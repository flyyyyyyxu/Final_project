Moving abroad, no matter which country, is no small accomplishment. When facing a language barrier, a culture much different from your own, and the daunting task of making friends in the new country you’ve chosen to call home, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed.
But, even with the headaches of finding work, a flat, a residence permit, etc., the thrill of trusting yourself and living in another country far outweighs the unease in it all. When I moved from the U.S. to Berlin, I found that the unique experiences and lifestyle here made up for any bureaucratic hurdles I encountered.

If you’re considering moving abroad from the U.S. to Berlin, here are some of the most surprising and fun facts based on my personal experiences that come with living in this hedonistic and international city.
If your German language skills are not quite up to par, you’ll have no trouble getting by in Berlin. While you should definitely try to communicate in German, in most cases, Berliners switch to English pretty fast when they can tell you’re not a native speaker.
The only downside is that it’s too easy to live here for years without achieving an intermediate German language level. Whereas if you moved to Nuremberg, Dresden, Hamburg, or most other cities in the country, you need to learn the language. So, while it’s easy to avoid the hassle of learning a new language , do you really want to tell your family and friends that you lived in Germany but still can’t speak German? You have the opportunity for an immersive language learning experience — why not take it?
One of the main reasons expats are unhappy after moving to a new country is not being able to make friends. This was definitely something I was worried about before I took the plunge. But I found that it’s pretty easy to meet like-minded individuals who are just as happy to make connections as you are. It’s just a matter of reaching out and getting used to talking with strangers. Sometimes, those strangers become your friends.
Here are some ways I made friends when I first moved to Berlin:
Traveling around Europe has always been a dream of mine. One thing I’ll always love about living in Berlin is the proximity to almost every country in Europe. The Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark, and France are closest.
You can travel to many cities on a two-hour flight, including Amsterdam, Barcelona, London, Oslo, Rome, and more. When you book early enough, you can usually find a round-trip flight for less than 100 EUR.
If you want to avoid flights to cut back on carbon emissions, trains will get you nearly everywhere too. You can even take a bus from Berlin to Prague for around 40 EUR and be there in four hours. It just doesn’t get better than that.
When you live in Berlin, you can say goodbye to long commutes in your car, aggressive drivers, and getting lost on the road. In Berlin, you don’t need to drive. Public transportation is so easy, affordable, and can get you anywhere. Plus it’s rarely late.
If you need a ride that’ll carry you faster than your legs, you can rent a bike or a scooter and get to wherever you’re going in no time. When you have your own bike, you can cycle to almost any district within a reasonable amount of time. It’s common for roads and sidewalks to have bike paths, and there are plenty of work-around routes for the busier areas that don’t.
An easy reason to fall in love with Berlin: you cannot beat the music, art, and culture here. From world-class museums to historical monuments with significant global meaning, you don’t have to search for long to find a taste of culture.
Here are some of my favorite cultural events:
Walking around in public with a beer, wine, or cup in hand is normal in Berlin. It feels so surreal and weird in the beginning, but, in most of Berlin, it’s totally legal. As long as you’re being safe and not causing problems, you can pretty much drink wherever you want.
Spätis go hand-in-hand with drinking in public. Spätis (short for Spätverkaufsstelle) are kiosks on almost every corner that are open at all hours, even during holidays. Like a bodega in NYC, they’re stocked with beer, wine, snacks, and cigarettes. While on your way to a bar or friend’s place, you might stop at one to pick up a beer for the road.
Sitting at a table outside one for a quick drink before heading out, or just to have a cheap drink with friends, is fun too. These areas can get crowded in the summer, but it’s a good place to meet interesting people, or at least have interesting conversations, even if you’re alone.
By far one of my favorite things about Berlin is the freedom of expression. There’s something for everyone, and you don’t have to travel far to find it.
It’s so much less judgmental than other places I’ve lived. You’re accepted no matter how you look, dress, date, think, or act. If you give someone a hard time for expressing themselves freely — you’ll likely be the one who gets told off.
Whether you’re into weekend-long ragers at the club, fetish play, table tennis, salsa dancing, or social activism — you’ll be in good company. The theme here is: You do as you do, I’ll do me, and we can all be friends.
No matter what country you move from, you can expect to hear the question:
So, why did you move here?
It’s an easy conversation starter, but most of the time, I think people genuinely just want to know and learn about you.
When I share that I moved to Berlin from Florida, the response is often surprise — especially in the winter. People seem confused about why someone would move from the “sunshine state” to a place that’s cold and gray for nearly six months out of the year.
My reply’s always the same: I’ve always wanted to live in Europe and love Berlin. You can’t beat the culture and nightlife. It’s full of history and fascinating people from around the world. Most of Europe is just a two-hour flight away. What’s not to love?
Berlin’s club scene is second to none. After the Berlin Wall fell, techno clubs became a place for freedom and expression. Clubs are open Thursday night till Monday morning. The party does not stop.
When it comes to club fashion, understand what type of club you’re going to. Sex clubs à la KitKat or Berghain? Think harnesses, mesh, leather, kink, fishnets , the more skin the better — and zero judgment. Open-air, techno clubs like Sisyphos or Renate? More colorful, fun, and chill garb works — just keep it sexy.
One thing that they all have in common is you’ll have an amazing time no matter which club you choose. You may have to queue in line for a couple of hours at some venues, but that just makes it even better once you’re in.
Berlin’s club culture means letting loose, letting your hair down, and letting go of inhibitions. You never know what fun may come.
Open relationships, polyamory, friends with benefits, and free love are big here. There’s an overall comfort with sexuality, and nudity’s not taboo. When you go to the sauna or swim at the lake, for example, you go au naturel. It’s not sexualized at all — just the natural human body. If you meet someone you matched with online, don’t be surprised if they have glitter all over because they spent the night before at a sex party. And if you’re not into that, then just be upfront with any potential dates or hookups before you meet them. Honesty + open communication are always the key.
The LGBTQ community is nothing short of amazing in Berlin. There’s acceptance for everyone. It’s intrinsic to Berlin’s culture. This might be one of the best cities in the world to explore your sexuality.
No one’s going to question what bathroom you feel most comfortable using. No one will bat an eye at two guys, two girls, or a full-on group making out. One of my friends said it best when talking about acceptance and embracement for the LGBTQ community, saying:
It’s everywhere. It’s not limited to one street, club, or neighborhood.
I think this is such a beautiful thing that shouldn’t be a rarity. While you can find this acceptance and love in many U.S. cities like Orlando, San Francisco, and NYC, it’s on the opposite end of the spectrum in others. In Berlin, there’s full acceptance for anyone and everyone. Love is love.
I never used dating apps back home in the States. Even when I’d go on vacation, I just didn’t do it. Maybe because it seemed unappealing after all the eHarmony ads I’ve seen over the years. But in Europe, especially Berlin, dating apps are the norm. Whether it’s Tinder, OkCupid, Hinge, Bumble, or even Instagram, I found them more fun, with less pressure, and more variety.
Don’t get me wrong — not every date is going to be spectacular. I’ve had my fair share of nightmarish dates that couldn’t end sooner, I’ve been ghosted, and dealt with creepers who couldn’t take a hint. But I’ve also had some fun experiences and discovered parts of the city I’d never find alone by using these apps.
Although, if you’re looking for anything more significant, I wouldn’t suggest relying soley on dating apps. When I met my boyfriend, we met through friends and going out IRL. While I know some success stories with couples who met on Tinder, it’s just not as likely.
Berlin is filled with idealistic parks and green spaces perfect for picnics, BBQs, people-watching, sunbathing, or having drinks with your friends. There are parks reminiscent of classic French gardens, like Kornerpark, waterfalls at Viktoriapark, some with Biergartens, concerts, or secret late-night raves.
I live near Tempelhofer Feld, an abandoned airport, where people all over Berlin come to roller skate, skateboard, walk their dogs, fly kites, and more. There’s even a community garden where you can sit amongst the flowers in the spring and summer. During the winter, you can find stands selling hot gluhwein (mulled wine) to keep you toasty.
The thing I love about Berlin’s parks and green spaces is not just how many there are, but how people enjoy them. People rarely go to the park and spend a day there in any of the places I’ve lived in the States. It’s part of the lifestyle here, being out and about in your community, and it’s one of my favorite things.
Summer in Berlin means lake days, “yachting” along the canals (aka cruising in a motorized raft), Biergartens, and open-air concerts.
Canals run all through Neukölln, Kreuzberg, and Friedrichshain. You can even rent a boat with a jacuzzi in the middle, which is perfect for the cooler months. On the Spree, there are plenty of boats serving as comedy show venues, bars, and restaurants that are a lot of fun.
If you’re willing to travel a bit longer, you can check out the lakes in the west too. You’ll have to pay an entrance fee to some of the most popular ones, like Wannsee, but as long as you get there early enough to find a spot, the fee’s worth it. Hanging outside and on the water is one of the best ways to keep cool during the scorching summer months in Berlin.
While America is a huge pioneer with the vintage scene, thrifting at second-hand and vintage shops are indeed picking up steam in Berlin. The quality and variety in shops here are wide-ranging, and full of treasures if you look to find them.
I love how mainstream it is to shop at second-hand shops in Berlin. It’s almost cooler to do so, rather than buying brand new. As a freelancer on a budget, I often go to a second-hand shop about once a month and always find something cute, unexpected, or functional.
My favorite is HUMANA SecondHand & Vintage, which has multiple locations throughout Berlin. I’ve bought winter coats, leather gloves, vintage skirts, and flowy scarves that are good as new here for a fraction of the cost.
Here are some other second-hand shops in Berlin:
It’s easy to say that all-black is Berlin’s style. Yes, that’s true — but not always. I’ve noticed a lot more colorful outfits recently, especially looks that reflect the ’90s and neons of the ’80s.
Closet staples everyone rocks in Berlin include combat boots, white trainers, leather anything, trench jackets, beanies/berets, and boyfriend jeans.
The main thing I love is the minimalistic style: no make-up, no heels, baggy clothes, natural hair — simple. You’re not dressing or styling like you would in most other European cities, like Rome, London, or Barcelona. Berlin has its own style where it’s almost more trendy to rock dad clothes over a suit and tie. When it comes to everyday streetwear, it’s casual. You’re not dressed to impress — just rocking whatever you have on with confidence. The main element here is attitude.
Before moving here, I’d never heard anyone talk about the food in Berlin. But do not be fooled. Berlin boasts some of the best street cuisine you can find, like falafel, döner kebabs, and, of course, currywurst — an original Berlin dish made of steamed or fried sausage with curry ketchup + fries. You can also find excellent authentic German/Austrian, Vietnamese, Thai, Turkish, and Italian cuisines no matter what part of town you’re in. If you want something healthier, you don’t have to look far to find vegan, vegetarian, and organic fare that don’t skimp on flavor.
As far as bars go, there’s no shortage of variety. Whether you want a divey pub to play darts and pool (a kneipe, in German), a themed cocktail bar, a craft beer bar with shuffleboard, or a rooftop bar to catch the sunset, you can find something unique no matter which district you go.
There are many reasons why it’s easy to live a healthy and active lifestyle in Berlin. On one hand, walking, bicycling, and taking public transportation makes getting in your steps-for-the-day easy. But also, nobody has microwaves. Instant meals are almost non-existent. You just use a kettle or stove to cook lunch or dinner — and it’s usually much healthier.
Did I miss having a microwave when I first moved here? Sure, yeah, a bit. But now, I don’t see a need for it.
I find that buying fresh produce is also much more affordable than it is in the U.S. You can easily find a produce market on the weekend, and, even at the store, the prices are reasonable. Eating healthy always felt like such an investment and expensive lifestyle choice before. But here, it’s affordable.
It is very rare for anyone to own a gun in Germany. Sure, there’s violence from time to time — it’s a big city with a population of almost 4 million after all. But I’ve never felt safer than I do here. I live in Neukölln, a district known for its Turkish markets, hipster cafes, and lively bar and club scene. I’ve walked home a million times at night, on both well-lit sidewalks and dimly lit side streets. I’ve never had a problem or felt unsafe.
Sure, you have to be alert and have some wherewithal to know what’s going on around you while walking late at night. But one thing’s for sure, there are no mass shootings every month, and that makes me feel safer at the end of the day.
Recycling and living an eco-friendly lifestyle are ingrained in German culture. Separating your garbage and recyclables is expected, but it pays to do so through the Pfand system.
Whenever you buy certain plastic, aluminum, or glass products, you pay a Pfand deposit. When you’re done with them, you can get that deposit back by returning your empty bottles in a Pfand machine.
Just take all your plastic and aluminum bottles and cans to the local grocery store (like Aldi or Rewe), and get back .25 EUR for each bottle you recycle. It’s an easy way to save on groceries and save the planet. This has helped me out when money’s tight on many occasions.
You can Pfand beer bottles as well for .08 EUR each. So, when you’re out and about, it’s customary to leave your empty beer bottle outside under an orange trash bin. Homeless people walk around the city collecting them and will Pfand them all at once later, allowing them to get money for food. This Pfand system makes recycling both easy and rewarding, while also helping others in the community.
Berlin’s not for everyone. It’s unlike any other part of Germany and may seem a bit rough in comparison. But for me, it’s everything I was looking for — history, travel, culture, international communities, life balance, and open-mindedness.
Moving abroad was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. And what I’ve learned is to say yes to nearly everything when you first move — social meet-ups, park parties, solo adventures, get-togethers with colleagues, work experiences that scare you, whatever. Each experience opens doors and leads you to friends and moments better than you imagined.
If these surprising facts about moving to Berlin sound ideal for you too, then plan a visit and discover all these things + more for yourself!

After waiting for two hours alone in the baggage claim area for Kathleen’s separate flight to arrive, Tine, Kathleen’s sister, and her male companion picked us up at the old Tegel Airport in Berlin.
It was a long drive back to their parents’ house. As soon as we got there, we tossed our luggage to the side — neatly, of course, as Germans are fastidious creatures — and plopped ourselves onto a freshly made German bed for a much-needed nap.
Afterward, my then-girlfriend/now-wife and I ate a cold dinner of bread and cold cuts and then watched Clint Eastwood’s movie Mystic River on DVD, or as Bostonians would say, “Mistick Rivah.”
The next morning, Tine cooked us breakfast, and since the jet lag had me convinced I’d gone back in time to my Aunt Dolly’s house, save for the brightly-colored German walls, I sat at the kitchen table bouncing my leg nervously.
“Let’s eat outside on the patio,” Tine thankfully said, in German. Thank God, I thought. Fresh air for my nerves.

I’ve wanted to take a trip to Berlin for a while now. This December for 5 days I finally got around to it.
Day 0:
We set off bright and early on Tuesday morning and landed in Berlin around lunchtime. We immediately went to grab food, being told that McDonald’s in Germany was the best in the world, we headed there. This was a huge letdown. It's expensive and just as bad as the UK! I opted for a satay peanut curry instead.
Before we could check into our hotel, we had a wander around the city looking at the East Berlin TV Tower and a few Christmas markets. With a quick pit stop in the hotel, we ventured out to see some Christmas markets. These offered similar things to the UK, good Christmas vibes, food and drinks and attractions like ice skating.
Day 1:
The next we headed out sightseeing, we first decided to visit checkpoint Charlie, one of the checkpoints between the east and west sides of Berlin. We were able to see part of the Berlin wall and a couple of recreations of the signs on the border. We then headed to Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag. The Reichstag was an interesting building with the glass dome addition after WW2. This was to signify that the current way of German politics is transparent and democratized rather than secret and authoritarian as before.
We then headed to a guided walking tour detailing Germany under the Nazis. This was incredibly interesting, the tour mainly focused on the treatment of the Jews by the nazis and ended with a visit to the Holocaust monument. This was very moving and purposely not explained by the artist to allow others to interpret it. As one walks through the monument, the stones get deeper halfway through and begin to become shallow again. I interpreted this as signifying how the Nazi policies towards Jews and their subsequent life became worse and worse, but ultimately they made it through.
We grabbed pizza for dinner! Shout out to Simela for their amazing gluten-free pizzas!
Day 2:
We started the next day with another walking tour. This time it focused on the history of East Germany under the GDR. As someone who studied this period extensively in school, it was fascinating to see the effects of this in person. Our tour guide was great! Very enthusiastic and keen to answer any questions we had. One highlight of the tour was Karl Marx ally. A showpiece at the time of the ‘success’ of communism to the Western world. The communist architecture was captivating particularly due to how different it is from western architecture.
Learning about life under the GDR made me appreciate the free will we are currently afforded. Under the GDR, workers had no choice in their profession, sometimes could not go to university and were constantly surveilled in their everyday lives. The system we have now is not perfect, far from it but it allows so much more de facto freedom than what the GDR has. It made me more hungry to pursue my dreams, knowing that others who came before simply could not.
The tour ended at the East Side Gallery, the most famous current section of the wall. The artwork here was incredible, painted during the fall of the wall. It showed the emotions of the people at the time. Rather eye-opening was the artwork supporting a socialist-style movement. They were upset with the current way of living, but still respected and supported a fairer democratic version of socialism.
We ended the day with a trip to the Stasi Museum. Again this was an intriguing exhibition, that details how the East German people were constantly monitored and spied on, even by their own friends/family.
Day 3:
Day 3 took us away from the history a bit. Inspired by the Berlin wall art, we went on an art-hunting trip. We first stopped off at David Bowie’s former apartment. A bit underwhelming, considering it is now an osteopath clinic!
We next visited an art museum called Urban Nation, spotting some street art on the way. The art here was cool, investigating issues such as masculinity in society, body dysmorphia and AI. I find it interesting how I used to hate art museums as a teenager. Now I love them, and as I have become more confident in myself, I can become more open to art and the emotions it evokes.
We followed this up by visiting a car museum which even had an old BMW Sauber driven by Sebastian Vettel!
We ended the day with a trip to Berlin Tempelhof Airport. This airport was used in the Berlin airlift and is now a park. What is cool is that they have kept the runways, which means you can walk the 2km distance (which of course we did)!
Day 4:
Sad to leave Berlin, but also excited to sleep in my bed, we headed out in the morning to visit a few sites before catching our flight. We started with a trip to the 1936 Olympic Stadium. Unfortunately, we could not go in due to a football game taking place and there is not much to do around it.
We continued and took a trip to the Kino International GDR cinema. This is an aesthetically pleasing building and still hand paints the cinema posters to this day!
Conclusions
This trip was a long time coming and to be honest, I wasn’t thrilled with Berlin when I first arrived but this quickly changed. I fell in love with the city, its deep history, art, architecture and international vibe. It reminded me of why I travel in the first place. To open up my mind, learn from history and become more open and learn from other cultures. It was really good to finally place the history I learnt in school in the country. Seeing the history reflected in the buildings and monuments made it and the impacts of it so much more real.

I sent this to the Abroad section of the Irish Times in a moment of madness, using green ink. The Abroad section features reports from people living overseas, sharing their experiences of life in their current locations.
Dear Editor of the abroad section Irish times.
I first arrived in Berlin in July 2005, stepping into a city that still felt like a playground for the adventurous — so different from the set routines of drinking in Dublin. Within days of my arrival, I met Derek Scally, your Berlin Correspondent. (that was a long time ago.) It felt like anything was possible. Back then, jobs weren’t always easy to come by. At times, I got the impression the whole city was unemployed. But finding a place to live was another story — gorgeous, spacious apartments at prices that now seem laughably cheap. In April 2022, I landed a job inside the Bundestag.
Fast forward to today, and Berlin has become a very different place. The struggle now isn’t just finding work — it’s affording to live here once you do. Rents have skyrocketed, apartments have shrunk, and the city’s creative, chaotic energy is being slowly pushed outwards. Where once you could find a big Altbau flat in Kreuzberg or Neukölln for next to nothing, now you’re lucky to get a shoebox on the outskirts for a small fortune. The party, as they say, is well and truly over.
After nearly two decades here, I’ve decided to leave Germany. The high cost of living, the difficulty of saving money even with a good wage, and the fact that Germany has not kept pace with the modern world have all played a role in my decision. Bureaucracy hasn’t improved, wages often don’t stretch far enough, and while it’s still possible to find work, it’s nearly impossible to build financial security. The amount of money you have to pay for health insurance is obscene. It is like a second mortgage ! The more you earn the more you pay — and by the doctors — the level of misdiagnosis is disturbing! You pay a fortune every month to be told to go home drink health teas and be given ibuprofen .
A former chancellor as late as 2013 — once described the internet as “new land” for Germany, and to this day, that mindset lingers. Other countries have moved forward fast — here, it is trying to stay the same as it never was! It often feels like things stand still. The obsession the politicians — I worked with had to be with the fax machine — (2023) is the like blue M+M test. the tip of the ice berg of what was wrong with the whole country. The just can’t stop using it even though they is no where I can go a buy a new one. As the population ages as the birth rate tanks and the political party’s get ever more conservative and anti-immigrant. It is evident that the party is even more over for Berlin but also Germany and the Germans! It’s going to be the working young left to pay the piper for the social system.
That creeping sense that the state finds endless ways to reach into your pocket, all while delivering less and less that feels useful or fair in return. Germany in particular can feel like a masterclass in bureaucratic overreach. There is a dog tax. There is a TV license fee, that is absurd — you pay for your own propaganda, even if you don’t own a TV. Exactly — it’s wild when you stop and really look at it. The idea that you’re legally forced to pay a TV license — it open an in biases - even if you never watch it — just so the state can funnel that money into broadcasters. All station heads who are politically appointed and often just push one narrow worldview. And they call that “public service.”
It’s like you’re funding your own manipulation. And it’s not even subtle. There’s barely a pretence of balance — especially in Germany, where everything goes through a Hagenburg-style vetting, where gatekeepers in politics and media coordinate what is acceptable and what isn’t. And if your view doesn’t align with the mainstream centrist-liberal consensus — forget it. You’re either ignored, mocked, or outright silenced.
Even satire, which should be punching up, calling out power, and exposing hypocrisy, has become tame, toothless, and often just another way to reinforce the dominant line. There is no splitting image in germany
You get state-funded comedy shows that pretend to be edgy while never daring to touch certain taboos or challenge real power. Various sacred cows go untouched - like rent is un-taxed. Eventually Section 15 all of the massive apartment owning renting companies. Running a monopoly.
That’s exactly it — political scandals don’t even feel like scandals anymore. The bar for outrage has sunk so low that someone like you or me might get fined or fired over a data protection slip, but an actual Bundestag member — an elderly CDU rep, no less — can go around commenting on OnlyFans using his official government email address, and it barely makes a ripple.
75-Year-Old German Politician Bernd Vogel Politician(CDU )withdrew his candidacy in German federal elections after it was found that he was replying to the posts of Onlyfans models on twitter.
His party Bündnis Deutschland released a statement condemning Mr. Vogel’s behaviour, to which he replied “I apologise for the stupid posts. I am withdrawing my candidacy from the state list and will not be running as a direct candidate in any constituency. Sorry!”
This guy Bernd Vogel (CDU) I could have been one of my clients, I would have walked by him in the corridors of power a not batted a eye lid
No consequences. A few headlines but nothing beyond a local paper. No resignation. Just… tumbleweeds.
And the worst part? It shows you how detached and out of touch these people are — not just with the internet, but with reality. This guy doesn’t even know how a burner account works, yet he’s voting on laws about cybersecurity, digital privacy, AI, media regulation. It’s laughable, if it weren’t so bloody serious.
It’s the same pattern: power protects itself. Scandals only matter when the media decides they matter, and that usually means only if it fits a narrative they’re pushing. The rest? Buried. Forgotten. Treated like a “quirky mishap.”
Germany has this veneer of order and rules, but peel back a bit and it’s all just managed decay. Political lifers doing whatever they want, while the rest of us fill out seventeen forms in triplicate just to rent a flat.
What do you think that CDU guy was even commenting on? Can you imagine the tone? “Herzlichen Glückwunsch, sehr ästhetisch…”
It’s no wonder people feel politically homeless. And culturally gaslit. You’re told it’s democracy and freedom of the press — but it looks a hell of a lot like curated conformity. No wonder people vote for the AFD they have no other option.
Even something as innocuous as enjoying a cup of imported roast coffee still has had its own tax bureaucracy — famously inefficient and absurd that cost more to run then it ever collected in tax. cite.
thinking of one of Germany’s classic bureaucratic own-goals: the Kaffeesteuer, or coffee tax.
This has been a running joke in political and economic circles for decades. Basically, Germany imposed a tax on imported roasted coffee (as far back as the Imperial era, but still running in modern times), and it got so bloated with bureaucracy — layers of administration, auditing, tracking small shipments — that by the early 2000s, it cost more to administer the tax than it actually collected.
Some reports claimed that collecting €1 of coffee tax ended up costing more than €1 in government resources. Utter madness.
But the real kicker? They didn’t scrap it. Not for ages. Because once a bureaucracy is in place, it becomes self-sustaining. Jobs are tied to it. Departments justify their existence with it. So even when it’s financially irrational, it trudges on like a zombie.
And coffee wasn’t alone — Germany’s had other “negative yield” taxes over the years. For example:
It’s like a case study in how to not run a modern economy of an advanced industrial society — or at least, how to run one where the citizen always pays for the system’s incompetence.
The part that really gets people is not just the number of taxes, but the spirit of them: petty, invasive, sometimes costing more to run than they bring in. And they dress it up with fancy language — solidarity tax, environment fees, administrative charges — but it all ends up feeling like an elaborate pyramid scheme, where the top layers (the politicians, the institutions) are protected, and everyone below is just coughing up endlessly.
I am not alone in feeling like it’s an endless downward spiral, where waking up early, working hard, and playing by the rules just means they find more ways to tap you for it.
Berlin will always hold a special place in my heart, but it’s time to look elsewhere for a better quality of life. The question is — where do we all go next?
Best regards,
Jerry Morgan

I’ve been planning to visit Berlin for too long. Then, spontaneously, over coffee, the three of us decided to go to The National concert in Berlin. It was simply like, “Should we? Let’s go.” The rest is history.
There’s truly a lot to see in Berlin, but I’ll highlight my top five favorite spots in case any of you decide to visit Berlin or return to it.
For the purpose of potential logistical planning, I note that my visit was in June 2022. It was much colder than I expected, so I still laugh at how I wore socks with sandals on this trip. No offense to those of you who typically wear them that way.
Before delving into writing about the places where I felt comfortable, I want to mention that history has never felt so vivid before my eyes; occasionally, chills ran down my spine precisely because of that. However, in Berlin, a special world blossomed with the beautiful nurturing of underground culture.
The longer days and beautiful sunsets these days have reminded me of the enjoyments at this old airport in Berlin.
Tempelhof was completed in 1941. The airport’s terminal building, designed by Ernst Sagebiel, is considered an architectural landmark. With a central hall spanning over 300 meters, it was intended to showcase the grandeur of the Third Reich. During the Berlin airlift in WWII (1948–1949), the airport served as a crucial hub for delivering supplies to West Berlin, which was cut off from the rest of West Germany by the Soviet blockade. The airlift became a symbol of Western determination and solidarity during the early years of the Cold War.
Since 2008, what was formerly one of the world’s busiest airports has been converted into a public park, bringing joy to people worldwide and contributing to prevailing peace. A popular recreational area covering over 300 hectares, it is a place where locals and tourists alike come to enjoy various outdoor activities. As an outdoor activities lover, I was fascinated by the bustling life this vast open space offers.
There was something for everyone there — from music lovers, drummers, and guitarists, to those who prefer more peace, bird enthusiasts who can only observe birds from a distance, further to cyclists, rollerbladers, skateboarders, plenty of people lying on the grass, picnicking, reading books, playing cards, jogging, kite-flying, and finally, those who came for the Florence and the Machine concert. I remember riding a bike along the expanse, with the sun setting, a gentle breeze tousling my hair. I heard music and remarked how good the cover of Florence and the Machine was. And then… it was actually Florence and the Machine. I couldn’t believe it.
The subjective feeling is that this is a city within a city. I don’t like large crowds, so I particularly appreciated the fact that a large number of visitors are nicely spread out in this area. Although around ten thousand people visit it daily, it never really looks crowded.
In addition to the already mentioned rich offerings, it’s worth mentioning the community gardens and several mini-golf courses.
I am incredibly glad that something with roots in darker impulses now serves as a place for relaxation, showcasing what Berlin truly has to offer: a vibrant and libertine life.
Okay, you’ve got me. I love parks. This one, spanning approximately 88 hectares, is another fantastic spot for a picnic, enjoying great beer, cycling (the two should be combined carefully — or not), playing board or card games, or simply taking in the expansive lawns, tree-lined paths, and recreational facilities alongside the Spree River.
If you’re up for another history lesson, a visit to the Soviet War Memorial is a must. The complex features a central statue depicting a Soviet soldier holding a rescued child while crushing a swastika underfoot. It’s a solemn place to reflect on and honor the victory over fascism and the sacrifices made to achieve it.
Our day unfolded like this: a multi-kilometer bike ride, a visit to the memorial, and chilling with beer by the river while playing the card game Exploding Kittens. Luckily, I’m a fan of dark humor, especially considering that a cat was waiting for me at home.
In this lush greenery, away from the bustling city life, people can be seen dancing, sunbathing, fishing, strolling, cycling, barbecuing, performing open-air activities, playing sports, and birdwatching.
If you continue walking, you might stumble upon one of the largest astronomical observatories, the Archenhold Observatory. Renowned for its Great Refractor, the longest refracting telescope in the world, it symbolizes the city’s scientific legacy and dedication to astronomy.
Kreuzberg is my favorite neighborhood in Berlin. You immediately notice the vibrant, multicultural atmosphere and the thriving international community in this district. Recognized as a hub for artists, musicians, and activists, this urban neighborhood has a reputation for its alternative and countercultural scene.
I fondly recall sitting on Admiralbrücke, a bridge spanning the Landwehr Canal, soaking in the eclectic and bohemian character evident in the various artistic performances. The place hosts many events and festivals throughout the year.
Given its historical importance, you can’t miss this district. Nearby landmarks include the Berlin Wall and Checkpoint Charlie.
And if you’re not as interested in history and arts, I must draw your attention to the culinary paradise found within the streets of Kreuzberg. Bustling cafes, charming restaurants, bars, and numerous pubs represent a unique gastronomic scene. There’s one bar I particularly liked.— Bohnengold. And if you’re fan of falafels, I strongly recommend this place.
Parks aren’t boring, I assure you, especially not when you’re up for a running session while dealing with a hangover. They say Tiergarten is to Berlin what Central Park is to New York. My visit to this spot, originally a hunting ground for Prussian royalty, wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows. However, at least someone was running through the tree-lined paths and alongside the numerous ponds and waterways.
The park area of approximately 210 hectares is ideal for unwinding after visiting the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag building. It’s a perfect spot to enjoy some poetry near the Goethe Monument. While I may not be Heinrich Faust, I was almost willing to make a pact with Mephistopheles in exchange for the soul I lost while running with a hangover.
But, much like Faust, driven by the eternal human desire for knowledge and transcendence, I explored various monuments, statues, and memorials such as the Bismarck Memorial, the Lessing Monument, the Victory Column (Siegessäule), and the grand exterior of Bellevue Palace.
Similar to Treptower Park, Tiergarten is also brimming with life and diversity. With a wide variety of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other small mammals, Tiergarten stands as one of the most cherished peaceful oases in the heart of Berlin.
While I’m not particularly fond of zoos, it’s worth noting that the park is also home to the Berlin Zoo, one of the oldest and most renowned zoos in Germany, founded in 1844.
This post could have been titled “My Top 5 Parks in Berlin,” and I plead guilty as charged. Speaking of charges, this is indeed a place to recharge your batteries. Without a doubt, the best day to visit the spot is Sunday.
After indulging in the charms of the flea market and the allure of the past, you can choose to either attend the open-air karaoke in the Bear Pit, relax and gaze at the azure of the Berlin sky, or stroll alongside the rich street art scene, with colorful murals and graffiti adorning many of the park’s walls and surfaces.
I was tempted to fill my luggage with antiquities, but reality dictated that I settle for a vintage record for my apartment and a couple of tiny souvenirs.
As I reflect on my visit to Berlin, I recall moments when I was on the verge of tears (and it’s not because of The National). The city constantly reminded me of the power to rise from the ashes, to reinvent, to be reborn even more beautiful.
As I bid farewell to this dynamic city, I carry with me memories of its amazing urban culture and the fantastic blend of bustling energy and tranquility. Trust me, it was not easy at all to list its treasures, and I can only imagine the hidden ones I couldn’t uncover during my six-day visit.
Until next time, auf Wiedersehen, Berlin!

The style here’s understated, edgy, and chic.
When I moved from Florida to Berlin, I made my fair share of fashion blunders and felt like a true Ausländer (or foreigner). To make this new city feel like mine, I watched and learned quickly what makes up Berlin’s shabby-chic style.
In 2003, Berlin’s former mayor, Klaus Wowerit, coined the phrase, “poor but sexy,” describing Germany’s capital city. Nowadays, while Berlin’s booming tech scene has led to a thriving, less poor city, it’s still and always will be, sexy.
Here are some of the fashion-staples I wish I’d known about before packing and moving from the US to Berlin.
It’s easy to say that everyone in Berlin wears black. But don’t be fooled — there’s much more to the Berliner look. While walking the streets of any part of Berlin, you’ll see various styles and colors depending on what borough you’re in.
Wearing black is indeed sharp, sexy, and mysterious. You can’t even get into certain clubs (e.g., Berghain) dressed in anything but black (or pleather, latex, sheer, etc.).
But the style still rings true. Especially in the fall and winter, you can’t go wrong with wearing black. Try taking a walk around Mitte or Kreuzberg. It won’t take long before finding someone who represents the epitome of Berlin style — likely dressed head-to-toe in black, boots, small-lense sunnies, perhaps a beret or cap, with a cigarette in hand.
After a year and a half, I’ve found that the keys to look for are black or neutral-colored pieces that you can wear with different outfits and easily layer.
When I first moved here, my wardrobe was extremely lacking in wintertime styles fit for Berlin. I soon discovered the outlets, thrift stores, and flea markets and changed that ASAP.
Dark shades are always in style here, but so are exaggerated looks of the exact opposite hues and patterns.
Bright outfits, mismatched patterns, ‘Dad’ clothes, plaid pieces, and fun pops of color in accessories are a whole thing here.. It’s like ironic stuff that’s not worn ironically.
During the summer, the whole “Berliners wear black” attitude goes out the window. I recently saw someone wearing a head-to-toe, magenta windbreaker — and he was rockin’ it.
All in all, as long as it’s not boring, that’s Berlin’s style.
Vintage styles ranging from the 70s to Y2K are back in a big way. In my experience, I’ve seen a lot of jumpsuits and activewear in neon pinks, greens, and purples that represent the 80s.
You also find 70s looks with wide bell-bottom jeans, shag jackets, and jewelry.
Y2K looks are fashionable with wide-leg jeans, belly shirts, bucket hats, sports sunnies, and chokers.
Go to any second-hand store in Berlin and find wide-ranging vintage styles and relics. I was at my local HUMANA recently, considering 80s-90s sportswear in all its neon glory. I didn’t find a style I liked in the end, so I’m still hunting for an outlandishly 80s just-going-for-a-run look.
Standing out is better than fitting in, right? When it comes to vintage, you can’t go wrong in Berlin.
During my first weekend after moving to Berlin, I remember hearing myself clip-clopping down the sidewalks of Friedrichstein wearing my high-heeled booties. You could have heard me a mile away.
The sound of high heels is sexy in the US and other countries. But not in Berlin. You walk around the crowded or quiet streets with that clip-clopping sound — you quickly notice you’re the only one. I still rock block heels, but they don’t make a sound.
In Berlin, you absolutely need a good pair of boots. The cobblestones on many roads can be deathtraps for anyone in heels.
Find a used or new pair of Doc Martens or something similar. You’ll need them in the wintertime. I bought a fresh pair of Docs my first month after moving here. That was a big first-moment of feeling like a true Berliner (at least style-wise). ;)
White sneakers, specifically Reeboks or Adidas, are another fashion staple. Combine those with a fresh pair of white socks, and you’re rocking Berlin’s style.
When traveling on the U-bahn, I always look at everyone’s shoes. In my experience, white trainers and boots are the most popular.
If you remember nothing else after reading this besides one point, remember: Get a proper coat.
A long one that reaches your knees so you stay warm when the wind picks up is ideal. If you want to look “so Berlin,” look for a shiny, faux leather trench. Without a coat long and warm enough, you freeze your ass off (writing from experience). Berlin’s a windy city in the winter.
When I first moved here, I went with a new friend to an art exhibition at Halle am Berghain, called Berl-Berl. It was the first cold-ish night in Berlin for the fall season. Granted, I’d packed a beanie, but that was NOT enough. Walking out, the girls at the door asked me in shock, “WHERE IS YOUR JACKET??” My, “Oh, I have a beanie” explanation was returned with looks as though I’d grown a second head. So, layer up and keep warm.
When people ask me what Berlin style is, I jokingly say that the more homeless you look, the better. Baggy clothes with au naturel hair and makeup are the way to go here.
The norm is a fresh-face with a minimal no-makeup look. If you want some features to pop, go for bold brows, long lashes, or a red lip. Just keep it simple and try to stick with minimal striking features with your makeup.
If your hair’s not naturally thick or wavy, most women keep theirs straight or let it air-dry. For guys, a fresh mullet, fade, or shaggy, long-hair looks are very stylish in Berlin.
Personally, I find this natural look refreshing. I’ve become quite comfortable going out sans makeup with hair styled by the air. It feels good knowing that the focus is on you as an individual. Getting dressed up occasionally is fun, but I don’t feel the need to do it every day.
Accessories are key to Berlin fashion. This is partially attributed to the necessity of dealing with the windy, frigid temps with a cozy scarf and warm hat. But fashion still plays a part.
During my first winter, I couldn’t even tie a scarf properly. I just wrapped it around and around as much as I could. I soon figured out how to properly tie a scarf — something necessary for both practical and stylish purposes.
Berets, beanies, and those short beanies above your ears (fisherman beanies) are widely worn in the winter. Yes, berets are not only for Parisians. ;) The wind chill freezes you to the bone during the winter, and any hat makes all the difference in keeping warm (Side note: My boyfriend rocks those fisherman beanies, and although not a fan initially, they’ve started growing on me).
Lastly, sunglasses are one accessory to have on-hand no matter the weather. Like my previous point, wearing 90s-styled, colored-lensed shades are super trendy right now. But no matter the style, a good pair of sunnies are stylish in Berlin, whether the sky’s blue or gray.
The most important thing to remember about fashion in Berlin is to wear it with your head high. Wear it with confidence, and you’ve got the Berlin look down.

I was just rousing from a disco nap (a short sleep in the afternoon, in preparation for a night of partying) during my first night in Berlin when my phone buzzed with a text from a friend from back home in London.
My friend was in Berlin, too, and saw on Facebook that I was in town. He asked if I wanted to grab some dinner. My travel partner was fast asleep, so I gently got down from the top bunk in our shared dorm room and went to meet my friend for the best sushi I’ve ever eaten. I didn’t know it at the time, but this was the last time I’d ever see this friend, who tragically died a couple of years later.
It’s another reason Berlin holds such a precious place in my heart.
The first time I went to Berlin was with my good friend Liam. Back then, in my mid-20s, Liam and I were young and ignorant about the world. We attended plenty of music festivals and nights out to see our favourite bands, but we craved something new and different.

Now sit back and relax because it’s time to talk about more travel lessons from our first European Christmas! While not an official birthday trip, I have always wanted to experience Christmas in Europe, so as part of our post-pandemic family travel and to celebrate turning 40, we went to Europe with my brother and my parents for two weeks in December.
If you’ve read my entry about our trip with Sergio’s parents and sister to Paris and Rome, this blog is in a similar vein, with travel planning, tips, and reflections. Each trip is a little different, and the lessons are a little different as well — in this case, traveling in winter meant a little extra planning to stay warm and dry.
But let’s get into it! I can smell the mulled wine…
Sergio and I have long been shoulder-season people — a luxury to indulge in if you’re not a parent and thus married to a school holiday schedule — but we tend to split holidays between my family in Washington State and his family in Chihuahua, Mexico. Christmas tends to be family-centered because everyone is together and it’s easier to see everyone at once.
It’s not that I don’t like tradition — but Christmas is a special season, and I’ve wanted to experience it elsewhere (say, Hawai’i) for some time, but it just hadn’t panned out. Christmas in Europe, however, ended up being a (more immediate) family experience and it was fun to travel in the true off-season.
Depending on your family members, you might have a group of eager travel planning beavers or a low-key set of folks who are happy to travel to a variety of places. For my family, I’ve always found it useful to come with some ideas while putting their preferences in mind (eg; clean and quiet accommodations, easy to see sights, etc.). Europe is chock-full of Christmas markets, but Dresden was one that popped to the top of the list in my research, giving one point on the map and making it easier to choose the end-points on either side — Berlin, with which we had some familiarity, and Prague, which my brother knew. That helped us narrow down the list of possibilities and put together the main Prague-Dresden-Berlin itinerary.
I did a lot of the planning with some assumptions (many of the considerations about mobility, walking distances, etc. that I mentioned in my previous post), but I also had the good fortune to learn from our first family trip to Paris and Rome. The biggest difference between the two trips was that we saw virtually no American tourists in any of our cities in December. Really and truly, basically none save a few folks here and there. And maybe this was a pandemic hangover as well, but there weren’t a lot of tourists in general! There were only two sites that required tickets far in advance (more info later in the post) so it was a relief to be in a space that wasn’t nearly as crowded. It makes me curious what other European destinations would be great in the winter!
But back to the planning — I already wrote about creating a shared doc and a Google Map so anyone can participate. The most important thing I’ve learned? Taking a trip together doesn’t mean you have to do every activity together! It was something that I knew before, but to have a harmonious two weeks, it helps to have a lot of flexibility so that people can travel at their own pace as well as see those places that most interest them. Case-in-point: My dad had a minor foot injury that meant walking longer distances on back-to-back days was difficult, so that necessitated putting longer walking activities a day or two apart, or choosing activities that he wasn’t interested in during the afternoons when he was resting.
We chose hotels for our previous trip to Paris and Rome but decided on AirBnbs for this trip. Our options in these December cities were much, much better, and much more affordable, especially when we needed three bedrooms. It’s hard to find rental apartments with 4.98 stars, but we stayed in three of them and it was lovely. This put us in central neighborhoods with good public transit and access to sights, all super-important to reduce walking and increase accessibility. You probably have a preference for hotels or rentals, but I’d encourage you to look at both quickly because in some cities there’s a clear winner.
Now to packing — as much as I prefer to pack light, it’s a little bit more difficult when you’re traveling in December, and we knew we had to prepare for rain, snow, and wind. Another factor that tipped us towards apartments was that we were able to get two with laundry facilities, making it easier to pack fewer pairs of pants and shirts so that we could make room for snow boots (and souvenirs). The most important items were warm, waterproof shoes, wool socks, very warm jackets, warm gloves, hats, and a scarf. One positive about all of these destinations is that they’re not fancy cities (we’re not fancy people!) so a nice sweater or top with dark jeans was enough for any meal out. As a Seattle girl, I must tell you that your winter jacket is likely not warm enough (but if you’re from Minneapolis or Chicago, you’re probably prepared).
With everything packed it was just a manner of days before we boarded a plane in Seattle for our SEA-LHR-PRG journey! I tend to feel a little anxious before a big trip, but we had planned very well so sometimes you just have to let the butterflies flutter a bit and just do the damn thing.
So let’s start with our first stop, which was Prague! There’s something about Prague that makes it a perfect jet-lag city: The main attractions are in a rather compact area, there aren’t that many of them, and public transit links most of them togther. We chose a longer layover in LHR to allow for enough time to move throughout Terminal 5 with my parents (the right choice) so we landed in the Czech Republic in darkness, tried to stay awake in the cab for the ride to our apartment, and passed out as soon as heads hit pillows.
The castle complex was a perfect first-day activity — whether it was the tomb of Saint Wenceslaus (a duke, not a king as the song suggests) or the Old Royal Palace, we were greeted with beautiful views of the city and kept moving so as not to fall asleep. The views of the old city are beautiful, and depiste the cold there was a festive atmosphere.
For me, the highlight of the city was taking a Christmas Market walking tour with Jiří (George in English). He took us by tram to some local Christmas markets with a bunch of quirky stops along the way, including sparklers, writing wishes on dove-shaped papers in a cathedral, and drinking some sort of homemade Czech liquor. The introvert in me doesn’t gravitate towards these sorts of activities, but my biggest travel insight of 2023 was that these local experiences can really make a trip more memorable. Again, a huge benefit of traveling with different people is that you try activites that you otherwise might skip, and for some people those personal connections make the city come alive!
Prague isn’t a very heavy museum town — and I’m past the point of taking photos in most museums — but I can wholeheartedly recommend the Mucha Museum as well as the Museum of Communism. I could spend hours upon hours in a museum (see visiting four Smithsonians in two days in January), but smaller museums are more manageable and allow you to get a taste of something while balancing everyone’s interests.
Prague really was a short stop, but I felt like it was a city that was doable in a few days. We ended our last day with an incredible walk across the Charles Bridge with the castle shining on the hill above us. It was one wild train ride from Prague to our next stop — Dresden!
Dresden was the city I was most excited about for this trip, and it didn’t disappoint! Are you ready for the Christmas Market to end all Christmas markets? Well, we went to the main market in Dresden which was started in 1434 and it was it’s 589th year when we visited. It also has the world’s tallest Weihnachtspyramide (Christmas pyramid, fondly called “The Twirly” in our house)! But beyond this, Dresden is a friendly and walkable city with easy-to-navigate public transit, and wind aplenty.
So let’s talk a minute about how to get around as an American — or non-German speaker. As with most places in Europe these days, English fluency is as high as it has ever been, and this is especially true in Germany. Like our trip to France, I was the only person who had any German language skills to use, but there were only a few situations where English alone wouldn’t suffice. The trickiest items tend to be ticket machines or menus, but with Google Translate you’ll get there. As always, hello, thank you, and please are good to know wherever you go (that’s Guten Tag, danke, and bitte, if you are wondering).
Dresden was firebombed at the end of the Second World War by the British and the Americans, destroying its inner city and burning alive about 25,000 inhabitants. The city center was largely recontructed in a traditional style (compared to a city like Frankfurt that re-built itself as a modern city), but the beautiful Parade of Nobles (below) survived because they were fired at a higher temperature than the incendiary bombs. It is a procession of famous local nobles from the twelfth to the first years of the twentieth centuries.
Unfortunately not all of the landmarks were so lucky, and because Dresden was part of the Deutsche Demokratische Republik (East Germany, to Americans), many historical buildings remained ruins until German reunification in 1990. What was particularly inspiring was that the town’s citizens donated 92% of the funds needed to reconstruct the church in the style of the one that was destroyed.
Lastly, Dresden is also a museum city, but one that is still under construction. The Green Vault (no photos inside, sorry) was one of the two attractions this trip that needed an advanced reservation, and security was particularly tight because of a 2019 theft. But its jewelry, porcelain, and decorative collections were amazing — but, as in other museums, few benches are available, so consider your companions and give plenty of time for rest. The Zwinger complex (also under construction — it was a mud mess!) included one of the quirkier museums of the trip — a museum of math and physical instruments. How fantastic to see the evolution of the globe and microscope!
Before we go to Berlin, let’s take a short break to talk about one of my favorite parts of the trip — the food! I look forward to any trip to Germany to eat delicious bread and dumplings and any sort of meat I can imagine. But Berlin in particular is a fantastic food city — we had incredible vegan pastries, Persian food, a wide variety of pastries, and fantastic Thai food.
The food at the markets was just as good as I thought it would be. Since I’m currently not drinking to keep my autoimmune hepatitis in remission, I only partook in a few sips of Glühwein (literally “glow wine,” or mulled wine), but you can collect little mugs from each market to take home (or return it and get your Pfand — deposit — back). There was ample Wurst (sausage) and Knödel (dumplings), and a variety of sweet pastries, hot doughnuts, and desserts. Our last Christmas Market in Berlin had indoor tent seating — how lovely to sit on faux furs and eat dessert while the wind whips outside!
So the biggest oops! of this trip was renting the Mega Van in Dresden. If you know Sergio at all, you’ll know that he’s a fantastically-skilled driver, even when we visited England and he drove a mega-van on the opposite side of the car/road and parallel-parked in one go (might I say that I live my life very impressed at his skill in all things and sometimes very jealous because how can he do all this stuff so well?).
Barry and Sergio went to the airport in Dresden to pick up the Mega Van from Hertz — and as they left I felt really positive about it. I’m a big fan of train travel, but our ride from Prague to Dresden was pretty chaotic on the Prague side, and with larger bags and extra space, a car seemed like a great idea. We would have the car — with free street parking in Dresden and a garage space in Berlin — to enable some day trips and also make it easier to cart luggage. It felt like a great way to ensure more comfort and mobility for my parents too.
But.
… As soon as I saw the Mega Van I knew this wasn’t the right decision. First of all, Dresden was so easy to get around that we didn’t need the car. We did have a reserved garage space in Berlin, but after measuring the van dimensions and the garage dimensions there was no way it was going to fit. We agreed to eat the cost of it and return it so we wouldn’t have to move it around every eight hours on the street. But this albatross didn’t go easily! Navigating the van return to the nearby train station was the most stressful part of the whole trip — and when we got to the rental car return garage, I was literally outside of the Mega Van running alongside it to make sure that we didn’t burst a pipe or get stuck on the ceiling (it didn’t), but after that experience we agreed never again. Never. ever. again.
That being said, if we didn’t get the Mega Van, we wouldn’t have had our random drive from Dresden to Berlin with a stop at what we thought was a beautiful castle but was actually an exhibit on a very niche East German film called Three Hazelnuts for Cinderella — and if you think it’s weird, I can’t even start to convey how bizarre it is to be in an experience where everyone around you knows and loves a thing and it’s completely lost on you.
Well, at least the outside looked nice.
Did you know that this part of Germany is Luther country? It is — and Luther is a complicated guy (I‘d recommend Martin Luther, Renegade and Prophet to learn more about him) but despite the bitter cold Sergio and I decided to stick it out and take a train to Wittenberg (since the mega-van had been returned), so our first day in Berlin was actually spent in Wittenberg. Sergio and I started going to church just a few weeks earlier (worthy of another blog post, but not today) so it was also an opportunity for him to learn a bit more about Lutheranism, as he was raised Catholic.
Wittenberg was a perfect day trip! I imagine December had something to do with it, but we felt like we had the entire town to ourselves! The two main things to see in the town are the two churches — the Schlosskirche (Castle Church) and the Stadtkirche (Town Church) of Saint Mary’s. The former was attached to the university and both the location of the doors where the 99 theses were (supposedly) posted as well as the tomb of Martin Luther himself. Rick Steves had a fantastic walking tour for the city — he’s also Lutheran — that helped us to understand the meaning what started in this humble university town.
There isn’t that much else to do in the winter in Wittenberg, so we had a long, lazy lunch, perused the Christmas Market (which included an accordion choir concert!) and a nearby shopping mall, and then took a long walk back to the train station… for a train that was almost two hours delayed!
As I always say, never go anywhere without a book…
So despite all of the travel that we’ve done, I’m not sure that I’ve ever visited a place that I’d like to live in more than Berlin. And as I researched for this trip I was thrilled to discover that many sites and museums are open over the holiday, even on Christmas Day itself, making Berlin a wonderful place for Christmas.
It’s easy to be attached to your American view of Christmas — everything bedecked in lights and tinsel — but that might just be the United States being (yet again) a little extra. For example, Christmas trees are trimmed on Christmas Eve and there were no mall Santas to be found — though the Cathedral had a beautiful tree and manger scene. So if you can set aside Christmas expectations, December was a fantastic time to travel with many fewer tourists and attractions to oneself!
My favorite site this trip was the Reichstag Dome climb. The Reichstag is the home of the German Federal Parliament — the Bundestag — and the building it self is rich in history. It was burned to the ground in the 1930s and not reconstructed until the Berlin Wall fell. The modern dome sits atop a classical building, and within the dome itself you can see all the way to the parliament’s floor, symbolizing the belief that the people of Germany should know what’s happening in the government. A wide, gently-sloped ramp circles up and then down the outside of the dome, providing a sweeping view of the city… that would’ve been better in the daytime.
Since Berlin has so much history and character, it was hard to narrow down all of the sites to visit, but we really enjoyed the DDR Museum (compact and full of daily-life exhibits), the Berlin Wall Memorial (outside and included real parts of the Wall that were still standing), and, of course, Museum Island. While the Pergamon Museum is still closed for renovation (sob!), the Old and New National Galleries are spectactular.
We love you, Berlin. You make any trip a little bit sweeter!
Things are delayed even in Germany — in fact, during one train delay on our day trip to Wittenberg, the Germans were saying to one another, “This wouldn’t be happening if we were in Switzerland!” and for the two of you that think that’s funny, I hope we’re already friends.
We packed everything up, double-checked that we had our passports ready, set some early alarms, and made it out of the apartment by 7am… to find out that our flight from Berlin to London was cancelled en route. Poor Sergio was on the phone with British Airways and the calls kept dropping, so it took four or five calls before we were rebooked for the following day. There were a few hotels at the airport and we were able to get some rooms to make our airport experience the following day much easier.
I think everyone else was pretty tired by this point, which was a reminder that two weeks is a long trip from home when you’re not in your best travel shape. As a maximizer I want to fit the maximum days into a trip if I’ve flown to another continent, but two two-week trips showed me that perhaps it would be better to aim for 10–12 days abroad so we’re finishing on a high note!
Me being me I looked up some attractions that didn’t involve returning into Berlin proper, which included a WWII museum that focused on the Soviet experience (something you learn little about as an American ) — and then Sergio and I decided to get another long day of walking in at Tierpark Berlin, their “safari” park outside of the city center. We went to bed tired and happy, and the homeward journey went off without a hitch.
Well, we’re at the tail end of this post, so it’s time to wrap things up on this trip! Whether in this post or my previous entry about traveling with the Ricos, I hope you enjoyed tagging along with us and perhaps came away with a few travel ideas for yourself.
So what’s next? Let’s say I’m an antsy lady unless I’m dreaming of another trip. Since we’ve had some great road trip energy lately, we’re gearing up for potential road trips in Norway and France this year! No definite plans, but a lot of planning and excitement about our next trips to the Continent!
Auf Wiedersehen, S

The Berlin Exit is the not-so-secret escape hatch used by a certain type of Berlin resident — usually broke, usually clever, and usually somewhere between Neukölln and Bali. It’s not to be confused with the Irish Exit (leaving a party without saying goodbye), though it’s spiritually similar. The Berlin Exit is more like leaving the country without saying goodbye to the bureaucracy — while still collecting its money.
This strategy walks a tightrope. Sure, it’s fraud if you’re caught. But it’s also a wink at the sluggish system that gave you a six-month wait to speak to a Sachbearbeiter. Germany expects you to be physically available for work if you’re getting benefits. If you’re in Mexico? You’re not physically available. Overcharging subtenants? Also illegal under § 556d BGB.
If you get caught, expect fines, repayment demands, and possible criminal charges. But until then… you’re just another expat ‘working remotely’ from a beach café.
Some got sloppy. Some got unlucky. But a few notable cases have emerged of Berliners being chased down for:
Investigations often begin with anonymous tips, undelivered mail, or suspiciously tan Instagram selfies.
To some, the Berlin Exit is a middle finger to the system. To others, it’s freeloading dressed up as digital nomadism. Either way, it reveals the cracks in a system that hasn’t caught up with a world where “home” is just a postal address and Wi-Fi signal.
There are Telegram groups, half-ironic t-shirts, and coffee table guides titled things like “How to Finesse the Jobcenter from Georgia”. The Berlin Exit is not just a tactic — it’s a meme, a mood, and sometimes, a mistake.
The Berlin Exit has, over time, evolved from a quiet tactic into a kind of underground lifestyle aesthetic — equal parts survival strategy, protest, and meme. In online forums, Telegram groups, and bar conversations from Neukölln to Chiang Mai, the Berlin Exit is discussed not only as a practical option but also as a tongue-in-cheek critique of neo-liberal bureaucracy and Germany’s increasingly precarious middle class.
Entire threads on Reddit, Facebook expat groups, and private Signal chats have dissected the ins and outs of pulling off the Berlin Exit successfully. Users swap tips on mail forwarding hacks, proxy logins, remote job contracts, and the friendliest social workers. Some create guide PDFs or Google Docs titled things like “How to Vanish Elegantly” or “Bürgergeld from the Beach.”
T-shirts reading “Ich bin systemrelevant (aber in Thailand)” and “Amt Ghost Mode: ON” have been spotted in Kreuzberg bars and Lisbon cafés. A niche Berlin techno label once released a vinyl compilation called Exit Strategies Vol. 1, whose tracks were named after Jobcenter forms and abandoned mailboxes. Now who would want to have anything to do with you — if you wore a tee shirt like in german man is another thing. Oh let me talk to the guy who is scamnin the system a wears a tee shirt about it.
For some, the Berlin Exit isn’t just fraud — it’s anti-work praxis. It represents a refusal to engage with exploitative labor models while pointing out systemic inconsistencies in who gets help and who doesn’t. Critics call it freeloading; others call it economic jiu-jitsu.
Academic circles have even begun to reference the trend in papers on post-capitalist migration, urban gentrification backlash, and algorithmic welfare surveillance, often framing it as a quiet rebellion against punitive state mechanisms.
This article is intended for satirical and informational purposes only. Do not commit benefit fraud. Or if you do, don’t blog about it. don’t put it on tik-tok or Instagram.

During our five days in Berlin, we visited a different museum nearly every day. We enjoyed seeing many intricately framed old masters and stunning landscapes, but what we noticed most was the inclusion of interactive screens and buttons. We wondered how much it had to do with a generation raised with cellphones.
Berlin’s Hamburger Bahnhof (the old train station whose trains went to Hamburg) was turned into a modern art museum with a new wing devoted to mostly large and noisy pieces of art. There were a few beautiful pieces, like the floor constructed of ropes and fabric, but many of the displays were shockingly ugly and required turning things on, watching screens, or listening to blaring music. I thought that messages and meaning too frequently took the place of aesthetics.
One afternoon we walked to Jewish Museum, renowned for its Daniel Liebeskind designed building that required a rigorous security check followed by navigating an underground tunnel. It took a while for us to recognize that there wasn’t a single right angle in the museum. We found much of it disorienting and depressing, because for the most part, it wasn’t designed for those of us who are Judaically educated and involved in Jewish life.
Instead, it reminded me of the museums Hitler planned, the ones that showcased the life and artifacts of a people that no longer existed. The exhibits, one after another, portrayed Jewish history and artifacts via video installations, exhibits that required interaction, and recordings of music or spoken descriptions of day-to-day Jewish life in different centuries and regions.
The museum was packed with groups of tourists and student groups engaged in pressing all those buttons, for example, hearing the voices of Jews who loved Wagner’s music but struggled with his antisemitism, and watching video clips from films with essentially Jewish themes.
I spent a few moments re-watching the video of Raid on Entebbe, about the 1976 Israeli military operation to free hostages after a French flight was diverted to Uganda and Jewish passengers were separated from the rest of the passengers. The terrorists were two German militants and two Palestinian operatives — five people were wounded and the only one to die was Yonaton Netanyahu, older brother of current prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.
After nearly two hours, we were tired of all the input, the screens, the noise, and the technology. We headed to the Israeli-run Museum café where we shared an excellent spinach boureka topped with tahini and pomegranate seeds.
Then we left the museum and meandered a bit, suddenly coming upon a street filled with engraved plaques embedded in the pavement. Each plaque contained a quotation of one of the world’s great minds (I snapped a picture of Baruch Spinoza’s quotation.
There were few people about and nobody else seemed to notice that this was the Path of Visionaries, a “symbol of global unity.” The path, we learned is a city project that passes Checkpoint Charlie (formerly a dividing point between east and west Berlin), and ends at the Oranienburger Tur, near where we were staying. Exhausted by then, we hopped on a train and returned to the hotel for a nap.
Since we’ve already been back in Chicago for a week, and I just found this unsent essay, I’ll end my notes about the trip by extolling the fabulous concert we saw that evening. It was part of the Berlin Jazz Festival, a sold-out performance about the Music of Django Reinhardt, in one of the Berlin Opera’s smaller halls.
Although my German wasn’t advanced enough to understand the narrator describing the life of the great Django, I’d studied the jazz musicians during a college elective and knew his trajectory (I remembered being shocked about the fire that left him only able to use two fingers on his left hand and he still managed to play like he did).
Waiting to get into the concert hall, I struck up a conversation with a young woman who was there on her own, and we ended up sitting together for the concert, talking in between songs. We were both blown away by the virtuosity of Joscho Stephan, one of the world’s great gypsy jazz guitarists, and it was delightful to make a new friend in Germany.
The next day, Christine, my new friend, sent a list of good places to eat, but we only had time to try Princess Cheesecake. Berlin is now officially on my list of the cities I want to return to.

By Jackie Jauregui
Unglaublich is the German word for unbelievable — the best way to describe visiting Germany for the first time and communicating with people in a language I first started learning in college.
Especially when I was able to go to a shop in the Schöneberg district and feel at ease.
The boxes of ink for fountain pens in front of me were like the alphabet building blocks of my childhood — colorful, with some easily understandable to me and some not.
“Wie viel kostet es?” I asked without thinking. (How much does it cost?)
The answer was, in fact, too much. I decided on something else, and when the shop attendant rang me up saying my total was “seven Euros and fifty cents,” she quickly apologized for speaking English — since I had addressed her in German.
As an American who has been learning German for just three years, I would have never expected a German to say Entschuldigung (pardon me) for speaking my native language to me, instead of their own.
Berlin is known as a multicultural city, whose 940,000 foreign-born residents come from more than 170 countries. Though there’s no clear data about how many Berliners speak English, it is a prevalent second language, with many signs, restaurant menus, and often even public transit announcements offered in both German and English.
In my experience, language learners wanting to practice their German in Berlin need to be adamant about using it as often as possible, because it’s easy to travel here without needing to use it.
I don’t have other colleagues with German experience on the Berlin Beyond Borders editorial team, so I’ve mainly practiced my German ordering at restaurants. In more tourist-centered areas such as Holzmarktstraße in Mitte, service workers have automatically spoken to me in English.
According to Rolando Montanchez, a Peruvian restaurant manager who has lived in the city for seven years, sometimes they are German speakers that want to flex their English muscles and sometimes they are foreign-born workers with stronger English skills. It’s stressful to lack fluency, but I push myself to speak German through my mistakes.
What’s more challenging than being understood is to understand. Luckily, German speakers have never been more accessible. From the prerecorded overhead announcements at the U- and S-Bahn stations to catching up at a café with friends who now live here, I’ve been improving through keeping my ears open and piecing together the words I know.
More than that, I’ve been exposed to the written language absolutely everywhere. I brought my habit of reading everything around me to Berlin and it really is the best practice. My favorite aspect of the culture, that I’ve been able to absorb this way, is German humor — which I would say exists, but is very subtle. And much of it is text-based.
For example, the gift shop at the Cecilienhof villa in Potsdam has a few minimalist postcards with ‘inspirational’ quotes. One with earnest commentary from Spanish painter Salvador Dalí reads: “Was mich interessiert ist Geld (What interests me is money).” A Euro and 50 centsdoesn’t accurately measure the joy I felt to have understood the postcard.
That is all to say, sometimes I look at sentences in job advertisements and go back to being four years old, building structures with alphabet blocks. When I speak, I build with the ones I recognize and can grab the quickest. When I listen, it’s as though I’m reconstructing a preexisting — sometimes much too sophisticated — structure. And when I read, sometimes theblock combinations don’t make much sense.
But I am not without resources to figure out how to build better. Thanks to the online bilingual dictionary LEO, the translator app DeepL, and our course researcher-interpreter Vanessa, I feel more confident going at it again the next time. It all comes down to making the next attempt. AndI consider it a privilege to not just have the opportunity to practice these language skills, but to finally live in German. Unglaublich.

This will not end well.
Or at least, that was the first thing we saw in Berlin. An art exhibition with exactly that title.
Arriving Saturday morning, we would not start with brunch. Of course not! Man, it’s Berlin, we gotta do the extraordinary stuff. Or at least if we follow the reputation of Berlin among Germans.
Extraordinary. Edgy.
And everything but mainstream.
And if something is mainstream, be sure it’s hard to find in Berlin. So here we were – at that exhibition about drugs and relationships, in a large glass cube surrounded by snow, at 10 in the morning.
Artist Nan Golding put her life (evolving around drug addiction) on 6 or 7 video clips and delivered a disturbing and empathetic basis for discussions with my friends. But this deserves another article.

Berlin is the vibrant capital of Germany. It is one of Germany’s most attractive cities, for fair reasons as it is Home to the World’s longest bear garden, epic music, and art scene. This capital of diversity and freedom sets trends and there is always something unique to discover. Berlin is also honored with a matchless rich history as compared to other European Cities. Ranging from the world’s longest beer garden to the most currywurst, we will lay odds you must be unaware of these Top Facts about Berlin. There must be some fascinating reasons why people keep coming back to Berlin.
Here are some top facts about Berlin, that you shouldn’t skip out on
Although Berlin is nine times bigger than Paris, it is not as crowded as Paris. Paris has a population of 21000 per square km while Berlin has 4000 inhabitants per square km. That’s why Berlin feels even more voluminous.
The length of the East Side Gallery is 1,316 meters and displays over 100 murals from artists around the world. The most captured mural is the Fraternal Kiss, which manifests the former Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and GDR Erich Honecker. The gallery is sited on the banks of the Spree in Friedrichshafen where scraps of the Berlin Wall can be seen.
Berlin has 180 museums while on average 106 rainy days. The most fascinating museums on the check-list to visit are:
This stopover zoo accommodates over 1,300 different species with 20,000 animals and covers an area of 82 acres. It is open to all and entertains both young and elders and permits some fun activities with animals so marked as the most famous zoo in Europe
The Doner spits possess around 63 kg of meat, which shows that 60 tons of meat are consumed in a day. The Berlin Doner originated from Turkish-style kebabs.
Can you imagine that there are about 1700 bridges in Berlin? The most memorable and well-known is the Oberbaumbrücke between Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain. Researchers also investigate the fact that Berlin has more waterways than Amsterdam, Venice, and Stockholm combined. So, get ready to explore the beauty of nature in Berlin.
There is a Spati located in almost every corner of Berlin. Late-night workers who are helpless to purchase groceries or essentials during the day originated the Spati stereotype in East Germany where they built it to serve their demands. Currently, Berlin people can’t survive without a Spati. You can buy your grocery or any essentials at any time of the day or night just near at hand.
Another top fact about the Capital of Germany, Berlin is that it is very lucky to accommodate more than 2000000 dogs and so was voted as Germany’s most dog-friendly city in 2011. There are about 114,968 registered dogs and along with unregistered dogs, it sums up to above 2000000 dogs. Yes! You got to know the right thing that you need to register your dogs in Germany and have to pay taxes accordingly.

Currywurst is one of the most demanded fast food dishes in Berlin. Back in 1949, a woman named Herta Heuer invented this delicious snack. She mixes ketchup or Worcestershire sauce with curry powder delivered by a British soldier. She blended this mixture with other pieces and marinated it over grilled pork sausage. Then put it on sale at a street stand in Charlottenburg. In its full swing, this stand could sell 10,000 currywurst every week. Now, about 70 million currywurst are consumed in Berlin each year.
Berlin, the capital of Germany is among the fifth most beautiful capitals in the World. So, here you can explore another top fact that Berlin is blessed to be the greenest city in Germany. It is devoid of skyscrapers and bureaucratic buildings. Open green space and woodlands cover about 30 percent of this city. There are almost 2500 parks and 431,000 trees packing the streets of Berlin. The tallest tree in the capital of Germany is a European larch that was planted in the Tegel Forest in 1795. It was named Dicke Marie.
Yeh! You have just read the true fact about base flying in Berlin. You can enjoy the breathtaking view of Berlin from 125m above Alexanderplatz from Park Inn. here you are free to choose your Base Fly ride. Berlin’s horizon glows in the night so go for the base fly after sunset or at night.
The cleaning of this Berlin’s graffiti cost about € 35 million every year. This magical street art is a fantastic piece of craft that should never be overlooked.
The Berlin transport system is so extensive that it covers almost 8.7 times around the Globe each day. It extends to about 473 km and adds about 120 km of tram lines. This capital of Germany possesses one of the most impressive public transport systems in the world. Just for correlation, Paris and London have 214 km and 400 km of public transport systems respectively. It would also be worth knowing about the sightseeing bus to Guimaraes.
About 40% of Berlin runs down your shoes, making them about twice the size it seems to be from the surface. The undercover world of Berlin consists of a compound railway network, a complex network of bunkers, and escape tunnels from World War II and brewer cellars. There is a wide range of underground beer over there. These underground bunkers including Nazis’ secret tunnels and living areas are now accessible to tourists.

When I learned that Globetrotters Monthly Challenge theme this August would be Street Art, my mind instantly travelled there: Berlin.
Berlin! I have been there twice, and the first time I was there I noticed one specific thing about the capital of Germany: It feels guilt, a lot of guilt.
One can spot this guilt all around the city. At the countless monuments, memorials, and artworks devoted to World War II, the Holocaust, and the Cold War. Most of these works, despite beautiful, are understandably gray in color.
A city that still digests the horrors of World War II, and still somewhat believes it has to repay something to the world. And the same city that still has scars of being torn apart, becoming ground zero for a whole world that was cut in half by two struggling giants. Berlin became the symbol of a broken world that lasted for four decades.
But it is exactly in the greatest scar of that great city that the colors bloom their brightest. The remaining parts of the Berlin Wall long became an open-air gallery, that to some extent purged all the dark from the past and celebrated life in a city that needs to show everybody it is much more than its history.
A city that feels the need to scream “I’m Alive!!”
The art at the west face of the wall started in the mid-80s, and as far as I could notice, it is as flourishing as ever.
So keep on, Berlin! Keep throwing colors over the wall of shame, so as Fulvio Pinna would say, freedom is ashamed no more.
I would like to share these two stories, the first one is from Anupa Jayakody, and her three days around Berlin;
medium.com
The second one is the beautiful Anne Bonfert story full of amazing photographs of the Berliner autumn. Need to confess that I have a kind of soft spot for that season.

I’ve come to realize just how much our surroundings can immediately influence the way we feel and live. Even with the best intentions, if our environment doesn’t align with the life we’re trying to build, it can slowly drag us in a different direction.
As someone who genuinely values wellness — not just fitness, but a balanced lifestyle — I started feeling really out of place in Berlin, where the culture often revolves around techno, party scenes, kink, smoking, drinking, drug use, and getting by on gig work and state support.
Yes, I said it.
So yeah… I’m counting down the days until I leave Berlin.
I’ve been feeling exhausted — not just physically, but mentally and spiritually too. Lately, my coping mechanism has been traveling, trying to shake off the energy around me. If I can afford the trip, I go.
But then I have to come back, right? And as soon as I do, it all hits me again.
So, I’ve started seriously thinking about ditching Berlin for good. Wild, I know. But, as I’m not exactly rolling in money, and as dreamy as it sounds to just chase sunsets and sip cocktails by the beach, reality’s got other plans. Like, you know… needing an actual job. Minor detail.
But you’re talking to Miss “I Got a Plan” over here. Structured as heck, checklist in hand.
First, things first, I will finish my short-term work contract in Berlin, then find a proper job — ideally one that doesn’t evaporate in six months. Radical idea, I know. And, move! Somewhere. Anywhere. Preferably with fewer existential crises per square meter.
Surprise, surprise — after a six-month-long panic search, most job leads pointed right back to… you guessed it: Berlin (shockingly original) or in that other glittering gem of excitement: Frankfurt am Main. Honestly, I don’t even know what’s worse — Berlin’s militant wokeness or Frankfurt’s charming little drug haven, the Bahnhofsviertel.
Oh, the irony… Am I giving off too much of “Alan is Morissette ’95” vibes if I start singing, “Isn’t it ironic?” Because that feels like the perfect soundtrack.
If you’ve ever felt like you love a place but it just doesn’t love your lifestyle back — trust that feeling. You don’t have to shrink your values to fit.
Seven months of job hunting across Germany’s “livable” expat-friendly medium-sized cities, and the only way out is out of the country. The economy’s going straight down the drain, so jobs are disappearing faster than my patience. Oh, and to add some extra spice, every single role now expects you to be a SQL, Python, and AI specialist.
I asked around with some colleagues and friends who are job hunting too, thinking maybe I’m just unlucky. Turns out, nope, the same story for them. Everyone’s just hanging on to whatever they can, and the ones who actually can do something are waving goodbye and not in a “see you later” way.
So yeah, the options right now? Not great. In Berlin, most jobs are short-term contracts, with only a handful leading to permanent roles. On top of that, tons of German and international companies based in Germany are outsourcing operations to cheaper countries or relocating staff abroad. So basically, if you’re not planning to survive on social welfare, you either have to accept lower pay and live paycheck to paycheck in constant instability or… well, there’s not really a “or” at this point.
I always wanted this blog to be as honest as possible, because life as an immigrant is way more about adapting to constantly changing circumstances. I chose this path, and I’m fully aware of what it means. But… deep down, I still wish I could make it all work without so much stress.
Against The Odds

We didn’t consciously plan to be in Germany for Trump’s second inauguration. It just worked out that way, a quirk of our schedules. When we realized that we would in fact be in Berlin on January 20th, my girlfriend joked maybe we could seek asylum.
I’d never been to Germany before. I guess I’d kept nursing a grudge born in the afternoon Hebrew School sessions of my Anne Frank-forward reform-Jewish childhood. But my best friend was in Berlin on a research grant and invited us to visit. So while Trump and his cronies shuffled around to bar mitzvah staple “YMCA” (not a gay anthem, apparently!) at the pre-inauguration rally, we staggered, jet-lagged, to a co-ed bathhouse in Kreuzberg.
First thing on our Monday agenda was a Berlin Underworld tour, where a charismatic tour guide led us through some of the tunnels beneath the Berlin Wall that people used to escape. He broke down Berlin 101 for those of us with only hazy 1980s childhood memories of divided Germany: After WWII, Germany was divvied up and occupied by the conquering forces. The US poured resources into West Berlin, and the USSR siphoned resources out of East Berlin, installing the socialist DDR government (GDR to us English-speakers).
Nearly overnight, East Berlin became a prison, with border guards given orders to shoot anyone trying to pass into West Berlin, even if they were just trying to visit the friends or family who a few days earlier had been neighbors. The DDR blocked off the city’s subway tunnels, installing guards to make sure no one was using the tunnels to sneak from West Berlin to East Berlin. “Why didn’t the guard system work very well?” the tour guide prompted the crowd.
“They could be bribed?” someone guessed.
He nodded while saying no, like a stern school teacher. “They escaped themselves,” he said. “The DDR had to make adjustments.” He directed our attention to a photograph of guards chained to their outposts.
We learned about how, as the wall became more fortified, people snuck through the sewers, preferring to literally swim through shit than to stay in their suddenly oppressive regime. A question that came up a lot was some iteration of: Wasn’t it telling that people hated the DDR so much they would risk their life to escape? If nothing else, wasn’t that bad PR? The tour guide answered this by widening his eyes and nodding meaningfully.
Eventually, he told us, people started to dig their own tunnels. “Mostly young men,” he explained, “because you know, young men can be stupid enough to be brave.” I felt an uncharacteristic surge of love for stupid, brave men.
We emerged blinking into the weak January sunlight.
“Would I be brave?” I kept asking. “If things were so scary?”
My girlfriend’s German friend said, “You probably would, if you had to be.”
After the tour, we stopped for coffee and cake at a nearby cafe, me and my girlfriend and my best friend, three queer women living our lives so freely that we’d taken this rather spontaneous trip to Europe because we felt like it. I checked the New York Times on my phone. “Oh god,” I said. “That’s right, he’s being inaugurated.” We all groaned, and changed the subject.
The next thing on the agenda that day was the DDR Museum, an oddly whimsical exhibition tucked into the bank of the River Spree, across from the Berlin Cathedral, a giant Baroque structure that somehow survived Allied bombing in one of those unscathed bits of Berlin that looks like any European city.
The museum breaks down the different aspects of daily life in East Berlin, including a replica of a typical apartment. I have to admit this really backfired for us, freelance creatives from New York City. “Wait, everyone was given a job? With benefits?” we marveled. “There was universal childcare? Everyone had a cute little apartment? And then they took vacations to nude beaches on the Baltic Sea?” I read that people in East Berlin had more sex than people in West Berlin, and contraception was readily available for women. I mean, we got that it was generally a bad scene, but still.
We kept taking pictures of the cute 60s wallpaper and fixtures. A plaque in the apartment replica explained that since so many things were so shitty (I’m paraphrasing), people retreated into coziness, focusing on making their living spaces as cozy and welcoming as they could. “Maybe coziness is what will get us through the next four years,” my best friend said, and we both laughed nervously.
It was a busy time for us, but things were busier stateside: Our country’s new president signed a stack of executive orders, promised mass deportations and more border barriers at the US-Mexico border, moved to end birthright citizenship, withdrew the US from the Paris Climate Agreement and the World Health Organization, ordered the dismantling of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives, pardoned members of extremist groups, and established a policy of “recognizing two sexes,” targeting transgender and LGBTQ+ Americans. His unelected advisor gave a Nazi salute.
Back in Berlin, it was date night. After dinner at the lush Tajikistan Tearoom, my girlfriend and I made our way to a queer bar called the Tipsy Bear in Prenzlauer Berg, a neighborhood that during the occupation was home to East Berlin’s counterculture of activists, artists, and the gay community. A sign at the bar read in English: “Welcoming Environment for Everyone — If you are racist/sexist/homophobic/or an ASSHOLE, don’t come in.”
We ordered stiff drinks, tired from the day and the dribs of news we couldn’t stop peeking at our phones for. Soon the music began. It turned out there was a drag king show that night. We held hands in a crowd of queer people from all over, and watched painfully hot women in drag act out winking stories of machismo lotharios and foolish kings. I wanted to cry, especially during the finale, when the drag kings from each act got up on stage together for a rousing rendition of “YMCA,” a song I’ve never before been overjoyed to hear.
Did they know how much we needed this? Did they know what this meant in this moment for Americans? Or is it just a gay anthem, no matter what anyone says?
There in East Berlin, everyone danced and sang along.

By John Glab
Berlin is internationally famous for its techno clubs and my visits to Tresor and Berghain upheld the stereotypes: dark spaces with intense flashing light shows, blurred by the occasional smoke screen. Loud, heavy, four-on-the-floor industrial techno rattles the concrete structure of the buildings, as well as the bones of those either dancing in ecstasy or swaying as they try to not to fall over from exhaustion.
But just because the techno scene now lives above ground doesn’t mean the rest of Berlin’s music scene does.
Hidden across the city are many punk and DIY venues that offer a space for a community of musicians to create their own art. In my time in Berlin, I’ve looked at posters taped to walls and light poles, searched names online, and asked around for some places to see a show.
Køpi, a squatting development in Kreuzberg, has a couple spaces for live music performances. I entered through a gate, obscured from street view by some vegetation. Behind it was a courtyard area flanked by the building’s two short wings. Its cracked, concrete facade was well adorned with colorful graffiti murals of contorted human figures, stencil art, and the common message of “kein foto,” no photography allowed.
German Punk Time meant I waited well over an hour for the show to start. In that time, I played a game of pick-up basketball with a few of the people who lived there, trying to avoid splashing in the puddles in the courtyard’s potholes. At Køpi, the line between public and private living spaces feels non-existent.
Koma F, the performance area at Køpi, was down a flight of stairs in a basement. Old bricks, rounded from age, formed arched ceilings in what felt like a former storage space. A crowd of around 30 people — who were well beyond their 20s — fit the punk cliché, dressed in black vests with studs and large boots.
The two bands that played, Shell-Shocked from Berlin and Disturbance from Rotterdam in the Netherlands, both reflected this vintage aesthetic in their music. Shell-Shocked had quick tremolo pickings that droned over blasting d-beats. The band’s vocalist stumbled around the front of the stage, leaning back while screaming into the mic, looking as if he was trying to swallow a sword.
Disturbance was much more straight forward, playing into the punk sentiment of less-is-more. They had a definite Oi! punk sound with frequent gang vocals sung over more classic stylings of simple rock-and-roll songs, but played faster and noisier. This affinity for the past makes sense as Disturbance has been a band since 1995. Perhaps you can critique them for never evolving, or holding onto the past too hard even from the beginning, but they were still entertaining enough for the people who came to see them.
The other venue I went to was OGH, located somewhere in the sprawling southern neighborhood of Neukölln. The entrance was tucked in an alleyway. Beyond the door, a stairwell splotched with graffiti and posters led up to the fourth floor of the warehouse space. There, the stage stood at the front of what looked like a former office area. In the backhalf of the space, people sat and talked between sets at a bar and lounge area. Large windows lined the entire wall of the venue, where many people looked out over the alleyway at surrounding apartment blocks.
The show at OGH followed a more post-punk garage sound, without the aggressiveness of hardcore. The bands were Dackelkontakt from Potsdam, Fantuzzi in Berlin, and Teo Wise, an Italian living in Leipzig. About 50 people filled the space. Dackelkontakt went first, sitting behind a small synth array set on a repurposed ironing board. They played fast, peppy, synthpunk tracks with a bit of added whimsy from the little squeals of a theremin. Often songs would pause for brief spoken word parts, traded off between members, including at the climax of their set when two of the band members quickly and aggravatedly talked over each other for about 30 seconds before falling into the last riff.
At the end, Teo Wise performed his light but robust punk tracks. Together with the other members of his band, they mastered the balance of playing locked-in and succinct while effecting a sprawling free spirit that gave the music so much livid personality. Wise’s set moved the audience into an ecstatic dance, with shoes slipping across a sweat slicked concrete floor.Most enthralling was that everyone danced together. There were no imposed boundaries as people whirled around each other, one person making contact with another’s psyche, before turning to the next, until there was a point of connection between everyone in the room. Theboundaries of the individual became invisible.
After the set, people lingered in the fourth-floor warehouse loft for well over an hour. They were simply talking, making new acquaintances, and building on the commonalities they had found during the performance. Whether it be two people just passing through the city, or someone finding a new community, these moments define life and cannot be manufactured. In Berlin, they can still be found in DIY spaces — if you just know where to look.

A Lesbian’s Guide to Berlin: 3 must-visit places (disability friendly),https://medium.com/@artementis/a-lesbians-guide-to-berlin-the-3-best-places-to-visit-disability-friendly-40e4e55cb73c,"Sign up

I’ll be honest, when I first got to Berlin, I was underwhelmed. For years, my friends had told me how much I would love it in the German capital — it’s the gay centre of Europe after all. Perhaps my expectations of rainbow bunting hanging from every balcony and LGBTQ+ museums dominating the streets were set a little too high.
I did find some lesbian history in the obvious places; the recognition of the suffering and slaughter endured by homosexuals in war-time Germany is poignant and moving, and the video memorial in Tiergarten is beautiful. Only, in the so-called gay capital of the continent, I expected to find, well… more. I should have taken the title at face value. While there are lots of events, bars and even sections of parks dedicated to the getting together of gay, cisgender men, the scene for women-loving-women and non-binary people (FLINTA* as it’s known in German) is scarce, under-advertised and according to one server I met in a lesbian-owned cafe, “disappearing fast”. The events that do exist for lesbians are almost exclusively weekly club nights. While fun for dancing, drinking and mixing with other FLINTA folk, these events are, at best, a little dull after your 51st Lesbian Tuesday of the year and at worst, are exclusionary to whole sections of the disabled community. I’ve included the club nights I encountered at the bottom of this post, so feel free to skip ahead if that’s more your scene. But the main purpose of this post is to shine a light on the few FLINTA-focused places I, a disabled lesbian, sought out when visiting Berlin.
Hands down, this is the best place to go if you’re looking for a lesbian crowd, without the partying and alcohol. Run by a British/American lesbian couple, Lonely Hearts Cafe is a fusion of both countries’ breakfast staples. Pancakes and fry-ups sit side-by-side on the menu and they have extensive allergen info readily available for my IBS buddies. Coeliacs can also enjoy food here — they were happy to prepare my order on a separate surface and brought out gluten free toast and vegan butter for me to enjoy with my fry-up.
When I walk in, the place is full of eccentrically-dressed people who (call it gaydar) I immediately assume to be queer. I take a seat along a bench under a neon sign that reads Lonely Hearts and from the back of the room, admire the other quirks this restaurant has to offer. It’s a cosy cafe, which mashes together British and American aesthetics so well, from the black and white letterboard for hot drinks, which looks like it might belong in a chippy, to the hand-drawn sign advertising iced tea. The teaspoons are in Marmite jars, the knives and forks in a large Coleman’s mustard tin, but there’s Tabasco in the condiment container. The red wooden benches have you believing you’re in a 50s American diner until you look at the throw pillows, which place you more in a granny-owned cafe in Surrey. My server, Amy, brings me iced water in a jug and I order a pot of Yorkshire Tea and a Full English. The bandana in her hair screams cottagecore lesbian who abandoned home to run off to a European city and set up a café with her wife... which seems to be exactly what happened. After eating, I use the bathroom. Opening the door is a queer cultural experience in itself. The small room I find myself in is decorated floor-to-ceiling with pictures of Dolly Parton. Even the toilet is Dolly-themed. I have to stop and laugh, take pictures and smile at my reflection in the neon-clad mirror. When I go back out to pay, I spend all my pocket change on merchandise — a t-shirt, mug and sticker set — to remember the queerest café I ever did meet.
It’s impossible to tell what this place is from the outside. The blue canopy is like a red herring for heterosexual people to be lured in, suspecting a green grocer’s and then you see the pink signage, graffiti and rainbow doormat and know they’ve got LGBerlin to a T. Inside, Keller Kreuzberg is full to bursting with art, clothing, cards, tarot decks, books, badges and so much more. I’ve never seen so much merchandise dedicated to LGBTQ+ people in one place. The store does a good job at catering to women as well; the kink section in the basement level has a good range of products for all body types and artwork that bares the same diversity. It’s got a furry pink ceiling which is beside the point but cool. I loved the sex-positive merchandise all around. Though the spiciest stuff remains downstairs, the shop isn’t shy about its stance on sex. My favourite items were a keychain that read, ‘it’s vulva not vagina’ and two naked women in a car painted on a coaster. The only thing I was a little disappointed in was a slight lack of lesbian-specific merchandise in the store, though there was some — I found a hat with the lesbian flag and some prints and cards featuring two women. The main focus was on queer-centered merchandise, which I understand from a business perspective sells better to the masses. But the owner of this shop also agreed with the Lonely Hearts team: the lesbian scene in Berlin is slim pickings. They did give me a tip on a good place to spend some time though, so I headed there next.
Lesbian pal of mine, how many times a day do you think about abandoning your desk job to start a female-focused, bookshop-cum-coffee shop? Five times a day? Nine times a day? Just fifteen minutes from Keller Kreuzberg on foot is She Said bookshop, which specialises in queer, literature written by women. And it’s got a café. They did it folks, they really did it. I spent over an hour wandering around here, picking up books in English and in German — partly to test whether or not I could still remember vocabulary from A-level German. (Spoilers, reader: I could not.) The level of diversity across the shelves is what you want from all bookstores, all written by FLINTA on a wide variety of subjects from fiction to memoir to poetry. I ended up walking away with a bundle of titles I hadn’t heard of before and devoured them on my night train to Brussels the next evening. With its cute café serving sandwiches, cakes and hot drinks, you could easily spend an afternoon here browsing the shelves, consuming coffee and queer literature ’til closing time.
Thanks to the wonderful small business owners I spoke to in the places listed above for these recommendations!
Other Nature — “a queer-feminist, sex-positive, eco-friendly and vegan sex shop” specialising in body-safe sex toys, locally-made kink gear, natural lubes and feminine hygiene products (amongst other wonderful things!)
Siegessäule — an online resource dedicated to queer information, events and guides in Berlin.
Schwules Museum — Berlin’s LGBTQ+ museum and art gallery. I did actually visit this museum but it didn’t make my top three purely because of its size. I paid almost the same entrance fee for this museum as I did for entry to Museum Island, and as far as I could see there was just one, small exhibition room. The exhibition itself was fantastic, full of lesbian artwork which I loved and bought prints of, but it would have been nice to see more! The tea in the cafe, however, was some of the best I’ve ever had. Their website states that admission is free on the first Sunday of the month, so I’d advise taking advantage of this when planning your trip.
I didn’t visit one myself but a lesbian friend of mine who lives in Berlin recommended the Tuesday lesbian night at Möbel Olfe — a bar widely known in Berlin for its gay scene. As far as I’m aware, Tuesday seems to be the night for bars and clubs to lesbi-fy, so bear this in mind if you’re planning a party trip!
Notes:
*Meaning “Frauen, Lesben, Intergeschlechtliche, Nichtbinäre, Trans und Agender”. Or in English, “Women, Lesbians, Intersex, Non-binary, Trans and Agenda”.

The spectrum only has two ends. No in between. People hate or love Berlin. The city hosts the most colorful contradictions: Snobby districts, fucked up districts. Start-up career character or totally lost. Techno drug scene, sober yoga class society. Grey in grey or wild nature. Go home with understatement, the city screams. Choose your mix of extremes!
Describing Berlin as a whole is merely feasible. It makes me say ‘anarchy’. Not in a purely chaotic sense. Rather with a tiny sparkle. ✨ I just don’t recognize a concept in Berlin. There is no average reference point. Which is probably the most remarkable thing about the city.
“In Berlin, anti conformance is a default” — my old roomie, who lives there
If you are an outlier in your hometown, you’re gonna feel pretty normal in Berlin. Therefore, outliers are wildly attracted to the city: The city makes non-average the new average. And people are proud of it. “I live in Berlin” is rather a phrase to describe an identity than a residence.
Everything, also the tyniest, most unremarkable part of Berlin seems unique. Even the train sound when arriving at a station was dedicated an anthem to by famous Berlin DJ Paul Kalkbrenner. It’s called Train. As if that would be the most normal thing.
And I love it. 🖤

This guide contains a collection of dos and don’ts to make sure you and everyone you’re raving with has a great time while clubbing. Although it’s based on the Berlin club culture, I’d be happy to see this applied everywhere where people are enjoying music together — be it at a club, festival or concert anywhere in the world.
I’ve spent a significant amount of my lifetime on the dance floor, because that’s simply one of the things in life that gives me the most joy. I was lucky enough to get introduced to the Berlin nightlife, festivals and Burns by great friends and experienced ravers, but often enough I meet people who didn’t get a chance for such an introduction. And although I don’t think that too much of advice is needed for yourself to have fun while clubbing in Berlin, I feel like there certainly are some things to keep in mind in order to make sure your fellow ravers are also having a great time.
So basically this is me wanting others to behave the way I consider appropriate, just so that I can keep on enjoying my time raving as much as possible. But that sounds terribly egocentric, so let’s not put it that way…
Figuring out where to go and how to dress can be challenging. There are quite a few guides available for selecting the right club or what to wear to blend in, but let me quickly add some points: The vibe you’ll experience will greatly vary between different clubs — and even between different events at the same club — so try out as much as you can. You’ll eventually find the scene you’ll enjoy the most. And while you generally should adhere to dress codes (e.g. no streetwear), don’t overthink it. The most important thing is that you’re being comfortable. Feel free to express yourself, your fellow ravers won’t judge. The people that do are not the people whose opinion you should care about. Avoid dressing a certain way just because others are doing it, go with your own style.
Although you should pack as light as possible, make sure to bring essentials that you or others may need. You’ll need cash in most clubs unfortunately, and ATMs in or at clubs often come with deposit fees. Don’t underestimate the importance of ear plugs, preventing hearing damage is reasonable in general and in some locations the sound can be unpleasantly loud. Bringing chewing gum, a lighter (even if you don’t smoke) or tampon and pain killer (even if you’re not going to need it) are easy ways to earn some karma points.
If you’re planning to do drugs: Do proper research about the substances that you consider consuming and also check how they interact with each other. The TripSit wiki is a great resource for that. Don’t try out stuff for the first time in a club you’ve never been to before or without people you trust and don’t push your limits. Remember that set and setting are key for psychedelic experiences. If possible, purchase what you need outside of the club, prepare it for consumption and label it properly. Club toilets are not a great place for doing that! Read about safer use guidelines.
If you’re not planning to do drugs: Awesome, chances are you’ll get into ecstasy just by focusing on the music and visual effects anyway! However, I would still recommend reading up on the effects of common party drugs, since quite a few people around you will be high. It will help you understand why people are behaving in certain ways, and empathy is key for having a great time together.
Most people will be joining the queue between 12 am and 3 am and it can stay crowded until the early morning. I personally never understood that and feel it’s much more comfortable to avoid arriving at the prime time.
Perks of arriving early: You get to skip the super long queues and are less likely to be rejected. I get that, for many people, queueing is part of the experience and I’ve met a fair share of my friends randomly while waiting in line. However, I’d rather spend that time chatting in a chill-out area inside, or dancing on the not yet crowded dance floor. Some clubs also have a reduced entry fee or cheaper drinks before midnight.
Alternatively, arriving in the morning can also be great (given you selected a club that isn’t closing): You’ll also avoid the entry queue, and the people that are still there or arriving with you are the really motivated ones. If you got some sleep during the night before, this will also be easier on your sleep schedule for the next day. Unfortunate timing can have you queuing for the coat check together with people that want to leave though.
Whenever you arrive, please don’t skip the queue unless you know someone who’s already in line. Some people make a sport out of it, but it’s simply annoying for everyone else.
Just like at the entry queue, please don’t push to the front. Know what you want to order before being asked. Have money prepared and don’t start looking for cash after your drinks are ready. Give a tip if everything was alright. Leave the bar counter after you paid. Same applies to the coat check.
Chances are that you’ll spend more time queuing for a bathroom stall than for drinks at the bar. And that’s mainly because they’re being used for taking drugs without needing to worry about the security.
If you’re in need for a place to consume stuff, first check if there are other options. Many clubs provide some conveniently separated small areas, these are there for this exact purpose (not to be confused with dark rooms meant for sexual encounters). The club staff won’t disrupt you there. If only bathrooms are available, make sure to minimise the time you spend in the stall and share it with other people that just need it for the same reason.
If you’re actually in need to relieve yourself with some urgency, it’s not unlikely that people will let you take their place in line if you ask nicely. Look out for groups of people that seam like they’ll not use the toilet for its intended purpose. Remember to check if there’s toilet paper in your stall before you need it, since there often is none.
Let loose and dance like no-one is watching. And smile while you’re at it. Having fun is contagious, your motivation will lift the mood of everyone around you. Similarly, if you’re not currently feeling it, don’t stand still right in front of the DJ looking like you’re forced to be there. Maybe go explore the other areas or grab a drink instead.
Dancing is so much more fun if you’re seeing how others are enjoying the music too. The dance floor is not the place to have smalltalk at, or to call the friend you’re supposed to be with, or to check your connection for the way home. Focus on the music and allow others to do the same.
The single most annoying thing for many ravers are other people using their phones (occasionally challenged by rude wasted people). A few clubs will require you to leave your phone at the coat check, most will cover your cameras. And that’s for a reason. Capturing the experience you’re having using a phone camera will likely be underwhelming and it’s degrading the experience that others are having. If you need to message someone, don’t do so in the middle of the dance floor. Your screen will be blinding and distracting for people around you. You and others will have the best time if you manage to not use your phone at all.
This should go without saying, but just be nice. Respect the personal space of others. If you bump into someone, say sorry. If you spill someones drink, go get a new one. If you find something that someone else lost, return it at the bar or coat check. If you see someone that could use help, offer some or go get the awareness team. Treat others the way you would like to be treated. Try finding joy in others having a great time with you, e.g. by doing a random act of kindness to a stranger. Offering water to someone who looks like they might be dehydrated is an always appreciated gesture. Imagine strangers just being friends of friends that you didn’t get introduced to yet. They might actually are!
For some more general guidelines that are worth being aware of, I’d recommend checking out:
If you’ve made it this far, I’m certain you’ll be a great rave companion.See you on the dance floor!

The happiest hour (two hours) is from 5–7 pm. After dinner, I returned to the bar every evening. Either solo or with my new friends Gabriel or Ria or Michèle. Started with cocktails as you do, mojito, Aperol spritz, gin basil squash. All new taste sensations for me.
I finally managed to fit some touristing into the drinking schedule. It’s my last day. I have to do something! When I’m asked what did you do in Berlin, I can’t say, “I partied, swam naked, made some friends and drank cocktails.” Well, I suppose I can. I have some great memories.
I started at Checkpoint Charlie, the most famous of seven crossing points between East Berlin and West Berlin.
I went looking for the Berlin Bears… these were the only ones I saw in a gift shop. I decided if I couldn’t find a bear, I’d buy…

After living in Berlin for almost six months, it’s time to remedy my failure in writing about its multitude of offerings.
That’s the thing with cities like this, ones spread out over land and history and culture; the sites of early palaces and modern immigration centers. The latest example of gentrification and one of the most well known sites of counterculture movements. A club scene for the leather-clad, but also a site for the wannabe artist and yoga practitioner. It’s just got too much!
Not even a year here will give me a chance to truly sense the song sung by the pulse of this city’s enduring arrhythmia. Instead, I’ll share a few of the spaces that have brought me joy while fall turned to winter and Berlin became the place I call home.
No list of recommendations by a Feldman exists without copious consideration for the locale’s foods. Without an aside on food’s integral place in cultural definition and experience, I’ll recommend a small slice of Berlin’s best culinary experiences.
From April to October, Thai Park street-food market swarms the green space of Preußenpark with delectable, colorful, lustrous-smelling Thai goodies. A cultural event as much as an opportunity for food, grabbing a steaming hot bun and a boba tea, a plate of rolls and a small fruit cake, sitting on the grass to enjoy your scores, Thai Park brings a joyous mix of culture to every demographic in Berlin.
Transported by the sound of Thai spoken at every stall, I used German to order my friends and I steaming vegetable buns, mini pumpkin cake, traditional tea, and noodle dishes. The food was good, the experience was better. Counting down the days until April.
The United State’s lacks a lot of Europe’s most redeeming qualities. And no, not the welfare state or the responsible gun laws, I’m talking about proper Western-Chinese cuisine. I love Chinese food as much as the next coastal Jew, but nothing could prepare me for finding out I’ve been lacking Sichuan noodles my entire life.
In comes Wen Cheng’s, the noodle house of my dreams. Hand-pulled, Sichuan noodles and a low-intensity atmosphere. Just the people of Berlin, and their f*cking delicious noodles.
Split — or don’t — a Gua Bao (Bao Bun) and a classic noodle dish on the sidewalk of Prenzlauer Berg (you can expect a decent line). You won’t think of much else for a while.
Another food I’ll truly never find an equal of elsewhere is, you guessed it, Döner. I like to joke that Döner is one of Germany’s most vital infrastructures, and I have yet to be proven wrong. There’s no one that doesn’t love it. A gift of the Turkish population in Berlin since the 70’s, Döner really is special to the mix of cultures in German cities, and more rural areas alike.
Don’t be mistaken and compare your local Kebab house for the satisfying flavors of Döner sauces, the endless carts of breads that steam as they’re split for filling, or the unmistakable script of most Döner location menus.
My local spot, the roadside Crispy Döner in Charlottenburg, has never done me wrong. Consistently the best 5 Euros one can spend on a given night. I don’t believe the cultural significance and deep satisfaction of a Döner is easily explained. I wish you the best Döner experience when that day comes.
Nestled in a bustling section of Neukölln, neighbored by rows of Middle Eastern sweets shops and Spätis, is Azzam Restaurant; my favorite Middle Eastern restaurant in Berlin.
As low maintenance as it gets, but the staff’s kindness and the sense of community overpowers any “finer” dining experience I’ve had. Azzam, like many businesses that cater to Berlin’s many culturally specific Kiez (neighborhoods), is the embodiment of community and the transportable abilities of food.
Order one or two dishes and you’ll have enough to split between two to three people. If you’re lucky, like my friend and I were, commenting on how good a dish looks will have you walking back to your table with said dish in hand, “a gift for you” from the kind men behind the counter.
Richly flavorful, wonderfully comforting, spiced in a way that makes you forget you’re in Germany — and my favorite — made with an authentic love of a culture I’m newly acquainted with.
Across the street, Azzam Market is a world of its own and while not a restaurant, deserves a visit. A portal to some far away country, or maybe to one that doesn’t exist — a perfectly balanced mixture of Arabic life and culture in Berlin. Grab spices by the kilo from enormous mounds, fresh spreads and Halal meats, local produce, imported specialities, and the most beautifully crafted sweet treats I’ve ever laid eyes on.
YamYam’s Mitte location is packed on an average evening. Rightfully so, as its adorable low tables (or floor-seat options for those with functioning knees), orange atmosphere, and well lettered signage create the most delightful dining aura. More expensive than a hole in the wall, ordering the bean pancake, Bi Bim Bap, traditional Korean sides, tea, and their house made ice cream. really are worth it.
Happy, satiated, and just plain old delicious — YamYam satiated the love for Korean food I discovered when I tried it for the first time. I’m in no rush to find a YamYam rival spot.
If you know me, you’ll have no objection to the distinction between a Cafe and a “food” specific location. Coffee is one thing, but I seek out a cafe for the illusion it brings to my day, the cuteness factor it exudes, and — the baked goods. Maybe to work, maybe to sip coffee, maybe to listen to a podcast, cafes are an entirely different experience, good food is just a positive bonus.
A German “chain”, but a loved one at that. In case you forgot the cinnamon bun intentions, Zeit für Brot brings you back. Translating to “time for bread” in German, this bakery and cafe brings freshly made cinnamon rolls of all kinds, the best cardamom bun I’ve had outside Scandinavia, and loaves upon loaves of fresh German bread. Not to mention other baked goods, sandwiches, and consistently good coffee.
With five (!) locations in the city, I’ve rarely turned down a wonderfully moist, usually enormous, Zimtshnecke for 3 euros.
If you had to model a cafe after me, I’d hope it to look something like The Greens. This cafe, plant-shop hybrid in an alley on the eastern side of the Spree brings the coziest atmosphere possible to an archetypal Berlin day. Warm and full of plants on every surface, The Greens serves great coffee and lunch options, and keeps some spaces laptop-free (which I love despite always coming there with the intentions of productivity).
Its loft feature might be the icing on the cake of this adorably lush space, but nothing beats the rotating selection of plants that accompany you on every visit.
Neukölln’s coziest cafe! The atmosphere in Leuchstoff evokes a neighborly familiarity — welcoming, in progress, and glowingly warm. Chock-full of vintage seats and plywood tables, the main room’s overhanging loft seats customers on a couch only a few feet away from the ceiling. Not for the tall.
Their coffee is some of the best I’ve had in Berlin, and the rich touches of their signature blue grace signs across the cafe, looking wonderfuly quaint in the (rare) winter sunlight. Read a newspaper, work on your laptop, chat with friends on a cramped couch, Leuchstoff makes me yearn for a shorter commute to Neukölln.
Another cozy hit, Cafe Odor makes you feel like you know the owners well after descending its short staircase from street level. Once inside, the Harvard library-esque green lamps, the cozy seats, and the adorable dog perched in the corner place an unrivaled sense of calm over the room.
Along with the best matcha I’ve had in the city, founders Dani and Heo can offer you an assortment of small treats be it rosemary-topped carrot cake, matcha bread, sandwiches. While the two South Korean founders put a sense of distinctly Korean aesthetics into their edible offerings, the cafe’s environment is entirely its own: cozy, sweet, serene.
Whew, consumerism was getting a little worried it would be left out of this list! Worry not, because Berlin’s eclectic, individual, stereotypically grunge, anything-but-German style has to come from somewhere.
Like many cities in Europe — or honestly anywhere except the US — flea markets boast stalls and streets overflowing with treasures of all kinds. Berlin’s flea market scene is astounding, exhausting. Its curated vintage shops offer a refuge from the bustle of markets, but tend to lack their anonymity and charm. Buckle up for bargaining or hum along to the German music agonizingly well dressed teens play in shops.
No household name recognition like its famous counterpart Mauerpark, RAW flea market is its own beast. You could easily spend hours wandering the seemingly endless stalls which mix professional vendors with kids selling their old clothes, the occasional vintage-influencer, and artists. Food is easy to grab too, because you’ll be gone so long hunger is destined to strike.
I’ve snagged a handful of treasures here — some great deals and a few less great, but all trophies of a Sunday activity that makes you feel, well, cool.
Less established than large park fleas, Maybachufer is a street in Kreuzberg along the Spree with a food market that takes place during the weekdays and flea markets on weekends. Another gathering of community where neighborhood residents line the cobblestones with their possessions adjacent to the food stalls and coffee carts.
Nothing beats a 1 Euro bin from a Berliner with copious amounts of tattoos after grabbing a croissant or vegan donut at one of the many and popular nearby cafes.
A blast from the past if I’ve ever seen one, VEB Orange brings East Germany to vivid color with authentic items from the GDR. Clothes, kitchenware, sewing supplies, household items, cards, and almost everything you can think of with color-blocked 70’s patterns is crammed on their shelves. On my favorite street in Berlin, this spot is worth a visit whether you come away with a souvenier or not. The counter-top cat (a real one, not from the GDR) adds to the cuteness of an overly crowded room.
My favorite store in the city, this multi-level art heaven has every creative material I can dream of, and doesn’t help to keep money in my pocket. Walking around with no project on hand is as legitimate as any endeavor, and the adjoining bookshop cafe might extend your visit. Their supplies strike wonder into my heart every time I walk out of the U-Bahn 8 and up their steps.
Just as much of a sight as a shop, the Berlin charity shops of Humana are not few and far between. The one on Frankfurter Tor however, is 5 stories tall. With more floors than you’ll ever need, the shop has got it all.
Alexander Platz’s Humana doesn’t rival in size, but its contents have never let me down — in fact the opposite. While locals frequent Humana, it can be a tad bit pricier than the even more locally-frequented ReSales. Worth a shot if you want to see how much stuff this world really has!
There’s not much to say on Soul & Style except that their 4 locations are full of nicley curated but approachable clothes and accessories. Priced accordingly, you won’t find the same deals as flea markets, but they’re worth a browse if you want cool and unique pieces or have something particular in mind.
I rarely find myself in Berlin’s northern district of Wedding, but one of its truly hidden gems is Bar Henriette. The flat, conjoined walls of the surrounding flats disguise the soft glow from Henriette’s windows as nothing other than a home on a winter night. But when you’re in front of it, the candles emanating from wine bottles and the consistent moody glow draw you immediately in.
Quiet and comfortable, their drinks are affordable, house specials picked with care, and the atmosphere restores years to one’s life that may have been lost in the endurance-sport that is Berlin clubbing. Grab a bottle of wine and you can easily spend hours sinking into their chairs as if it were your own living room.
Cafe by day, bar by night, An Einem Sonntag Im August is well known for good reason. With tiered step-seating, couches, and tables, the interior blends seamlessly from day to night as lights switch off. The cocktails are just as good as the fresh tees and coffee and the bustle all week long does nothing to detract from the intimate feelings wherever you sit. When the weather is warm, outdoor seating and bench swings host you under awnings, giving the best people watching view in Prenzlauer Berg.
Pub culture in Berlin is harder to find than you might think. Real Kneipes are all the better for it. While dive bar culture provides a night of fun in its own right, Shurke’s small space gives you the feel for a Kneipe that I fear may be slipping from Berlin’s landscape.
If there’s no space, move on! But if you find a spot to rest, the air is cloudy, the beer is German, and the energy is classic.
A recent recommendation brought me to Mano unsuccsesfully. Even the slanted hallway with old wooden auditorium seats smashed against the wall was crowded. Next time around we were lucky enough to land a little nook by the window, which required a step up above the lower seating and a pretzel-maneuver to sit comfortably. But the small details in this place from the tree-loft area in the main room to the delicious house cocktails and well worn pillows made this an instant favorite.
There are some aspects of cities that don’t necessarily fill a typical “activity” slot, but end up being the best ways to spend your time. A few of my favorite pastimes, for Sundays when the markets are closed so you can’t (and shouldn’t) do your grocery run; for when it’s raining and cabin fever strikes; or when the weather is grey and something needs to happen.
Airport turned public space, Tempelhofer Feld is my favorite place in Berlin. Rich in history and contemporary activity, Tempelhof information could fill a thesis project.
Go for a run, bike, walk, skate, rollerblade, or wind-sport (yes — an entire green is dedicated to wind sports), and find a community doing the same, usually with music, too! Check out the art mini-golf course or the kids carnival area, read the historical tour plaques, admire the real airplane on display in the center, or walk through the community gardens. Start with a coffee and pastry at a nearby cafe and find a spot to picnic near the bird-breeding grounds, apple tree cultivation, or sheep grazing when it’s the season.
Nothing is so exceptional as this urban oasis, smack dab in the center of Berlin, bordering more than three neighborhoods and connecting a city through recreation.
Off the otherwise unremarkable area of S-Bahnhof Bellevue, Park am Präsidentendreieck is a fantastic place to soak up any rare piece of Berlin sun by the water. Or pick up a paddle at the public ping-pong tables and reignite a competitive fervor only found in Kita playgrounds.
While I continue to note nearly every worthy location I visit in Berlin, I’m haunted by the knowledge that I’ll forever be missing endless experiences in this wide city. Here’s to four more months of exploration!

Berlin is a big city. Of course, compared to Beijing, Tokyo, London, or New York, it is not intimidating at all. But still, by German standard, it is pretty huge.
A friend of mine once told me that Berlin is pretty big because its tourist sites are scattered across the city, and they can be far away from one another. Indeed, no tourist would try to walk from The Brandenburg Gate to East Side Gallery since, according to Google Map, it takes around one hour.
Another friend argued that Berlin is big, and that is why it can host so many gigantic things; big streets (e.g. Straße des 17. Juni and Karl-Marx-Allee), large parks (e.g. Tiergarten and Tempelhofer Feld), huge buildings (e.g. Berliner Fernsehturm and Berliner Schloss), just to name a few.

Berlin has a complex history that has significantly shaped its urban landscape and development. As the capital of Germany, it has experienced monumental shifts over the centuries—transforming from a Prussian capital into a divided city during the Cold War and now into one of Europe’s most dynamic and modern cities. What makes Berlin so captivating is how its infrastructure and urban planning tell the story of a city constantly rebuilding and reinventing itself.
Berlin’s modern identity is rooted in a unique combination of historical events and urban resilience. Initially, Berlin was a modest settlement along the River Spree, but it gradually became a trade center during the Middle Ages. By the 18th century, Berlin had become the capital of Prussia, a major European power, and it underwent significant development under the rule of Frederick the Great. However, it wasn’t until the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century that Berlin truly began to transform into a major European metropolis. Factories, railroads, and grand boulevards like Unter den Linden were constructed, making Berlin a vital economic and cultural hub.

On the 21st of March, 2025, I had the pleasure of exploring the magnificent collection displayed at the Gemäldegalerie. What follows is a selection of paintings that deeply resonated with me, each accompanied by descriptions carefully crafted from my personal impressions, research, and understanding of the artwork. The photographs included were taken by me during this inspiring visit, capturing the ambiance and visual depth of the exhibition. Art, for me, has always been a dialogue between the artist, the canvas, and the observer. I invite you to join me on this journey and hope these reflections offer a window into both the artists’ intentions and my own interpretations.

In an extraordinary cultural collaboration, Berlin’s Gemäldegalerie presents “From Odesa to Berlin,” an exhibition showcasing 60 remarkable European paintings evacuated from the Museum of Western and Eastern Art in Odesa, Ukraine. These artworks, spanning from the 16th to the 19th century, escaped the devastating impacts of war to find temporary refuge in Berlin.
This exhibition is more than a display of artistic masterpieces — it symbolizes solidarity with Ukraine during a challenging historical moment. Each painting not only reveals Odesa’s rich and often overlooked cultural heritage but also sparks meaningful dialogues when paired with related pieces from Berlin’s own collections.
Established in 1924, the Odesa Museum holds a trove of significant artworks that resonate deeply with European art traditions, featuring celebrated artists like Frans Hals, Bernardo Strozzi, and Francesco Granacci. Now, for the first time, these Ukrainian-held masterpieces are introduced on a large scale to audiences in Germany, offering fresh insights into shared histories and common artistic threads between Eastern and Western Europe.
Organized around nine thematic chapters, the exhibition invites visitors to discover the striking connections between artworks from Odesa and their Berlin counterparts. Through carefully curated juxtapositions, the exhibition provides illuminating encounters and reveals the depth and diversity of Ukrainian-held European art.
Curated by Sabine Lata and Dagmar Hirschfelder of the Gemäldegalerie, with meticulous conservational oversight by Anja Lindner-Michael and Thuja Seidel, “From Odesa to Berlin” is an essential exhibition that underscores the power of art to foster unity, raise awareness, and protect cultural identity amid conflict.
Amidst the unfolding conflict in Ukraine, extraordinary measures were undertaken to safeguard Odesa’s cultural heritage. The Odesa Museum of Western and Eastern Art, located in a historical palace dating back to the 19th century near the iconic Transfiguration Cathedral — partially damaged by Russian air raids — faced severe threats. Immediately following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, volunteers and museum staff rapidly mobilized, fortifying the museum palace with sandbags and meticulously packing the most valuable artworks. Around 80 masterpieces were evacuated to an emergency storage center within Ukraine. Documenting this urgent rescue, the exhibited photographs, taken between March and May 2022, poignantly illustrate the lengths taken to protect culture and history amidst the devastation of war.
There have been a lot of paintings which have been brought to Berlin, I’ll show some of them.
This compelling portrait by Johann Baptist von Lampi the Elder depicts Joseph de Ribas, a notable admiral in the Russian Navy of Neapolitan and Catalan heritage. Painted around 1796, it captures De Ribas shortly after he played a pivotal role in Russia’s capture of the Ottoman fortress of Khadjibey, leading directly to the founding of modern-day Odesa in 1794 under Catherine II’s reign. De Ribas’ significant legacy endures in Odesa, where a main street still bears his name. Yet, amid contemporary geopolitical tensions arising from Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, there have been discussions — though no final decision — regarding the renaming of this iconic street. This artwork thus not only highlights a key historical figure but also symbolizes the complex interplay between art, history, and contemporary identity.
Rendered with subtle grace and delicate realism, Rinaldo Boldrini’s Portrait of Emilia Boldrini (1857) captures the quiet dignity and elegance of its sitter, Emilia Boldrini. The artist, active primarily in Bologna, later became a key figure in Odesa’s cultural scene, co-founding the Society of Fine Arts in 1865. Emilia, a renowned opera prima donna, toured Odesa in 1848, where she married and spent a significant chapter of her life. The painting poignantly reflects her serene beauty and refined posture, suggesting the strength and vulnerability of her personal journey. Tragically, Emilia returned to Bologna in 1852 and soon after lost her voice, abruptly ending her distinguished opera career. Thus, this portrait not only encapsulates a refined example of 19th-century portraiture but also resonates deeply with personal narrative and cultural exchange between Italy and Ukraine.
Thomas Lawrence’s dynamic portrait of Count Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov captures the complexity and charisma of one of Odesa’s most influential historical figures. Vorontsov, a Russian count raised in London, served as Governor-General of New Russia based in Odesa. Under his administration, Odesa flourished culturally and economically, deepening its ties with Western Europe. Lawrence, famed for his vivid brushwork and expressive characterization, portrays Vorontsov with an air of dignity and command, his confident posture and refined attire emphasizing his significant role. Yet Vorontsov’s legacy is not without controversy: as commander-in-chief during Russia’s colonial wars in the Caucasus, his reputation today carries critical reflections. Lawrence’s portrait thus invites viewers to contemplate not only the grandeur of Vorontsov’s contributions to Odesa but also the complicated moral legacies that historical figures inevitably embody.
In Virgin and Child (1903), Finnish painter Albert Edelfelt beautifully combines spiritual intimacy with everyday simplicity. Known for his interest in depicting rural Finnish life, Edelfelt reinterprets the traditional religious motif by portraying the Mother of God as a humble young peasant woman, tenderly cradling her child. Soft, bluish daylight enters through the window on the left, harmoniously contrasting with the warm orange glow from an unseen fireplace. This interplay between cool and warm illumination symbolizes the profound mystery of Christ’s incarnation, merging divinity with human vulnerability. Edelfelt’s subtle use of color and gentle brushwork imbues the painting with a comforting serenity, capturing the viewer in a moment of quiet contemplation.
This evocative devotional painting from around 1520, inspired by Gerard David, powerfully captures the profound sorrow of the Virgin Mary mourning the loss of her son, Jesus. Characterized by its close-up intimacy, the artwork invites viewers to engage deeply and empathetically with Mary’s grief. The detailed emotional portrayal enhances the spiritual experience, compelling viewers to contemplate the shared humanity and divine significance of Christ’s suffering. Originating as one of the most reproduced devotional compositions in the early 16th century, this Odesa painting exemplifies the influential artistic legacy of Gerard David. Its emotional intensity was influential enough to inspire subsequent Netherlandish artists to adapt and expand upon the motif, reinforcing its enduring resonance across European religious art.
This exquisite altarpiece from 1519 by Francesco Granacci beautifully captures the stylistic influences of his close friend Michelangelo. Granacci, who studied alongside Michelangelo in Domenico Ghirlandaio’s workshop in Florence, frequently took inspiration from Michelangelo’s drawings, a fact evident in this depiction of the Madonna. Here, the Virgin Mary, enthroned gracefully, exudes serene majesty, while the Christ child gently blesses the viewer. On either side stand John the Baptist, shown humbly in contemplation, and the Archangel Michael, radiating quiet strength. Granacci’s delicate colors and carefully balanced composition speak to the high Renaissance ideals of harmony and humanist beauty. This masterpiece from Odesa provides a remarkable example of artistic dialogue between Renaissance masters and serves as a testament to the significant cultural treasures preserved through Ukraine’s challenging times.
This tender depiction of the Virgin Mary with the Christ Child, created in the Southern Netherlands (likely Bruges) after 1567, beautifully illustrates the enduring emotional and devotional appeal of this classical motif. Inspired by a celebrated composition by Rogier van der Weyden dating from around 1450, the painting captures a touching moment of intimacy as the standing Christ child lovingly embraces his mother. The floral background, abundant with roses symbolizing purity and divine love, accentuates the emotional warmth and spirituality of the scene. Inscribed below is the phrase “Virgo salutiferi plena favoris ave” (“Hail Mary, full of salvific grace”), drawn from a prayer printed in 1567, emphasizing Mary’s role as a compassionate and grace-filled intercessor. This popular devotional image, replicated extensively throughout Europe, highlights the deep spiritual resonance and lasting influence of Northern Renaissance art traditions.
In this compelling late-18th-century depiction of Saint Jerome, Giuseppe Antonio Pianca vividly portrays the revered ascetic in deep contemplation. Set within the isolation of a dark, mysterious forest, Saint Jerome’s muscular yet weary form suggests a life of rigorous self-denial and spiritual introspection. Pianca masterfully uses chiaroscuro — intense contrasts of light and shadow — to accentuate the saint’s meditative expression and rugged physique. The presence of a human skull symbolizes Jerome’s reflection on the transience of earthly life, while the rosary and crucifix embody hope for spiritual salvation through faith and devotion. Pianca’s dramatic interpretation invites viewers into a profound meditation on mortality, devotion, and redemption, making it a powerful exemplar of religious painting from the Odesa Museum collection.
In this gripping depiction attributed to Antonino Alberti, known as Barbalonga, the dramatic biblical event known as the Massacre of the Innocents is portrayed with intense emotional energy and raw realism. Painted between 1623 and 1649, the work vividly captures the frantic desperation of mothers as they struggle to shield their children from brutal assailants following King Herod’s ruthless decree. Barbalonga’s dramatic composition and dynamic movement amplify the chaotic violence and profound anguish of the scene, drawing viewers into a moment charged with fear, sorrow, and tension. Beyond its religious significance, this powerful canvas poignantly resonates with contemporary themes of violence, loss, and human suffering, serving as a striking reminder of the enduring relevance and emotional impact of historical artworks.
In this vivid and dynamic 16th-century work from Jacopo Bassano’s workshop, myth and pastoral life intertwine seamlessly. The painting depicts the abduction of the Phoenician princess Europa by Zeus, who famously takes the form of a white bull. Yet, typical of Bassano’s distinctive approach, this mythological drama unfolds within the charming simplicity of an everyday pastoral scene. Richly detailed figures, animals, and objects imbue the narrative with a sense of realism and immediacy, bridging the divide between divine myth and human experience. The striking interplay of shadow and vibrant colors heightens the dramatic tension, while the careful attention to rural elements grounds the ancient myth firmly within the tangible textures of 16th-century life. This remarkable piece from the Odesa Museum’s collection exemplifies Bassano’s talent for bringing classical stories to life through vivid storytelling and meticulous observation of daily life.
Annunciation to the Shepherds, 17th century (Unknown painter, after Abraham Bloemaert) and Adoration of the Shepherds, c.1604, Abraham Bloemaert
This pairing of remarkable paintings illustrates the rich artistic dialogue of the early 17th century. The first artwork from Odesa, attributed to an unknown artist, vividly portrays the biblical Annunciation to the Shepherds and closely mirrors a detailed 1599 engraving by Jan Pietersz. Saenredam based on an original by Abraham Bloemaert. Its vibrant colors and dynamic composition suggest direct familiarity with Bloemaert’s original work, now lost. Complementing this, the Adoration of the Shepherds (c.1604) by Abraham Bloemaert himself showcases his characteristic clarity and rich coloration. Both paintings exhibit Bloemaert’s profound influence, highlighting his importance as a central figure in the Utrecht artistic tradition. Together, these works not only explore a cherished biblical theme but also provide insight into how compositions traveled, were adapted, and influenced artists across Europe.
This lively painting, dating from around 1700, portrays Hercules, the legendary hero known for his extraordinary strength, in a surprisingly vulnerable moment. Following the original composition by Peter Paul Rubens — created for his own Antwerp residence — Hercules is depicted here struggling with the effects of excessive wine consumption. Barely able to stand, the mighty demigod relies upon a satyr and a nymph for support, highlighting a stark contrast between heroic strength and human fragility. The rich colors and dynamic forms reflect Rubens’ distinctive style, full of movement, energy, and emotion. Notably, this interpretation, previously held in the Odesa Museum, exemplifies the widespread influence and enduring popularity of Rubens’ mythological compositions, bridging the gap between classical ideals and the human condition.
In this captivating portrait from the 1630s, Utrecht artist Abraham Bloemaert presents a deeply expressive portrayal of an elderly woman. Characteristic of Bloemaert’s work during this period, the painting belongs to a genre known as tronies — studies of heads or busts not meant as formal portraits but rather as explorations of human expression and character. Painted after living models, these pieces often depict older individuals in modest attire, emphasizing realism and emotional depth over social status. Bloemaert’s Old Woman embodies this approach, her lined face gently illuminated against muted colors, revealing subtle textures and a contemplative presence. The piece not only showcases the artist’s technical mastery but also reflects broader trends in Dutch art, influenced by Rembrandt and his circle, highlighting the dignity and quiet beauty found in everyday humanity.
Portrait of a Man (1660s)
The male portrait from Odesa is comparable to Dutch portraits of naval officers from the 1660s and 1670s. The probably carved wooden handle of the weapon attached to the sitter’s belt resembles that of a kris, a Javanese dagger. The man’s large eyes are reminiscent of portraits by Jan de Bray, who was considered the most important portrait painter in Haarlem during the second half of the 17th century. A similar type of face and hairstyle can also be found in the Berlin portrait of a Haarlem priest, also attributed to Jan de Bray.
This work captures the essence of Dutch portraiture, emphasizing dignity and character through detailed depiction of clothing and weaponry, hinting at the subject’s rank or profession.
St. Luke, depicted by Hals, was originally part of a series representing the four Evangelists. The half-length figures of these Evangelists show similarities to Hals’s genre paintings from the mid-1620s. St Luke’s typical attribute, a bull, blends into the painting’s background, becoming visible only upon closer inspection.
Hals is known for his vivid, lifelike portrayal of figures, characterized by dynamic brushwork and naturalistic details. This work exemplifies his style, showing a contemplative and introspective Luke engaged in writing his gospel.
The 18th painting is titled “Rest of the Comedians,” created in the 1730s by Alessandro Magnasco. It is an oil on canvas painting previously housed in the Odesa Museum of Western and Eastern Art.
In this artwork, Magnasco portrays a diverse group of soldiers, mothers with small children, and comedians assembled under dimly lit arcades. Alessandro Magnasco is recognized as one of Italy’s most original genre painters of the 18th century. He is notable for his distinctive, imaginative style and his ability to depict eccentric scenes, often centered around the marginalized segments of society such as outlaws and vagabonds. His paintings have thematic similarities with contemporary Spanish picaresque novels.
My personal favourite because of the use of colours and shadows, the painting “Winter Landscape,” created by Andreas Achenbach in 1859, beautifully captures a serene winter scene bathed in soft, silvery evening light. At the heart of this tranquil landscape lies a frozen pond on which figures can be seen skating, depicting the leisurely activities typical of a winter’s day. Surrounding the pond, snow-covered houses and structures nestle comfortably amid tall, dark evergreens, contributing to the painting’s intimate, cozy atmosphere.
Achenbach’s careful handling of light imbues the entire scene with a gentle luminescence, highlighting both the delicate texture of the snow and the reflective surface of the ice. The composition’s detailed realism is reminiscent of Dutch painting from the 17th century, yet it also evokes a distinctly Nordic ambiance, influenced by the artist’s travels to Norway and Sweden.
The painting exemplifies Achenbach’s status as a key figure of the Düsseldorf school, celebrated for landscapes that combine precise naturalism with poetic atmosphere, capturing moments of quiet beauty and contemplation in nature.
“The Coachmen’s Quarrel,” painted by Jules-Alexis Muenier in 1893, vividly portrays a dramatic and violent incident set against the scenic backdrop of a sunny day along the Côte d’Azur. The painting starkly contrasts the serene beauty of nature, with rugged mountains, lush greenery, and tranquil waters in the background, against the shocking human drama unfolding at its center.
In the foreground, two men are depicted on a bright, open road. One man stands assertively, holding a knife, clearly the aggressor who has just committed an act of violence. His expression is intense and resolute. At his feet lies the victim, sprawled helplessly on the ground, conveying the brutal aftermath of their confrontation.
Muenier employs a broad perspective with exaggerated depth, placing the attacker at the compositional center, which emphasizes the tension and gravity of the scene. This approach intensifies the narrative, bringing a stark and haunting contrast between the vibrancy of the sunlit setting and the gravity of the violent act, encapsulating a poignant and powerful moment of tragedy.
Gabriel von Max’s painting “Light!” from the early 1870s portrays a deeply evocative and spiritual scene set against a simplistic yet symbolically rich backdrop. At the focal point of the canvas is a young blind Christian woman dressed in pure white, a color signifying innocence and spiritual purity. She is depicted seated gracefully on a stone bench, calmly offering a small burning oil lamp towards an unseen recipient, symbolizing the spreading of Christian enlightenment.
To her side lies a collection of similar oil lamps, each softly glowing and illuminating her serene features. In front of her feet rest palm branches, poignant symbols foreshadowing her martyrdom. Behind her, partially hidden in the shadows of a doorway, stands a beggar woman, quietly observing the scene — an element adding a sense of intrigue and quiet reflection to the painting.
Gabriel von Max’s thoughtful use of light accentuates the tranquility and gravity of the narrative, underlining the historical context of Christian persecution implied in this scene. The overall mood is both gentle and deeply symbolic, effectively communicating themes of faith, sacrifice, and spiritual illumination.
In “Sunny Day” (1895), Emile Claus captures a delicate moment of tranquility, perfectly illustrating the essence of Belgian Luminism — a style emphasizing the subtle interplay of light and atmosphere. The painting portrays a peaceful, rural landscape bathed in warm, radiant sunlight. A flock of geese calmly moves along a grassy path toward the viewer, drawing attention to the serene pond in the background, which softly reflects the sky and surrounding foliage. Claus masterfully employs gentle brushstrokes and harmonious, pastel-like colors, creating an atmosphere of quiet beauty and contemplative calm. The painting resonates with a tender observation of nature’s rhythms, inviting viewers to pause and appreciate the simple elegance of the natural world.
Visiting the Gemäldegalerie was more than just viewing art; it was a moment of profound connection and inspiration. I left with a renewed appreciation for these masterpieces and their timeless ability to speak across generations. Thank you for accompanying me on this artistic exploration — I hope it encourages you to experience these wonderful works in person.

I’d been living in Berlin for almost a year before I managed to write about why I chose to give up my life in Canada to start anew in the German capital. I’d moved here in June 2011 and months later, found myself without words or an ability to share what was a very personal story. I’d typed dozens of drafts but felt none of them ever seemed fit for publishing. I guess I needed more time to realize why I’d really moved here and what exactly it meant to me.
Finally, the day came when I ended the suspense by sharing why I moved to Berlin in the first place.
Some people move to Berlin to be part of the city’s creative community, others to work at a startup, while some come for love, and many simply, for the hedonistic party and clubbing lifestyle.
My story’s much more different. I moved here never having visited the city, completely alone, without a job, and not knowing a word of German.
From the outside looking in, my life in Toronto seemed like a really good one. I was lucky enough to have close friends, an amazing apartment, and a job that paid well. I kept busy by playing sports, taking classes, and going to events and parties. I traveled a few times a year and did awe inspiring things like cruise the Galapagos Islands and hike the Inca Trail in Peru.
What most people didn’t know was that I was deeply unhappy. I loathed my job. I was ashamed I didn’t have a steady boyfriend, never mind a husband or children. I felt guilty for not being able to appreciate what I had. To be honest, I didn’t feel deserving of my good life. I cried each day, regularly had full blown panic attacks, and suffered from unrelenting insomnia. I was tired and drained all of time and even though I didn’t realize it yet, was sinking into a deep depression.
I was in complete denial of my depression for a very long time.
A lot of traumatic things had transpired in the decade leading up to that time of my life:
I’d married an abusive man, only to get divorced a year and half later. It had been devastating, as he’d been unfaithful and never once showed any regret. I’d also been pregnant and when he found out, he pressured me into having an unwanted abortion. When he left, he immediately moved in with his new girlfriend as if our seven years together meant nothing. Our parting was the best thing that ever happened me and my life immediately improved when he left, but I never once took the time to process what damage the relationship had done to my well being.
Just a couple of years later, I found out my father broke his 20+ years of sobriety. Things went downhill pretty fast from there and it got to the point, that every time the phone rang, I would collapse into a panicked state. The phone calls never meant anything good. He was either in the hospital from overdosing, getting picked up by the police for public drunkenness, and once, even arrested for driving under the influence. These events continued for quite a while until one weekend when I went home to visit him and my sister and I found him dead on the kitchen floor. As much as I’d been expecting something like that happen, there isn’t too many things as devastating as finding your father’s decaying body. I’ve never been able to get the image out of my head, or even the smell.
As if his death wasn’t enough, my siblings and I had to take care of my dad’s estate which involved a lot of work and stress. My sister and I ended up taking on the bulk of the responsibilities, a huge burden to say in the least. To make matters worse, no of the kids could agree on anything and what followed, was two years of pointless arguments and disputes. When it was over, one of my sister’s stopped talking to the entire family.
During that time, we also had to care for my elderly grandmother who was dying from Alzheimer’s. She ended up passing away just one year after my dad did. Even though it sounds wild and totally unbelievable, when we arrived at the cemetery for her burial, we discovered that they’d dug up the wrong grave site, my dad’s grave site! Trying to cover up their mistake, the grave diggers had carelessly tossed my dad’s cremated remains into the forest adjacent to the cemetery. My family and I had to comb through piles of dirt to find them and on the day we were supposed to bury my grandmother, we had to rebury my father as well.
So much insanity in such a short time would challenge the best of us, but I kept going by avoiding any and all opportunities to face the enormity of all of those life events by all means possible. I played sports, took classes, went to parties, and threw myself into work — just so I could keep busy and avoid checking myself into a mental hospital.
In 2005, I’d bought a house with the proceeds from my divorce. It was an investment property, as I purposely bought in a developing area so I could sell at a profit later on. Five years later, I did exactly that, leaving with a very handsome amount. Around the time I sold my place, I was also laid off from work and scored a decent settlement package.
It was the perfect chance to take a sabbatical and figure out what I really wanted from life. I could breathe and not worry about things for a while, perhaps finding the happiness that’d always eluded me. I ended up taking nearly two years off of work and spent the time being a lady of leisure, a champion lady of leisure actually. I slept in, got day drunk, watched countless reruns of Golden Girls, took cooking classes, and most importantly traveled. And once I started, I couldn’t stop.
A woman previously obsessed with South America, I finally decided to give Europe a chance. Figuring there was no better place to start than Italy, I ended up having my best vacation ever. It was then I felt free, happy, and joyous for the very first time ever in my life. I lost count of how many times I cried simply because it felt so surreal, to be there in a place I’d always dreamed of visiting and to feel happiness that I still didn’t feel I deserved. The new emotions overwhelmed me, but it became some kind of natural high I started to chase.
Upon arriving home, I ate and drank Italian food and wine at every opportunity, enrolled in language classes, and even vowed that someday I’d move there. I took comfort in dreaming about what life abroad would be like and indulged in silly movies like Under The Tuscan Sun for inspiration.
Not wanting to stay away from my new love for long, I returned to Europe again for Christmas to do a tour through Munich, Prague, Bratislava, Budapest, and Vienna. To be honest, I’d low expectations for the trip and thought there was no way that Italy experience could ever be topped. To my surprise, the Christmas tour turned out to be even better than I ever could’ve imagined. One cold snow filled night, as I walked across the Charles Bridge in Prague, I suddenly just “knew”. I was someday going to make that big move abroad to Europe. Not only did I want to do it, but more importantly, I knew I could do it.
Those trips were pivotal for a few reasons. First, it solidified the fact that I loved the continent. The happiness of that first trip was repeated with the second. Second, I discovered there was more to Europe than Italy and I knew I’d be happy living almost anywhere. I started thinking about Germany, France, and even Spain. Third, I felt a new and very surprising confidence that it was something that I could really do on my own.
The new year arrived and so did a new job in Toronto. The adjustment back into being employed was not gentle and again, I found myself feeling completely and utterly miserable. The honeymoon was over and I wondered what had really changed. Even though I still planned to move, I hadn’t taken any concrete actions to make my dreams a reality. I felt stuck and didn’t know how to move forward.
Then while in Cuba on vacation three months later, I received a call from my landlord announcing that they were putting my flat up for sale and public viewings would start the very next day. At first I was deeply upset with the news but then realized this was the time and a perfect opportunity. I decided right then and there I’d move to Europe. I cancelled my vacation and flew back to Toronto the very next day so I could start the process.
Just a few weeks later, I quit my job, gave my landlord notice, and applied for a working holiday visa in Germany. Without it being approved, I sold all of my possessions, booked a one way flight to Berlin, and secured a holiday apartment in Prenzlauer Berg. I was finally ready to move to Berlin.
After I put the wheels into motion, everything happened really fast. I was so busy taking care of details, I barely had time to think about what I was doing and one day, the enormity of all suddenly hit me. I was ending my way of life as I knew it and had no idea what the future held. I didn’t have any real plans except to try and make my blog successful, get to know Berlin, and see as much of Europe as I could. I knew it was possible (even likely?), I’d fail miserably and would have to come home. I made sure I had enough money to last about six months.
I was scared, exhilarated, and stressed but mostly, excited.
Saying my farewells was the single hardest thing I had to do and it wasn’t without tears. I had to bid adieu to some of the best friends in the world and of course, my family. It finally got to the point during my last week in Toronto where it was all getting to be too much and all I wanted to do was hop on the plane. Time was dragging by much too slowly and I was ready to start my life with a vengeance.
Reactions to my big announcement were mixed. While most expressed their support and wished me well, others weren’t so kind. Some were jealous, worried, and even thought I was crazy (which I now realize I was!).
These were just some of the comments — “Are you experiencing a midlife crisis?”, “You’re so naive. You’ll never succeed at travel writing. It’s not really a profession.”, “You need to grow up.”, “Aren’t you taking the whole Eat, Pray, Love thing a little too far?” “I’d do the same if I didn’t have a mortgage, spouse or children.”
While some of the concern was certainly warranted, the narrow mindedness of some people also shocked me. How can you not be thrilled for someone who wants to embark on a new adventure? I wondered, how couldn’t they see what I saw? The possibilities, the potential, the chance for true happiness.
As expected, everyone asked me why I was moving to Berlin. I’m still asked this question on a regular basis and still find it a hard one to answer.
I can’t really narrow it down to just one reason. My answers varied but went something like this:
It wasn’t at all because I watched this amazing video.
Of course, there are usually more questions:
“Do you have a job in Berlin?” I didn’t have a job when I first arrived.
“Do you speak German?” I didn’t know any German outside of bier, kindergarten, and scheisse but planned to take classes. I quickly become quite good at saying “Mein Deutsch ist nicht so gut.” to get through daily situations.
“Have you ever been to Berlin?” No. Based on the advice of two girls I met in Cuba and a friend that had lived in the city previously, I chose to live in Berlin as opposed to Munich, Hamburg, or Frankfurt.
“Are you moving there for a man?” Nope. Although the idea of dating fashionable, well educated, multilingual men who watched movies with subtitles was definitely appealing.
“Do you hate Toronto?” I didn’t hate Toronto. It was just time for a new beginning. I’ll always consider it home.
Did it work out? Yes, and no. Shortly after my arrival, a fellow newly arrived Berliner remarked to me over late night beers, “I don’t know whether you’re fucking brilliant or fucking crazy, but you certainly have balls.” Now that I look back, I admit that I may have been just that but I harbour absolutely no regrets.
I ended up staying in Berlin for 18 months. While there were plenty of ups and downs, moving to Berlin was one of the best decisions I’d ever made. Unfortunately, those downs caught up with up me with untenable work and relationship situations, so I took the very right decision to go back to Canada to figure things out.
It was also another opportunity to make myself feel grounded myself again and take stock about what I wanted from life. It didn’t take me long to realize that I missed Berlin a lot and I soon began plotting my way back. After two years in Canada, I returned in November 2014 and have been here ever since.
A decade later in 2021, I sometimes still find myself astonished that I’ve been in Berlin for all of this time. I’ll admit that I have moments where the urge to go back to Canada has been strong, most especially at the beginning of the pandemic.
Looking back, I can really see in the years following those traumatic events I discussed above, I took every possible action to avoid confronting my emotions. While I thought travelling around the world and moving to Berlin made me happy, I also realize that this was only furthering my escapist behaviour.
Following my move back here, I fell into bad habits like smoking and drinking, partying, and excessive travel. My happiness was superficial and even though there were plenty of fun-filled moments along the way, my unhappiness and depression only deepened, and as time went by those cracks only became more open and exposed. The depression was always lingering there, just under the surface, ready to bubble up and explode at a moment’s notice.
Then the pandemic came and I hit rock bottom, fast and hard. The lockdown, uncertainty surrounding my job, being so far away from home, and completely alone was just too much. While I’m still not so ready to write about that whole experience, I can say that I was in really, really, really bad shape.
Thanks to support from plenty of cool people who spent time with me on video calls, understanding doctors, a sympathetic employer, and regular therapy, life looks much differently than it did before. I’ve put absolutely everything into bettering my well being. I quit smoking, found a new job, and managed tough events like losing my grandmother and cat in the same week. The panic attacks have stopped (for now), I’m off of antidepressants, I sleep through the night, and wake up many days with a smile on my face. My life is all the better with the recent arrival of a new rescue cat from Poland, who sports such a thick moustache that I named him after Burt Reynolds.
I (cautiously) say that I may be finally be feeling happy. Something I never thought I’d be able to say with any conviction. While I have a lot of work ahead, I’m in a really good place and look forward to building a much healthier and happier life here in Berlin.

When you walk into my Friedrichshain apartment, there’s a room labeled “Kinderwagen-Rollstuhle” next to the elevator. On the door, a paper reads:
“Only for strollers. Do not use this room for bikes!”
This was my first inkling that Friedrichshain was a neighborhood for more than hipsters and its club scene.
When I first moved to Berlin in 2019, stroller rooms and family policies were the last thing on my mind. My husband and I moved here to live in a big city, travel across Europe, and start a new adventure. As we stayed longer though, more of our friends started popping out pandemic babies. We soon decided to start our family here as well.
Americans love praising Scandinavian countries' utopian family policies. The NY Times recently touted Finland for giving all new parents the same leave, following Sweden’s example. Bringing up Bebe, which explores the differences between American and French child rearing, has become standard pregnancy reading. Achtung Baby is the German equivalent. I also read these books during pregnancy in my quest to glean child-rearing wisdom.
This post is my version: a personal story about my 22 months of pregnancy, birth, postpartum, and parental leave in Berlin. This isn’t a how-to guide, and I’m not promising to confer any wisdom. But I’d like to show what it’s like to live in a city built with both physical and social infrastructure for families, during one of life’s most tender junctures.
At my first appointment with my Frauenartz (OB/GYN), I received a little book called the Mutterpass (Mother’s pass). All the tests and examinations throughout my pregnancy and birth were recorded in it. Although it may seem archaic to bring a paper booklet with you to every appointment, it actually made a lot of sense in practice. During my pregnancy, I received care from a disparate group of doctors and midwives. Instead of transferring electronic medical records, I simply handed over my Mutterpass at the start of each appointment.
Holistic medicine is more widely accepted in Germany and supported by the medical establishment. Like in the US, I went to routine OB/GYN checkups where I would do a urinanalysis, blood pressure check, weigh-in, periodic blood tests, and consultation at each appointment. I did ultrasounds and genetic testing at predetermined weeks. Unlike the US, I also went to a Hebammenpraxis, a midwife clinic.
One of the downsides I experienced with public health insurance was that my OG/GYN was often overbooked and rushed—sometimes my appointments started one to two hours late. But at the Hebammenpraxis, the midwives took their time. They explained each test in my Mutterpass, making sure I understood each result. They also recommended acupuncture and acupressure for my debilitating first trimester nausea. This was all covered by my public health insurance.
I split the costs of my public health insurance with my employer—I pay around €‎440 per month. This is calculated based on your income level. Health insurance is mandatory for everyone living in Germany. Some people pay for private health insurance if they don’t qualify for public, or want greater control of their providers. See here for more details.
My favorite part of the German medical system is the hebamme, a personal midwife. Hebammen are trained medical professionals that can perform examinations on the mother and the baby. They also guide parents through this huge life transition. In Berlin they work hyper-locally — usually only in one neighborhood. My other mom friends advised me to start looking for a hebamme as soon as my pregnancy was confirmed.
Unfortunately there is a shortage of hebammen in Berlin. To find one, I posted in facebook groups, registered for search websites, visited Hebammenpraxes, and asked friends of friends. Finally, by the end of the first trimester I found my match: Mandy.
Mandy only worked in my zip code, and took a handful of new mothers each month. She visited homes by biking from apartment to apartment — sometimes up to 8–10 homes a day! After our initial meeting at the end of my first trimester, we signed a contract. We didn’t talk for a while, and then around week 35, she came for a few home visits. She checked out my baby room and recommended a few items I might need postpartum. She was also available on call if I thought I was going into labor, and could advise me on when to go to the hospital.
In Berlin, you have a couple of options on where to give birth: a hospital, a Geburtshaus (birthing center), or Hausgeburt (home birth). All options are mostly covered by insurance. In birthing centers, you are attended to by a 1-on-1 midwife in a more “home-like” environment. Doctors are not on-site and there is not the option for epidurals or other drugs. At home, a Beleghebamme (personal birthing midwife) supervises your delivery.
I chose to deliver in a hospital because I wanted the option to have an epidural, and probably because of my American tendencies. I registered at Charité Mitte, a top teaching hospital 20 minutes away, where most doctors and nurses spoke English.
Germans believe that all pregnant women are entitled to not only adequate medical care, but also mental and physical preparations for birth. My public health insurance, Die Techniker, reimbursed me for yoga classes and a Geburtsvorbereitungskurs (birth class). Although most couples take a weekly birth class in their neighborhood, we chose a weekend online course because of COVID. It was also challenging to find one in English.
The German system acknowledges that pregnant mothers not only need a physical break, but also a mental break. They respect the experience of pregnancy and motherhood.
In Germany, your maternal leave starts six weeks before your due date, with the statutory maternity leave, called Mutterschutz. During this time, you receive full pay, and are expected to relax and focus on preparing for the baby. At first I wasn’t sure if I wanted to take that much time off. I felt extreme FOMO — worried that I’d miss out on important moments at work.
However, since I’d be paid the same whether I worked or not, I embraced the German benefits and stopped working. I spent the first few weeks off “nesting” — preparing the baby room, washing and sorting hand-me-down clothes, and stocking our freezer. I also tried to stay active by doing prenatal yoga and going for walks with other moms on leave. One of the benefits of longer maternity leaves is that there is a higher likelihood that your friends are also on leave.
After my due date came and went, I went for daily check-ups and CTG (electronic fetal monitor, EFM) scans at my Frauenartz. Five days after my due date, I had a blood test at the hospital and they decided to have me stay to be induced. While I waited for the induction pills to work, I waited in a separate hospital room in the maternity ward.
German hospitals provide a range of equipment to support vaginal deliveries. Charite’s delivery rooms had specialised equipment such as an exercise ball, birthing stools, ropes attached to the ceiling and walls, and adjustable birthing tables. Some even had a bathtub for water delivery. The midwives embrace moving around and changing positions to help the baby “spin” down the birth canal.
I had the fortune of a quiet delivery ward, which allowed a midwife to accompany me the entire time I was in active labor. Oftentimes in a hospital a midwife splits her time between two or three women. One downside of giving birth in a hospital though is that you may need to change midwives mid-delivery. This happened to me 6 hours in. But in the end, I had a positive experience as I liked the different approach of both midwives. I didn’t see a doctor until the very end, just a few minutes before I delivered my baby boy.
Grant was born after 9 hours of labor.
After birth, I stayed in the hospital for 3 days. This allowed us to have Grant’s U2 appointment at the hospital, which needs to happen between the third and tenth day of life in Germany. Similar to US wellness checkups, Germans have a set of preventive medical check-ups from the first day of birth through adolescence.
We were lucky to get a “family room” after birth, where my husband was able to stay with us in his own bed. We were supported by postpartum midwives 24–7, who were just a button press away. Charite doesn’t have that many family rooms though, so most people need to share a room post delivery. Other families choose to leave the hospital as soon as possible, because their hebamme can also support them at home.
The one downside of staying in the hospital was the German food. This was what I was served for dinner on the first night. Yes, that’s a raw tomato in the corner and a large pickled cucumber in the other.
I had heard the hardest trimester isn’t the 3rd, it’s actually the “4th trimester”, otherwise known as postpartum. I was worried about sleepless nights and how my body would recover. But after reading the book “The First Forty Days,” I learned it could be a magical time if you’re prepared and have a strong support system.
The Germans also have a culture of resting after birth called Wochenbett which literally means “weeks in bed.” The new mother is supposed to stay in bed to recover and focus on skin-on-skin and feeding the new baby.
This is actually quite similar to the Chinese tradition of Zuo Yuezi (坐月子), which literally translates to confinement. During this time, new mothers aren’t supposed to leave the house or touch cold water.
My parents came to Berlin for my Zuo Yuezi, and rented an apartment a block from my apartment. My mom made me warm Chinese soups, didn’t let me touch cold water, and helped take care of Grant. I didn’t leave the house for almost 30 days, which wasn’t that hard for me as it was in the middle of winter.
As I mentioned before, my favorite German benefit is the hebamme. My midwife Mandy came the first day we got home, and visited every day for the first few weeks. Each visit started by weighing Grant, tracking his progress to regaining his birth weight. She also checked and cleaned his umbilical cord stub, and showed us how to bathe him once it fell off.
At the beginning she also supported me in breastfeeding: teaching me different positions, helping wake Grant up mid-feed (his breastfeeding persona was a “dinner dozer” / “rester”), and teaching me how to use the pump (which I only used before my supply came in). This was invaluable, as it prevented common breastfeeding problems like mastitis and nipple pain. If I had any major issues, Mandy could have also referred me to a lactation consultant.
Each day, my husband and I would write down all our questions to review with her. Are his hands too hot or too cold? How should we dress him at night? Should we start vitamin D drops? When will he get over his jetlag? Are we doing tummy time right? Is this a normal amount of spit up? I think she single-handedly prevented us from having postpartum anxiety. :)
She also checked on my health — both physical and mental. She asked about my bleeding, checked my stitches, and examined my abs for diastasis recti. It was such a blessing to get maternal care without having to leave the house with a newborn. Oftentimes, there is so much focus on the baby, not on the mother’s recovery. I didn’t feel this way.
All German employees (people with a German employment contract) are entitled to parental leave. There are two concepts: Elternzeit (parental time off) and Elterngeld (parental allowance / money).
In my circle of friends, most mothers took at least a year off — usually until their child went to Kita. This also lines up with how long women are recommended to breastfeed for, about one year. Babies can start drinking cow’s milk after one year of age. I noticed that most fathers took a few weeks off at the start with the mother, and then some weeks later when the baby is older. Many took it during the summer holiday so the whole family could vacation together.
In a bit of a tangent, I’m going to compare Germany’s policy to Sweden’s. Unlike Sweden’s equality focused policy, Germany doesn’t have a minimum number of days each parent must take. In Sweden, their 90 days of “use-it-or-lose-it” time for fathers incentivizes men to take their full parental leave. Sweden also has an “equality bonus” of 50 kr each per day if you share your parental leave equally. This has led more Swedish men to take more paternal leave than other countries, and even created a “latte pappa” culture.
While I was pregnant, we visited our friends in Sweden with a 1 year old. The couple took the first month off together. The mom then took the next 6 months on her own, and then the father took the next 6 months on his own. Leaving the baby with the father made it easier for my friend to go back to work, and helped them establish a more equal division of household and child rearing. In the US, studies have shown that when a baby arrives, working couples no longer share their housework equally, even when they did before (study). This was a pattern I didn’t want us to fall into.
So what did we do? My husband and I both took the first month off. Then I became the primary caregiver from months 2–10, though my husband took off 6 weeks of vacation throughout that time. He also works from home, and was able to support me during the day when needed. He will become primary caregiver when Grant is 10 months, and plans to take at least 3 months of paternity leave. We chose this split because I wanted to take about one year off of work, and because by the time Grant is 10 months he’ll be breastfeeding less and less dependent on me. I also wanted us to both experience being primary caregiver to develop our own parenting styles and build empathy for each other.
The thing I appreciate the most about this experience, is that I had the privilege of going back to work when I was ready. I took a total of 12 months off — something I never would be able to take, or even thought I’d want, in the US. Some moms are ready to return to work after 3 months, and others at 3 years. I didn’t have to choose between being a “stay-at-home-mom” or a “working mom” when I wasn’t ready. And throughout my leave, even though my day to day was being a full time caregiver, I considered myself a UX designer. This is an important part of my identity.
So what did I do with my time?
Not going back to work allowed me to continue breastfeeding on-demand. I didn’t need to pump, though I used the passive Haaka pump to collect extra milk for bottles.
Women in Berlin breastfeed practically everywhere– restaurants, playground, the Ubahn… No one bats an eye!
Around 6–8 weeks after birth, many German women take a Rückbildungskurs to strengthen their pelvic floor. Pregnancy and childbirth can stress, stretch, and weaken the muscles in your pelvic floor and abdomen, which can cause pain and urinary incontinence. Germans don’t wait for a doctor’s diagnosis. Almost all women sign up for a course after their hebamme clears them. In the class, a physiotherapist walks you through a series of breathing and muscle exercises. This is also covered by health insurance.
This can also be a great way to get out of the house with your baby and meet other new moms in the neighborhood. Unfortunately I was only able to find an English course online.
A few months after birth, a social worker contacted us for a home visit. I had never met a social worker before, and wasn’t sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised though! The woman came with a large folder of flyers: lists of pediatricians, local hospitals, family centers, and kitas (day cares). She reassured us that the local town hall could put us on a waitlist for kita (daycare), if we weren’t able to find a spot ourselves. This is a common concern of parents, as kita spots can be notoriously hard to find in Berlin. She also made sure we how to fill out all of the required German paperwork and navigate the bureaucracy.
As Ali Wong said in Hard Knock Wife, “when you’re a new mom on maternity leave it’s like The Walking Dead. You’ve just gotta hook up with a crew to survive.” Neighborhood family centers saved me, and helped me find my survival crew. All around Friedrichshain there are family centers with programming for kids and their parents. Many have free play times and classes such as “baby massage” and “yoga with baby.”
When Grant was around 4 months old, I started going to a “baby time” every Friday. With a facilitator, we went around sharing how each of our weeks went — recounting what’s changed with the baby, and checking in on how we are each doing. We sang some German songs and did some playful activities. It ended with a lovely breakfast and tea. The whole class was donation based.
Although it was tough for me to always understand what was going on in German, I managed to make one good friend from the group. When the class ended, we started going to drop-in “open play times.” Grant loved playing with all the new toys and structures, and I enjoyed some adult socialization. It can be incredibly lonely and isolating to be caring for your baby at home alone all day.
I’m not going to say much about Kita (daycare), because unfortunately we will be leaving Germany before Grant can go to Kita (at one year of age). The most important fact though is that Kita is free. Yes, daycare is free in Berlin. Well, except for a €23 / month lunch fee.
Parents apply for a Kitagutschein voucher that determines the number of hours you qualify for based on their age and the number of hours the parents work. Most kitas don’t take babies under the age of one though. If you’re curious to learn more, this is a great guide.
What?! You’re leaving Berlin? You might be surprised to learn after describing this seeming family utopia, we’ve decided to return to the US — the only rich country without federally mandated paid parental leave.
We miss our family.I had a really hard time the weeks after my parents left Germany when Grant was three months old. My relationship with my parents, and my in-laws, has completely changed since becoming a parent myself. I call my parents almost every day, and can’t imagine having them only see Grant once or twice a year. I think that one of the best things we can do for Grant, and for our sanity, is to surround him with people that love him — which means moving closer to my family in the Bay Area.
We miss our friends.Although it was hard to make many friends during the pandemic, we managed to make a few good friends in the past three years. However, almost all of them have now moved away as many were also expats, and went onto their next location. We know how important friendship is to our happiness, and how lonely and isolating parenting can be. Back in the bay area we have friends we’ve known for 10–20 years, and many of them are now having kids too. We’re actually planning to co-live with a friend I’ve known since birth!
We’re tired of speaking bad German.We had grand plans to learn at least conversational German when we first moved here. We took a month-long intensive course, and then biweekly classes for the first year. But after a year we only made it to A.2, at best. When I got pregnant, I lacked the energy and motivation to continue. In the area we live in, we’re able to use English in our day-to-day encounters, but when we hit bureaucracy, it is all German. And becoming a parent doubled the amount of bureaucracy we’ve hit. I also couldn’t imagine not being able to speak to Grant’s daycare teachers fluently.
We want to continue working with our American employers, but want family friendly hours.My husband and I continued to work for American companies when we moved to Berlin. He stayed with his previous company, and I started at Google Berlin. This meant we worked somewhat shifted hours, usually 10 am to 7 or 8pm, with a healthy midday break. This is not compatible with a baby’s schedule (3pm kita pickup, 5:30pm dinner, 7pm bedtime). From my experience, most Googlers in leadership positions based in Europe take a break to watch their kids, and then go back online from 8–10pm. This is not the lifestyle we want.
We want to establish a permanent home base.To my husband’s dismay, the idea of moving back to the bay and staying there for the rest of our lives terrifies me. I’m not ready to stop our adventures! But I do agree that we’d like to establish a home base and permanent community. Maybe we’ll move to Taiwan or Singapore in 5 years though :)
I’m extremely thankful for my experience from pregnancy to parental leave in Berlin. I know how lucky we are to be able to move here, have our parents stay with us, and work at well paying jobs. We are extremely privileged to get this new perspective on what having a baby can look like. I’ve had friends in the US who had to fight for time off from their employers or beg their doctors to take their pain seriously to get a PT referral. It would have been hard for me to advocate for myself during this tender and vulnerable time.
I am grateful that Germany welcomed us as a temporary residents (we have EU Blue Cards), and allowed me to qualify and pay for public health insurance. I’ve felt supported by the city and healthcare system, with community spaces and services that I didn’t even know I needed.
After 12 months off, I feel ready to return to work, and step aside to let my husband become the primary caregiver. Love you dear! :)
Thank you Owen and Kalvin for the edits, and Alana Range for the lovely photos.

This article is a reflection of my recent journey to Berlin, Germany’s capital to attend a party given by my company. I felt Berlin is warm to newcomers, and it has tons of history from world wars and, homes, people from different backgrounds and nationalities. In a few phrases, what I feel about Berlin:
Berlin is a human rights capital of Germany. It embraces a new inhabitant with both hands and Berlin always has room for someone: a tourist, an expat or a refugee. I find the culture is so open that for millennial, Berlin can be an ideal city to live and work.
Unfortunately, that was not my opinion when I last visited Berlin 6 months back for attending AWS Summit, Berlin. On February 26–27, 2019, I participated in the summit or conference whatever you call it, and didn’t get much time to explore the city and its famous landmarks and attractions. I stayed in Ibis hotel, Postdamer Platz. We book it because it is close to the summit venue, Station Berlin. It was a sheer business trip in the mid of the week.
Station Berlin is one of the old railway stations in Germany that opened in 1875. Later, it is used by the German Postal office as a hub of packages and mails. Now the location is rented for conferences and events.
The whole area is an old city and looks more gloomy in winters. The first impression is the best. After seeing the modern, vibrant southern towns like Munich and Nürnberg, I found Berlin Postdamer Platz as a disappointment.
The Berlin Hauptbahnhof(Central Train Station) makes you think of an alien spaceship in terms of architecture, but when you come out, you find the old Berlin which is not so appealing in winter.
You can see the Station Berlin 3D tour here:

The Berlin Hauptbahnhof(Central Train Station) makes you think of an alien spaceship in terms of architecture. But when you come out, you find the old Berlin which is not so appealing in winter.
I got a chance to go to Berlin again, in the form of a summer party given by my company. My company, Zalando, annually throws a huge party(4000+ attendees) for employees working all over Germany. As part of it, we traveled from Tradebyte office in Ansbach, Bayern to Berlin’s Leipziger Straße by company-provided bus.
The company booked hotel rooms in Motel One, Leipziger straße for 30 plus of us. The plan was to go to the party on that evening, get back to the hotel, rest and travel back on the next day. People can also stay again and explore Berlin in a relaxed way, after-party and come back whenever they wish to return to Ansbach.
It was slightly an overcast condition in Ansbach, in the early morning. I got ready by 6:45 AM and prepared my morning coffee. Then I left straight to the meeting point in Bahnhofstraße for boarding the bus to Berlin. The plan was to start from Ansbach, then detour Nürnberg and pick few employees living there.
Our bus rolled on Autobahn A9(Highway) via Bayreuth swiftly through the landscapes of many meadows where cattle and horses were feeding. Construction works are going on in many places to the highway. For frequent travelers, the bus trip could be annoying as you see a lot of cars zipping next to you and Ferrari and supercars are quite common. Trucks should take the last lane of a six-lane road.
The most eye-pleasing stint in the journey is the sight of gigantic windmills on A9. They rotate slowly and sometimes with moderate speeds when the wind is high.
You also spot beautiful meadows and green pastures right next to the road. The soil type varies as we travel from south to east.
My friend and I played a small guessing game on the autobahn. It is to see the number-plate of trucks pass by and guess the city/town/municipality of the vehicle registered in Germany. Like for example, Ansbach registration is AN XX-YYY. Below is a number plate from Wolfsburg, Germany home of Volkswagen. The blue color “D” is Deutschland(Germany) with an EU flag in the background.
We saw trucks from European union, and also from other countries like Great Britain and Switzerland who has different number-plate. I came to know that when you enter into a different Schengen state, you have to pay a toll. But within Germany, for using autobahns(fast-driving roads), you pay no fee.
We stopped near a gas station in midway because our driver has to take rest for 45 minutes. In Germany, driving laws are strict and transparent. A driver should compulsorily for halt 45 minutes after driving straight for 8 hours. We had our lunch at around 11:45 AM.
The bus equips an in-house bathroom and a fridge. The ride was comfortable, and 5–6 hours journey didn’t exhaust us at all. Now, after the break, we headed towards Berlin. Our bus driver, on some occasions, announced the exciting facts about the regions like “Ahoy! Now we are entering into East Germany” etc.
Near Leipzig, we spotted from the bus a cargo airport of some private company. My friend told me that the planes halted there are Russian by observing their body paints. I wondered what Russian planes are doing there. But I later recollected that the same region was under the soviets until 1990.
Finally, at 2:45 PM, we entered into the outskirts of Berlin and soon into the city. The bus went through the Ernst-Reuter-Platz into the famous Tiergarten(Botanical gardens).
Since we are pouring in a lot of German words, here are some of the common words you see as a tourist and what they mean in English:
Nouns:
der Platz — the Square
die Straße — the Street
die Stadt — the City/Town
der Markt — the Market
die Garten — the Garden
die kirche — the Church
der Bahnhof — the Train Station
Adjectives:
Haupt — Central/Main (adj.)
Alt — Old
You can attach adjectives + nouns to form new words. Like:
Hauptplatz — Main square
Hauptgarten — Central garden
Hauptbahnhof — Central station
Altstadt — Old Town
Tiergarten is home for hundreds of huge trees in the heart of the Berlin city. There are many squares in the garden. Our bus passed by the famous Siegessäule(victory column) that is a remarkable piece of architecture which lifts the spirit of Berlin. The Prussian empire constructed it in 1873 as a memorial for its victory against the Danish forces. People in our bus stuck their noses to the window to see this marvelous figure.
After crossing a few traffic signals, we saw the Soviet war memorial, which is a statue remembered for the legacy of soviet soldiers in the Berlin city.
We then passed through the famous Brandenburg Tor(gate) from the west side of the city. FYI: The gate entrance faces East Berlin.
We will talk later more about this de-facto mascot of Berlin. Our bus took a right turn here onto Ebertstraße and faced few more traffic signals. Finally we reached hotel in Leipzigerstraße around 3:15 PM.
Within half an hour, everyone checked-in to Motel One. Many seem to be exhausted from the trip and want to have a nap before going to the party that starts at 6:00 PM and goes until 3:00 AM. But I have a different plan in my mind. I washed my face, locked my room 3:45 PM, and left the hotel for exploring the Berlin city. I have time until 5:30 PM when the bus starts from the hotel to the party venue.
I then checked the nearby attractions in Google and started walking towards a few of them. There are Germans, Chinese, Balkans, Turks, and tourists from many other nations walking in the streets. The good thing about my hotel location is every major attraction in Berlin is walk-able and under 2 KM distance. The only thing I am running against hard is the time.
People filled the Cafes and open restaurants who are enjoying the weekend atmosphere. I first took Friedrichstraße from Liepzigerstraße and walked onto Taubenstraße to reach Gendarmenmarkt. It is a square that has a concert hall and two churches Deutsche Kirche und französische Kirche (German church and French church). The architecture of all three is mind-boggling. I didn’t enter into them, but the vast square with cheering families, lovely couples, and, senior citizens made a lively atmosphere.
I then walked past the French church onto Markgrafenstraße and other streets just watching the architecture of buildings and observing people around. I also went to a few parks nearby where parents are playing with their kids and, few are biking. I sat there for sometimes and started to the next attraction, Berlin Gallery, which is 1.4 KM from that point.
While I am walking to the attraction, I received a call from my colleague saying office bus is ready to leave to the party venue and all are waiting for me at the hotel. Oh my god! I stared at my watch and found it was 5:30 PM already. Then I dumped my plan of going to Berlin gallery and walked back to Leipzigerstraße where my bus was standing on the road to take off. I didn’t even get time to change my clothes, and I jumped onto the bus coach, and it left after 7 minutes delay, curse me.
Berlin’s Tempelhofer Feld (Tempelhof airfield) hosts our party, which is an old airport where military airlines/cargo planes used to operate at the time of World War 2. Now it is a park, and like Station Berlin, the runway area is rented for parties and events to generate revenue. This place is famous for a cold war time event called “Berlin blockade and airlift.”
As a quick fact of history in the times of cold war from 1948–49, soviet occupied East Germany and cut down the entry for allies into west Berlin to provide the food supplies to its citizens. East Germany, which is under communist rule, surrounds West Berlin.
There is no other option for the US and its western allies(France, UK, Canada, New Zealand, etc.) than to fly supplies from West Germany to West Berlin. Tempelhofer Feld is used by Allied powers to receive the food supplies and then distribute them. It went for a year. I am lucky enough to stand on the same grounds where a lot of dramatic events took place 70 years back.
You can find more here:
en.wikipedia.org
The party was great. I can see thousands everywhere, met many new folks. For Ex: I met a Spanish guy named Alex, who come from Palam de Mallorca island of Spain. He told me that Germans are the majority of tourists to his island because it was once a German territory. He said he is currently learning German and likes the job he does in Berlin.
As our conversation progressed, I told him when I think about Spain, Rafael Nadal comes to my mind. To my surprise, he said to me that Nadal too lives in Mallorca and Nadal’s home is just 5 KM from away from his. Wow! How often do you hear that from a stranger? Like “Do you know? Sachin Tendulkar lives two blocks away from me”.
My colleagues and I played many games like fußball, Table Tennis, Basketball at the party. We spent almost four hours playing, eating, networking, dancing, and enjoying the music and environment.
At night, people had a high time with drinks and danced to playing songs by a DJ. My friend and I decided to say goodbye to our colleagues at the party around 10:00 PM and planned to go out for sightseeing Berlin after dusk. Hurray! This time, I don’t have to go alone.
Now comes the exciting part! One of the friends and I took U-Bahn(Underground rail) from Tempelhof station to Hallesches Tor and planned to walk from there to Checkpoint Charlie. We don’t want to go till Französische straße, which is close to our hotel because we want to wander more on foot.
My friend is a history buff, and I was lucky that he is an unofficial tour guide for me. Apart from his mother tongue Turkmen, he speaks Russian, German, and also, Turkish. He was there in Berlin before, but he wants to explore the places again.
When we got out from Hallesches Tor station, we saw a water channel, a tributary of the Strengbach river right under the station. There is a small steamer boat drifting in the waters. It is like having a stream under the underground rail. In the station, you also find the historical pictures of the station lines damaged in WWII.
Then we walked around Mehringplatz, a circular residential square and steeped into Friedrichstraße. On the way, we have seen many buildings with graffiti and messages like “Make Art not War.” Many houses were silent and seemed like there is no activity at 11:00 PM.
Initially, I thought there were off to bed, but I came to know that Berlin people love nightlife and most of them will be hanging around bars and nightclubs along with friends drinking beer and eating sausages.
In the same street, we have reached a famous tourist spot called Checkpoint Charlie. It is an immigration checkpoint between East Berlin and West Berlin. East Berlin and West Berlin are divided by Berlin wall until 1990. The only road which you can take to cross the border is through this checkpoint. Here you have to prove who you are, show the permissions.
Before the Berlin wall was built in 1961, many people fled from East Germany to West Germany, which irked Soviet to construct a wall. Checkpoint Charlie is a very crucial point where sometimes soviet and the USA used to deploy tankers to show their power. I felt thrilled that the things from my history books are right in front of my eyes.
While we are at Checkpoint Charlie, a lovely young couple who are riding an e-scooter approached us and asked for help with directions. Their phones were dead, and they were confused about the location of their hotel. They are heading to Invalidenstraße. They noted the directions from Google maps on my phone and bade us goodbye.
From the Checkpoint Charlie, we headed towards Brandeburg Tor(gate) by taking the famous Wilhelmstraße. It was named after Friedrich Wilhelm I, a legendary Prussian king. Many government offices lie in this street, which gave it the name ”Government District.” It is one of the prominent streets in Germany before and even now. This street also has a museum that has Soviet TV Sets, landline phones etc.
We also walked past the Jew cemetery memorial, which is constructed by the German government and US embassy where you can see a bear idol, which is similar to the Statue of Liberty. Berlin’s coat of arms has a bear, so bears are very popular in Brandenburg, Berlin. Now comes the famous Brandeburg Tor(gate). We have reached the gate at around 11:45 PM. It was empty from tourists. It has a chariot on top with goddess Victoria riding it.
I stood at the East Germany side in front of the Brandenburg gate. Behind the gate is the Tiergarten where my bus took a right. East Germany entirely closed this gate in the communist regime. WWII conflicts destroyed the gate partially but then after restored.
I thought I have the whole night to explore this beautiful Berlin city and there were few to almost no tourists in the main attractions. Right next to the gate, I found there are US, France, and Russian consulate generals. My friend told me that every powerful nation tries to get the closest consulate near the Brandenburg gate. As I told you, he is my unofficial guide(chuckling)
From the gate, I can see a building that has round glass, Dom. I learned it is Bundestag(German Parliament office) in Platz der Republik(Republic square). They closed it already, so couldn’t explore it. I heard that people could attend the sessions but have to register online upfront.
www.bundestag.de
By then I felt exhausted because of the long bus journey, afternoon walk, party games, and two and half hours long walk again. We started walking back to our hotel via Charlottenstraße, where we once again went past Gendarmenmarkt, and I had an opportunity to glance at the famous Humboldt University of Berlin.
The specialty of this university is it has won 50 Nobel prizes till now and has great alumni: Sociologists like Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Physicists like Max Planck and Heinrich Hertz. The legendary Albert Einstein taught at this university from 1915–1928. I also collected few invitation cards those spread on a sitting bench as souvenirs for myself.
With all the good memories, we reached our hotel at 1:20 AM. I dropped myself on the bed after changing clothes. I slept soundly until 7:30 AM next morning, had my breakfast at the hotel and traveled back to Ansbach with my colleagues.
That ends my Berlin visit!
Now you know why Berlin completely changed my earlier impressions! Because it offered so much in very less time which I can cherish for my lifetime!

By Carly Kay
The familiar rumble of plastic suitcase wheels against cobblestoned streets was suddenly drowned out by the pulse of techno music and a cacophony of languages as I finally dragged my luggage over the threshold of Generator Hostel in Berlin Mitte.
The words “You are crazy my child. You must go to Berlin” and “Make love not war” were boldly printed upon cabinet doors that displayed a photo of the now-iconic kiss between former East German president Erich Honecker and former Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, painted on a piece of the Berlin Wall known as the East Side Gallery.
Within an instant, this dimly lit corner of the hostel lobby seemed to reinforce Berlin’s international reputation for chaos and creativity. After spending months researching the famously reunified city, I was prepared to enter in real life the picturesque vision of history-laced eccentricity that had vividly taken shape in my mind.
Yet, instead of being met by hordes of passionate young people, as I had imagined from the comforts of Santa Barbara, I encountered silent unblinking stares and direct, unapologetic words. Known for embracing freedom, the city exists at the same time in a culture that rigidly abides by unspoken rules.
Soon after I boarded a bus from Tegel airport, it became apparent that the local passengers had very little tolerance for visitors who unknowingly violated these mutually-recognized social agreements.
Taking in my new surroundings, I was suddenly ripped from my tranquil, contemplative state when the sound of loud banging against glass filled the air.
“My wife! My wife! Please, someone stop the bus. My wife is out there,” shouted a flustered man with two daughters in tow.
Despite the panic in the man’s voice, the bus driver continued to pull out of the station. I watched in disbelief as the nearly full bus watched the situation unfold without the slightest inclination to help the man left on the sidewalk.
After a few seconds of the traveler’s incessant pleading, a man inside the bus rolled his eyes and reluctantly yelled something in German to the bus driver, apparently driven more by annoyance than altruism.
Berliners and travelers alike glued their eyes to the confused family as they attempted to reconvene and reevaluate the transit system in the doorway of the bus. As I gaped at the family, people around me began to shift uncomfortably in their seats and a palpable frustration settled over the crowd.
Growing impatient with the family’s indecision, the same German man who spoke to the bus driver began aggressively making shoo-ing gestures towards the door.
“Out, Out,” he shouted bluntly to the family. “A different bus for you. Out.”
The confused family finally stepped off the bus to discuss travel logistics elsewhere.
As the engine revved, the bus driver’s voice came over the intercom. Unfamiliar syllables and guttural noises drifted over my head and provoked an outbreak of laughter from the locals around me.
I did not understand what the bus driver said, but could only imagine it had something to do with the visitor’s inability to understand the social expectations for proper bus etiquette. My suspicion was confirmed during our orientation when I heard stories of bus drivers denying rides to passengers if they were waiting just off to the side of designated stops.
These small codes and standards seemed to contradict the glorified free-spirited energy that I strongly associated with Berlin. The city fosters a sense of radical self-expression. But at the same time, its occupants are afforded a certain level of responsibility, to respect mutually-understood social values.
A bit unsure of our new temporary home, I considered how to navigate such a complex system of both rigidity and independence. The system both welcomes daring innovations with open arms, while it exiles particular deviations from the norm with sharp rebukes.
So, despite my apprehension, I confidently dragged my suitcase through the hostel lobby, ready to engage with a convoluted labyrinth of social norms that co-exist in the city that has an explosive sense of self-identity. I guess you could call me a ‘crazy child.’ I had truly arrived in Berlin.
UCSB journalism students are now reporting daily in Berlin for feature articles which will be published here in July. Meanwhile, they are blogging from the city about their travel and journalism experiences.

Should you visit Berlin? Absolutely not, as these five points prove. Not only will you have to endure a city where everyone seems to have no responsibilities and only want to party, your trip will then ruin the rest of your life when looking back at the very few things Berlin does well. Read on for some important warnings on why you shouldn’t bother visiting Berlin…
Clubbing in Berlin is like nothing else I’ve experienced. From the ridiculous door policies and marathon opening times to the endless techno, you’ll find that the nightlife in Germany’s capital is very unusual. But after just one night of being indoctrinated into the Berlin way of doing things, you’ll realise that they just do it better.
In Berlin clubs, it’s frowned upon to take photos — in some, photography is banned. But why would you want to take photos of your mates in the club anyway? Just enjoy the moment, your life shouldn’t be about showing off to your Instagram followers. Who cares if you got into Berghain, anyway??
You also won’t find any mirrors in the club toilets, either. Or anywhere else for that matter. But if you’re actually there to have a good time, does it even matter what you look like?
Next is the music. No one loves techno quite as much as Berliners do. Last time I went to Ipse in east Berlin, the crowd cheered after each DJ finished their set. Moments later, the next DJ would come on and play what sounds like the exact same track, only with a slightly different snare drum sample.
SEE ALSO: 4 things you’ll learn about clubbing in Berlin
And if you’re not into the hypnotic, monotonous music, you’re not getting in, because the bouncers will quiz you on who’s playing.
However, after clubbing in Berlin, you’ll realise that clubs elsewhere are full of posers who are just there to be seen, pretending to have fun. Does anyone even have fun in clubs outside of Berlin? Most likely, they’re not. In Berlin, they’re actually there because they love the music.
And that’s how it should be. Why go to a club with ludicrous drinks prices to pretend you’re something you’re not and live a lifestyle you don’t lead, just to impress a load of other people who’re in exact same boat as you. You might be sitting in the VIP booth, but truth is after tonight you’ll be back on your zero hours contract job or skipping your media studies lecture.
At least in Berlin, clubbers are honest. When you get home, clubbing will be ruined for you as you’ll realise just how futile and pathetic it is anywhere else.
Berlin is probably one of the cheapest major cities in the world. Want a latte at the train station? It’s yours for the princely sum of €1. Want a kebab? That’s €3.50. In fact, the only thing that’s overpriced is entry to the TV Tower.
Trust me, in just a few days you’ll get used to the low prices (unless you head over to Poland or Hungary next!) and when you get home, if you’re from the UK, the USA, or elsewhere in western or northern Europe, things will suddenly seem so expensive.
On a night out in east Berlin, you could have a beer for under €2. That would cost you around £5 in London. We even picked up 0.5l bottles of beer at a convenience store for €0.60. Sixty cents. That’s insanely cheap!
Nothing ever happened in Berlin. It might be the capital of Germany, but Germany only became a country in 1871. Even the USA has 100 years on that, while England was unified in the 10th century and has been a country ever since.
Plus, Berlin was almost totally destroyed in 1945. And nothing really happened after that…
Of course in reality, Berlin was one of the major flash points in the Cold War. Take the Berlin Crisis in 1961, where US and Soviet tanks had a standoff for 16 hours, 50 meters apart, with live ammunition. Chilling stuff.
Or the Berlin Wall, and the numerous escape attempts that led to hundreds of East Germans tragically dying at the hands of the border guards, as well as the fascinating stories of how a handful of people got away with it through their audacious escape attempts. You can learn about these at the Berlin Wall Museum at Checkpoint Charlie.
And who can forget the former German Democratic Republic? If you’ve been watching Deutschland 83, you’ll already know about the East German Communist state. Find out what life was like behind the iron curtain in the DDR museum in Berlin Mitte. Though it was one of the more successful communist states, you’ll learn that freedom was severely restricted, and find out how the population coped by listening to communist music, watching steroid-fuelled sports, and going on nudist beach holidays (yes, really).
Berlin is known for it’s chilled freewheeling spirit, that’s much less intense than other large cities like London or Paris. You’ll find the people here are really down to earth and relaxed. In the summer months, many people sit out drinking at beach bars on the banks of the river Spree, or take a dip in the Badeschiff.
They’re not uptight about when clubs close like in other cities — parties from Friday night are known to stay open until Monday morning. No matter what time of day or day of the week, you’ll see people relaxing and having fun, partly down to the rise of flexi-time working hours in the city.
SEE ALSO: What in the world is travel hacking?
The city is also home to around 20,000 artists, drawn to the city thanks to cheap rents and tons of studio space. Similarly, Berlin is a hotspot for tech startups, meaning there’s lots of hipsters to meet in the multitude of quirky, independent bars.
After you leave, you’ll miss the constant party scene, particularly if you’re going back to the daily grind of the rat race back home.
Bologna has bolognese, Tokyo has sushi, and Berlin has… doner kebabs?
But these aren’t the standard greasy kebabs you’d pick up at 3 am after stumbling out of a grimy provincial Essex nightclub. The döner im brot is ubiquitous across Berlin, and absolutely delicious, served with salad, and both garlic and herb and hot sauce. The grilled bread that these kebabs are served in makes all the difference, rather than the dry pitta you’d get served in the UK. While you can pick up a doner anywhere, you can find the best in the city here.
Let’s also not forget the famous curry wurst, made from a steamed, then fried pork sausage, served with a ketchup based sauce topped with curry powder, and a side of fries.
The humble curry wurst owes its existence to World War Two. The dish was invented by Herta Heuwer in Charlottenburg, west Berlin, in 1949. Having acquired curry powder, ketchup and Worcestershire sauce from the occupying British troops, serving up the first curry wursts to the construction workers rebuilding the city.
Today, Berliners can’t get enough, guzzling 70 million of them each year.
So yes, food in Berlin really is the wurst (sorry)

While chatting a few years ago about Berlin with a venture capital veteran from the Silicon Valley, he mentioned that he saw Berlin as ‘a city finding itself’. As a recurrent visitor of the city since 1998, I can relate to that statement; I can happily say that by now, this city has developed a character of its own (on the startups’ side).
Berlin is the capital of Germany, and one of the most eventful cities in the world.
It is a city of contrast where history and newness encounter each other on every corner.
A good example is that the city serves as the center for all political decisions in Germany as well as the hub for startups and technology advancement. But before we look at the current state of the city, it is useful to go down memory lane and understand the following:
After World War II (1945) the city was mostly destroyed. Situated at the center of such a dark recent history, the city needed to rebuild itself and was in an awkwardly divided position: West and East Berlin. The West side was controlled by the American, British and French, while the East side was controlled by the Soviet Union. The division was so strong that there was even a physical manifestation of it, the Berlin Wall, which was built in 1961 and only fell in 1989. The city became the capital of the German nation in 1991 and then started its reconstruction process.
Two main factors determined the type of people that lived or moved to the city and would later become critical for the development of the startup ecosystem:
These factors attracted talent to Berlin, creating density over time and increasing its appeal to internationals. In the words of a friend:
“Berlin is not a city where people brag about a 6-course menu at a restaurant, but rather one where people talk about the clubs they frequent.”
That alternativeness in what it means to have “made it” in the city attracts a distinct crowd.
So let’s create a short timeline with some of the main events in this ecosystem building process:
In the early 2000s, there was arguably not much happening in the city in terms of industry. In Germany, a highly decentralized country, every region or “Bundesland” was relatively specialized in terms of a certain type of business: insurance in Munich or energy in Essen. Berlin was mostly known for being the city where the artists and the government were located, but there was no big industry, which made it a fertile ground for people to build from scratch.
The first wave of startups in Berlin dates to the interval between 2007 and 2010. Within that time the city gave birth to startups like studiVZ (social network), Immobilienscout24, Zalando, Idealo, Gate5, and Jamba. Jamba was the second exit from the Samwer brothers who later became the founders of Rocket Internet. Gate5 was sold to Nokia, and the founder, Christophe Maire, would later go on to start Atlantic Labs.
This period saw the rise of venture builders; since these types of companies are not common everywhere, I’ll explain: Venture Builders are companies that focus on launching new businesses from a core team that develops them and supports them with some central functions such as HR and Legal. In short, these are companies whose purpose is to create other “child” companies. While venture builders are now present across the world, there has been a strong concentration in Berlin.
Around 2011, there were two venture builders in the city: Team Europe and Rocket Internet. Team Europe was started by Kolja Hebenstreit, Lukasz Gadowski, and supported the early days of Delivery Hero (Lieferheld back then), Wooga, and Spreadshirt. Rocket Internet was started by the Samwer brothers who had previously founded and successfully exited companies such as Alando and Jamba. There has been plenty written about the Rocket Internet and the Samwer brothers’ story, but I personally recommend reading this version by The Generalist.
While there are mixed opinions on the company and its ethics, no one can deny that they were one of the largest catalyzers to make the Berlin startup hub “happen”. Among the companies that benefited from the Rocket Internet force, we can find some of the most iconic scale ups such as Delivery Hero, HelloFresh, Zalando, Home24, and Westwing.
As time progressed, startups originated not only from venture builders but from other founders entering the scene; some of those stories relate to SoundCloud, Wunderlist, EyeEm, SumUp and Amen. On the venture capital side of things, some VCs started to see an opportunity in Berlin and one of the first ones to establish a presence here was Earlybird, which moved from Hamburg to Berlin in 2013. Berlin started to appear in the international startup scene, so much so that even Ashton Kutcher decided to invest in the city back in 2012.
Several of the companies mentioned before were the bootcamps for much of the talent we see today, and as talent churned from the bigger companies, more ventures got built. At this point in time, most of the companies built in Berlin had a flavor of commerce, consumer and copy-cats. People associated Berlin with power of execution, but not necessarily with innovation.
By 2014, Oliver Samwer, the older brother of the trio, started to professionalize his investing and from that Global Founders Capital was born. It was right around that time that Rocket Internet was considered to have reached its peak success, where many of its ventures such as HelloFresh, GlossyBox, DeliveryHero, and Zalando were present not only in Germany but had also started international expansion.
As Berlin became more recognized as a startup hub and the venture building practices became internationally known, more venture builders started to emerge such as Hitfox (now IONIQ), which expanded into fintech with finleap and later into healthtech as Heartbeat Labs. Many of these venture builders not only built for themselves but also for corporations, and soon enough it became common for several German corporations to establish their innovation practices in Berlin. Examples include Lufthansa Innovation Hub, BCG Digital Ventures, and Körber Digital enabled by consultants such as BCG Digital Ventures.
In 2015 Wunderlist, a startup from entrepreneur Christian Reber and the Wunderkinder crew, was sold to Microsoft for $125 million. While compared to some of the valuations and exits we are seeing in the current VC climate this might seem small, at the time this was a major milestone for the Berlin ecosystem. This made it clear that it was possible to build something out of Berlin and exit to global players.
By 2016, Berlin was well recognized as the second largest startup hub in Europe, only behind London. It is around this period when Rocket Internet stopped incubating more businesses. At an ecosystem level, there were already enough small successes to have attracted more capital to Berlin and many new VCs were founded: Point9, Cherry Ventures, and LaFamiglia.
As aspirations in the city grew, it became increasingly attractive to international funds opening offices in Berlin– properly committing to the city. Some examples of international funds opening offices in Berlin include Creandum, Heartcore, and Speedinvest.
The success stories of previous years have encouraged more people to pursue entrepreneurship as a viable career path. As we look into the future of Berlin, the city has diversified the type of industries it serves into fintech, logistics, mobility, edtech, etc… Furthermore, it is expected that some of the Berlin based unicorns will IPO or be acquired in the coming years, leaving several employees with disposable income to invest or start new things on their own. At the same time, this also means more second-time founders and operators with scale-up experience that will continue the flywheel in the ecosystem.
On the VC side, the proliferance of smaller VCs led to a general sentiment that Berlin has consolidated its spot as one of the leading European hubs, taking on increasingly more ambitious challenges. Two movements that were not discussed in this narrative so far were the governmental initiatives to enhance the startup ecosystem, such as the Adlershof, and the fact that for a while Berlin was considered one of the crypto hubs of Europe.
For now, I believe it is time to bring the story to the current times and identify who the movers and shakers in the ecosystem are:
By now it is no secret that nearly every important fund in the world has at some point invested in a Berlin-based company, however I want to focus our attention on funds that are “headquartered” or “committed” in Berlin.
The first category, “headquartered”, contains funds who were founded or moved their headquarters into the city. The second category, “committed”, contains the funds that have at least one person permanently based in Berlin; hence they have formalized their commitment to the city.
While the city’s stars are and will always be the startups, it is useful to see some of the VCs as the catalysts for innovation happening in the city. Many of those VCs are operators turned investors or individuals who have boldly betted on Berlin being the next innovation center of Europe. By late August, Sifted reported that Berlin startups had already obtained €5.1bn in investment:
As we can see this means that by the time I publish this article, the city is likely to have doubled the investment from 2019, the record year until now.
On the startup side, I don’t think I’d ever finish this article if I were to list all the startups in Berlin. Nonetheless, I want to highlight some of the ones that have successfully put the city on the global map:
I want to finish this article by encouraging everyone to move to, invest in or visit Berlin. Nowadays, there are more factors that contribute to the city continuing to gain the hearts of many, so here are few selling points:
Overall, it has taken a while for Berlin to become the startup capital we know and love. I am bullish on Berlin continuing to attract highly qualified talent and increasingly incubating more European unicorns. Come visit or message me if you have extra stories on the city.

KREUZBERG, Berlin — At the Berlinische Galerie on Alte Jakobstraße, I rounded the corner to an exhibition room and was taken aback by a large, ape-like creature sprawled across the concrete floor in an installation that I can only term narrative art.
The ape was coated in black, stringy fur that small worker figures were stripping from her back, leaving her torso a bloody mess. Her mouth hung wide open as wooden structures leaned up against her face with other small human figures trying to extract resources from her teeth. Some laborers had even gone to loot her private parts, loading her treasures into overflowing trucks. They were stripping her bare, capitalizing on her death, and destroying her corpse to feed their greed.
On display until Aug. 21, the art installation “The Sweet Certainty of Deliverance from the Darkness that Surrounds Us” portrays the imminent threat the planet faces, with rising temperatures and natural disasters caused by greenhouse gas emissions and unsustainable ways of life and production.
Witnessing this artistic raid on the creature’s body, a feeling of violation crept up in me, confronting me with the reality animals have faced in the race toward industrialization. My feet quickly moved to the next room.
In the middle of that hall, a flower bud-shaped paper-mâché spaceship draws the eyes, luring people to enter. Within it, the faces of animals stared back at me. Surrounding the vessel are large brown leaves, each holding a painting depicting the story of human evolution and collectivism that was set ablaze by mankind.
Apes fall from trees transforming into humans. Together, the apes burn down the forests and trees from where they came. In a last effort to preserve what remains of the land, the animals work together to build the vessel featured in the center of the room, which sends humans into space as animals watch them leave the world they have destroyed.
Leaving the exhibit, I was overcome by guilt and shame.
German and Romanian artists Matthias Boehler and Christian Orendt present their shocking view of the future of civilization, attempting to explain why humans waste resources, burn acres of forests that provide the Earth with oxygen, and produce more gas emissions than ever recorded. The two have worked together since 2008, creating art installations that provoke their viewers into questioning their responsibility and prompting them to change their ways of life by experiencing impactful and ironic mixed media exhibits.
While the storyline is a work of fiction, the work portrays a reality that is eerily familiar. Thoughts of billionaires flying into space and power plant fumes drifting up through the Earth’s atmosphere entered my mind. The exhibit conjured the smell of fires burning and ashy-covered streets in California — now also happening near my home in Queens, New York, where glass shards and Styrofoam litter concrete roads that used to host freshly cut fields of luscious poppies.
Now, walking around the streets of Berlin, I am reminded of how we globally share the challenge of survival. Advertisements for sustainable products surround me. It is easy to be a more eco-conscious guest on Earth in Berlin, where the importance of conservation is posted along the walls of train stations and covers the beams of streetlights.
This is not the case in the United States, where recycling is an afterthought and rarely enforced. It is difficult to find a can to throw out trash along the streets of Manhattan. Walking is not an option in Los Angeles, when there are no sidewalks, forcing me to get behind the wheel.
In Berlin, I am rewarded with a Euro coin every time I return a glass bottle or cup, urging me to reflect on my plastic consumption. When riding the U-Bahn, I am given four options on how to dispose of my trash, prompting me to discover what materials my waste is made of. To beat the summer heat, I can find solace on a former runway at a reimagined Tempelhof airport, surrounded by lush gardens and commuting cyclists. In this city, greenery stretches across historic streets crowded with people enjoying the sunshine, filling me with hope.
Berlin seems to understand the pleasures of living on the Earth and the need to take action now. After walking out of the Berlinische Gallery, I am beginning to as well.

You’ve probably heard of Elon Musk. You’ve definitely heard of Berlin. What I didn’t know before moving here two years ago is that it’s not just Germany’s capital — it’s also Europe’s techno capital, home to some of the most famous clubs in the world. One of them, Berghain, is a ten-minute walk from my apartment. Yes, that Berghain — the one that supposedly denied entry to Elon Musk. Now, it all makes sense. And that also tells you everything you need to know about this place.
Berlin is a story.
Berlin is many things.
For many Europeans, Berlin is an escape — from old values, expectations, responsibilities. It’s a weekend escape, a semester-long detour, a soft rebellion. You drink, you party, you feel unglued.
Berlin is an open air museum of war, destruction; but also of freedom and choice. Berlin has transcended its strictly geographical boundaries, and has transformed into more of a lifestyle.
Clothes — black; chains, nets.
Smell — urine, tabacco, weed.
Drink — beer or weinschorle.
State of mind — sad or happy.
Free time — nature, parks, rivers, lakes, nudist beaches, biking.
Money spent — on rent; in small cafes, flee markets, secondhand shops.

Edit: After posting this, I got a lot of responses from people who also attended the Berlin Opera Academy and had something to say. I’ve asked for their permission to share their stories. You can find them at the bottom of this article.
On the first day of BOA 2022, during the general assembly, the head of the program gave us a rousing speech. It really was very good — you could see people eyes lighting up, and I felt my own face glow with anticipation.
However, he said one thing that made me a little suspicious. ‘Be positive,’ he told us. ‘Have a positive mindset. Don’t grumble or complain. Make something out of it.’
Of course, I completely agree with the benefits of a positive mindset. There’s a lot of whining and complaining in any world, and we’d all be better off without it. But at the same time, this sounded defensive to me — as if he knew there were things that weren’t right, and hoped to not get too much pushback.
As it turned out, the BOA program, for all its merits, has a few drawbacks that I think people should be aware of before signing up.
But let’s start on that positive note.
BOA is a great initiative and Berlin is a great city. The teachers that they attract are often amazing and will give you valuable feedback. They will often give you their honest opinion, and because you’re seeing lots of different people in a short amount of time, you will start to notice which comments keep popping up. I, for example, heard that I was moving around rather aimlessly from three different teachers. That’s when you know it should be the first priority on your list of things to fix.
This is a great opportunity that might be worth paying for, especially if you’ve never done it before (I hadn’t).
You’ll get to actually do a whole opera and you will be guided by professional conductors and directors. I got extremely lucky: my opera (Suor Angelica) was directed by Susan Stone. She displayed a kind of professionalism that I really learned a lot from over the span of four weeks. She was kind and open, but not overly familiar. She was ridiculously smart, had very original ideas for the piece which the executed with meticulous precision, and held us and herself to a very high standard. It was one of the most inspiring things that month.
You might make some new friends, and you’ll be able to see how you measure up to others. This will be both encouraging and discouraging. Personally, I learned that, repertoire-wise, I was way better prepared than almost anyone else there, which was lovely. But I also learned that my interpretations suffered because I wasn’t intentional enough in my on-stage movement. This was painful to realise, but it was very important as it allowed me to work on it.
During the first two weeks, I got into exactly zero masterclasses. That’s right. The booking system where you are supposed to make your own appointments was deeply flawed. It basically meant that whoever had the fastest internet connection could get multiple masterclasses every day, while others went weeks without getting a masterclass. When the students of BOA 2022 complained, there were “warnings” issued to those who over-booked. But by then, many people had fallen behind in a way that could not be fixed. When I finally got my first masterclass in week three, I let the teacher know how happy I was to finally have snagged a spot. The teacher said: ‘Are you serious? I’m seeing some people for the fourth time today.’After that, I took it upon myself to help distribute classes fairly by snagging masterclasses I’d already been to and contact people that hadn’t worked with that teacher yet, to give them my spots. I even contacted some teachers separately and paid them for private lessons at their homes, because BOA wouldn’t have them back for more classes. The people at BOA had no solution for this problem, other that to issue warnings and block people who had had too many masterclasses — but as this only happened halfway into the program, most people were not able to make up for their lost time. This meant that some people got way more than their money’s worth from BOA, while others really did not.
This was one of the factors that resulted in the over-booked masterclasses. While I was there, they were staging three or four operas at the same time, all with three separate casts. This meant an absurd number of singers, all fighting over the same finite resources. It also means that everyone’s attention is spread very thin. The maestro has to work with two other people singing the same role as you, and they’re also working on the other productions. In my case, our director was working with four casts simultaneously — two for Suor Angelica and two for Gianni Schicchi — while the conductor was working on every production that was going on at that moment (do the math: 4 operas x 3 casts per opera). Whelp.
The Berlin Opera Academy also accepts people with little to no experience (who then eat up all the time with the conductor because they haven’t studied or cannot sing their parts). I knew all my parts by heart when I got there. My “time with the conductor” was five minutes in a huge rehearsal, after which he said ‘Great, thank you’ and moved on to the two other people singing the same part.
Let me be clear: there were people at BOA 2022 who said: ‘It wasn’t like this last time.’ I think I caught the program at an especially bad time. I came during the busiest month, and halfway into the production, the entire costume and set department quit because of unsafe working conditions and the fact that BOA had not delivered on their promises to them (which BOA admitted). They tried to salvage the situation, but in the end many productions had to scramble to get any kind of costumes together.
This is a relatively minor issue, but the venue where the operas were staged was a letdown. The ‘changing rooms’ were a gigantic, completely dark garage-like space that was open to the elements. When it rained, there was water everywhere. The hall is very oddly designed and is clearly better suited to an art exposition than music. The orchestra sat to the right of the performers, while there were a couple of chairs herded together in the far corner for a tiny audience. I felt a bit embarrassed that I had invited my family to come see the production.
If you’re looking for that glamorous opera feeling, this is not the right program. Considering sticker price is almost €5000, I would have expected more.
Well… that depends. For me, it was worth the money, but mostly because I hadn’t done anything like this before, I got a partial scholarship and because I was willing to pay teachers separately for extra classes. I learned a lot and had lots of fun experiences. But I don’t think I would ever go there again, and I would not pay the full price to go there.
After I published this article, I got lots of comments from fellow students. Some of them were generous enough to let me share their opinions here.
I’d have mentioned the amount of commuting you have to do between rehearsals and classes/coachings. But overall, I think it’s too generous to BOA, to be honest. The thing is a scam. I felt so bad for the kids who paid €5000 to be triple cast as the third genie or something. And members of staff sexually propositioned people on the course after they’d finished their final show. I’ve told so many people not to do it.- Anonymous
Honestly, I think you covered everything very well — the only thing I would maybe add was that we weren’t really in “Berlin” we were very much on the outskirts of the city and had to take public transit for like 45 mins to each location, which made it hard to be able to participate in everything, to be honest.- Charlotte Forknall
I think what we received as participants in the programme was completely unacceptable. If I hadn’t received scholarship from BOA and from another source, I would probably be fighting to get a refund. I’ve done other summer programmes before and this was easily the worst, and cannot even be compared because the standard is so low. If anyone were to ask me about BOA, I would without hesitation tell them it’s a scam. - Anonymous
1000% agree with everything you said. The only reason I do it, is it’s the cheapest conducting program that includes opera. - Anonymous
I totally agree with each and every word. We as singers are so desperate to sing and do our job, that sometimes we don’t ask ourselves questions like: ‘Did I pay too much and get too little?’ This whole industry is telling us to be happy and grateful, and not to advocate for ourselves. But I think it’s important to not only be positive. Especially if you’re a woman and you’re a bit angry, people call you a bitch. But it’s not a bitchy quality, it’s a human quality to protect yourself and stay with the truth. I think it’s really important to speak about, if we want this business work for everybody, and not just for money.- Katsia Kaya

Fancy taking on a fast, flat World Major Marathon where world records are made? Here’s what you can expect if you’re thinking about running the Berlin Marathon!
The Berlin Marathon is one of the six Abbott World Major Marathons and is the fastest of them all. With only 285ft (87m) of elevation gain it’s not surprising Eliud Kipchoge ran world records here in 2018 and 2021, clocking a massive 2:01:09 at the latter.
So if you’re thinking about taking on a race that’s renowned for producing PBs, here’s what you can expect from running the Berlin Marathon.
Berlin Marathon sends lots of comms, but many were only in German. Yes, yes, I know it’s a race in Germany, but I’d signed up in English, selected my communication preference as ‘English’ so I didn’t understand why I was getting emails in German.
The pre-race programme was terrible — one of those useless digital e-books that was impossible to flip through a single page when using a mobile phone. And as the first half was in German (again, no issues with that) and second half in English, it was almost impossible to easily find the details you were looking for. Even a pdf would’ve been a big improvement on this, but for anyone with digital accessibility needs it would’ve been virtually impossible to find any information.
It was disappointing.
The Berlin Marathon Expo took place at Tempelhof Airport to the south of the city, an easy ride there on the U-bahn (which was free to ride for marathon runners during the whole time the Expo was open and on race day).
I arrived about 08:00 so I could take part in the Generali Berlin Marathon Shakeout Run. It was free to enter and anyone could attend, so if you were with family or friends (and they were happy running about 6k!) everyone could run (althought from 2023, the shakeout run has moved back to its usual spot at the Olympic Stadium, starting at 09:30).
It was very relaxed, I’d highly recommend taking part.
The Expo itself was inside several old airport hangars. It had quite an old-skool, Cold War-era vibe to it, which just added to the atmosphere of running in Berlin.
To enter, I had to show my race card (I’d added mine to my iPhone so it was quick and easy) and photographic ID, then they heat-sealed a wrist band to my wrist. I was told I needed to keep this on until after the race, but very frankly after the Expo, no-one asked for it — my race bib was enough. That said, I wouldn’t tamper with it, just in case… even though I had to cut mine off as there was no way it’d come loose by itself!
Race bib pickup was at the very back of the Expo and once there was quick and easy. If you’d bought a finisher’s t-shirt, you had to pick that up at another counter, where you had to go outside, join a queue, then come back inside the hangar. It again was quick, but not very intuitive.
Adidas had loads of official gear for sale, so if you liked the Berlin Marathon merchandise you could load up before you left.
My family had come with me to Berlin so I’d signed the kids up to do the kids’ races taking place on the Saturday. The first was the Bambini Run for my 5 year-old, which also took place at Tempelhof.
It was pretty congested getting the kids to the start line and they didn’t allow parents through for our age category (parents could accompany the 0–2 year olds and 3–4 year olds, but not the 5–6 year olds onwards). I was a concerned my Little Girl would freak out being by herself — especially as most of the announcements were only in German — but she was fine, the marshals were great at herding the kids around and she finished with a beaming smile on her face!
Her run was only about 500m, but it was enough so she felt like she had taken part.
On the Saturday afternoon, there was a Mini-Marathon for older kids, starting at Potsdamer Platz. There was very little information about it online — and nothing in English — so I’d emailed the organisers and asked how I could sign up my son and they were very quick to get back to me with a link and a code.
Apparently the Mini-Marathon — which covers the last 4.195km of the main Berlin Marathon route — is a big schools event, with around 10,000 schoolchildren from all over Germany participating. We had a bit of a nightmare trying to pickup my son’s race bib as apparently pickup at the Expo had ended on the Thursday and when we got there on Saturday, no-one at SCC (the event organiser) knew what was happening. We eventually found the bib pickup area but it was closed down.
So we headed to the start line in Potsdamer Platz and asked SCC there, and got Little Man’s bib in about 60 seconds — very easy! Although by this point they only had large finisher’s t-shirts left, so he’s got a good few years to grow into it!
He absolutely loved the race, it was by far the largest he’d participated in and he even got to run through the Brandenburg Gate before I did!
Collecting him afterwards was hugely stressful, however. There was no clear signage on where to go — all the parents headed into the Berlin Marathon finisher’s area but the actual end of the Mini-Marathon was further down the road. There were also two exits, so we were freaking out a bit as we didn’t anticipate that so had no idea where Little Man would emerge. I took one exit and my wife took the other, and thankfully I found him pretty quickly.
So from his perspective, the Mini-Marathon was awesome… I’m so happy he enjoyed it but as a parent it was a massive stress from start to finish.
On Marathon Day itself, getting to the start line of the Berlin Marathon was one of the easiest experiences I’ve ever had.
No need to get up in the middle of the night to catch a ferry to Staten Island like you do when running the New York Marathon, or jumping on a bus from pretty much the finish line to the start if you run the Athens Authentic Marathon or Boston Marathon.
Berlin Marathon starts in Tiergarten near the Reichstag and travel by U-bahn and S-bahn is free, with the trains run every few minutes.
There’s not much there at the start village of the Berlin Marathon.
I only recall massive queues for toilets (until the men discovered they had outdoor urinals). There were also many bag drop areas, which you could walk up to and drop-off without queuing.
Before entering my corral, I found a small piece of ground to run some warm-up loops, then saw a team mate from my running club so we headed into the corrals together.
There are no toilets in the corrals, but there are more toilets and urinals just before you enter. And if you’re tempted to go in the bushes you’ll be out of luck — literally everywhere was fenced off, so it was either go in the toilets/ urinals or not at all.
Berlin Marathon is a loop, starting and finishing in Tiergarten in the city centre.
You start in the park just beyond the Reichstag parliament building and head west past Victory Monument before turning right and looping round Tiergarten and into Mitte.
There are a couple of small bridges over the Spree but you’ll barely feel them. The first ‘uphill’ segment is around Mile 4, with an elevation gain of +25ft (7.6m). There’s another +22ft (6.7m) segment in Mile 6, then the course is virtually flat until Mile 19 when there’s a -26ft (7.9m) segment and another downhill -24ft (7.3m) segment in Mile 21.
So bottom line is, you’re not really going to feel any of the elevation gain, but there are a couple of nice (but short!) downhill sections later in the race.
The Berlin Marathon begins to draw to a close running through Potsdamer Platz, where the crowds become thronging again. Support is great along the entire marathon course, and even though for 90% of the race it’s thin, the crowd gives off a welcoming vibe.
Lots of families were out supporting, with dozens of kids looking for high-fives, which was really motivating. Berlin Marathon also prints your name on your bib, and even though my name is difficult for non-English speakers to pronounce I had more personal shout-outs running the Berlin Marathon than any other race. You really feel a close connection with the crowd.
The final stretch of the Berlin Marathon has you running through the famous Brandenburg Gate and past the Reichstag to the finish line. But as the Brandenburg Gate is still a good 400m from the finish line, it’s prudent to hold off that sprint finish until you get a little closer!
Water and aid stations are plentiful along the course, the first set are at the 5k mark and then every 2.5k afterwards. Just watch out for the brown liquid — it’s cold, sweet tea, so not to everyone’s liking!
Eliud Kipchoge may have ran a new world record that day, but I knew I wasn’t going to PB at the Berlin Marathon.
I’d had a terrible training block over the summer with two consecutive injuries that put me out for five weeks, then two weeks before the Berlin Marathon I caught COVID-19.
I also had to think about running the Chicago Marathon two weeks later, so for me the Berlin Marathon was going to be an exercise in discipline.
I decided to try to run negative splits for the first time at this distance, running the first 20 miles between 7:20 and 7:40 min/ mile, then seeing what I could give for the last 10k.
I managed to clock my first 5 miles at an average pace of 7:35 mins/ mile, then upped it to 7:20 mins/ mile up to Mile 20. I felt surprisingly good at this point, so cracked on to average 6:50 mins/ mile for the last 10k, with a sprint finish peaking at 4:59 mins/ mile at the end.
Without any hills or other notable terrain to contend with — unlike the monster hill in the middle of the Athens Authentic Marathon or the ups and downs of the New York Marathon over the many bridges — Berlin Marathon lets you focus on what pace you’d like to run to achieve your goal.
I can see why it’s so fast!
The Chicago Marathon may be flatter, but Chicago suffers from poor GPS coverage through The Loop, which makes it hard to know exactly how fast you’re going at the start and the halfway point, plus all those 90-degree bends mean you slow down at every corner.
Berlin Marathon, on the other hand, just flows, and bar one sharp turn just before Mile 3 when the two lanes of runners merge, the rest was easy going.
Post-race was excellent!
There was a massive positive vibe as Kipchoge had just ran a new world record, then the sun started to peep out. It had been a comfortable 12C (54F) for the race, so the timing (for me at least) was perfect.
You get your medal pretty much right after you finish, then water and a few other bits and pieces. It’s about a 1km walk to the end of the finish area, where it’s extremely important NOT to miss the Erdinger tents giving out their Alkoholfrei beer!
I headed to the grassed area in front of the Reichstag and sat on my poncho, drinking in the sun and my ice cold beer. I could’ve stayed there much longer, but besides the Erdinger tents there wasn’t much else going on. So after half an hour to chill, I headed back to the U-bahn station and my hotel for a well-earned bath.
I really, really enjoyed running the Berlin Marathon.
Even though the organisation wasn’t always been plain sailing up until race day, the Berlin Marathon itself was superb.
The atmosphere was relaxed, the support had a real warmth to it and the course lets you concentrate on your race.
One thing I will say about the Berlin Marathon is that it’s hard to notice anything specific about many of the areas you run through as they all kinda blend into one. Sure, the downtown area around Potsdamer Platz had a unique vibe to it, but bar the final mile through the Brandenburg Gate I had no idea where in the city I was at any given time. For sure that’s mostly on me for not being very familiar with Berlin, but I didn’t have the same issues when running the New York Marathon or running the Chicago Marathon, where it’s very clear when you move from one borough or neighbourhood to another.
This isn’t really a criticism, just an observation, and it certainly hasn’t put me off wanting to run the Berlin Marathon again.
As one of the six Abbott World Major Marathons, Berlin Marathon always sells out every year. So if you’re thinking about entering, you’ll need to be fast!
Odds through the lottery are decent — I got in on my first attempt — and it opens right after the race finishes, so one year ahead. Time qualifiers need to meet a pretty tough standard — a sub-2:45 for men aged 44 and under and a sub-3:00 for women in the same age bracket.
But if you’re looking for a marathon PB on a fast, flat course with amazing support, give running the Berlin Marathon a go!

A hundred years ago, Berlin was among the biggest cities in the world as its population rapidly grew from 2 to 4,5 million. Just imagine the demand for new housing at that time! Eventually, the city became a testing ground for architectors’ creativity and social experiments.
Passionate about the ideas of affordable mass housing, modernists were trying to make utopia come true — create cheap, standard, and, if possible, lovely houses. Not to mention, it was also a time of the Nazi’s rise to power. Nowadays, pretty small apartments and compact blocks are concealed by colored plaster, original door patterns, and manicured lawns. I’m sure that living in these houses may feel totally different from the careless meditation of a passerby. We are privileged to observe modernist estates from a distance of decades and draw our own conclusions.
This piece should have started with a bird’s-eye view of the horseshoe-shaped building, but let’s leave it to the birds. City explorers like you and me, not aided by drones or helicopters, see this site differently. When I came, the frost was gleaming on the grass in shadows, and the sun shone gently through a gap between “horseshoe” edges.
The Horseshoe Colony is a complex of townhouses and 3-story blocks of flats, and the central one — as you might have guessed — is curved like a horseshoe. A humble memorial stone at the pond tells this estate was designed by Bruno Taut and built between 1925 and 1933.
I was lucky enough to visit the Horseshoe Colony twice, at dawn and dusk, although it took me an hour to reach Britz, a part of the Neukölln district. As I left the metro, sunlit rosy-and-tartare houses with fiery doors popped up. At first, I was walking past them pretty fast, not realizing they were also part of the architectural ensemble — not just the shaped block.
I didn’t expect such a burst of color either because the whole modernist architecture (and Bauhaus in particular) had always seemed minimalistic and monochrome to me before.
Although this estate appeared as affordable housing for rapidly growing Berlin, it was designed with privacy in mind, thus feeling neither fully urban nor entirely rural. In this densely populated area, you’ll notice a lot of hedged yards with lovely arbors, swings, braziers, beds of flowers, and other attributes of carefree leisure.
The Horseshoe Colony doesn’t look luxurious; however, it gives space for individuality and embodies a passion for detail. I spotted a dozen door variations. My favorite ones are the black-framed ones with colorful rectangles in the middle. You can hardly find the same building color and door pattern combination twice.
But let’s turn back to the horseshoe building for a while. What amazed me the most about it was the optical effect of using sky-blue paint. Loggias look like holes in the building, and you can pretend to see the sky through them. As a result, this pretty massive building doesn’t feel overwhelming.
I noticed something about color that would also be relevant to other housing estates in this article. So, color is probably, the cheapest way to convey style, whereas columns or sculptures require a lot of work and material. It’s remarkable how modernists used the power of color, creating affordable yet original housing.
And the icing on the cake — a crimson wall, which turned out to be just the opposite side of those tartare houses I mentioned at the beginning. The setting sun cast its light on the wall, and the windows and balcony frames got lilac. After all this, I did realize why this settlement gained its status as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
I left the Horseshoe Colony after sunset. Black silhouettes emerged from the gloom but didn’t obstruct the sky view. If you stand on the stairs between the horseshoe edges, you’ll see magnificent scenery — the sun sets behind the building, people switch on the lamps, and this light reflects on the surface of the inner pond.
You can easily spot the White City from afar. Its white minimalist geometry stands out among yellowish houses nearby, and the five-story corner towers, like guardians, stand on both sides of the street, Aroser Allee. This housing estate in the district of Reinickendorf was built in 1928–1931 and turned out to be the last modernist quarter of the Weimar era.
The key role in the White City design belongs to Otto Rudolf Salvisberg. The central structure of this ensemble is like a sea resort hotel hovering above the street. I hate when parked cars spoil the picture, so I squatted in the middle of the boulevard and shot through a hole in the hedge, thus “hiding” the vehicles behind the bushes.
And how can an authentic German building be without a clock on its top?
Look! Another clock on the opposite side of the same building. I adore how classical modernist architects could create a style with the simplest geometric shapes: squares, circles, and rectangles. Although all the buildings generally look uniform, they have numerous unique parts — like these clocks.
Now, the doors. Doors are where modernist architects burst into various color combinations and rectangle compositions. Bright red and blue doors look incredibly vivid on the white facades.
Not to mention gorgeous blue windows along the staircase, an eye-catching stripe of volume on a flat facade.
A couple of paragraphs above, I mentioned so-called “towers,” higher parts of the corner buildings. So, I found five of them: two large towers on both sides of Aroser Allee and three narrow ones at the corner of Emmentaler Straße and Genfer Straße. They create a distinctive border with other buildings and hold the borders of this settlement.
I had visited the White City before chestnuts and poplars started blooming and one more time after trees went green. In spring, there is a short period when the sun is bright enough to make the walls sparkle, but the trees, still leafless, don’t obstruct the view. I was happy to enjoy this contrast between glaring facades and black trunks.
My final unexpected observation was red and blue bands underneath the roofs. On the one side of the street — blue; on the other side — red. Pre-war architects used to leave numerous unobvious details, aesthetic gifts for an attentive urban wanderer. By the way, White City also is UNESCO-protected and part of the Berlin modernism heritage.
Call me old-fashioned, but the number of floors in a residential building should be a one-digit number. For example, five. It seems compact enough and doesn’t turn a house into an ugly “anthill” similar to Soviet-time quarters in East Berlin. I decided to check the Carl Legien Settlement late in the evening, just before sunset.
This housing estate is located a 5-minute walk from the station Prenzlauer Berg in a district of the same name. Like many buildings displayed in this article, it appeared between 1928 and 1930 and was designed by Bruno Taut and Franz Hillinger.
Carl Legien estate is more uniform than, for instance, Horseshoe Colony, but belongs to UNESCO World Heritage, too. Its buildings don’t have varying characteristics like doors or facade colors. What fascinated me the most was the pinkish tint of the walls and, of course, red, yellow, and blue frames. Gazing at them, I immediately recalled paintings by Piet Mondrian.
And again, we observe the same simplicity and minimal expressive means — no columns, no sculptures, no molding. Rounded balconies and loggias are all facing the inner yard, and I guess it must create a feeling of privacy and own space for the dwellers.
Not many buildings in Berlin have bare brick facades. Brick is typical for factories and warehouses, but most residential estates are plastered and painted in pastel colors. However, the UNESCO World Heritage complex at Shiller Park stands out; the exposed concrete grid of balconies and ochre walls immediately drew my attention. It was designed by our good old friend Bruno Taut and constructed in 1924–1930.
I noticed a bright green car on the street between the historic houses and decided to look closer. Like the settlement itself, the car turned out to be also vintage. Citroën 2CV was a popular economy vehicle in the 1950s, and it fitted in here so well. The phrase on the car, “I fly bleifrei,” is a pun. In German, “bleifrei” means “lead-free” or “unleaded” (without added tetraethyl lead), which is a characteristic of petrol or paint. This motto and a cute duck mascot made me smile.
I noticed the streets where this estate stood were named after English cities — Bristolstraße, Dubliner Straße, Oxforer Straße, and Windsorer Straße. Later I understood why — in Google Maps, this area was called the English Quarter. Except for the car and street names, there were some other beautiful details, like a white doily in one of the windows.
The way how I instantly spot historically significant buildings in Berlin is by well-preserved wooden doors and windows. Look at these bold red frames. If the door is original, not a later replacement, the paint must have been scratched off and carefully repainted a dozen times. Paint sagging and overshooting on the glass look so heartwarming and naive when you can visualize the story behind it.
At the end of that walk, I was thinking about the balconies, which were half-glazed and half-opened. Large windows with white “skeletons” created the impression of porches. Maybe this is why so many local dwellers have beds of flowers, sun umbrellas, and chairs on their balconies. It’s a blessing when your home has a special place to meditate, sipping coffee to the sounds of birds’ songs.
It’s getting more challenging to impress you with Berlin modernism, but I’ll try. The ace up my sleeve is this lovely settlement on the southeastern outskirts of Berlin. It was built a bit earlier than most estates introduced here, in 1913–1916, and the design belongs to — surprise! — Bruno Taut.
While walking and taking pictures, I felt uncomfortable — like an obnoxious intruder or a guy chewing popcorn and slurping beer at the museum. Fortunately, there is little chance you disturb someone at 6 a.m. on Saturday because people (except for me though) prefer to bask in bed a bit longer. But my weird pleasure is to stay one-on-one with architecture and avoid city dwellers casting suspicious glances at me.
This settlement is probably the richest in styles and colors and feels specially designed for vacationing. Not surprisingly, it’s called “Gartenstadt” (garden city) in German and belongs to UNESCO World Heritage.
All the buildings have two or three floors, bright wooden shutters, and terraces. Even though most houses are arranged in blocks, they don’t feel like dull clones.
On some doors, I saw eye-shaped stickers with a silhouette of a thief and a phrase in German, “Neighbours are watching.” I don’t know about you, folks, but to me, this is a typical village security system when people notice more than any video surveillance from highly urbanized districts.
So far, the “garden city” was primarily painted in warm colors: orange, red, and yellow; however, it has a winter-cold section, too. If I happened to choose my favorite building here, I’d choose this stunning blue villa. The tree, in the shade of which it stands, seems to be at least a century old, planted at the times of settlement construction.
Sorry, I cannot overcome a desire to show you the lovely doors of Falkenberg once again in detail. See how carefully a trellis (this white frame for supporting climbing plants) is covered with a sheet of glass. Residents’ needs might have changed over time, but they didn’t spoil the initial design with a massive overhang. And the red door below, besides being amazingly beautiful, has a sticker I’ve already told you about.
Did you think there was just one blue house in the garden city of Falkenberg? Here is another one. You can compare how differently the same tone looks in the sun and after the sunset. In the light, it is glossy, and in the gloom, it gets matte and soft like a gouache drawing.
It was pretty late when I headed back to the station, yet I couldn’t miss an opportunity to take one more picture. What a combination of a cold-blue sky and pavement and orange-warm lights and a bush.
I’m not overwhelming you with historical facts from Wikipedia, so you should have some energy left to cope with the last chapter. This so-called “Waldsiedlung” (forest settlement) is located in one of the most picturesque districts of Berlin, Zehlendorf. You cannot take a single photo here without capturing at least one pine.
All the previous modernist settlements were located 5–10 minutes from the nearest train stations, but this one surrounds the station with an unusual name, “Uncle Tom’s Hut.” These beautiful 2–3-story blocks of flats and townhouses were finished between 1926 and 1931. Could it happen without Bruno Taut? Of course, no, folks. And Taut was accompanied by fellow architects Hugo Häring and Otto Rudolf Salvisber, whom I mentioned many times in this and previous articles.
Onkel Toms Hütte, unfortunately, hasn’t been (yet?) honored with the status of UNESCO World Heritage and remains the only settlement in this article without this status. However, it doesn’t mean city authorities neglect its preservation. All the buildings look well-maintained and don’t have noticeable stains on their bright facades.
In childhood, my granny dressed me in not-so-new grey and brown stuff because she knew I’d be dirty by the end of the day. A residential building is something people “use” very often, and why the hell do you make it so bright? I admire the courage of architects who cared about the dwellers’ moods, too. It is much more pleasant to live in a place that also pleases your eyes than just a practical and robust apartment!
My poor German skills, though, were sufficient to interpret gorgeous letters on the building below. It must have been a hairdresser’s workplace, but now it looks unoccupied by any business.
The shadows were growing higher and getting longer. Time to return home and view all the photos taken that day…

This year, I was able to finally cross off a major dream of mine: visiting Europe for the first time! It was a dream come true to visit Germany and Italy, but Berlin in particular caught my attention in unexpected ways. I had the chance to stay with a close friend in Wilmersdorf, a neighborhood that offered me a fresh outlook on living in Berlin away from the tourist attractions. I spent 12 days learning about the city’s interesting history, lively markets, thriving food culture, and quirky retail spots from my travel companion and the kind Berliners I met along the way.
I was so affected by this experience that I was motivated to write this guide. In order for anyone considering a trip to Berlin to experience the history, culture, and distinct charm of this incredible city as I did.
Since the tours, I’ve realized that the reason Germans sometimes come out as aloof or uncaring might be directly related to their past. Deep wounds from World War II’s loss and the terror of Nazi Germany persist to this day. Through memorials, museums, and the Stolpersteine — brass “stumbling stones” commemorating Holocaust victims — Germany confronts its past head-on, admitting its collective guilt. It’s simple to see how this emotional burden, which hasn’t been resolved, might be inherited and cause a reserved, occasionally disconnected mannerism.
Berlin is well-known for its lively flea markets, each of which offers a distinctive blend of local culture, art, antiques, and vintage finds. These are a few of the more well-known ones:
Kreuzberg’s Markthalle Neun transforms into a street food paradise on Thursday nights that you won’t want to miss. I had the opportunity to try a variety of international cuisines while exploring the ancient hall, including fresh oysters, Venezuelan arepas, and Korean dumplings. It was more than just cuisine because of the vibrant ambiance, which was full of wonderful scents and welcoming sellers. It’s a must-see if you’re in Berlin on a Thursday!
I got the opportunity to go to Hosek Contemporary, a unique art and music venue situated on a Spree River boat. It was a bizarre experience to listen to experimental music there; the live sound, artwork, and soft boat swaying created a unique experience. This location is a must-see in Berlin’s art scene if you’re looking for something immersive and different.
For those interested in avant-garde music culture, other venues such as Sophiensaele, Quiet Cue, Radialsystem V, and Berghain are also worth seeing.

A city is nothing without its people. Yet a city is also a silent witness to the past. Walk any berlin street, day or night, and you feel the past. If you can see marks of the past in the cobblestones, then you can surely feel it in your bones.
I look for clues of the past in Berlin’s architecture. I’m always walking, looking upwards, often too much; Car horns warn me to watch where I walk.
Architecture shows us the present and the past. Tall columns that reach up high enough to make your neck ache. Designs that mix up a little of the Romans with the Greeks, Doric, ionic, Corinthian, Tuscan and Composite.
Northern European architecture favours smallness. Not tall columns reaching towards the heavens, but squat doorways, tiny windows that protect dwellers from winter weather. Country homes that are functional, workshops only big enough to roll a wooden cart into then load up with goods. That’s my imagination. Walking on Berlin cobblestones fires up the heart.

One day I found myself on a flight to Berlin, Germany. Berlin didn’t even rank within the top ten places to visit on my list but I had to go for work, so why not enjoy this obligatory adventure? I had heard that Berlin was moody and grungy, like the emo child of Europe except it’s not “just a phase”. I was prepared to be met with a lot of punk rock and broody, techno vibes but (as is custom when traveling) I discovered the unexpected.
I landed in the mid evening in Berlin and my colleagues and I were starving and excited to sample Berlin cuisine. Three of us were American and were humbly disappointed that many restaurants nearby were already closed — how inconvenient! It’s usually good to be humbled like this as an American abroad, it definitely enriches one’s character. We did manage to find — what else —but a McDonalds. At this moment, I was less than dazzled by Berlin’s seemingly inaccessible evening meal options but figured it could only get better from here.
In the days that followed, I found Berlin to be a fascinating albeit (at times) icy, bustling city of natives, expats and tourists with cool modern buildings and large boulevards. While the overtone of German austerity, order and efficiency was undeniable, there were surprising pockets of whimsy mixed in here and there.
My personal favorite site was the Brandenburg Gate. A stunning piece of architecture with a lot of history and easily one of the most recognizable landmarks of Berlin.
I also visited Checkpoint Charlie, which was historically the Berlin Wall crossing point. This was a quirky museum overflowing with objects large and small, significant to a major turning point in German history. Not too far from the Brandenburg Gate was the beautiful, lush state park called the Tiergarten. Dense with trees, I would describe the Tiergarten as “Central Park with European elegance” — definitely another favorite location.
While Berlin certainly had highlights of grunge, some parts were charming and even rather quirky with fun thrift stores, local farmer’s markets and the unexpected hipster-style cafe.
Before traveling to Berlin, I was looking forward to sampling famous local fare (currywurst and sauerkraut of course) but Berlin also had much to offer in terms of international cuisine, with a lot of Turkish influences. I made it a priority to sample at least one döner kebab (something I would describe as a cross between shawarma and a sub sandwich) and it did not disappoint. To date, one of the best breakfasts of my life (avocado toast, covered in sautéed mushrooms over thick, fresh bread) was at a highly aesthetic cafe called Kaffee Karamell Berlin. And when I finally got my fork into some local sauerkraut, I knew that I was ruined for any canned, store-bought variety…forever. At the end of my trip I discovered that Berlin was certainly more complex than I had originally imagined. Quirky, grungy, cool, refined, steeped in history yet unapologetically modern, a bit edgy with it’s soft sides as well. Snag your ticket to Berlin and see for yourself!

It’s been 5 months since we moved to Berlin; I’m still astonished we pulled it off as a family. Here are some things we did and learned along the way:
That’s it. I don’t mean to sound cheeky but it’s actually completely doable and only seems daunting in principle. Once you’re executing, you’re operating a checklist, it becomes all about unwavering project management. The biggest deal breaker for us was the school and it worked out rather well.
I’ve got a ton of early impressions and can only spew them out in random order:

Steeped in history, Berlin has been the capital city of the united Federal Republic of Germany since 1990. In that time, it has become one of the hippest and most vibrant urban centres in Europe — with a flourishing cultural scene, brilliant nightlife, and a plethora of bars, restaurants, shops and cafés, as well as green open spaces. Read on for a few insider tips on what to explore off the beaten track.
The loop route along the boundaries of former West-Berlin is also known as the Berlin Wall Trail (Mauerweg). The approximately 160 km (100 miles) loop road is accessible by bike, skates or on foot. The trail follows the former border that ran through and around West Berlin. It turned those parts of the city into an island surrounded by the former East Germany from 1961 until 1989.
Everyone is invited to enjoy all the sights along the road from forests, rivers and parks at the “outer parts” of the trail, as well as architecture and lively city atmosphere at the inner parts of the loop. Along the route there are information stands about historic events in the time of the Cold War and successful escapes. Fears as well as hopes of those fleeing former East Germany are described. But it also depicts personal stories and notes about the dead of the wall (known as Mauertote).
The Berlin Wall Trail combines history and being active in a very distinctive way. At the same time you can see how nature took back areas which used to be known as “death strips”, where people in East Berlin were prohibited to go.

Berlin’s Wall Park (Mauerpark) that used to be a border strip, is the perfect place to go on a sunny Sunday afternoon. Check out the huge weekly flea market, which sells almost anything you can imagine, from vintage handbags to Soviet helmets. If you’re feeling particularly brave, you can also try out a Berlin tradition — outdoor karaoke! Organised by locals, Bear Pit Karaoke lets anyone turn up and have a go at serenading those relaxing in the park with their favourite song. Don’t be put off by the intimidating name, however — almost every singer, no matter how horrendous, is guaranteed a round of applause.

Formed of sections from the former Berlin Wall, the East Side Gallery is a permanent installation showcasing some spectacular examples of street art.

Tiergarten is the second biggest public park in Berlin and is located right in the city centre. Within walking distance to other famous Berlin sights like the Brandenburg Gate, the Victory Column or the Reichstag, home of the German Bundestag, the park is a refuge from the loud and busy city life. Tiergarten used to be the royal hunting ground in the 16th century. Nowadays you can walk among mature trees, classic sculptures, ponds and breathe fresh air in an area much more similar to a forest due to its massive size and bunch of trees.
Click here for more information on Tiergarten
Only a few years ago Tempelhofer Feld was an airfield. Used by the American Allies as an airport and army base until the 1990’s, Tempelhofer Feld is today the biggest park of the German capital. Since 2008 it has been used as a public park, where everyone is invited to spend their free time. Whether it is by bike, on roller skates or even flex-wing, you can get active in the designated areas. But you can also take your barbecue and have a nice BBQ with your loved ones around or meet people from all over the world. Note: there are almost no trees, because the aim to preserve the impression of an airfield does not allow the plantation of trees.

A former Cold War listening post, the spectacular Teufelsberg complex looks like something out of a science fiction movie, perched on an artificial mountain to the west of the city. Abandoned for almost twenty years, the site has since been reinvented as a creative space by Berlin artists and musicians. Whilst off-limits to the public due to the somewhat dilapidated state of some of its buildings, the Teufelsberg is open for official tours.

A striking courtyard complex made up of restaurants, shops, bars, cinemas, theatres and galleries, Hackesche Höfe is one of Berlin’s hidden gems. The striking Jugendstil (Art Nouveau) architecture makes for a gorgeous backdrop for a cocktail outside on a balmy evening. If the weather’s a little inclement, take in a film or a cabaret show.

Berlin’s Kreuzberg district is home to many people of Turkish heritage, so it’s no surprise that the riverside Turkish Market, which runs twice a week all year round, has so much on offer. Here you can find a wide range of delicious Turkish food and drink. It’s a particularly good place for fresh fruit and vegetables — go along to the very end to get the best deals.

Everyone I know who visited Berlin came back saying the same thing:
“Berlin is a magical city.”
They weren’t lying. It’s hard to capture the essence of this place with just a few words, but there’s something really special happening here. Every block is teeming with energy and creativity. Walls are plastered with interesting graffiti and residential balconies are bursting with floral arrangements. Sidewalks are wide enough to accommodate outdoor seating for cafes and restaurants, pedestrians, and bikes all at once, and the streets are bustling with people at all hours.
The cultural atmosphere feels leisurely and less profit-driven, and people seem to be actively enjoying living and working in their city. There’s a sense of civic harmony here I haven’t experienced anywhere else. Most importantly, beer is suuuper cheap, sometimes cheaper than bottled water. It’s also legal to drink in public which makes it tempting to buy a drink for the road (any road). I was afraid I’d bankrupt myself on booze if I stayed any longer.
My German experience began before my plane touched down. The stewardesses on my flight were dressed like beer maidens and handing out free schnitzel and brews for Oktoberfest. A yodeling contest was held at the front of the plane moments later. I arrived in Berlin around 10pm and took a train to my hostel.
I spent the first half of the week touring the city together with some floor-mates from the U.K. We wandered Berlin’s deceptively large streets and hopping on and off public transportation (which had a pretty high learning curve) to visit public squares, churches, and landmarks. Luckily for me, my hostel-mates had a local friend who showed us some fantastic spots, like a rooftop bar called the Klunker Kranich that sat atop a seven-story parking structure and overlooked the city. The most memorable was a mind-blowing place night club called Sisyphos. Here’s my journal entry if you’ve got some time to kill.
On the days I wandered by myself, I joined random walking tours, ate at an African food collective that helped re-integrate refugees into Germany, and went to a bar where all the furniture was upside-down and attached to the ceiling. I visited the Holocaust Memorial at sundown and walked in silence between the large concrete blocks, thinking about the United States and the path we’re headed towards if we don’t remain proactive and vigilant of our bubbling fascism.
I walked around Templehoff Regional Park, an abandoned airfield with old hangars and dilapidated planes. It was a bit surreal seeing kids riding bikes and flying kites on airstrips where bombers used to take off. I strolled through Tiergarten, Berlin’s central park, on my last day. It was raining on and off, but when the sun finally came through, the trees shimmered like verdant jewels.
On my last night, I met up with five other travelers through the Couchsurfing app and we drank late into the morning, (which made for a very rough trek to the bus station a few hours later).
One week doesn’t feel like enough time to do Berlin justice, but I guess that gives me a reason to come back. I’ve got the rest of the world ahead of me and it felt like the right time to get going. I still feel a bit timid whenever I enter a new hostel or restaurant, especially when I can’t speak the language, but I’m slowing getting more comfortable with the discomfort. Getting by in a multi-cultural city like Berlin wasn’t too difficult, but I know the language barrier will only become more challenging as I travel east. At least I’ve got time to ease myself into it. My phone has been an invaluable companion, allowing me to book tickets and hostels in the same sitting and save maps for offline use. I purchased my first international SIM card today, but all of the instructions are in German. So I’ll have to figure that out at some point.
I’m writing you from a hostel in Dresden now, where I’ll be staying for at least the next few days. I’m waking up early tomorrow to visit one of Germany’s national parks. I’ve been craving some nature after being immersed in such rich urban environments for the past few days.
Thanks for taking the time to read this. I’ll be trying to post weekly, so shoot me a message if there’s something in these you’d like to hear/see more or less of in the future. Any feedback is deeply appreciated.
Until next time!

Twenty five years ago this week, TV images flashed on screen of people singing and dancing atop the Berlin Wall.
It seemed almost impossible. I gulped, smiled and felt all tingly.
The fall of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9, 1989, was emotional and personal for me. Years earlier, I had lived on the free side of the divided city at the height of the Cold War as an American military high school student. Were our neighbors trapped in the East now free after nearly three decades of Soviet control?
To stem the flow of East Berliners who wanted to escape, a jagged 27-mile wall cut the city into two halves, and 100 miles of barbed wire encircled the back half of West Berlin, making it an island city. But as American military dependents, we enjoyed a good life and freedom in a cosmopolitan half protected by American, British and French soldiers.
Those in East Berlin experienced a daily existence that was dreary and drab behind a 13-foot-tall concrete barrier. Although all roads in West Berlin ended at the wall, we couldn’t help but see the oppression on the other side. “This wall is an illusion,” read graffiti painted on the free side. “You stand like a scab, an unhealing wound,” were scrawled words I still remember today.
With my father’s U.S. Air Force status we were allowed to venture into the East. We occasionally drove through the famous Checkpoint Charlie border crossing in our gigantic1962 Pontiac Star Chief. During day trips, we would purchase camera gear, crystal glassware and wall clocks in shops intended for visiting communist dignitaries.
We avoided the regular markets with no fresh fruit, and shoe stores with only one size, style and color.
On one outing my family returned to our car to find people standing by the trunk, which was large enough to hold three people. They asked us to take them over to the West.
My father just shook his head “no” and told us to get in the car. He had heard of other GI’s who had smuggled East Berliners back to the West and were caught by the American military police. U.S. officials would immediately transfer those soldiers who risked an international incident. They would be sent from West Berlin (a plum assignment) to a desolate outpost in South Korea as punishment the next day, or so the rumor went.
On my 16th birthday, my father took me over to the East for dinner at the Moscow Haus, a high-end restaurant frequented by communist officials. Within minutes, a man in a Russian uniform joined us at the table. In decent English, he asked about the stripes on my father’s uniform and what they meant.
I remember great awkwardness and a racing heartbeat as the soldier continued to sit with us as we remained silent. Finally the Soviet officer returned to his own table. Who was he? Where did he come from? Could we have disappeared that night, deep in the heart of East Berlin?
Another time we tried to buy a motorcycle in a showroom full of choices, or so we thought. The clerk pulled a big book from behind the counter and asked us to write in our name and address. “Three years,” he told us. “What about these in the store?” we asked. No, those were just for display, he said. We would need to get on a list and wait, so we declined.
While the Soviet east sat basically untouched and neglected for 28 years, the fall of the Wall led to massive, but slow, renovations.
The former districts of East Berlin today are festive places, full of upscale townhouses, offbeat art galleries and ethnic restaurants. Playhouses host performances that rival those of New York and Las Vegas, and American celebrities like Matt Damon and Tom Cruise turn up weekly for vacations or movie premieres.
The former swath that cut through the center of city has provided prime real estate for development again, especially along the Spree River. The city’s subway systems are united and provide seamless and efficient transportation for Berlin’s 3.5 million people.
Everything happens on a grand scale, whether it’s a massive fireworks display at the Brandenburg Gate on New Year’s Eve or the opening of Europe’s largest train station days before the 2006 World Cup soccer tournament began. The main government building, Der Reichstag, is a contrast of visions — with old style below and a futurist glass dome above that allows visitors to peer into the legislative chamber below.
By guiding University of Florida student journalists the past 10 years on study-abroad trips, I have been privileged to help tell the story of a reborn Berlin. Armed with digital cameras, voice recorders and laptops, UF students have spent two weeks every May since 2005 reporting on a cross-section of Berliners. From the city where I discovered my interest in photojournalism, we document some of the people and places that exemplify Berlin’s ongoing spirit of freedom. It’s a subtle revelation as the students come to understand the significance of what they are seeing and feeling.
Many return to Florida saying they’ve been changed; they have felt the underlying spirit of survival, transformation, creativity and openness. Most are surprised and enthralled that the city lives up its reputation of “anything goes.” Some students feel more patriotic after learning and seeing first-hand how American forces kept the city alive following World War II. Some say they want to return to Berlin and open a coffee shop – or work for the Fat Tire Bike Tour company. Most have heard the expression first-hand from Berliners that “you can be who you want to be in Berlin.”
All remember Dr. Pong — a virtually unmarked club where the only entertainment is a single ping-pong table and loud music. Holding a beverage in one hand and a paddle in the other, up to 30 partiers circle the table in a counter-clockwise motion, enjoying a group game that shrinks in size as players miss and have to sit out. After the final two players battle for the championship, the winner bangs the table three times with his paddle, and everyone starts up again. It’s a happy mix – a free-for-all of ages, styles, religions and politics.
Dr. Pong is only a hole-in-the-wall pub, a relic in the former East. It’s poorly lit, has unadorned concrete walls and is full of choking smoke. Yet it speaks volumes about the edginess of Berlin, the acceptance of others and the freedom that the united city now enjoys.
Twenty-five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Germany’s capital continues to reinvent itself, balancing between an historic past and an optimistic future to remain one of the world’s leading cities. I’m proud to be a part of that transformation every year.
John has been teaching photojournalism at the University of Florida since 1991. Each summer, he organizes a trip to Berlin for students interested in documentary journalism.

I’ve been fascinated by the subway all my life. Maybe it’s the fact that there’s nothing outside the windows; that when sitting in a subway carriage one has no other choice than to focus on the other passengers – how they look, what they’re doing, what they’re reading – or, god forbid, oneself.
There’s also that unique feeling of descending into the bowels of a city and being propelled from one brightly-lit station to the next through dark, mysterious tunnels.
In Berlin, there is the additional sensation of stepping out of the present and directly into subterranean history, since the city’s U-Bahn and S-Bahn were both complicit in transporting border traffic between West Germany and the GDR.
The fact that the city was divided along apparently randomly-drawn borders meant that some of the U-Bahn lines from West Berlin actually travelled beneath East Berlin, though passengers were not able to leave the train until it reached West Berlin again. The stations those trains passed soon became known as ‘ghost stations’ amongst Berliners – dimly lit stops where armed East German border guards would peer at passengers through slits in bricked up huts.
Due to the geography of the boroughs of Wedding in the West and Mitte in the East, the U6 had, after the U8, the second highest number of ghost stations, namely the five stations from Schwartzkopfstraße to Stadtmitte. On a cold March day in a still snow-covered Berlin, I decided to ride the U6 to Friedrichstrasse. I wanted to get a feel for what the underground city may have looked and felt like during those Cold War days, and to simulate a journey from West to East, if only in my head.
I start right at the beginning of the U6, at Alt-Tegel, which opened as ‘Tegel’ station in 1958 as part of a northern extension of the U6, which had existed since 1923 as the North-South Line between Seestrasse and Tempelhof. In 1992, the station was renamed Alt-Tegel (Old Tegel). As it’s the end of the line, it comprises eight exits, and is an important feeder in summer for people visiting the nearby Tegeler See to explore its pleasure boats and beaches.
On this cold, winter day though, the area reminds me of the small, boring town in West Germany I grew up in: all 1980s plastic and concrete with sharp edges, a Commerzbank, and a C&A next to a café full of huddled, grey-haired pensioners.
GDR U-Bahn and S-Bahn. West Berlin does not exist on this map.
Borsigwerke, Holzhauser Straße, Otisstraße and Scharnweberstraße are the next stops on the line, and also part of the 1958-extension.
Due to the very high water table, the track was raised onto an embankment, meaning passengers can view the quintessential urban scenery: business parks, small estates, grey and brown houses from the 80s.
The only excitement for me is at Scharnweberstrasse, where one can see glimpses of the planes rolling along the runway of Tegel Airport.
Speaking of planes: Kurt-Schumacher-Platz must be the best place in Berlin for plane spotting. There’s something genuinely appealing about standing at the bus stop near the kebab stands and Chinese restaurants and watching the planes roar just 50 metres over your hand on their final approach to Tegel airport.
The locals, long used to the noise and the sight of planes with the landing gear extended, continue strolling and feeding the pidgeons without blinking. For visitors like me, it’s hard not to imagine the plane careening into the bus stop rather than the runway behind it.
From Kurt-Schumacher-Platz, the U-Bahn runs underground again, traveling through “wild” Wedding (formerly in the French occupation sector) along Afrikanische Straße (with the nearby Centre Culturel Français and its very own Eiffel Tower replica), Rehberge (the best stop to explore the Siedlung Schillerpark, a modernist housing estate and UNESCO World Heritage site), Seestraße and Leopoldplatz — a.k.a. the heart of Wedding, with its Brutalist town hall, Schinkel-designed church — and to Reinickendorfer Straße, the former ‘last stop in Berlin West’.
From 1961 on, when the wall was erected, trains from Reinickendorfer Strasse did not stop until Friedrichstrasse.The line was then called the C-line, and its trains would pass under the border and through Schwartzkopfstraße then Stadion der Weltjugend, Naturkundenmuseum then Nordbahnhof and Oranienburger Tor at a snail’s pace.
All the station exits were bricked up, and armed border guards or police patrolled the platforms vigilantly. There was barbed wire beneath the platform edge to prevent fugitives from crawling along the tracks, and even the emergency exists were blocked: the only way to leave when a train broke down was to walk along the tracks to the nearest western station.
On the surface, all references to these stations were removed; the GDR did not want to remind its citizens that there were trains rumbling in and out of the capitalist West right beneath their feet.
Naturkundemuseum, decorated in cheerful yellows. Image by Kate Seabrook.
Today, nothing reminds passengers that these stations, now cheerfully painted in yellows and greens, had once been in another country – except maybe a vaguely claustrophobic atmosphere.
The stations seem smaller and more crowded than the ones further up the line, but that could admittedly be my imagination. The atmosphere doesn’t seem to affect the school classes alighting at Naturkundemuseum, nor the noisy group of Spanish tourists entering the carriage at Oranienburger Tor for the short hop to Friedrichstrasse.
Bahnhof Friedrichstrasse is one of the most important stations in Berlin history. Different to the other GDR ghost stations, it was transformed from a former central station for subway, commuter and regional trains into a major border crossing, and became a bottleneck where people from the capitalist west and from the workers’ and peasants’ state passed each other unseen.
The station’s facilities and the underground station were only accessible for passengers from the western sectors transferring here. West Berlin citizens could also avail of the border crossing and enter the GDR here, after passing through a labyrinthine maze of tunnels and walkways designed to prevent any direct contact with GDR-citizens.
East Berliners, on the other hand, could not enter the U- or S- Bahn – the only way to leave the GDR was to get on a long-distance train to West Germany. To do so, GDR citizens had to pass through the so-called ”Tränenpalast,” the palace of tears, a building on the square north of the station erected in 1962. The expression is derived from the tearful goodbyes that took place in front of the building, where family members with travel permits had to say farewell to their relatives.
After the fall of the wall, the blue glass pavilion of Friedrichstrasse became a cultural center for concerts and readings, and was eventually turned into the Tränenpalast museum in 2006, enabling visitors to relive the experience of officially crossing from the GDR to West Berlin.

Berlin has become one of the most interesting and exciting cities in Europe to visit. You can go back in history to a church from 123o A.D., to the more recent history of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the ever-changing city and rejuvenating neighborhoods. Berlin is a terrific city from a runner’s perspective, but it takes some planning because it is big and sprawling. You can run almost anywhere in Berlin — the sidewalks are wide and there is an unbelievable network of bike paths (but note they really are for bikes…).
From the city’s center, there are wonderful runs around some of the most important sites and monuments, along the Spree River, and into some wonderful parks, notably the Tiergarten and Volkspark. Just outside the city, highlights include the Grunewald Forest, Spandauer Forest, Tegeler Forst, and some wonderful parks for running near the convention center and airport. If you have the time, hop on a train and go to Potsdam and run in on of their wonderful parks, including our famous ‘Palace Run’.
Berlin is very spread out — about 5x the size of Paris, and distances are big. So, best to plan your runs and where to stay, and use the
fabulous transportation system with extensive subway and rail (U-Bahn and S-Bahn), and bus lines. This allows you to do a run one way and hop the U-bahn back!
Topographically, the city is fairly flat. For some hills, go to Volkspark Friedrichshain.
Berlin climate is typical of continental Europe. Winters are cool but not frigid and there is rarely persistent snow or ice. Summers can be warm and humid but not hot, with lovely long days. Rain is plentiful and os spread throughout the year.
14 miles of paths. Start: Brandenburg Gate. MAPNice add-on: Schlosspark Charlottenburg, ~2 miles west. Baroque castle surrounded by beautiful gardens, with paths along the River Spree. ~2 mile perimeter run and ~2 miles of paths.
The Tiergarten is the running capital of Berlin. A vast, 545 acre green space right in the city, Tiergarten is a running paradise for locals and visitors alike. There are about 14 miles of mainly gravel trails. A ‘straight’ option is to take the paths alongside Strasse des 17 Juni, past the Victory Column. There are several small lakes, lovely English Gardens, and paths along the Landwehrkanal and Spree River. Several of Berlin’s important landmarks are also part of this run: Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag building (seat of the German parliament), Bellevue Palace (German President’s residence), the Congress Hall, the Kanzleramt (Chancellor’s Office), some remnants of the Berlin Wall, and the Soviet War Memorial. Our embedded map shows a nice 7k tour of the park, courtesy of the Sheraton Grand Hotel, and our linked map shows the park’s entire trail system. There are maps well situated throughout the park, as well as WCs, water, and places for snacks or an after run beer.
2 miles or more. Start: Park. Access: Ubahn Richard-Wagner-Platz. MAP
The largest palace in Berlin and its lovely gardens are a popular tourist attraction. The park surrounding the palace makes for a lovely run, with grand paths approaching the palace and then along the water. The perimeter paths add to ~2 miles, with a couple more miles possible using all the interior paths. Closest subway access is Richard-Wagner-Platz or Sophie Charlotte Platz. A nice add-on is to run west along the Spree to Tiergarten, which is ~2 miles. Then you can run even more in the park, or along the water.
A great ‘long run’ option is to start at Brandenberg Gate, run through Tiergarten to the end, and then take the canal paths to Schlosspark Charlottenburg. Do a tour of the park and take the lovely tree-lined Schlosstrasse to the Sophie Charlotte Platz U-bahn for a return. About 7 miles one-way.
7.5 miles. Start: Alexanderplatz. MAP
This is a “jogging sightseeing” tour, incorporating some of the visitor highlights of Berlin. It’s about 7.5 miles, and you can jump on or off depending on whatever location is most convenient. Our route starts at the centrally located Alexanderplatz — a major transport and shopping center, and near the Berlin Congress Center. There are several examples of important German architecture and history in this area. Head west, running by the Aquarium, East Germany museum, and on the river, just across from the Museumsinsel — an island with several of Berlin’s important museums. Head south, passing by the Berlin opera and the Communications Museum, to Checkpoint Charlie. Pass by a the Topography of Terrors (actually a very serious exhibition of Nazi atrocities), up to the Potsdamer Platz — a square at the heart of the city’s history, and area with several concert halls and theaters. Head north, on the outskirts of Tiergarten to the Brandenberg Gate and German Parliament (Reichstag). The run concludes with a 2 mile jaunt east, through the University of Berlin, along Unter Den Linden, a wide street with many important buildings and museums (and tons of construction). Easy add-ons to this run are the paths of Tiergarten. See river paths, or west along the Kurfürstendamm.
This is an island right in the heart of Berlin that has several important museums and buildings. One can run on the island, and on paths along the river on either side, using the many pedestrian bridges to cross over. It is a good 3.5–4 miles on the paths around the island. Lots of ways to add on with river paths in area. Note: lots of construction in the area.
4.8 miles out and back along the Kurfürstendamm. Start: western end in Hallensee, or eastern end at Wittenbergplatz subway. MAP
This is Berlin’s most important commercial street, akin to the Champs Elysees. The Ku’damm, as it is called, has been the heart of west Berlin, lined with cafés, clubs, fashion stores, car dealerships (nice looking ones) and restaurants. It is pleasant to run along this wide road, especially in the morning before it’s too crowded. Also a good night running option. A there and back along the main sections of the road is ~4.8 miles. Good options to continue south of Kurfürstendamm into the Wilmersdorf area and lovely Volkspark. Also, the side streets off Kurfürstendamm are pleasant for running. An interesting site here the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church.
5 mile Loop w/shorter options. Start: S-Bahn Treptower park stop. MAPLonger option or separate run: Over bridge and along Spree River paths. MAP
Treptower Park is a good anchor point for running in east Berlin. It’s a bit of a ride from the city center but easy to get to via S-Bahn. The pleasant park has numerous paths that can be combined with a run along the Spree River. Our route starts at the S-Bahn station, through the Treptower Park trails and the Planterwald nature preserve. An important landmark is the Soviet War Memorial, which commemorates the 80,000 Soviet soldiers who were killed in the Battle of Berlin. Then loop back along the river paths, viewing remaining elements of the Spreepark amusement park, which operated from 1969–2001. Our run is 5 miles. For a nice add-on, cross the bridge over the river and run along Spree River paths of the Rummelsbergarea. It’s a This is mostly waterfront running, with some 7.5 miles RT possible. A 3.5 mile loop would be the finger out to Friedhof Alt-Stralau. Nearby is the massive Arena Berlin, and good running options along the Landwehr Canal trails.
6.25 mile loop. Start: U Hallesches Tor U-Bahn or other stops. MAP
This is another pleasant run in east Berlin, taking in the trails along the Landwehr Canal and Gorlitzer Park. The dirt path goes along the water here, with weeping willows and by beer gardens and restaurants, including Restaurant Boat van Loon. There are lots of restaurants and cafes along Maybach-Ufer or Paul-Lincke-Ufer. Our route includes a tour of Gorlitzer Park, with its big open fields and paths. This run can also be combined with Treptower Park, about 1 mile away. On Tuesdays and Fridays there is a wonderful Turkish market, which makes for a great post-run stop.
Many trail options. 3 lakes w/good perimeter paths. Access: Grunewald station (closest to the city), Nikolassee station (south end), or Wannsee station (closest to the beach)
At 7,000 acres, this is the largest park in Berlin. Nearly 100 miles of roads and trails. Some fairly rugged for running. Hard to proscribe a particular run since there are so many options. Some lakeside path perimeters include 2.5k around Grunewaldsee, 4k around Krumme Lake, and 8k around the Schlachtensee. One option is to do a long run, such as to the south end of Lake Schlachtensee, and then the S-Bahn Nikolassee station. A good hill option is to follow the trail called Teufelsberg, which is a 350-foot high mountain made out of rubble from WW2. Now that’s a one-of-a-kind ‘er.!
Prenzlauer Berg
A nice neighborhood for running. Combine this with Volkspark Friedrichshain. Lots of pleasant streets with cafes, parks, and playgrounds. Stay west of Prenzlauer Allee and east of Brunnenstrasse. Good streets include Kollwitzplatz and Kollwitzstraße.
The Wilmersdorf. Pretty neighborhood in the southwest part of the city. Volkspark Wilmersdorf is a lovely linear park that has a tour of 5–7k. Western end is along small ponds. Access via subway: Rathaus Schöneberg. Others nearby. MAP
Volkspark Rehberge. Nice park which, combined with Goethe Park to the southeast is nearly 300 acres or ~3 miles of pleasant biking and walking trails, and a nicely manicured memorial garden. ~4 miles west of the city and only 2 miles from Tegel aiport. Can be combined with Volkspark Jungfernheide, which is 1.5 miles east. Access: Rehberge metro.
Volkspark Jungfernheide.Nice 300 acre park with sporting facilities. Great option near Tegel airport.
Volkspark Friedrichshain. a path-packed melange of wooded rolling hills, grasslands, a Baroque fairy-tale fountain, and two good-sized hills made from surplus rubble. Berlin’s oldest park. Combine with nearby Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood. MAP
Spandauer Forest. Access: Spandaur U-Bahn. This is a huge park about 10 miles west of the center of Berlin. Closest public transport access is Spandauer, 1.5 miles from the park. It is nearly 4 miles from the southern end of the park to the northern end. There are tons of trails, with a good variety of woods, fields, and waterside paths. Good maps and loop options right off the parking lot at Schoenwalden Allee. A couple of highlights are to run along the stream paths one way, and then along the Brandenberg Wall path on the way back. If 10+ miles of running in this park isn’t enough, Tegeler Forest, with its more wooded, rugged trails, is just to the east. Spandauer Forest is a good running option near Berlin’s international airport.
Tegeler See. Access: U-Bahn Tegel. Just north of Tegel airport. Wonderful waterfront run along the Tegler See. Run across Borsigdamm towards Greenwichpromenade. Once past the mooring sites, you’ll reach the beautiful park of the Tegel Palace. Just past Villa Borsig via Schwarzer Weg, you’ll reach the Tegeler See and a beach & swimming site. This out and back is just over 4 miles, and can be combined with trails in the Tegeler Forst. MAP
6 miles RT. Start: Potsdam Train Station. MAP
About 15 miles from Berlin and an easy train ride, Potsdam is the capital of the German state of Brandenberg and was the residence of Prussian kings and the Kaiser until 1918. Running options here abound — there are wonderful palaces, paths along the Havel river, and wonderful parks. Our route highlights the famous castles and landmarks of Potsdam. Start at the train station and take Friedrich-Ebert-Straße to the northern city gate. Then take the park path to the main city gate, and into the Marlygarten and the main palace area. Use the northern end paths of the park, running by the Sanssouci (Frederick the Great) palace and gardens, the Orangery Palace and Botanical Gardens, and then along Hauptalee to the Neues Palace — enjoy the stairs! Return along the other area paths. There are great options to add on here: University of Potsdam, paths along the Havel river 2k just to the south, Babelesberg Park and several other wonderful parks, particularly to the east.
There is a huge selection of hotels in Berlin. The city is very spread out, so best to plan you stay near one of the routes and near a metro station. Recommendations:
Many of the running shoe companies have running stores in Berlin.
Runners Point. Has 5 stores in the Berlin area. They have a very centrally located store right on Kurfürstendamm A fast growing group run culture, with events nearly every day.
Nike Store. Near Tiergarten. Group runs.

Runners Point and the Nike Run Club store also host group runs.
Running in Germany. Good site for info about marathons and other interesting races in Germany.
Berlin Marathon. September. One of the world’s three largest and best marathons. It has two gentle inclines at miles 17 and 21. Otherwise, it’s a fast, flat course through the whole city, and 800 years of history with a spectacular new finish, through the Brandenburg Gate.
Berliner Half-Marathon. April. Nearly 15,000 runners take a 13.1-mile sight-seeing tour of the city. Visit www.berlin-marathon.com.
Big 25 Berlin. May. An undulating urban route that starts and finishes at the Olympic Stadium. Great race, going back to 1981, through Berlin sites.

BERLIN — Berlin is gritty and urbane, where techno music throbs against the graffitied walls of sex clubs and drag bars. The city is known for being progressive and tolerant — but hop on the S-Bahn to one of the last stations in the East and you’ve entered Marzahn.
This is the other Berlin.
Marzahn is tucked in the northeast corner of Berlin, a working class industrial region, dotted with high-rise flats dating from the Communist era. Far-right politics find fertile ground here. After the Berlin Wall fell, Marzahn became a hub for skinheads and swastikas in the 1990s, an area rife with nationalism and populism.
Today, Marzahn is a stronghold of the country’s most successful nationalist party, the Alternative for Germany or AfD. The party embraces a platform of familiar right-wing causes — anti-immigration, isolationism, anti-LGBTQ, anti-vaccine, antisemitism and climate change denial — which are part of the American political landscape as well. Like former U.S. President Donald Trump, some in the AfD have grudging admiration for Russian leader Vladimir Putin. They oppose supplying arms to Ukraine to defend itself against Moscow’s recent invasion.
Although AfD support slipped in the most recent elections last year, its formerly fringe politics are moving deeper into the mainstream —in Germany as abroad.
Jorn Geissler, treasurer of the Marzahn branch, is keen to explain himself and his views to American readers. He invited me into his office, projecting a voice that exuded his buoyant demeanor as he walked me through the local city hall. This German nationalist wore a pair of gray khakis and greeted me with vanilla wafers and black coffee.
“You are now leaving the politically correct sector,” reads a mousepad on a desk in the AfD Marzahn office. This is a party that trades inclusive policy and progress on human rights — or political correctness — for nationalist and anti-immigrant sentiment.
Of course, speaking to an American journalist, Geissler presented the polished rendition of the far-right faction, meticulously packaged as socially acceptable. Geissler wanted to make this remarkably clear.
“I’m not a Nazi and I’m not a racist,” said Geissler. “We hear so much about fascists and Nazis in Germany, in Berlin, in Marzahn, but I’ve never seen a Nazi.”
The AfD party was founded in 2013 by mainstream Christian Democrats, who wished to abolish the euro as Germany’s currency. It adopted a clear anti-immigration platform amid the influx of Muslim refugees in 2015, when the party’s popularity rose.
Supporters are primarily from the former Communist eastern part of the country, where the political divide today reflects a split along the former Iron Curtain. During the AfD’s peak in the 2017 election, only 11.1% of western German voters cast a vote for the AfD as compared to 22.5% in the eastern states, according to tracking carried out by the German publication FOCUS.
Right wing parties have made strong inroads in the former East Germany, a phenomenon attributed to high unemployment and loss of identity after the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989, what Germans call the Wende, which means ‘Turn.’
“The whole East lost its political orientation in 1989,” Geissler said. “The former parties collapsed and all people in East Germany had to orient in a new way because we had no strong connection with the existing parties.”
Upon its creation in 2013, the AfD did not meet the five percent threshold to elect members to the German parliament. Very quickly, however, party support skyrocketed due to its feisty social conservative politics and its opposition to an influx of asylum seekers from the Middle East and Africa.
In Marzahn, support in 2021 hovered around 16%, maintaining the right-leaning reputation of the neighborhood. In the 2017 national election, 20.6% of Marzahn voters chose the AfD in the first round of voting, the party’s peak year.
Geissler, a construction engineer, joined the far-right party in 2014, attracted to its nationalist stance against the euro. He came to appreciate the party’s disruptive politics, seeing it as the German counterpart to Trumpism.
“We are not controlled by the system,’’ he said.
Even as a young man, growing up in the Germany Democratic Republic, or East Germany, Geissler was the rebellious type, dissatisfied with the living conditions maintained by the ruling Communists.
The same goes for Jeannette Auricht, 62, a member of the Berlin Senate who as a child danced around her room to Michael Jackson and Earth, Wind & Fire on the radio. In all areas of Berlin, TV and radio channels were left unrestricted which also gave her and other East Berliners access to the American Forces Network, a U.S. Army-run radio channel that contributed to her rising angst over lack of freedoms in the East.
Auricht was arrested in her teen years for demonstrating against the Berlin Wall. Now, she represents the AfD in Berlin and says she has “learned to read between the lines” in German politics, meaning she has a long-standing mistrust of government.
As she pledges to hold onto her center-right stance, not all of her party co-members do the same, instead drifting further right.
The alternative ideology of the party has attracted many extremist members, prompting the German courts in March 2021 uphold the government-declared designation of the AfD as a “suspicious entity,” which makes it legal to monitor groups who may be engaging in anti-constitutional activities.
Germany’s attempt to put the AfD under surveillance for extremism does not phase Auricht, who said she does not fear wiretapping because she has nothing to hide.
“I’m not planning a revolution,” she said. “Criticizing the government is a job you have to do and that is nothing against the country or the democratic ways.”
Within the party, leaders try to push out extremists by researching whether they have a racist or fascist history, Geissler said. However, German laws make it difficult to remove members from their parties and this proactive measure was only implemented a couple years into AfD’s existence, he said.
So, extremists do still exist here. And while the party is currently split between center-right and far-right directions, the far-right fringe casts a dark shadow on the reputation of the party.
In late 2020, former AfD party official Christian Lueth was recorded saying that to allow more migrants into Germany would be better for the party because it would attract more membership. As for the immigrants, he said, they can “shoot them all afterwards.”
“Or gas them, whichever you like. I don’t care either way,” the Lueth was quoted as saying.
Geissler said that other political parties in the governing coalition fight against the AfD because of some outspoken extremists, and he also blames the media for misrepresenting the party, due to what he considers a journalistic lean to the left.
He also points out that most party officials are beginners in the political scene.
“AfD members are mostly newbies,” Geissler said. “Most people have no political experience compared to other political parties. And you have to go a long way to get to the top.”
The fringe is gaining ground not only in Germany but in other parts of Europe, where voters in countries like Hungary and Poland are also continuing to accept the far-right in their political mainstream. Despite the AfD’s drop in votes in Germany’s most recent parliamentary election, the nationalist movement is gaining traction among the general public.
“Far-right groups are starting to share straight-out white supremacist ideas that used to be unacceptable in ‘mainstream’ politics,” said Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the U.S.-based Global Project Against Hate and Extremism.
The AfD’s social platform places it far into the political edges with its subversive ideology on human rights, she says, adding that its populist platform reflects the shifting political climate in Germany.
“There is a hard move to the right built mostly on anti-immigrant positions, a simultaneous collapse of the left, and a scramble at the center to keep the fringe out,” Beirich said.
Far-right anti-immigration sentiment is the most obvious example of social conservatism that has the potential to turn dangerous — as it has on a few other occasions in the three decades since German reunification. The AfD platform pushes for strictly regulated borders, especially for Muslim migrants who “don’t take up German culture,” said Marzahn party treasurer Geissler.
He says there is a stronger opposition to Muslim refugees than to Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian invasion because the new arrivals are of European descent and share Christian principles and other cultural norms.
“Migrants from Islamic countries are completely different from European countries like Ukraine,” Geissler said. “The culture is more similar, such as how to speak to women, and the family culture.”
The AfD is vocal about its anti-immigrant stance, but its antisemitism is more hidden. It does not support certain inclusive laws and regulations, such as those governing circumcision and animal slaughter rituals — some of which affect both Muslims and Jews, said Sigmount Koenigsberg, Commissioner Against Antisemitism at the Jewish Community of Berlin.
“The AfD is pretending to be pro-Jewish and pro-Israel,” Koenigsberg said. “It’s a fig leaf to hide their anti-Muslim sentiment. The far right parties are all antisemitic and that is clear.”
In July, the state of Brandenburg, outside Berlin, voted to amend its constitution to include stronger language banning discrimination against Jews, and specifically naming the Sinti and Roma diaspora for protection, codifying a commitment to fight antisemitism and antigypsyism.
The AfD was the only party to vote against it.
Beirich, of the global anti-hate project says the AfD’s populist rhetoric is now part of a global fabric, and she cites parallels between the German AfD and the American Republican Party.
“There’s a lot of political science work that’s been done about where the Republican party sits now and AfD is one of the parties that they most compare our GOP to nowadays,” Beirich said. “So it just shows how far the Republicans have moved to the right.”
She said the GOP and AfD dovetail most on their anti-immigrant positioning, seeking to deny benefits to migrants and cut back on numbers.
But while abortion laws are politically charged in the United States , especially after the Supreme Court reversed the Roe v. Wade right to abortion, the German right has maintained a more ambiguous stance.
“Every woman should make their own decision about their body,” said Auricht, who represents the AfD in Berlin. “With vaccinations too, you cannot say ‘my body my choice’ and then not hold that same principle with receiving the vaccine.”
Gun rights and regulation is also a hot topic for polarized America, and the AfD spokespeople cannot understand the American obsession with guns.
While the far-right narratives are similar worldwide — anti-lockdown fervor, dangerous conspiracy theories, and opposition to gay rights, just to name a few — the U.S. might be in more danger of veering into reactionary politics than Europe is, say analysts.
“There are some parallels with a hard shift to the right and openness by regular conservatives, especially here in the United States, to white supremacy and street movements,” American anti-extremism activist Beirich said. “I think the situation actually is worse here in the United States than it is in Germany.”
Because of Germany’s Nazi past, democracy is better protected by a state that is highly concerned with anti-democratic movements and hate speech, she said.
Beirich points out that far-right wing parties tend to be opportunistic, attaching themselves to crises such as the pandemic to keep their numbers up. If there is another social or economic crisis tomorrow, she said, party support would likely reflect the country’s circumstances.
“They are going to rise and fall in various ways depending on the mood of the country,” Beirich said. “The fringe is not disappearing like they did in previous eras. They seem to have a foothold now and are surviving.”
So the AfD may have lost some ground electorally, but its ideas have seeped into mainstream politics, strengthening the broader array of rightist parties.
Annemarie Schmidt, 74, a retired teacher from Marzahn who identifies herself as left-leaning, admits that she shares the AfD’s concerns over refugees, over rising housing and energy costs and the financial burdens of the war in Ukraine.
Schmidt thinks the climate is ripe for the AfD to do well in the future.
“Poor people here get nothing and the refugees get a lot, so the state makes it difficult for everyone to get along,” Schmidt said. “Though the AfD is taking advantage of these problems, they could be right on this topic. I wouldn’t vote for them, but during the next election the AfD will be very strong.”

By Annie Mark-Westfall
My column is due in two days, and I am staring into a panicked abyss. To inspire myself, I take a brisk walk while my husband puts the kids to bed. As I set out, I narrate and write in my head, badly. I get stuck on whether the word “brisk” is meant to describe the pace or the biting cold, and roll my eyes. For the duration of the walk, I will wrestle my thoughts, alternately trying to focus and to let my mind empty itself. Think. Don’t think. Think.
It gives me flashbacks to being a middle-schooler at a mall in middle America, standing in front of a large display of those 3-D hidden image posters. Those posters were the fake news of the 1990s, I am sure of it. My friends always claimed to see a floating sailboat, while I stood there dumbly.
“Just focus on one spot. Do you see it?”
“No, no! Don’t focus on anything, just let your vision get blurry. Do you see it now?”
My thoughts return to the present, where I am walking quickly in the freezing cold of January in Berlin, musing now on the cliché “waste not, want not.” For a year, I have been rolling this concept over in my head, wondering at the direction of causation. How a refrigerator full of leftovers does seem to reduce my appetite. Just don’t think, Annie.
I pause at the site of Albert Einstein’s old apartment building. It was destroyed in the war. In Berlin, we say “the war” the way New Yorkers say “the city” — as if there is only one. An etched sign marks the location. Berlin does not light its streets the way US cities do, and my neighborhood is particularly residential, so the sign is barely visible. We bring all our visitors here, so I know that it details, both in German and English, how Einstein used to host famous and talented guests. How they would spend evenings discussing the secrets of the universe and other urgent and important matters. Here, he wrote his theory of relativity. THINK, Annie!
The numbness is setting in. I forget how cold Berlin is, and should have worn a longer coat. It was almost 60 degrees when we were back in Ohio for the holidays. A friend who attends the climate negotiations texted me from Katowice, Poland in December, “We are all f*cked. Learn survival skills and move to higher ground.” Don’t think about that.
On the move again, I return to another friend’s idea to relaunch a Berlin salon, reminiscent of the ones run by Jewish women starting from the late 18thcentury. I am desperate for her to do this, and to include me. I think about my living room: its warmth from the radiator, inviting Persian rugs, and soft floor lamps. Our 12-foot ceilings and stained-glass windows. I am a Jewish woman. Can I make this happen? I chasten myself to sit back and stop it. It was not my idea. And my living room is not my own. It has French doors that connect to the kids’ room, and is perpetually strewn with baby dolls, mateless socks, child-size kitchen supplies.
Approaching home now, I recall how earlier in the evening, my 3-year-old asked, “How do you say ‘salad’ in Polish?” I vow that 2019 will be a year of delighting at these questions, rather than a sighed, “I don’t know, baby, eat your dinner.” Think.
I grab my computer and thaw out on the couch. I go online and am both relieved and dismayed to read that my column from last January similarly noted this soul-level exhaustion and lack of inspiration. Think, dammit!
Next to me on the couch is the latest unopened letter from Grandma Bea, her familiar cursive handwriting shaky across the envelope. I adore these letters and their everyday non-news. The essence of her character leaps off the page even as she claims she has nothing to write. This letter once again recounts her delight from a deer’s visit to her backyard bird feeder a few weeks ago. The event has found its way into three letters over the weeks, along with a detailed weather report. “My freezer is full and my fridge is stocked, so let it snow!” Grandma Bea knows how to warm a soul, even from across an ocean.
To start my year, I read When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi, the terminally ill brain surgeon on a quest for the meaning of life. His memoir intersperses quotes from literature and facts from neuroscience, and left me bereft when I turned the last page at the solitary hour of 2:00 am. Thinking now about Dr. Kalanithi’s calling as a doctor, and Grandma Bea’s notes on substituting gluten-free flour in her famous banana cake recipe, my breath catches at their hyper-focused sense of purpose.
Last summer, while I was still on maternity leave, I met up with a friend from college who was passing through Berlin. We sat in a café together, and as I shushed my baby, I hungrily asked questions about her life as a writer, feeling pangs of jealousy. Although I have meticulously crafted my dream life here in Berlin, I admittedly had hoped writing would play more of a role in my life than it currently does.
The conversation turned to one of her award-winning essays, on the topic of whales and something else brilliant and divergent like prison reform. The combination came to her after a professor urged her to return to a subject that she was “passionate about as a child.”
As I sit on my couch now, eight months later, trying again to conjure something that inspired me as a child, I hear the baby cry in the next room, followed by my husband’s voice, urgent, patient, frustrated, calm. I google “3-D image posters” and try to focus.

The P-51 Mustang is one of the most recognizable aircraft in military aviation history, and the story of “Berlin Express” illustrates just how far the Mustang’s legacy reaches.
The warbird’s story begins with American World War II aviator William B. “Bill” Overstreet who hailed from Clifton Forge, Virginia. After enlisting following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Overstreet trained with the U.S. Army Air Corps and was eventually deployed at Raydon Airfield in England. There he joined a squadron of the Eighth Air Force flying Republic P-47 Thunderbolts from RAF Leiston. As the AAF transition to the newer Mustang, Overstreet got his first opportunity to pilot a P-51 on January 30, 1944.
Overstreet named his first P-51, which he received in February 1944 “Southern Belle.” However, the aircraft was lost while being flown in combat by a different pilot a couple of weeks later, causing him to rethink the name. At the time, his squadron was assigned to bomber escort missions with the 357th fighter group regularly flying sorties to Germany, and thus the “Berlin Express” was born. All his subsequent planes went by the same moniker.
The “Berlin Express” P-51B Mustang achieved legendary status during an epic World War II dogfight in Paris in 1944, when Overstreet flew the aircraft under the Eiffel Tower in hot pursuit of a German fighter. Overstreet eventually downed the German Messerschmitt Bf 109G and eluded heavy enemy fire while escaping the battle with the “Berlin Express” intact. This victory was later immortalized by Len Krenzler in a painting of the “Berlin Express’” Eiffel Tower victory.
“Our man Bill was like Daredevil, the man without fear. Between flying so low and dodging enemy fire, he still shot a few bursts of his guns and hit the 109’s engine. In a last-ditch effort, the 109 flew under the Eiffel Tower hoping Overstreet would avoid it — NOPE!” recalled Brian Burnett II, Tour Guide at National Museum of the U.S. Air Force. “Bill followed him under the tower, and as the 109 pulled up, Bill sent him back down in flames. Afterwards, Bill went down to the river and followed it, barely above water level. Under the cover of the structures on either side, he made his way out of the city and back to base,” continued Burnett.
Today, the restored Mustang “Berlin Express” is based on the remains of the P-51B 43–24837. This Mustang flew with the 9th Air Force’s 363rd Fighter Group out of RAF Staplehurst in Kent, England. It crashed in Beckley on June 10, 1944, after the pilot was forced to bail out during a training exercise. Sporting a “Malcolm Hood” canopy and wearing the markings for “Berlin Express,” its paint scheme models the 357th Fighter Group Mustang that Overstreet made famous.
The modern day “Berlin Express” also made a historic transatlantic flight from the U.S. to England with U.S. Air Force Heritage Flight alumnus Lee Lauderback in the cockpit, following the same route it took in 1942 as part of the military troop buildup in the United Kingdom during WWII. The four-day, 5,470-mile journey began June 28, 2017, in Texas and culminated with its landing at Duxford Airfield in England on July 4.
Nearly 80 years after its original landmark moment, the “Berlin Express” will take to the skies with the Horsemen Flight Team in honor of the Italian Air Force’s centennial celebrations in Rome from June 16–18.
Dan Friedkin, who owns “Berlin Express,” will fly the historic aircraft and perform in the Pratica di Mare Air Show on the right wing alongside his longtime Horsemen Flight Teammates Jim Beasley, Jr. and Ed Shipley.
“The ‘Berlin Express’ is an iconic aircraft that symbolizes a defining period in the history of aerial combat,” said Dan Friedkin, chairman and CEO of The Friedkin Group, Horsemen Flight Team member and AS Roma football club president and owner. “It’s an honor to fly in the Pratica di Mare Air Show as we pay homage to the brave men and women who have shaped the course of military aviation. We’re excited to offer people around the world the chance to celebrate Aeronautica Militare’s memorable history and look forward to flying our routine for the first time in Rome, a city that holds a special place in my heart.”

While moving to Berlin was a dream come true and I could go on about all of the things I love about this hedonistic city, it came with its share of adjustments.
Some were easier to acclimate to as I quickly picked up a new way of doing things. Other things I still struggle with, even after a year of living here.
But at the end of the day, it’s all a part of the adventure. Anyone who picks up their life and moves abroad naturally craves change, newness, and a lifestyle shift. However, despite all of the best intentions and a can-do attitude, some things take longer than others to get used to.
— Want to know the flip side? Check out 20 Things I Love About Living in Berlin — From an American Expat for all the magical and exciting things I love about life in Berlin. —
Over the past year, I’ve noted what I’ve found to be frustrating, confusing, or a royal pain in the ass. Keep reading to learn about the harder, more challenging things for Americans moving to Berlin.
Finding a place to live where you can register your address (or Anmeldung in German) is by far the most challenging experience internationals face early on when moving to Berlin. As one of the most populous cities in Europe with the best nightlife in the world, not to mention the culture, history, and booming startup scene, it’s no wonder people from all over the world flock to Berlin’s gates.
Rent prices have skyrocketed in cities across the world, and it’s no different in Berlin. While it’s more affordable than Paris, London, or Amsterdam, it’s not as cheap as it once was either.
For example, I live in Neukölln where rent used to be extremely low since it was once a risky neighborhood to live in. That is no longer the case. Today, Neukölln’s known for eclectic bars, hipster cafes, music venues, green spaces, and some of the best street food Berlin has to offer. No matter what district you wind up in, finding a suitable place to live can be tricky.
Here are some tips that may help your search:
Just remember, when it comes to finding a flat, it becomes a lot easier once you’ve arrived and have feet on the ground. So, if you’re dealing with the madness of finding a place, getting rejected, and losing sleep over securing a spot before you arrive — take a breath and know it will work out once you get here.
2. Germany’s Cash Culture
The phrase “cash is king” takes on a whole different meaning in Germany. Paying with cash is mandatory at many bars, restaurants, shops, and even doctor’s offices in Berlin. If your purchase is a small one, you almost always have to pay with cash. I once got yelled at by a bartender in Friedrichshain when I didn’t have the cash to pay my tab, muttering “In Germany, we use cash.”
This is not the case in the U.S. or any other country I’ve visited in Europe. As one of the most prosperous and wealthy countries in the E.U., it’s surprising that card payments are frequently not accepted. I’m used to it now and always have some amount of cash on me, but it took time before this felt normal.
3. The Bureaucracy
Similar to my previous point, Germany is still lagging in the digitalization department. All important documents are sent by post. Video calls and emails to get legitimate documents are nonexistent. You have to physically visit the administrative and governmental buildings for anything official.
As a result, the system is backed up and it often takes months before you can schedule an appointment with any official administration. While the system is slowly becoming digitalized, it’s a slow process that was exacerbated at the height of the pandemic.
For example, when you’re registering your address or interviewing for a resident permit, it may take months before you can schedule your appointment. The slots fill up so fast, and you have to wait patiently on your computer, hitting the refresh button repeatedly every morning to see if anything opens up. It’s a major headache, but eventually, you begrudgingly accept that that’s just the way it is. You have to play the game.
4. Everyday Items That Are Only Available at the Pharmacy
Buying rubbing alcohol, skin care, flu medicine, or melatonin can all be bought at any drug store in the States. In Berlin, you have to go to the pharmacy (or Apotheke) for all of these things. This can be frustrating when working around limited hours of operation and dealing with the anxiety about speaking German, or trying to, before asking if the pharmacist speaks English.
Luckily, there are apps, like MAYD, that you can use to order from the pharmacy online and avoid this process altogether if you plan ahead.
5. Hours of Operation Aren’t Always Reliable
You know when you need to visit a store after work so you look up the opening hours on Google beforehand to plan your day? You expect it to be open when you get there before closing time, right? Well, depending on the shop, that doesn’t always go as planned in Berlin.
If the shop is slow and nobody’s walked through the door for a while as the end of the day approaches, shops won’t hesitate to close earlier. This has happened to me on multiple occasions when visiting a copy shop, photo studio, butcher, or bakery. Similar to my point about the lag in digitalization, online hours of operation are more of a suggestion than a rule for many small businesses across Berlin.
6. Learning German is Challenging When Everyone Speaks English
Perhaps a blessing and a curse, most people speak English in Berlin. You can actually get away with never learning German and only speaking English if you really want to. Sure, this helps during the initial transition moving from the U.S. to Berlin. But now, after living here for over a year, the improvement in my German language skills hasn’t grown much.
Whenever I try to practice and communicate in German, most people usually recognize that it’s not my native tongue and switch to English. Yes, this is helpful at times, but all in all, you have to work harder to learn the language than you would have to in a smaller city in Germany.
7. Winter Nights Begin at 3:00 PM
Coming from Florida, a state known for its sunshine and tropical climate, getting used to the winter season was a major adjustment — especially during my first winter. After Daylight Saving Time, it gets dark by 4:30 PM and gradually increases to 3:00 by mid-December. The winters are long, cold, windy, and grey. As a result, seasonal depression affects many people and vitamin D deficiency can easily become a problem.
To combat the dreary winter season, consider investing in a sunlight lamp that emits artificial sunshine. I just got one and it’s already making a huge difference. Now that it’s my second winter here, I’m much more mentally prepared. I already know I’m going to be inside more often, and I try to use this time for working on my goals and projects — like practicing my German.
Thankfully, summers in Berlin are incredible and make the winter season worth waiting out. Just hang on until then and you’ll understand why people rough it through the winter.
8. Understanding the Metric System
If you grow up in the U.S., you use the Imperial System for measurements and the Fahrenheit scale for temperature. Except for a handful of other countries, that’s not the case for the rest of the world where the Metric Scale and Celsius degrees are standard.
I remember the first time I tried to bake a pumpkin pie around Thanksgiving because I was feeling homesick. It took forever as I converted quantities for every ingredient from my mom’s recipe while using a measuring cup with few details. Needless to say, my pie didn’t come out splendidly. It didn’t take long before I got proper measuring utensils that converted cups, ounces, and teaspoons to grams, liters, and milliliters.
It helped to change my phone settings to Celsius degrees early on. While I had to look up the Fahrenheit conversions for a long time, it started making sense after a couple of months. Figuring out the differences becomes second nature with time.
9. Grocery Shopping
Shopping at the grocery store can be a bit intimidating the first time in Germany for several reasons, particularly the lighting speed that cashiers scan your items at the check-out line.
The hardest thing for me was grocery shopping in general translating all the ingredients from German to English. I’d often wander around my local Rewe, Aldi, or Nahkauf for hours before finding everything I needed. In retrospect, it’s probably easier to shop online in the beginning.
On the bright side, it’s good practice to familiarize yourself with the German terms for garlic, cinnamon, vegetables, potatoes, and more early on if you plan on making this country home for a time.
10. Doing Laundry Using a Drying Rack
Flats in Berlin don’t come with dryer machines. Instead, you dry your laundry using a drying rack. I made a mess of things my first time or two hanging my clothes that left noticeable indents and wrinkles. Thankfully, my flatmate was able to correct my technique to avoid this problem in the future. It’s simple once you figure it out. That first time or two, though, was something new.
The other aspect is understanding the German settings on the washer machine. I used the scan image feature on my Google Translate app in the beginning. After that, I could figure out the setting by just going off the time limit, temperature, and spin speed.
Even typing this makes me feel extremely privileged to have always had a dryer. Nonetheless, nobody wants to ruin their clothes doing laundry, and this was still something I had to get used to during the first few weeks of life in another country.
I hope this provides some perspective for anyone searching for a realistic view of some difficulties you may encounter when moving to Berlin or another European country from the U.S.
In comparison, my list of “challenges” is much shorter than the list of things that I love about Berlin. Some of the adjustments, like not having air conditioning or learning your shoe size in European measurements, are so trivial in contrast to all of the experiences and growth I’ve enjoyed since moving abroad. If given the opportunity, I’d make the same decision to move abroad a hundred times over — no questions asked.

Travel Date: Oct 25, 2022Trip Duration: 4 daysLocation: BerlinCountry: Germany
It was late October, and autumn had fully embraced Europe. The air was crisp, the leaves were golden, and I found myself in a refreshed state of mind after months of routine in the Netherlands. My last adventure had been to Belgium, and I felt the need for another break — a chance to both recharge and reconnect with a close friend living in Berlin. With that in mind, I booked a BlaBla car, a budget-friendly option, for the 7-hour drive. It was a journey shared with strangers, but the ride turned out to be quite enjoyable, with pleasant conversations and the excitement of traveling to a new place.
As we approached Berlin in the evening, my first glimpse of the city was the iconic Fernsehturm, the famous TV Tower. Bathed in the soft evening light, it loomed over the skyline like a symbol of Berlin’s complex past. Once a broadcasting tower and a proud symbol of Communist power, today it stands as one of the city’s most recognizable landmarks. My first impression of the city was a blend of awe and anticipation.
Eager to experience Berlin, I spent some time wandering the lively streets, soaking in the urban energy and the distinct buzz of the city. The streets were a blend of old and new, modern cafes and shops nestled between centuries-old buildings that told their own stories of Berlin’s history. Eventually, I made my way to my friend’s apartment. It had been years since we last saw each other, so catching up felt like a breath of fresh air. After settling in and relaxing for a bit, my friend decided it was time to introduce me to Berlin’s legendary nightlife. The city came alive after dark, and we hopped from one lively spot to another, enjoying the pulse of the city.
The next day, on the 26th of October, I had planned something a little more structured — a walking tour booked through GuruWalk. The morning air was chilly but refreshing, and I made it to the meeting point just in time. Our guide, knowledgeable and passionate, took us on a historical journey through Berlin’s war-torn past. One of the first stops was Checkpoint Charlie, the best-known crossing point between East and West Berlin during the Cold War. Standing there, I could almost feel the tension and uncertainty that must have hung in the air during those days of division.
As we moved on, we visited the site of Hitler’s final bunker, the very place where he spent the last moments of his life. It was a sobering experience, knowing that beneath the unassuming ground lay a chapter of history that shaped the world. The tour continued, and soon we found ourselves at the Brandenburg Gate, standing tall and proud. This grand monument, once a symbol of division, now stands for unity and peace. Under the unexpectedly warm autumn sun, I took a few photos, trying to capture the magnificence of the gate with its classical columns and rich history. After lingering there for a bit, basking in the sun, I met a traveler from the United States. We clicked immediately, and together, we decided to continue exploring.
Our next destination was the Konzerthaus Berlin, an elegant concert hall known for its neoclassical architecture. The grandeur of the place was awe-inspiring, and I could almost imagine the musical performances that must have filled the air with harmony and culture. We walked the historical streets, each corner revealing layers of Berlin’s rich and sometimes tumultuous past. Eventually, we found ourselves at Berlin Cathedral, a majestic structure that has stood since the 1800s. The cathedral was imposing, with its grand dome and intricate details. Inside, it houses a massive organ with 7,269 pipes, a royal tomb, and offers breathtaking views of the city from its dome. We admired the architecture and strolled through its quiet interior, feeling the weight of history within its walls.
By late afternoon, it was time for me to meet up with some old colleagues from a previous job. Around 5 p.m., I grabbed a quick bite and made my way to Alexanderplatz, one of Berlin’s busiest and most famous squares. We spent the next few hours at Museum Island, a tranquil spot surrounded by stunning museums, and it was the perfect place to catch up and relax. As evening fell, we headed to a cozy bar nearby, where we shared stories, laughed, and reminisced about old times. The hours slipped away effortlessly — there’s nothing quite like the ease of conversation with familiar faces after so long apart.
The next day, October 27th, my friend had some time off, and he suggested we visit Teufelsberg, a unique and slightly offbeat destination. It was once a U.S. listening station during the Cold War, perched atop an artificial hill made from the rubble of WWII. Today, it’s known for its panoramic views and vibrant street art. We hopped on a train and made our way through the city, the excitement of exploring something new bubbling between us. After getting off at the station, we hiked through the Grunewald Forest. The autumn colors were at their peak, and the forest was alive with shades of amber, gold, and crimson. It was a peaceful walk, and the beauty of the season made it all the more special.
Teufelsberg itself was a fascinating place. The structure, abandoned and worn by time, was now a canvas for street artists. The walls were covered in colorful, intricate graffiti, each piece telling its own story. We spent hours wandering around, taking in both the art and the history of the place. The view from the top was breathtaking, offering a sweeping panorama of the city and the surrounding forest. It felt like a hidden gem, a place that not every tourist would think to visit.
Before heading back, we grabbed some Indian snacks at a nearby spot. Later that evening, we decided to make a simple but delicious dinner at home — Aglio olio. My friend had perfected the recipe, and it turned out to be a delightful meal.
The following day was more relaxed. After a leisurely breakfast, my friend gave me a mini-tour of his apartment, which had a fantastic view of the street below and a spacious terrace perfect for parties. The weather continued to surprise us, warm and sunny, which is rare for October in Germany. I spent the day revisiting some of the places I had already seen, this time at my own pace. Walking through the streets with my earphones in, I listened to Rick Steeve’s videos., taking in more of the city’s history and architecture. There’s something deeply satisfying about exploring a city on your own, taking the time to absorb its energy and appreciate its stories.
That evening, my friend invited me to dinner at a fancy Greek restaurant. It was my first time trying Greek food, and the dishes were amazing — rich, flavorful, and hearty. We were joined by a friend of his who was Greek, which made the experience even better as he explained the origins and significance of each dish. After our meal, we took a final stroll through the streets of Berlin. The city had left a lasting impression on me, with its mix of history, culture, and modern vibrancy.
The next morning, I caught my bus back to the Netherlands, reflecting on the incredible experiences of the past few days. Berlin had been everything I hoped for and more — both a journey through history and a personal adventure that I wouldn’t soon forget.

I travel the world exploring high tech low life places. Most of these places are in Asia, but what about Europe? Wikipedia Cyberpunk page mentioned Sony Center in Berlin as an example of cyberpunk-influenced cityscape. Modern incarnations of cyberpunk are exact focus of this blog, so we’re going to Germany!
First place we’ll visit is Potsdamer Platz in Berlin’s central borough called Mitte.
This place is awesome and looks more like Manhattan than a German city.
Being a kid in late 90s I loved a TV show called “Total Recall 2070”. It was loosely based on Philip K. Dick works. Plots of most episodes are quite cheesy, but its futuristic atmosphere was so damn dark and sinister! And you know what? Potsdamer Platz looks and feels exactly like Total Recall 2070.
As I know, no cyberpunk books or movies are based in Berlin, but they definitely should!
Berlin is worth visiting just for Potsdamer Platz, but let’s proceed to the Sony Center, which is nearby.
It is easy to approach Sony Center from Potsdamer Platz, just go where all the neon lights are.
This area consists mostly of shopping malls, offices, restaurants. But who cares? For me it looks exactly like William Gibson’s 80s vision of the future.
Large shining dome reminds me of Highlander 2 movie. By the way, the movie was very much high tech and low life.
Offices on the sides of Sony Center looks super futuristic even without glowing neon lights.
The area of Sony Center and nearby office buildings is quite crowded and noisy. Walk couple of minutes westward and suddenly the streets become empty.
Approaching Tiergarten, Berlin’s central park. It is completely empty at 8pm.
Going to Unter den Linden street, which passes Mitte horizontally. Westernmost part of the street is a place of famous Brandenburg Gate and different government building.
But let’s go east, where Berlin looks more hi tech and noire.
Probably low life is not what you’ll find here, but central Berlin still has its dark vibe at night with techno clubs and dark cold streets.
Mitte reminds me both Manhattan and Moscow, but feels darker than each of them.
Speaking of Moscow, we’re approaching Alexanderplatz which looks a lot like large soviet city, rather than Western Europe.
Which is quite obvious, since this district was a part of Eastern Germany.
When it is foggy, Alexanderplatz feels like a vampire movie.
Visiting Berlin is definitely a good idea for dark future fans. Other districts look less dark, but still interesting to explore. Berlin is easy to reach via major airlines (sometimes with connection in Frankfurt or Munich) and its relatively cheap, comparing to other Western Europe capital cities.

On January 18th, I flew to the city I've been most looking forward to (so far) on my travel itinerary, and Berlin lived up to the hype.
Berlin has a sordid past, but the city has done an incredible job of being as transparent as possible about it. Unlike Madrid, which largely sweeps up its past under a rug, it is impossible to avoid being confronted with the harsh realities of all that has happened in Germany's capital.
Throughout the centre, signs provide a long look at the historical events that tore the city apart over and over again, but also showed how resilient the residents are. Black and white photos reinforce the ravages of war, white crosses honour those who died trying to cross into West Germany, and the path of where the wall stood leaves a jagged scar through the city.
I stayed in an Airbnb Prenzlauer Berg, a hipster neighbourhood in what was Eastern Berlin, brimming with cute restaurants serving vegan breakfasts and stores selling colourful clothing and handmade ceramics from local artists.
My apartment was a stone's throw from the Berlin Wall memorial along Bernhauer Strasse, which was surprisingly informative. For blocks, you follow the line of where the wall stood and read placards in German or French that explain what life was like for people on both sides of the border.
There are also screens where you can watch archival footage, which makes the experience so much more immersive. On the buildings along the walk, giant pictures throughout the forty years of horror show what the area looked like exactly where you were standing. Unfortunately, some residents along the strip fought against having their property cut by the memorial line of the wall. I can't imagine caring more about having a space for a bike rack surrounded by a fence than allowing the city to honour its past and all the people impacted by it. It seems selfish and shortsighted in my opinion.
I'll go through my museum excursions in my next post, but can I just rave about the restaurant scene in Berlin for a second? First of all, no other city I've traveled to in Europe has had as many fantastic vegan options. From fancy and pretentious to junk, it was all easy to find no matter what area I was in, and SO GOOD. It's tasty things like this that demonstrate why not all vegans are skinny. Guilty!

This wasn’t a trip intending to explore the capital. No, I’ve never been to the capital of my home country. But the city of Berlin is also far away from where I grew up in the country.
This trip only led us to the city because we found no closer Decathlon than on the outskirts of Berlin. Decathlon is the sports store where I buy all my sports equipment. From swimsuits and snorkel to hiking pants and boots, sunglasses, and whatever else I need. We even bought an inflatable kayak here.
There are many stores across the world (we even found a Decathlon store in Thailand) but the closest one to our current home was about an hour's drive away. And in Berlin.
We were looking for a bicycle for my husband and that was the reason why we went on the journey to Berlin. Originally I had said I won’t be driving into the city. There’s public transport here. Use it. It’s much more relaxing than taking the car.
But remember, we live in the countryside. It takes a bit until we get to a train station. Or bus stop. Plus, we would be coming back with a bicycle as luggage. Maybe I should get over my shadow and just drive.
We’ve driven in many cities before and even though I wasn’t the driver in Bangkok’s crazy city traffic, I’ve done a…

What is Berlin famous for and why do travellers everywhere recommend and rave about the German capital so often?
Berlin is an eccentric city with an eclectic culture and is one of the most ‘happening’ places in Europe. The city attracts over 14 million visitors every year and tops many tourist’s bucket lists who all want to experience its vibrancy and aesthetic. However, you probably want to know exactly why the city is so highly regarded before booking your next trip.
Let’s find out what is Berlin famous for? And why is it so different to any other capital city?
The city is home to many iconic, quirky buildings and monuments. From the Gothic design of Berlin cathedral, to the Rococo-inspired Charlottenburg Palace, and post-war Brutalist architecture, like the harrowing concrete landscape of the Holocaust Memorial. The city is full of diverse architectural styles.
The Berlin art scene is modern, vibrant and alternative. Whilst the city has many galleries dedicated to classic art, Berlin is probably most famous for its brilliant and bizarre street art, which coats buildings and the remains of the Berlin wall. The creativity of Berlin artists is unparalleled — no concrete surface is safe!
Berlin’s music scene is well known and respected across many genres. The city has three operatic houses — perfect locations to perform the works of German composers like Beethoven, Brahms and Bach, to name a few. Disco, electronic and synthpop are also very popular in the city and many club-goers enjoying dancing till dawn to this modern music in trendy venues.
Speaking of dancing in trendy venues, Berlin’s nightlife is widely considered one of the best in the world. The capital’s most exclusive club and notoriously difficult to enter is Berghain, but there are many other exciting and elusive venues to party in, dotted about the streets.
Berlin is renowned for its charming markets. Some weekly events include a traditional farmer’s market selling German craft food and drink, to hipster flea markets full of handmade treasures. Germany is also famous for hosting magical Christmas markets too, and Berlin is no exception!
Berliners are serious about their sausages! And the currywurst is the most popular item, available on almost every street corner of the capital. Quick n’ easy, yet filling and tasty, the sausage dish is a world-famous German delicacy.
Berlin famously contains many beautiful gardens and clean parks which contrast, yet compliment the built-up, concrete landscape. Tiergarten is perhaps the most famous central garden and is located next to popular attractions the Reichstag and Victory Column.
Berlin’s fascinating, dark past has left behind many abandoned and derelict buildings, some of which are open to exploration, such as an American spy station and an abandoned theme park. The sites are often covered in incredible street art and are a must-see amongst adventurous travellers who enjoy going off the typical tourist paths.
The bear is the mascot of Berlin. It proudly stands on the city’s coat of arms and the Berlin Buddy Bear is a fun interpretation of the animal. Berlin has 140 painted Buddy sculptures scattered around the centre. They have become an integral part of the streets of Berlin, not to mention inspiring many souvenir gifts. Many tourists enjoy counting how many they find on their travels through the city.
This is just a short list about what Berlin is famous for. The city is treasured and respected by so many for an abundance of personal reasons, but anyone lucky enough to have seen the capital can agree it is a unique and visit-worthy city.
Will you add Berlin to your bucket list?

This is the Fernsehturm Berlin, the TV tower. Built in the late ’60s, at 1206 feet it is the tallest structure in Germany and third tallest in Europe.
During the Cold War, there were two independent Germanies:
Berlin was entirely within East Germany but was divided into sectors, the US, French, British, and Soviet. Westerners were limited in going to Berlin in the first place, but getting to East Berlin was a major hassle.
There were three roads from West Germany to Berlin, and they were carefully monitored. None of my friends even considered trying that drive. There was also a rail service from Frankfurt to Berlin, the Berlin Duty Train. Like the three highways, carefully planning and getting the required approvals was essential for the train.
However, I did get to East Berlin for a couple of days in 1981. Co-worker Bill (of the Vienna trip fame) and I got a military hop from our base in West Germany to Berlin. Melinda, one of our friends, had just been transferred there as a protocol officer. Clever of us to have a friend in that business, wasn’t it? She had arranged rooms for us in the huge hotel at Tempelhof airport.
Because the city was still occupied, you couldn’t just go into East Berlin and wander around. We had to wear our military uniforms so you know how much we stood out among the locals.
My first thought when we started sightseeing was how stern all the people looked. Not that they disliked us, but like they were not enjoying life there. We saw lots of rubble still there from the war years. Guess I’d have expected more repair work to have been done by then, 1981.
Checkpoint Charlie was and is still known as a major symbol of the Cold War so we wanted to see it. It was the only approved checkpoint, walking or driving, for foreigners and military personnel. (Sorry, my picture isn’t too good; couldn’t Photoshop it enough.)
This is me, in uniform, at the Brandenburg Gate in the Soviet zone. People and vehicles could use it freely until August 1961 when the Berlin Wall was built. The Wall enclosed the entire city, passing right by the west side of the gate. President Ronald Reagan gave his famous ‘Tear down this wall’ speech near the Gate in June 1987. As you may remember, the Wall was ended in December 1989.
Thanks again to Melinda; we got a tour of West Berlin, the Wall, and even into East Berlin just a bit. She’d arranged a helicopter tour for a visiting US Air Force general. You know biggies often get special treatment and opportunities.
Since the General’s aide was the only other passenger, Melinda asked the General to take two visiting USAF officers. He kindly agreed. I’d been in a helicopter before, even saw the Tucson home of a mafioso kingpin from one! This trip was unique, a matter of international law, I guess. Flying over the Wall into the Soviet Zone was a huge no-no. But the crew said they did it regularly, just a brief crossover, to maintain US rights!
Is this cheating? It’s me at the Berlin Wall from the good guy side, on a different trip.
Now, about that TV tower…
Like the Brandenburg Gate, it is one of the most prominent symbols of Berlin. When the sun shines (as it does once in a while in Germany) it reflects on the tower’s dome in the shape of a Greek cross, a symbol against the East German removal of crosses from churches during the Cold War!

Germany is Europe’s most important country. It is the most economically powerful country on the continent, a heavyweight in political and humanitarian affairs, and the EU’s most populous country.
Yet its capital city, Berlin, is a bit of a disappointment. Despite its urban sprawl, it boasts quite a small population for the capital of such a big country — significantly lower than Istanbul, Paris or London.
It’s also quite poor for the capital of such a rich country — until 2018, Berliners were actually poorer than the national average. That means that Berlin was in the extraordinary position of being a capital city that dragged down the rest of the national economy. Even now, many big cities in Germany (Munich, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Stuttgart etc) are richer than Berlin.
Nevertheless, like virtually all capital cities, Berlin has a dream to sell. London and New York brand themselves as the financial rulers of the world; Paris sees itself…

I was back in Berlin last year after a long gap. The last time I was there I was lucky enough to attend an event the Business Design Summit. I can safely say that event changed the course of my work and heavily influenced the canvas card based approach we are using in IASA Global across the BTABOK and the IASA learning programs.
The event was pitched for visionary leaders, executives, entrepreneurs, and consultants (hard to know what I was then). It was an exciting point in time where a group of visionary thinkers were coming together to share their ideas, merge methods, find connections and co-design a new toolbox for business.
The pitch…
People improving todays businesses and building tomorrows need new, practical, strategies to deal with today’s brutal new business environment. A handful of visionary business thinkers, educators, authors, and world class entrepreneurs know this. Separately, that’ve been crafting a new business toolbox and playbook. What if all that knowledge, experience, and all those tools came together?
The people behind this event brought together strategy, innovation, entrepreneurship, design thinking, leadership, culture.
Yves Pigneur, Rita Gunther McGrath, Mark Johnson, Luke Hohmann, Dave Gray, David Sibbets, Henry Chesbrough, Alex Osterwalder, Stefano Mastrogiacomo, Lisa Kay Solomon, Steve Blank plus Patrick van de Pijl (apologies for the image quality the best the internet could provide).
Each of them had published books, academic papers and created toolkits to support businesses in what they described as a ‘brutal new business environment’. About ~300 people from all over the world arrived in Berlin hosted in the Classic Remise Berlin on 19th & 20th April 2013 a restored tram depot with displays of Classic cars.
We were crammed in, packed tables and a palpable energy. The focus was to discuss, explore, evolve a practical toolkit to do the jobs that we needed to do. These were new thinking tools their goal to improve the quality of thinking and elevate the level of conversation.
What resulted was 2 days and nights of playing with these tools and realising that each one was like a finding a magic potion. Mostly presented as 2D canvases e.g. Business Model Canvas. They were infinitely flexible and multi-dimensional they had depth, they could jump through time and let me play with different futures. They were also scalable and malleable they could be scaled up & down, twisted and repurposed to suit different contexts and problem spaces. They were light and could be created and abandoned (not like the document heavy worlds that are still pervasive). And lastly they were ‘mostly’ open source allowing both use and derivative works to be created, moving away from strictly proprietary works, frameworks and methods which presumed to have some secret sauce that imbued the creator with the mystical powers of transformation. Alex Osterwalder recently posted a reflection on the journey here.
I came away energised and excited about how these ideas could be used; our company was christened Business Model Adventures as we saw the opportunity to take people on creative adventures to discover new opportunities.
I’m an Architect, I saw the need for a toolchain to help me do the work I was doing better. I started searching, curating and integrating lightweight tools, canvases, cards, kits, games and methods into my practice. Where a tool didn’t exist I tried to fill a gap, overtime what I realised was that each tool fulfilled a need I had and fit into my practice.
If you want a great article on the modern architect read David Jones recent CIO.com piece on juggling architect identities and activities.
My own view has always been that an architect worth their salt is involved in…
Architecture got lost in standards, frameworks, methods, debates about “what is architecture?” and “what is an architect?”, trend chasing and surfing and lots and lots of documentation for us by us (write-only; no one reads). In hindsight it feels indulgent, self-interested, self-important and self-centred. I wasn’t above this, I did these things; I committed these sins so I feel the self-criticism is justified.
It feels like an eternity since I wrote this article about the impact of our approach to documentation. What the canvas methods offered was an opportunity to strip this back and rethink the work. To paraphrase Lisa K Solomon “conversation is the technology of architecture” the canvases became a language to design strategic conversations.
First the language — to design a strategic conversation, I think through what I need to understand and the destination we (‘conversations’ are sometimes but rarely solo) want to arrive at. Canvases can be used to clearly describe the flow of the conversation and the outcome of each piece is clear.
Second, the canvas provides a frame and a constraint for a part or the whole of the conversation. Take business model canvas as an example, it’s trying to capture the essence of a business model in 9 panels. It’s highly opinionated it doesn’t care about low level detail, it omits the environment it lives in. It asks the questions —
Third it provides a shared externalised focus for a conversation and a frame to build a shared mental model. One thing I think is underestimated is the effort it takes to create a model for anything with multiple elements in the human brain. The problem is amplified when I’ve got more than one person involved. Imagine 2 people have to create a mental model of the same elements at the same time in the same way. Without a frame and a common language this becomes impossible. The canvas creates a space for shared focus and understanding inside a constrained model. Now we can engage with the canvas physically and share a mental model.
I’ve found that the ability to point at something to bring attention to an element is critical; “let’s look at the customers” brings everyone into a collective focus. We can then navigate and build a narrative e.g. “what’s our relationship to this customer?”. We let the story unfold using the canvas as the guide.
Fourth the canvas method allows injecting prompts as questions to support facilitation and improve the repeatability and predictability of the process.
The work Lewis Curtis and others have done on question-based analysis (PBAAM Perspective Based Architecture Analysis Method) comes into focus as the questions become part of the tool.
Fifth canvases are composable and connectable each canvas regardless of it’s origin or choice of terminiology can ‘usually’ be mapped onto a metamodel e.g. ebmm, archimate. We then have a model elements with clear relationships, we begin to join the dots. See here on creating a metamodel from Ardoq.
Sixth canvases promote rapid prototyping and refactoring in lo-fi friendly ways. I don’t need much to get started, a printer is handy or online tools like miro, but anything works — napkin, paper, post-it, whiteboard and something to make a mark with a sharpie, pen, crayon. I can create, adapt, destroy and repeat; all of this can be done at speed. One thing we do in IASA Training is model a business in 12 minutes. I stole this from Alex Osterwalder he did it with an audience of about 500 people in pairs modelling their businesses with a 12 minute time limit.
Seventh, we build collective memories; the artefacts we create build a collective memory that all participants benefit from, the structure aids memory and recall while the outputs act as physical/digital reminders of the process that can be easily referred to.
Eighth, last but not least, number 8. The canvas method lends itself to VIVID Thinking approaches, Dan Roam in Blah, Blah, Blah , David Sibbets and the guys at Grove, Sunni Brown the doodle manifesto and last but by no means least Dave Gray. Their collective work in Visual Thinking, Graphic Facilitation, Workshop design and Facilitation (e.g. Gamestorming) has helped. Lest I forget Per Kristiansen and the guys in Lego Serious Play who extended the LSP method to support BMC and other canvas-based methods.
Of all of these factors the most powerful for me has been #8. The creativity that comes from these visual approaches is rocket fuel, this quite literally rewired my brain. I couldn’t look at a business without trying to model it with BMC; I couldn’t experience a journey without starting to model the customer experience on a journey map.
I’ve been involved in IASA and the development of the profession and practice of architecture for 20 years now, I first contacted Paul about setting up an IASA Chapter in Ireland in 2005, after 3 tries we got it up and running in 2008. I went through IASA Core training in 2010 in Stockholm with Andy Ruth. I became an instructor and delivered this program many times all over world. I then had the opportunity to participate in a redesign of the course which ultimately led to the canvas-based methods outlined in the BTABOK and last year the publication in Miro Universe of the canvases.
As with everything my thinking has evolved with my experience. I’ve spent since 2018 working in the health service in Ireland. The journey has been incredible, the experiences and the people likewise. We’ve battled through COVID, a major cyber attack, the Ukraine response, the development of Digital for Care a strategy for digital health in Ireland to 2030, the development of the HSE Health App, the procurement of a National Shared Care Record and many other side hustles. I’ve used, stretched, stressed and tested most of the methods in different contexts and in different ways. I’ve never been pure about this, I’ve remixed and riffed where necessary to fit the situation, culture and people.
Like everything many of the canvases/cards captured what was going on in my head at that point in time; me today would certainly argue with me 10 years ago. The BTABOK will be the place where these updates begin to emerge.
Where did the journey lead? I was solving my own problems and following my own curiosity first and foremost. The work has helped me and hopefully clients and colleagues I’ve worked with over the years overcome some formidable challenges. It’s been a busy few years in Health in Ireland and I haven’t had a lot of time to reflect on the journey too much.
One thing that happened last year that I haven’t had a chance to mark yet is that I became an IASA Fellow. I was attending a CAF Summit (Chief Architect Forum) event in Amsterdam.
In a ceremony in the Miro offices (thanks Grisha and the team in miro) in Amsterdam I became the 15th IASA Fellow.
If my impostor syndrome wasn’t strong enough, I look at the other fellows and I wonder. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting and talking to many of them through the years Grady Booch, Angela Yochem, Scott Whitmire, Daniel Akenine, Max Poliashenko, Eoin Woods and I’m grateful and humbled to have my name mentioned next to theirs. Years of conversations with so many friends and colleagues also helped shape my thinking.
Paul Preiss, Leo Peyton, David Jones, Dennis Mulder and other friends and colleagues who have been along for the ride were there to help me celebrate. This ended in a wonderful wander through Amsterdam with Leo reflecting on what I have to acknowledge as a major event in my career.
Three final thank yous to Paul Preiss who has been a friend, co-conspirator, confidante, collaborator none of this would have happened in the way it happened if Paul hadn’t started IASA 20+ years ago (thanks brother :), to the alptitude and Happy Valley gang Laurence, Carlos, Jack, Arno and the rest of the gang, our recent trip recharged me. Lastly to Orlaith my life and business partner who has helped, created, developed, listened, and otherwise dealt with Gar’s canvas obsession and the mess of paper, post-its, canvi, thanks Orlaith!
My handle on medium, twitter and elsewhere was always @aspiringarc. I always felt that this acted as a constant reminder of the correct mindset to maintain.
Always be aspiring!
There is no end to the learning, growth development and there is certainly no end to my optimism, curiosity and enthusiasm. Architecture is a team sport, a collaborative endeavour and most importantly in my head it’s always been a big game to play and an infinite game at that.
So this started as a trip down memory lane and it’s ending on a hopeful and grateful note of thanks to all who have shared their knowledge and helped me through my career and life, you know who you are…

I’ve been fascinated by some concepts over the years. Tao - a way or a path, but more so one that is in in harmony. Another concept is Tradecraft — the techniques used in espionage particularly in regime change. I hope this will be a place to reflect on ideas related to this.

“To me, Berlin is as much a conceit as a reality. Why? Because the city is forever in the process of becoming, never being, and so lives more powerfully in the imagination.” — Rory MacLean
Gabriela Trofin-Tatár
“Travel has been the fire that has shaped my current self, accumulating layers of complexity in my thinking, thoughts, and actions as a result of my journey’s successes and failures.” Gabriela Trofin-Tatár
Attending the Dreaming Europe Student Congress in 2006 was an eye-opening experience for the 20-year-old me. This trip left a lasting mark on my journey of self-discovery and wanderlust.
The visit to the hall of the European Parliament in Berlin fueled my passion for international affairs and diplomacy, igniting my determination to pursue studies abroad. During this transformative journey, I also had the unexpected pleasure of making two Danish friends, foreshadowing my future adventures in Denmark.

Last summer I went to Berlin and it was beautiful. Despite the heat wave that had been sweeping across Europe when visiting, it didn’t ruin the experience — even if we were sweating.
After taking an overnight train on Friday, I woke and started my early day in Berlin on Saturday. I had planned the day out so that I would see most of Berlin in my limited time (I had to leave by Sunday night) and it was successful, hitting most of the main spots. However, there is some things I missed, so if you want a more in-depth experience I’d recommend staying longer. Berlin is not a smaller European city like Copenhagen, but a huge area a Manhattan-style feel at points.
Here is how I saw Berlin in about 48 hours:
Right off the train stop you will be able to walk towards Brandenburg gate and the Reichstag (German Parliament building).

There are thousands of films shot in Berlin (click for city map). Opposite to many other shooting locations, Berlin surpasses the mere location tag. Instead, the city is a breathing creature, making it a character on its own.
It holds true not only in movies, though. When visiting Berlin, I felt like walking through Berlin is to walk through human memory, through disaster and overcoming. It was a walk through the urban movements seemingly never stopping to run its streets, breathe from its walls and remind us about the history and human condition.
Here are 4movies (to be frank, I only watched 3 of them, and adored 2.5) that are must-sees before visiting berlin. Or, you may just follow my path and watch the first three.
The movie takes a look into East Berlin life of intellectuals in 1984.
The scenes of the prison of the lives of others were filmed in the Royal Prison, the former Central Prison of State Security (Stasi) of the German Democratic Republic, today converted into the memorial site of Berlin-Hohenschönhausen. If you wish to book a visit, you must first register here. What’s more, former prisoners often offer guided tours where they narrate their personal experience.
Run Lola Run is a movie that literally takes you through Berlin in the turn of century. From now oh-so-hip Friedrichstraße to Charlottenburg near the National Opera, with stops on the Museum Island, Lola is on the mission to save her boyfriend’s life (literally). The other storyline of the movie conveys the saving of herself. Visiting her father, and running through the whole Berlin, she finds herself once again.
She also passes through Schlesischer Tor, Oberbaumbrücke in Kreuzberg or the beautiful square of Gendarmenmarkt in Mitte among many other streets.
In short, its route does not make any geographical sense, but how good and beautiful is Berlin from beginning to end from home and in less than an hour and a half?
Berlin, Symphony of a Great City has an incalculable historical value: this silent film immerses us in day-to-day life in the centre of Berlin in 1927, a Berlin that we neither knew nor will know as it would be reduced to rubble a few more years late.
Probably only the river Spree has remained immutable since then. The Berlin Cathedral, like so many other buildings and monuments portrayed by Walter Ruttmann’s camera, we only know of its recent reconstruction. And others, like the Royal Palace in Berlin, cannot be visited again until 2019 (next year).
Roberto Rossellini stood in what was left of Berlin in 1947, made a casting between non-professional actors and filmed the third chapter of the quintessence of the Italian neorealist: the trilogy of Rome, Appointment aperta, Paisà and this Germania, Anno Zero.
The result is devastating. Edmund Kohler is thirteen years old and wanders through the centre of Berlin with the sole purpose of surviving and helping his family survive. The backdrop is a Reichstag that is already only rubble and the barren esplanade of the Tiergarten, whose wood served to warm German homes during World War II.
The penury was such on and off the screen that many actors escaped when it came time for repatriation after recording the interiors of the film in Rome.

A couple of decades ago, what began as casual weekend hikes with friends — just a few hours in the mountains — slowly evolved into a deeper exploration of local and state parks. A curiosity for new adventures soon led to the discovery of National Parks across the country, and that passion expanded into international travels, exploring nature’s preserved wonders in parks around the world.
Along the way, it became clear that some of the most breathtaking and inaccessible parts of nature could only be reached through multi-day hiking and backpacking trips. These journeys, typically lasting 7 to 10 days, became a regular part of travel, often solo. Trips around the world were undertaken, each offering a unique experience and challenge. Over time, 20+ hikes were completed, each with its own set of lessons and rewards.
This growing love for exploration led to a shift in how trips were planned. Hiking and biking along coastlines, following rivers, and exploring port cities offered new perspectives. Night walks through urban landscapes provided a chance to see cities in a whole new light, often traversing them in unusual shapes like O, S, W, M, and X.
Last year, the focus turned to recent history, with travels through the Balkan countries. A deeper interest in historical trails soon emerged, culminating in the discovery of the Berlin Wall Trail — a 99-mile loop around Berlin. Fascinated by the trail’s historical significance and the surrounding landscapes, this became the perfect opportunity to explore the city and its neighboring regions in a way that blended history, culture, and nature.
During the visit, the energy in Berlin was undeniable, with a culture that’s constantly evolving yet still deeply rooted in its vibrant past. It’s a city that attracts tourists, but somehow still manages to feel like a place where locals truly live. Over the years, it’s become safer and more accessible, but what really stood out was how seamlessly everything is connected. The public transportation system made getting around a breeze, which only added to what made the experience so memorable. With the river winding through Berlin, it’s impossible not to feel the weight of over 30 years of division between East and West. That history is still very much present, and its echoes can be seen in so many corners of the city today. Walking along the carefully crafted Berlin Wall Trail gave me a deep sense of how far Berlin has come since reunification. The city feels like it’s truly found its stride — growing, changing, but always preserving the memories of its divided past.
Though initially set to walk the entire loop of the trail, after 4 days exploring its most iconic portions, it became clear the industrial sections could easily be skipped. This saved time was then reinvested in visiting nearby cities — Hamburg, Hannover, Bremen, and Celle — spending another 4 days soaking in Germany’s unique charm.
In this trip of 8 full days, an amazing 120 miles (190 kilometers) were walked, with hardly 10% of the routes repeated. Staying in city centers made it easy to take public transportation, using time effectively. The convenience of downtown hotels also made nighttime exploration effortless.
Hamburg stood out as a major port city, with its significant role in global trade. The city’s impressive post-WWII rebuilding efforts were evident, and the mix of modern, sleek architecture alongside remnants of historic buildings created a unique atmosphere, highlighting Hamburg’s resilience. A tour of the Airbus plant offered a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at aircraft production.
Hannover, though less touristy, had a quieter, almost deserted feel, which allowed for relaxed exploration and the opportunity to take day trips to nearby Bremen and Celle.
Bremen charmed with its well-preserved UNESCO sites, like the Town Hall and Roland Statue. The medieval architecture and cobblestone streets exuded timeless old-world charm.
Lastly, Celle felt like stepping into a fairytale, with its picturesque half-timbered houses. The historical center offered a perfect blend of history, culture, and cozy cafés, making it a delightful place to explore.
Overall, this format of exploring cities with rich history by foot was incredibly rewarding. It keeps the mind curious, constantly discovering new details, and made this trip unforgettable.
Closing Thought — Berlin Wall and Beyond
This journey through Germany, spanning over 120 miles of history-rich exploration, reaffirmed the joy of traveling on foot. From the Berlin Wall Trail to the charming streets of Hamburg, Hannover, Bremen, and Celle, this trip was an immersive blend of history, culture, and nature. Each city added its own flavor — Hamburg’s resilient port spirit, Bremen’s medieval UNESCO treasures, Hannover’s quiet allure, and Celle’s fairytale-like charm — together painting a vivid picture of Germany’s past and present.
The decision to walk through these cities wasn’t just about covering miles; it was about connecting with the soul of each place. The Berlin Wall Trail, with its emotional weight, felt like a journey through time. I could almost feel the ghosts of the Cold War as I walked along its path. Even in cities with less obvious history, like Hannover, the quiet streets told their own story.
Walking gave me the freedom to truly absorb the atmosphere — no rush, no rigid plans, just a deep dive into local life. The convenience of public transport in Germany allowed me to move seamlessly between iconic landmarks, neighborhoods, and hidden gems, maximizing every moment of daylight.
Ultimately, this trip reaffirmed that history is best experienced on foot. Each step taken brought a new perspective, whether it was a look at post-WWII reconstruction in Hamburg or a quiet afternoon in Celle’s picturesque town center. There’s something powerful about walking through a place, experiencing its rhythms, and understanding its past.
After 8 days and 120 miles, it’s clear that this way of exploring — slow, deliberate, and connected to the land — offers the richest insights. Germany’s history, from the Berlin Wall to its modern-day cities, is an open book, one that’s best read one step at a time.

Note: Most of these are around Prenzlauer Berg/Mitte because I would be the last person to travel across the city for a workout.
I was born without a single athletic bone in my body, and I was okay with it until I moved to Germany. Why do Germans love Sport machen so much?! I began to feel the FOMO shortly after moving here. I tried going to the gym and also doing YouTube workouts- but turns out I am bad at consistency unless there is a later cancellation fee on the horizon. Luckily, the company I work at presented me with a discounted Urban Sports Club membership and so I was able to also mache Sport and discover my favourite studios/workout classes.
If you are a party person (I am not), you’ve definitely heard of Club Athleten’s CLUB BOXING classes. These are a mix of boxing and HIIT workouts, paired with a techno soundtrack and super groovy studios. But if you’re looking to build your booty, ASS ASS ASS is my favourite class at Club Athleten. They’ve got a bunch of workouts to choose from, and regardless of which on you choose, it’ll feel like a party!
If you’re on that clean girl or pilates girlie vibe, then a barre class is exactly what you need. Barre is mixture of pilates, yoga, ballet and strength training and will definitely leave the studio feeling the burn. Feel the Barre has some of the most attentive instructors who will make sure you’ve got the correct form. My favourite class is the BarreSIGNATURE- this gives you a taster of all of the classes they offer, that focus on different areas (core, strength, cardio, etc).
BEAT81 is another Berlin classic and I think it’s for the people that love an extreme workout (or maybe I am just that unfit). BEAT81 will push you to new lengths when it comes to cardio and strength training, as well as indoor cycling. What makes it more fun is the heartrate trackers you wear during the workouts, and you can track your progress on a screen. My favourite class at BEAT81 was the Strength class- which they describe as low on cardio but it still killed me (in the best way).
Despite having grown up in India, I was never someone who did yoga, except when I was forced to at school. However, because I grew up in India and have experienced real yoga, I am a snob when it comes to yoga instructors. To my delight, Yogic Escape offers that exact authentic Yoga experience. It is Indian owned, and all the instructors I’ve had so far have been great. I cannot recommend the Yoga for Beginners class enough. The class size is quite small so your form will be corrected and you will be pushed, but you will leave feeling lighter and stronger.
Yeah Studio offers a range of Pilates, Barre and Yoga classes, as well as teacher trainings. I love the Barre45 class by Tanja, and the Yobarre class too. Both classes use various props to elevate your workout and all the instructors are super motivating. There’s always a friendly community feeling as well.
Every week when I walk into Rocycle, I feel boujee and part of something exclusive- so you best believe I never skip a Rocycle class. Rocycle, on paper is a spin class but in reality is so much more. Not only does it incorporate some ab exercises and weights (all while on the bike), it is a great way to put away all your screens and forget about everything on the outside for 45 mins. A dark room, loud music, choreohraphy and a motivating instructor is really a great combination for a fun and effective workout.
Ride and Rocycle have the same concept and I would say they are equally good. The bonus with Ride is that you can book a class based on the type of music you like working out to. The closest studio to me is also smaller than the Rocycle one and it feels like the employees and regulars know each other well which is super cute.
Boaré is another one of my local studios that offers a variety of Pilates, Yoga, and Meditation classes. I enjoy their Pilates selection, as everyone class I have taken has left my legs SHAKING. I also tried a Sound Healing here and it left feeling ever so relaxed.
If the clean girl aesthetic was a studio, then this would be it. I have only taken classes at the Prenzlauer Berg studio, but all of their studios look equally beautiful. Hale.Now offers a range of Yoga, Pilates, Barre, Meditation and Sound Healing classes. I live for their Pilates Sculpt class (which literally books out instantly on Urban Sports). Their signature class is called Female Strength and it’s next on my list to try out.

My first days in Berlin were terrible. The apartment I agreed to rent based only on photographs was too cold: Spartan in its hyper-masculine functionality. It would not warm up. It also became clear that I could not get by on English alone despite Berlin’s reputation as a cosmopolitan hub. I bought cream cheese when I wanted yoghurt, and had to use sign language in the grocery store, bakery, and flower shop. Buying tickets for the subway was not easy either. I walked around in an alienating landscape in which most of the signage was incomprehensible, newspapers made no sense, and I required GoogleTranslate to use the washing machine. It was unsettling to be able to discern the letters, but not the words. I realized that German acquisition, even basic German, was necessary if I wanted to interact with people outside the Anglophone expat cocoon, and if I wanted a more meaningful connection to my new home.
Fortunately, I am good with languages. That talent paired with a six-week language course and being unabashed about speaking terrible German has made a difference. Now I can talk to the butcher, the baker, and the Siemens washer. The other thing that has made a difference is my decision to get to know this city through its bookstores. I resolved to visit a different bookstore each weekend, and from there to launch my explorations of the neighborhood in which the store stood. This would get me out of my (cold) apartment, and into Germany’s capital, get me walking, looking at buildings, and discovering food, shops, and public spaces.
How happy I am with my choice, because Berlin is thick with bookstores. I won’t bore you with statistics, just my anecdotal experience coming from New York via Los Angeles. Brentwood, my old neighborhood in La-La Land, is thick with movie stars, and nail salons. There’s no lack of storefronts offering manicures and pedicures and juice cleanses, but there was not a single bookstore within walking distance (or even easy driving distance) of my apartment on Sunset Boulevard. Contrast that with at least ten bookstores within a ten minute walk of my current apartment in Berlin’s Prenzlauer Berg, and several just steps away. Even Morningside Heights, my Manhattan neighborhood, can boast of only Book Culture (formerly Labyrinth Books), the wonderful, intellectual heavyweight on 113th Street, and its sister store on Broadway and 116th Street, across from Columbia University’s gates.
But it’s not only Berlin’s high per capita of bookshops that I wish to extol, it is also their variety, specificity, and idiosyncrasy. You find the usual suspects of course, like bookshops devoted to children’s books or used books or art books, but I have also found bookshops aimed at naturalists; crime fiction aficionados; cookbook enthusiasts; travel nuts; theater buffs; sci-fi fiends; visual design freaks; and expat Anglos. There are so many others still waiting to be discovered. Let’s take a short walk from the Wasserturm,
the 19th century brick water tower that anchors my part of Prenzlauer Berg, to see what I mean.
Walking north on pretty, cobblestoned Ryke Straße, past the synagogue and its security detail, will take us to the intersection with Wörther Straße. A right on Wörther leads to St. George’s Bookshop, a purveyor of second-hand English books since 2003, and a left finds us in front of Georg Büchner Buchladen and its enticing window display. From Wörther Straße, walk north on Kollwitz Straße and its popular cafes and restaurants and cross Danziger to Senefelder; continue north until you get to the intersection of Senefelder and Raumer Straße and Buch Reigen. Their beautiful children’s books (yes, in German) have been tempting me since I moved into the quarter. Then walk west on Raumer to Helmholtzplatz, a lovely square where, on Sundays, neighborhood folks sell clothes, books, and toys. Then a quick right on Duncker Straße and a left on Letter Straße, following the tree-lined square, until you reach Buchbox! and its outdoor racks with postcards and wooden toys. From there, take Lychener Straße north and turn left on Stargarder Straße to find the Buchhandlung Moby Dick. If instead we had walked east and south from the Wasserturm we would encounter about one block east at the corner of Knaack Straße and Prenzlauer Allee the Mowgwa Antiquariat, a used bookstore with a small English section. Continuing south on Prenzlauer Allee and then going east on Heinrich Roller Straße takes us to the Einar and Bert Theaterbuchhandlung, a sweet corner where, on the right day, you can enjoy your tea and book in a sunny spot overlooking Leise Park.
Admittedly, Prenzlauer Berg, which was formerly in East Berlin, has changed dramatically since the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989: the once dilapidated apartment buildings are festooned with refurbished balconies and terracotta ornamentation, and their marble floors, tile work, and stained glass windows gleam. Coffee shops, yoga studios, organic food joints, and chic boutiques welcome both the local gentry and tourists.
Yet the bookstore is flourishing, when it has all but disappeared in comparable neighborhoods in American cities. In Berlin, the bookstore thrives even in less affluent and more demographically diverse neighborhoods. Two such are Kreuzberg and Neukölln, where a range of booksellers coexist with mosques, döner kebab shops, and Middle Eastern food marts.
What is it about this city? How do the book and the spaces in which it can be held, beheld, smelled, heard and, dare I say it, tasted, continue? Is it rent control? Is it state support? Is it Berlin’s vaunted independent artistic sensibility, emblematized by repeated references to body art and body piercings? Is it Berlin’s exceptional character, its special air, and its sexiness, as in Berlin ist arm, aber sexy? Translation: Berlin is poor but sexy.
Whatever it is, I have been seduced. I have fallen for this city’s intellect, its understated style — or is it studied shabbiness? — and the opportunities it presents to engage with the physicality of the book in a variety of spaces — sleekly modernist, cheerfully colorful, musty and cavelike, or hiply furnished in typical Berlin style with wooden pallets and mid-century modern. The sheer somatic pleasure of letting the eye wander, having it alight on a book, picking it up, feeling its heft, the pliability or resistance of its binding, turning its pages, noticing their typecasting, the sprawl of lines or their compact containment in stanzas, getting a waft of age or crisp newness, finding an inscription, a coffee smear, a tear, underlined text, or marginalia in a brisk hand.
I think it’s telling that the German word for bookstore is Buchhandlung, a compound of the words buch and handlung, the word retaining, unlike the English, the tactility of the operation, and the implication and involvement of the hand, and of the entire body in the act of engaging the book.
Editor’s Note: Tomorrow, we feature Subhashini Kaligotla’s interview with St George’s Bookshop bookstore owner Paul Gurner.

But what exactly is Pictoplasma? Similar to the question posed in “The Matrix,” I found myself needing to discover the answer for myself. Let me explain: In 2004, I bought the first Pictoplasma character book in a bookstore in Switzerland and was completely captivated. I also visited their very informative website at the time and gathered that it was a meeting for character designers. Since that day, I wanted to attend Pictoplasma myself. However, it took me 20 years to finally make it. So in May 2024, I attended the conference in Berlin. On the first day, I felt a bit overwhelmed, not because of what was offered, but due to the organization. Everyone had to wait patiently until they could register. I felt a bit lost, but around 3:30 PM, things finally got started. I went to the registration and then directly to the first exhibitions by the artists who would be giving talks in the coming days. I saw some of the works and took them in. Then I wandered around the venue for a while.
The next day, the conference truly kicked off. According to the program, some highly renowned artists from the scene had gathered in Berlin. I attended talks by Joe Bennett, a young designer and animator from the USA. He recently made waves with his series “Scavenger Reign” on HBOMax, a sci-fi series that looks like it could have come from the mind of the artist Moebius. He has been working on this series for over seven years, and it will be available on Netflix in the coming months. His other works for Adult Swim and Fox also stand out, characterized by a quirky but endearing sense of humor.
Additionally, the artist duo “Los Calladitos” really impressed me. Their stunning murals depicting a fantastical world centered around the preservation of light captivated me. They work on their pieces with incredible care and creativity. They also showed some animations from their own film, which brought even more life to their characters and world. Unfortunately, I missed a talk by Peter The Roman, an artist known for experimenting with AI in his 3D worlds. However, I saw some of his works in the exhibitions spread across various locations in Berlin. Overall, 20 artists participated, giving talks and workshops.
But what sets Pictoplasma apart? It’s not merely a stage for artists; it’s also one of the largest communities in the realm of character art and animation. The “Artist Talks” provided profound insights into the world of artists: their methodologies, how they develop ideas and strategies, and how they publish, sell, and make a living from their art. It’s a platform for exchange and collaboration, bringing creatives from diverse backgrounds together. Moreover, the conference reflects the zeitgeist of 2024. In a world dominated by AI, Pictoplasma artists emphasize the importance of emotion and craftsmanship. It became evident that while AI is a valuable tool for ideation, the execution of most artists’ works remains in human hands. This realization, which I suspected before Pictoplasma, was confirmed and reinforced during the event. Indeed, the use of AI elevates the significance of handmade art. Consider, for instance, the wooden figures crafted by artist Parn “Ani” Aniwat, who carves more than 30 charming characters each month. Or reflect on Los Calladitos, who seamlessly transfer their unique style from the vast walls of their murals to their animated films. Even the ceramic lamps crafted by Portuguese artist and entrepreneur Ana Seixas demonstrate how handmade artworks garner special relevance and appreciation. Ultimately, one desires to touch the art that inundates our digital world.
All the days at Pictoplasma were incredibly lively and full of inspiration. One of the most interesting talks was by Philip Hunt, a creative director at AKA Studios from the UK. He shared his experiences and insights about design and art, particularly regarding the film industry and the challenges of adapting a children’s book like “Here We Are” by Oliver Jeffers into a film. He discussed the extensive thought and effort required to translate beautifully drawn 2D characters into a 3D medium. After many ideas and experiments, he and his team successfully turned the book into a beautiful film, which can be admired on Apple TV. By chance, I met Philip on Sunday, the last day of Pictoplasma, at a small flea market in Berlin. I approached him because I didn’t get the chance to talk to him at the event. We had a pleasant conversation about the industry, covering topics like advertising, films, and other media. He asked me how I found Pictoplasma, and I told him that initially, I didn’t know what to expect or what I would take away from it. He responded that each year, he takes away inspiration and a reminder of why he continues his work. He loves attending Pictoplasma, getting inspired by other artists, and gaining a perspective beyond commercial work. He also shared that he attended the first Pictoplasma 20 years ago and didn’t know what it was about back then either. Now, he teaches workshops and helps lead the Pictoplasma Academy. It was a very enjoyable conversation. So, what makes Pictoplasma so special? It’s the chance to see designers and artists doing something different from just working on commercial projects. This is something I can definitely take away from it. I was deeply moved by the following artist talks. One of them was by the artist Parn “Ani” Aniwat. Out of necessity, he began carving small figures out of wood. Now, he makes 30 pieces a month — small, cute characters that he sells to collectors and exhibitors. It has become his business. He gave us a glimpse into his workday, which runs from 9 to 5, after which he spends time with his family, sketches ideas, and watches Netflix. The same goes for the Portuguese artist and entrepreneur Ana Seixas. During the pandemic, she started working with pottery and created clay lamp characters that sold faster in her shop than she could make them.
Of course, even at a conference focused on hand-drawn, painted, or crafted characters, the topic of artificial intelligence can’t be avoided. Some artists use AI as a tool to support their ideas. However, despite the technology and digital capabilities that AI offers, traditional craftsmanship remains one of the most important aspects. While no one insists that art must be created by hand, most artists still find themselves holding a pencil or an Apple Pencil. One of the most memorable statements about AI came from Philip Hunt. A young designer from the audience asked him whether she should focus more on AI. He responded that she should focus on drawing, as AI will inevitably come. But drawing with a pencil would always convey ideas better (or something along those lines; I’m not certain of the exact wording). Another artist, possibly Christopher Rutledge, mentioned that AI is a useful tool but compared it to mastering image databases or programs like Photoshop or After Effects. Artists have shown that they engage with AI, but in the end, it’s their ideas and visions that they bring to life. For the past few months, I’ve felt that we are returning to an era of “handmade” artistry, especially in art, film, and design. With the overproduction of AI-generated images and texts, which now look and read quite well, the personal touch is often missing. A good example is animator Joe Taylor, who makes his style unmistakable with hand-drawn loops that resemble flat designs from claymation. He showcased a commercial clip for the ProCreate app, which he both drew and animated using their software.
Aside from the talks, there were workshops, exhibitions, and parties. Unfortunately, I couldn’t attend all the talks or everything that was offered. Given that Berlin is a very large city and the event organizers thought it would be a good idea to use various locations across the city, it wasn’t easy to be everywhere. There was also an AR scavenger hunt called Character Hunt, where participants had to travel around Berlin using the Adobe Aero app to view the characters. Great ideas, but too little time to experience everything. Attending Pictoplasma was a fascinating journey into the realm of art, characters, and animation. It was far more than I could have ever imagined back then. For me, it was a significant source of inspiration for my work as a designer. Here, I could discover new perspectives and gain a wealth of inspiration.
The most captivating talk was also the last one of Pictoplasma. It was by Mila Useche from Colombia. She is an artist and filmmaker who had a tough journey. She had to fight hard in the working world, including working for a game company where she worked up to 15 hours a day. She then became a freelancer, working for studios like Disney, Warner Brothers, Nickelodeon, and Netflix. She also worked on her own concepts and film ideas. One of these is currently being realized in a German-Colombian co-production.
Recently, there has been a crisis in many animation studios in the USA, with widespread layoffs and job cuts. Adding to this were the aftermath of the pandemic and the surge of companies eager to use AI. Mila needed to find a way out, so she began sharing her hand-drawn images on Instagram, reaching many people who celebrated her art. She now lives in Japan, where she produces her art and characters. That was Pictoplasma 2024. A few days in another world, a world full of inspiration, art, characters, and animated films. Just a different kind of matrix.

The Guardian published a story in May 2024 about a left political party calling for a price cap on Berlin’s famous Doner Kebab. The price of this staple Berlin street food has doubled over the last couple of years. I still fondly remember the first time I tried out the Doner Kebab in 2017 when I had only paid 5 Euros for a chicken doner kebab and a beer. Putting a price cap on street food seems impractical in a capitalist country like Germany. The current economic state and rising inflation do not justify that.
But Berlin always has exceptions.
The opening sequence of Anthony Bourdain’s Parts Unknown episode on Berlin distills the history of Berlin and why it’s a hotspot for thrill seekers. Bourdain (rest in peace) was brilliant at getting to the heart of a city in a few sentences in his travel shows. That particular segment of the show ended with Bourdain having dinner at a local establishment called Domke Fleischerei with the bouncer of one of those notorious clubs in Berlin. Since seeing that episode, I have wanted to visit this place that serves ‘herzhaftig’ meat-heavy food. If you are a vegetarian or vegan, this…

One of my favorite hobbies is collecting inspirations of art and design I come across while browsing the internet. Thanks to those new “save” features in apps like Pinterest or Instagram, I’m able to build little digital art museums for myself. I have thousands of “saved” pictures, from vintage photography to exotic art collage. One day I caught myself amused by the simple, elegant, extremely creative logo of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.
Whatever your career is, imagine yourself designing an orchestra logotype. First, you’d take a look at previous creations: mostly elegant curve-shaped designs with ornamental details or typographies. In color patterns, you’d see a majority of red, black and white, sometimes blue or green.
Second, you’d might brainstorm general aspects of orchestras. I’ll help: Tradition. Old Style. Chic. Elegant. Perfection. Beauty. Cult. Deep emotions. Beethoven. The frequency of sound wave. Instruments. Symphonies. The treble clef. The air-drawn lines of a baton.
The ordinary “elegant curve-shaped designs” illustrates these round elements of an orchestra. Music is not “straight”. Emotions are not “straight”. What about the color pattern? They are clearly trying to call attention, communicate passion (red tones) in a classic and elegant way (black, white tones) with notes of respectfulness or loyalty (blue, green tones).
The access to a huge source of inspiration enables the creation of my little digital museums, but it also harms uniqueness. You can create something beautiful and well constructed, but it’s easy to fall into ordinary. You can find many “how-to-do-a-beautiful-orchestra-logo-in-10-steps”, but the real challenge is to be creative and unique and still carry the message you are trying to transmit.
Well, here is why the Berlin Philharmonic logotype owned it:
This overlapped series of pentagon forms (straight lines), instead of illustrating common aspects of an orchestra, communicates the masterful architectural work of Hans Scharoun (1832–1972) for the orchestra’s concert hall, previously all fan or shoebox shaped.
The chosen yellow, a color that’s uncommon for this market, grabs attention, transmits creativity, motivation, optimism, and warmth. That conveys the Berlin Philharmonic is a modern, vivid, joyful orchestra but also warm — musically and emotionally deep.
There is also an easter egg: The overlapped pentagons clearly but not perfectly represent the floor plan of the concert hall. These overlapped pentagons suggest, besides all, a circular movement:
Yes. Circular. Do I have to say more? The logotype merges, in an exquisite way, an architectural uniqueness that characterizes the Berlin Philharmonic, without forgetting the musicality, elegancy, and round elements that surrounds an orchestra. All of those represented, with not a single curve.
“Good design is obvious. Great design is transparent.”
— Joe Sparano

He’s a trained cabinet maker, a qualified social pedagogue, and a professional graphic designer and illustrator. Christian Rothenhagen, also known as deerBLN, is a Berlin patriot with a conceptual flair. proud magazine sits down with the artist to discuss his love for the city, his creative ambitions, and what it means to be a true Berliner.
proud: What is your ambition behind putting tiles on the city’s streets?
deerBLN: My ambition is clearly to beautify my city and to express myself: in drawings, on t-shirts, on skateboards, in installations, wherever. I am happy to live in the most beautiful city in the world. I see myself as a modern local historian. I document the city through my drawings and give something back to it through my work in public spaces. My “street art” is, for the most part, not illegal, but rather tolerated interventions in the urban landscape. It’s an expression of my love for this city.
proud: You are a true Berliner. Do you even like the city anymore these days?
deerBLN: I have lived here since 1976. For me, the city is still the most beautiful, the roughest, the most diverse, the most interesting, the most incorruptible, the most broken — and the most honest. It’s the city that doesn’t lie to you. It wears its scars openly, shows its wounds, and is as direct as a punch in the gut. But it’s also the city that will always catch you. I love Berlin — now more than ever!
proud: You just designed a skateboard series for Artsprojekt. Are you a skater?
deerBLN: I used to skate a lot, but I wasn’t particularly good. I started in the mid-80s on one of those plastic boards from the department store. When I was 15, I bought my first real board, a Santa Cruz with Independent trucks and OJ II wheels — a classic! That board was my pride and joy and my ticket to a world that has shaped me to this day: skateboarding, punk rock, and hardcore. The DIY ethic of that scene has influenced my work from the beginning. So, to design a board series now is a huge honor for me. It’s a childhood dream come true.
proud: What are you currently working on?
deerBLN: Right now, I’m developing a T-shirt series for a Berlin-based streetwear label and working on a few poster designs. I’m also preparing my next solo exhibition, which will take place in the spring of 2009 in Friedrichshain. Besides that, I’m always drawing… my city… Berlin!

Germany is the 4th largest economy in the world as of this writing. Berlin is the capital of Germany. After the Brexit, Berlin became the biggest tech center in Europe. 1000s of new opportunities are created daily for tech-related jobs here in Berlin. From Meta and Amazon, there are a lot of tech companies out there here.
Software engineering in Germany is mostly driven by new technologies and practices. Generally, companies don’t have many QA engineers, so the quality of the output solely lies on the engineer who builds it. As per my understanding, the most popular programming languages are Java, JavaScript, and Go, and knowing Kotlin, Scala, or typescript on top of these might help.
German is the main language in Germany, but as Berlin is a multicultural city you can get by with English just fine. Berlin has a welcoming atmosphere and the community here is open and inclusive. Berlin has a rich history which you can spend time with. There are a lot of parks you can take an evening stroll. Veganism is high and nigh. Berlin is a hotspot food scene & partying hard (Really, they have 36-hour-long parties). It is nice for families as well because healthcare and education are free
As I can see, there are two ways for you to get hired and move to Berlin.
Tech companies in Berlin offer generous relocation packages. These packages can be varied from one-time lump-sum payments to fully assisted relocation support with a relocation agent. These relocation packages are made to ease the pressure on moving to a new country. In most scenarios companies are willing to relocate the entire family. For reference, I have seen relocation budgets vary from 2.500 euros to 10.000 euros
Another important factor to consider is the salary. For Visa reasons, you should at least get paid 56.400 euros per annum. More on this later.
If you are in tech and if you’re planning a move to Berlin (or any other German city such as Munich or Cologne), the following can be helpful in securing an interview.
Clean up your Linkedin profile
Linkedin is going to be the medium for you to make the first contact with your future employer in Germany. Make sure you have cleaned up your Linkedin and that it is up to date. Add the necessary skills you have to your LinkedIn Skills section. Get your skills endorsed to help the LinkedIn algorithm to present you as a candidate to recruiters.Have a look at the following LinkedIn accounts. None of them are perfect but they can be good pointers.https://www.linkedin.com/in/dinanjana-gunaratne-800573a8https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathiesha-maddage-48710096/
Take skill quizzes
These are not necessary but they are sure to be a fun experience. This is what LinkedIn has to say about it.
“It’s not mandatory for you to take the assessment. However, taking the assessment will help you stand out by showcasing that you have the desired skills of an ideal candidate, as well as increase your chances of getting noticed by other recruiters.”
Follow companies
Follow German tech companies on LinkedIn. You will be automatically notified if they post any job postings on LinkedIn
Build your connections
Building connections is necessary on LinkedIn. Add recruiters and HR people from companies you like for better reachability.
Make yourself “open to work”
In your profile, you have the option to make yourself open to working. LinkedIn says if you make yourself available it will try to make it invisible to the current company you’re employed. You can edit your job preferences from there. It will look like following
By now your LinkedIn profile is good to go. As mentioned earlier there are 2 ways for you to apply for a job. But at this point in time, LinkedIn lacks filtering job opportunities with relocation support (Correct me if I am wrong). The only way to get around it is to go through the entire job posting to see if they give relocation support. That is where recruiters come in.Since they are reaching out to you instead of the other way around, you’re bound to get a good deal. Technical recruiters may apply for one or multiple companies on your behalf. Be prepared, some technical recruiters may ask a few technical questions.
Now it comes to your CV.
Your CV shouldn’t exceed 2 pages. When making your CV follow the general guidelines. When describing the projects you did, use the XYZ format. It says you achieved X which is measured by Y by applying Z. An example of this would be “Reduced production incidents by 50% QoQ by analyzing 10 root causes out of 30 production incidents in Q3. More information on this can be found below”https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/google-recruiters-say-these-5-resume-tips-including-x-y-z-formula-will-improve-your-odds-of-getting-hired-at-google.htmlIt is important to spend some time improving your CV. After all, your CV is the one that does the talking.
By this point, you’re ready to make first contact with potential employers. If you haven’t received any messages from recruiters yet it is time for you to make the first move.
At this point, you have 2 options1. Reach out to connections who are working in companies in Berlin2. Directly applying from the careers pages of companies
Both options are good, but sometimes your application gets prioritized if it comes through as an internal referral. And for you, don’t be shy to reach out to a friend or a connection, as an internal referral most of the time pays the referrer for the successful referral.
This has already gone longer than I expected, so I will stop from here and will do a follow-up writing on addressing how interviews are performed here and about the Visa process. As a parting gift, I will add a list of companies that provide relocation support for tech jobs as per my knowledge.
See you on Part-2 :)

(Author’s note: A German version of this article was published in Berlin’s “Der Tagesspiegel” newspaper on March 15, 2025)
It didn’t matter if the neighbors looked on disapprovingly. The New Year had arrived, and spring began with a large fire that we, as children, would jump over for what felt like hours to leave behind the evil spirits of the past year. The scent of saffron rice and grilled fish. The loud music surrounded us and the families of my father’s Persian friends who visited each other, greeting with kisses and embraces. Whenever I remember the Persian New Year celebrations I experienced in West Berlin during the 1980s, I’m filled with a warm, hopeful feeling. Back then, I didn’t understand how much more this festival must have meant during that time, amid a terrible war between Iraq and Iran that lasted nearly a decade and resulted in half a million casualties. A celebration amid a German society that was still firmly convinced it was not yet open to immigrants and what they could contribute. For my dad and his friends, the celebration was a piece of home helping them feel more at home in a foreign land.
Only years later did I learn how widespread the tradition of this New Year’s festival is. According to UNESCO, “It has been celebrated by more than 300 million people for over 3,000 years in the Balkan Peninsula, the Black Sea region, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Middle East.” The festival’s observance traces back to the Zoroastrian ancestors of today’s Iranian people. Since 2009, the UN has even included Nouruz in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
When I would return to my Berlin school on Mondays after the festival, there was no mention of the Persian New Year. Only Christmas, Easter, and New Year’s Eve existed. Once, in 12th grade, our English teacher asked about our backgrounds and our parents. I remember it clearly because it was such an unusual experience. She wanted to know if we, as children of immigrants, felt any particular conflict. The only thing I felt were the glances of my classmates, which led me to give an evasive answer. The meaning and power of the New Year’s festival thus remained hidden from her and the rest of the teachers and students.
For example, the story of Kaveh the Blacksmith, who plays an important role in Ferdowsi’s famous Book of Kings. According to legend, Kaveh led an Iranian uprising against a cruel, child-devouring dragon king. This symbolism of resistance against oppression has led authoritarian governments to attempt to ban the festival over the years repeatedly. However, the most important meaning of the festival is the awakening of nature to new life in spring, the victory of light over darkness, and of knowledge over ignorance.
When I speak with my friends in Berlin every weekend, it becomes increasingly clear to me how important it is to celebrate the Persian New Year and remember its message, especially this year. For weeks, I’ve been hearing much about the challenges originating in Moscow and here in Washington, D.C., and the increasingly difficult political and economic situation for Germany and Europe. Even during the pandemic, I didn’t perceive this much fear and uncertainty about the situation.
Next week, I will tell the children at my daughter’s elementary school in Washington, D.C. about the Persian New Year. There are some children there who are directly affected by their parents’ dismissals by the Trump administration. There are flyers preparing for the possible removal of children of illegal immigrants at the school. The teacher invited me at my daughter’s request, who had so enjoyed the presentation of the Indian Festival of Lights, Diwali, in the fall by a mother of Indian descent. I will tell them about the great New Year’s festival and its message that we will celebrate with friends and neighbors. With a fire that many in the city will jump over to rid themselves of the evil spirits of the past year. And about how for me, the festival is also a piece of memory of Berlin and a home that I gladly share with all who currently need more confidence and community.

Thinking of making Berlin your new home?
Take these things into account for a smoother move.
A “Wahlberlinerin” (Berlin citizen by choice) explains.
Visiting my hometown in Groningen, the Netherlands feels like a breath of fresh air, as if I’m walking through a village. Most pedestrians on the street greet me with a smile and a nod.
It doesn’t work like that in Berlin.
You ignore one another. Some neighbors who accepted my packages in the past and certainly know who I am ignore me in any other setting.
It’s no different when walking on the street. No one greets you, you greet no one. If you do, expect frowns, very confused, or even scared looks.
The temperatures drop to or below zero during the winter months. People get moody, sulky, and the city turns bleak.
The only good thing about Berlin winters from the perspective of a Dutch person: it doesn’t rain…

“The strength of career success lies in the power of networking.” - Omotola E.O.
I shared in my previous post about my speaking engagement in Berlin at FOSS Backstage, where I spoke on Contributors’ Engagement and Monetization Opportunities.
In this series, I’ll share some of the new connections I made on this trip, particularly at the FOSS Backstage event.
This is my first international trip outside of Africa. I got the feeling you get when you go to a different country and meet people from different cultures. The good thing is I was already looking forward to connecting, learning new cultures, and having a good time.
I did! I met some cool folks from different organizations and career paths. One thing that brought us together is our love for open source.
Among many other connections I made at this conference, meeting with Outreachy mentors was one of my highlights.
I met with Antonin Delpeuch, an Open Refine community mentor, and Jarek Potiuk, an OpenStack community mentor.
We discussed their experience as an Outreachy mentor, how the program has benefited their projects, and them as a mentor. It’s good to hear them talk about what excites them about Outreachy applicants and interns and how the program has enhanced their projects.
After the conference, I had a good dinner with Antonin Delpeuch, and we talked more about the future of open source and outreach programs. We also shared individual goals, our steps, and what we see in open source.
It was such a great privilege to not only meet with other open source advocates who are interested in what the Outreachy program does but to learn more about how open source experts and the community can get involved, the benefit of the program to mentors, and the steps and requirements to participate in the program.
I was able to preach the gospel of Outreachy to these fantastic folks and build and strengthen their knowledge about the program and relationship. Looking forward to further connecting with them and having them support diversity in tech through the Outreachy program.
Until the next and final series, I will share my experience exploring the great Berlin. Mach’s gut (Welle)!

The Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG) — Berlin’s citywide public transportation system — boasts an sprawling web of trains running with cold, calculated efficiency. A moment’s tardiness leaves your arms struggling to stretch the closing doors. A Google search reveals a link to its website, which bears the slogan: “Because we love you.”
Evidently, this love only applies to the native and the lucky. As with any bureaucratic bunch, alas, the company’s true love remains the almighty Rulebook. German culture in general reveres tradition, so the guidelines of their businesses prove tighter to squeeze through than their departing train doors.
When I arrived in Berlin after 16 restless hours of international travel, I scoured the BVG ticket dispenser for the student option. I was desperate to end the day, but both I and my travel organizers had done our research. The website listed the 61 Euro “Ausbildung” (“education”) ticket as the one for students and nowhere did it state any specification beyond possessing a student card, so I bought the ticket and left.
A week passed. I grew infatuated with Berlin, its cosmopolitanism broadening my perspective on what a big city could be. Worried that if I didn’t lower my gaze from the high rises to my laptop I might miss my deadlines, I ventured off to the nearest U-Bahn station, aiming to write at a local café.
I boarded a U-Bahn remarkably devoid of people. Over that last week alone, I’d shared more physical intimacy with fellow train-riders than in many long-term friendships, so any room to breathe was precious.
The second a BVG officer boarded, however, all air left the train car. A heavyset, bald man, clearly born for this role, he bore a black vest thicker than any soldier’s. Beneath this riot gear he wore a black T-shirt, with the skull logo of Marvel Comics character The Punisher imprinted on its sleeve.
I was sure that I had no reason for concern. As the train left the station, he whipped out his scanner, demanding that all passengers present their tickets. A few good citizens later, he reached me, scanned my ticket, and stared me down.
“Let me see your student ID,” he said. I obliged. Staring at the UC Santa Barbara logo, he remarked: “This is not the ticket.” Confused, I emphasized that I was indeed a student studying here. Shaking his head, he replied: “You will get off with me.” As he turned to continue scanning, I made nervous eye contact with The Punisher’s skull.
Stepping off, I found my pitiful German akin to a fist in a gunfight. He claimed my ticket was solely “for job education” and set me an appointment to pay it the next day. Having conveniently reached my stop, I hobbled off, defeated, to the coffee shop.
The next day, I trekked over to the BVG headquarters for my appointment, with Vanessa — my trip-appointed German translator and true hero — by my side. The front of the building, complete with LGBTQ+ rainbow colors displayed, seemed inviting enough. Quickly, however, we were directed to a crude little crevice in the building’s back corner.
A bouncer-type at the BVG customer office bellowed orders from the front door. We sat together, awaiting our turn. I expressed confidence in our success.
Okay, you absolutely shouldn’t judge a book by its cover. But when I tell you my confidence melted the second I saw the man behind the counter, please let me off this one time. His eyes teemed with dissatisfaction. Mercy was not in this man’s vocabulary — nor was any English. Funny how this was the only place in Berlin I’ve been where no one has spoken English.
Vanessa fought valiantly, but it was a losing battle. The facts of the story — I am a student studying in Berlin and I had bought a ticket at the student ticket price — meant nothing to this man. “You wouldn’t go to Thailand and use your student ID to buy a ticket there,” he repeated. I am neither sure why that’s something I wouldn’t do, nor what his focus on Thailand was about. But we were chipping away at stone.
“You cannot buy this ticket as a foreigner,” he said. We emphasized that nowhere did the website specify this. “Go online and write a complaint,” he responded.
Vanessa looked at me sympathetically. I sighed, knowing the war was lost, and paid the fine. The 60 Euros aside, I felt robbed of the wide-eyed earnestness I’d brought in my suitcase. There was something potent in that initial Berlin buzz, the excitement of believing this new place might be better than back home. But now I felt disillusioned.
Make no mistake, I’m still loving my time in Berlin. You could spend weeks peeling back this city’s layers — the boundless events and different cultures it hosts — and still never find the end. Any place this large and bustling needs a public transit system, so one must deal with the BVG. Still, I wanted to issue this warning, just in case The Punisher tries to track you down.
Go online and write a complaint, huh?
Fine, man. Here it is, for the entire world to read.

You might expect a 91-year-old to have plenty of leisure hours. Not Francis Kilduff. The WWII veteran is so busy putting the final touches on his latest docudrama and hobnobbing at the USO headquarters, he barely made it to the theater. Though he managed to carve some time out of his weekend to enjoy a pre-performance meal at the Geffen Playhouse, he’s hurriedly slicing into his beef and hoping he doesn’t miss curtain.
It’s the Sunday night before Veteran’s Day, and Geffen has invited military vets not only to take in the final dress rehearsal of Hershey Felder as Irving Berlin, but also to enjoy a catered dinner buffet. Partnering with the Gary Sinise Foundation (Sinise and Randall Arney, Geffen’s Artistic Director, are pals from their days working together at Chicago’s Steppenwolf Theatre), the Geffen celebrates veterans by hosting these special veterans nights for every Gil Cates Theater subscription production. As a proud partner of Blue Star Theatres, the Geffen Playhouse also offers veterans free tickets to season productions year-round.
But tonight is extra special. For most of these vets, Irving Berlin composed the soundtracks to their lives.
Seated at the table with Kilduff is Alan Bertik, an affable vet who was on a Navy destroyer in the Korean War (“It was 30 below,” he says, chuckling). He and his wife used to usher at the Geffen. They saw Felder perform one New Year’s Eve, but he’s especially excited about this show for the simple reason that he knows most of the music. Of course, everyone knows the biggies: “White Christmas,” “There’s No Business Like Show Business,” “Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning.” Still, Berlin’s catalog is so expansive — he wrote at least 1,500 songs — there are many that history has forgotten. Yet the men and women who fell in love, broke up and fell in love again remember them fondly.
“Of course I’m excited!” Kilduff chimes in. “That’s my era.”
Hershey Felder has crafted one-man shows based on Gershwin, Chopin, Beethoven and Bernstein, creating experiences that are half concerto, half stage play. In fact, they’re so unique he’s become quite famous not only in Southern California, with many premieres at the Geffen, plus performances at Pasadena Playhouse, Laguna Playhouse, San Diego Rep and the Old Globe, but also across the nation and world. (You can read more about his work in a recent American Theatre magazine article that is also re-published as the program note for the show.)
For Hershey Felder as Irving Berlin, Felder recounts Berlin’s life story by weaving memories into songs. During the peformance, Felder plays one of Berlin’s most famous songs, “God Bless America,” and invites the audience to sing along. As voices surged with pride during the dress rehearsal, there were more than a few eyes filled with tears. The one constant in Berlin’s life — from being an immigrant baby to a “singing waiter” to Fred Astaire’s best bud to a lonely recluse — was that he found comfort in music. Berlin may be America’s most famous composer, but to that end, he’s not so different than the rest of us.

I visited many galleries and art exhibitions in Berlin and here’s my reviews.
It is not as difficult to purchase tickets as it is in Barcelona, but it is critical to double-check the opening days and hours.
I visited ""the soul station"" : the LAS Foundation in Halle am Berghain. An extensive interactive metaverse ethical gaming installation.Brathwaite-Shirley investigates marginalized histories, particularly those of the Black and Queer communities. When prospects go into Berlin’s renowned space, they are greeted by a dark, foggy environment filled with an array of varying screen displays flickering with artificial light, waiting us to tap in.
I spent a lot of time there trying to understand everything, but there still remain some parts of the journey that are perplexing. The storyline offers the sense of limitless possibilities. As my friend grace said , it kind of reminds me of Love + Death robots vibe too.
By the time I visited it was only 8 euro and it was episode 1 of the game.
Episode 2: ARE YOU SOULLESS, TOO?Will start from September to October.
Really really worth it.
Really famous on social media. An immersive museum exploring the concept of dark matter. It was really far away , and maybe I expected too much after the halle- exhibition visit. There are several rooms to explore and you can probably finish it all in 1 and a half hours. Or even faster without the drink/snack breaks in between. However, this place made for a really good video/ photos. The tickets are quite expensive for what it offer though…
I truly had fun that visit! Film buffs will thoroughly like this. There are free smartphone applications for audio guides, and it was simultaneously interesting and enlightening. Day tickets cost 9 euros and close at 6 p.m. After experiencing the museum, visitors can also visit the Library of Film Archives. Aside from that, it’s clear that the Deutsch kinemathek hosts a variety of exhibitions. On top of that, the permanent display will close in October. I had an absolute blast there.
Honestly ， I encountered a lot of fashionable people here. And I think they’re here for the IG post. It certainly is a cool place to take photos.
I saved a lot more museum visit as well but I just couldn’t make it because of prior plans. Next time , Berlin!

This Berlin flew by! A good overview is that of Screen Daily and if we’re lucky, you can read it here without subscribing. My own activities flowed from two sources:
1) Education: I taught and led tours of the market for Berlinale’s Talent Campus Meet the Experts, for Deutsche Welle Akademie Film Festival Workshop, and for INA Sup, a TV, film and new media school based in France and linked to the French National Audiovisual Institute (INA). This is the most rewarding work, seeing what talent is coming up in our world, seeing ideas take hold as the students learn about the market.
2) Our Consulting: Another pillar of our company, aside from blogging and professional education, is strategic planning with filmmakers. This Berlinale was very intense and very energizing for my partner Peter Belsito and me, with Beyond the Moonwalk having found a berth for international sales representation with Steve Arroyave’s Arrow Entertainment and a U.S. distribution commitment, and more actively involving, with Donna Deitch’s The Catcher, where a series of meetings with top German and Canadian producers and sales agents gave the project the momentum of a race horse bound for first place!
What follows are my impressions of various other Berlin events as they passed by — ever so quickly — but still with enough eye-catching power to capture my attention in the first place.
I was happy to see Jeff Lipsky and Adopt Films’ co-managing executive Tim Grady cleaning up with 3 acquisitions; no time to waste anymore as the third Bingham Ray memorial pointed out to those who have the mind to realize the message. Sister (L’enfant d’en haut) by Ursula Maier (ISA: Memento, Swiss rights with FilmCoopi), I hear is A+, Paolo and Vittorio Taviani’s Caesar Must Die (Cesare deve morire) (ISA: Rai Trade) won the Golden Bear, and Chris Petzold’s Barbara, all in Competition.
American indie works-in-progress have been granted a second chance to screen for European indie distributors (EuropaDistribution) at the upcoming Paris Film Festival in June. I have been invited to be on the jury of “U.S. in Progress” and am thrilled at the prospect. I was honored to have been invited to be on the jury in Wroclaw at the American Film Festival in November as well, for the first edition of this chance for U.S. filmmakers to win post-production and cash prizes. This is where the film Now, Forager was picked up by fledgling international sales agent, the only international sales agent in Poland, New Europe Sales founded by Jan Naszewski [jnaszewski AT gmail.com] and Anja Sosic [anja AT NewEuropeFilmSales.com]. The film went on to screen at Rotterdam Film Festival. Even hotter news will be forthcoming from MOMA and The New York Film Society’s New Directors/ New Films about one of the films at the AFF’s “U.S. in Progress”. If you missed it in Poland you will be able to see it in New York this April!
I was lucky to see two films during the market and after the market closed, this last Saturday and Sunday, when I caught some more films I was unable to see earlier due to my “real” work. Of the films I saw here in Berlin, here are my unique :) comments for what they’re worth.
Children of Srikandi (Panorama) is a very personal account by a female filmmaker collective in Indonesia on what it means to be a lesbian in their society. The sweet intimacy of the film overrides its non-professional veneer (the “filmmakers” were all non-professionals). In fact, this could serve as a template for other non-professionals who want to tell their stories. Schools come to mind as possible candidates for this sort of filmmaking, as does my own pet project, The Literacy Project. The Indonesian contingent here in Berlin was interesting and sociable as they met their audience and fans. They were hosted by Berlin based producers Laura Coppens who is a doctorate student in ethnological studies in Zurich and Angelika Levi, doc filmmaker (My Life, Part 2 about growing up Jewish in Berlin).
Bergman & Magnani: The War of the Volcanos. This invitation-only work in progress with Wide House uses a unique way to show the emotion filled and the biggest jet-set love scandal of all times, the story of Roberto Rossellini, Anna Magnani and Ingrid Bergman as Rosellini and the volcanic Anna Magnani ended their relationship after making Volcano (1950) and the married Ingrid Bergman and Rossellini began theirs with the filming of Stromboli (1950), the name of the second volcano on this Aeolian Island which has been in almost continuous eruption for 2,000 years. The visuals of their stories are illustrated entirely with the scenes from movies starring them as they enact the real life emotions and the commentary of the doc. I am most interested to see how well this technique succeeds.
Paolo and Vittorio Taviani’s Caesar Must Die (ISA: Rai Trade) is a moving illustration of the transformative power of art as hardened criminals in an Italian prison rehearse and perform Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar. The the 80 + year old Brothers Taviani deserve recognition for their artistic excellence. I can’t argue with Mike Leigh and the jury’s judgement except that on my emotional meter, Rebelle (War Witch) was the real winner.
Rebelle (War Witch) by Kim Nguyen (ISA: Films Distribution) should have won the Golden Bear. The Silver Bear for Best Actress was awarded to Rachel Mwanza, but this film is so deeply moving on the most primal levels, maintaining its African roots while touching our most sensitive emotions of parents, love, rape, pregnancy and infants as they are experienced by a female child soldier from ages 12 to 14. It should also win Best Foreign Language Film in next year’s Academy Awards. Produced by the industry vets Marie-Claude Poulin and Pierre Even, it is yet another feather in the cap of the the Canadian film industry.
Dieter Kosslick observed that with 15 Competition titles confirmed at the time Screen International interviewed him, “both thematically and geographically, we have many films coming this year from Asia, and particularly China and Indonesia. There is also an interesting focus on France this year, beginning with the opening film Farewell My Queen (Les adieux a la reine) (ISA: Elle Driver) and going through all of the festival’s sections. Moreover, we have two French jury members [Francois Ozon and Charlotte Gainsbourg] in the International Jury.“ Eight titles selected to date have German majority or minority participation, so German filmmakers and (co-)producers will again enjoy a record presence in the Competition on a par with 2011’s tally of eight films involving German directors or German production partners.” He also notes Competition films’ trending toward “times of upheaval and new departures… with many films coming from Africa and Arab countries”. My observation of the 23 Competition films finally selected is that the nostalgic look back at European aristocracy and top social tiers (A Royal Affair, Bel Ami, Farewell My Queen) and its mores stands in stark contrast to today’s upheavals of families and children (Childish Games, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, Postcards from the Zoo, Just the Wind, Mercy, Shadow Dancer, Sister, Rebelle, Home for the Weekend, Jayne Mansfield’s Car, Coming Home). Seven other films continue the theme of social upheavals: Tey — which deal with childhood memories of Senegal experienced by an American, Captive about Phillipine hostages, Barbara an Eastern German looking to move to the West, Caesar Must Die about prisoners finding art in their sequestered lives, Flying Swords of Dragon Gate about upheavel during the Ming Dynasty, White Deer Plain about upheavel towards the end of Imperial China, The Flowers of War about the upheavel of China by the Japanese in World War II. The exceptions, Tabu and Meteora, deal with love, the Saving Grace.
Two major disappointments were Steven Soderberg’s Haywire (ISA: Mandate) and Stephen Elliott’s Cherry. Both about women, they left me puzzled with what the plot was about. Pretty, well done and negligible.
This Berlin Diary Part 2 will continue after I work on my new and soon-to-be launched website! I have spent an entire day on this blog and I still have much more to write!

This is drawn from my recent bestselling book on heroes (cue Bowie) who dug escape tunnels under the Wall, The Tunnels: Escapes Under the Berlin Wall and the Historic Films the JFK White House Tried to Kill. Part of Bruce’s performance, and remarks, via link below. I would attend an epic Springsteen concert in Berlin almost 30 years later.
https://youtu.be/WBIcfPBVxxQ
On this date in 1961 the Berlin Wall started rising overnight (first as mere barbed wire) dividing East and West for almost three decades. The fall of the Berlin Wall, 28 long and deadly years later, has been attributed to lots of things, from Mikhail Gorbachev’s reforms and Ronald Reagan’s famous plea to the ineptitude of the Politburo and the collective courage of the East German protesters. But there’s little doubt that David Bowie and Bruce Springsteen did their own — if small — part.
When Bowie died several years ago, the German Foreign Office noted as much in a memorial tweet: “Good-bye, David Bowie. You are now among #Heroes. Thank you for helping to bring down the #wall.” For Springsteen’s role, you can read the 2013 book Rocking the Wall: Bruce Springsteen — The Berlin Concert That Changed the World. But Springsteen’s memoir, Born to Run, offers his full account of that epic concert for the first time.
Many Americans are surprised to learn that our rock stars were even allowed to play in East Germany while the wall, constructed in 1961, remained in place. But Communist Party leaders, noting the tremendous buildup of anger and tension among their young people during the Gorbachev “glasnost” era, decided to provide a safety valve of sorts by allowing major rock concerts starting in 1987. Tens of thousands of East German kids were already flocking to the wall to listen as Bowie and others played just on the other side — and there had been clashes between the music-starved youth and East German police.
Bowie’s June 1987 performance was remarkable on several levels. The stage was set up in West Berlin, very close to the wall, with the old Reichstag building as a backdrop. Unlike most Western performers, he had a fitting song for the occasion: “Heroes,” written a few years earlier and purportedly inspired by Bowie’s time living in Berlin. The line about standing by the wall while “the guns shot above our heads” may refer to dramatic attempts by East Germans to escape the East — which happens to be the subject of my book, The Tunnels: Escapes Under the Berlin Wall and the Historic Films the JFK White House Tried to Kill. (You can watch part of Bowie’s performance that day below.)
https://youtu.be/FdykmbbaZI8
And here, from a 2003 interview, is how he described it:
It was one of the most emotional performances I’ve ever done. I was in tears…And there were thousands on the other side that had come close to the wall. So it was like a double concert where the wall was the division. And we would hear them cheering and singing along from the other side. God, even now I get choked up. When we did “Heroes” it really felt anthemic, almost like a prayer. However well we do it these days, it’s almost like walking through it compared to that night, because it meant so much more. That’s the town where it was written, and that’s the particular situation that it was written about.
By then, Bob Dylan had been invited by a youth arm of the Communist Party to play in Treptower Park in the East on September 17, 1987, along with touring mates Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and Roger McGuinn. Protests were building against the regime and the wall, and East German officials hoped to defuse tensions with a few signs of openness.
The Stasi didn’t seem too worried that Dylan, then in a down period in his career, would prove to be a rabble-rouser.
Naturally, the Stasi (East Germany’s notorious secret police) were on top of it. Their six-page preview was filed at their headquarters under “Robert Zimmerman, No. HA XX 17578.” It mainly covered logistics and security — no secret bugging of Dylan, apparently — and the dispersal of 81,000 tickets, with at least one-third going to party officials and their pals. The Stasi didn’t seem too worried that Dylan, then in a down period in his career, would prove to be a rabble-rouser, as he was merely “an old master of rock” with no particular “resonance” with the youth of the day. The crowd, they predicted, would be mostly middle-aged and older. Dylan would act in a “disciplined” way and not cause undo “emotions.”
In the end, the gig played out pretty much as the Stasi had anticipated. By most accounts, Dylan — whose lyrical work just earned him the 2016 Nobel Prize for literature — gave a rather lackluster performance (his norm for the time), consisting of a couple of Christian tunes mixed in with hits like “Blowin’ in the Wind,” “Rainy Day Women” and “Like a Rolling Stone.” He reportedly did not speak a single word from the stage.
This was not the case with Springsteen, who arrived in East Berlin 10 months later to play his biggest concert ever. More than 200,000 showed up, twice what Dylan had attracted. Springsteen opened, pointedly, with “Badlands,” but the indisputable highlight was his cover of “Chimes of Freedom,” a Dylan tune that Dylan himself had overlooked. The show, which in typical Springsteen style lasted nearly four hours, was beamed to millions of East Germans via state television. Many middle-aged Germans I interviewed for my book fondly recalled attending the performance or watching it on TV. “It was a nail in the coffin for East Germany,” one fan told the Guardian years later.
In Born to Run, Springsteen recounts a previous visit to East Berlin with bandmate Steve Van Zandt. “You could feel the boot,” he recalls. The wall, in Springsteen’s view, seemed almost “pornographic.” The experience helped shock the then-apolitical Van Zandt into decades of activism. “The power of the wall that split the world in two, its blunt, ugly, mesmerizing realness, couldn’t be underestimated,” Springsteen writes. “It was an offense to humanity.”
When Springsteen returned to East Berlin for his epic 1988 show, as I note in my own book, he unhappily discovered that the state was billing it as a “concert for the Sandinistas,” the pro-Communist Nicaraguans. So he delivered an impassioned speech. His German was grade-school level, but he got the point across: “I’m not here for any government. I’ve come to play rock and roll for you in the hope that one day all the barriers will be torn down.” East German officials backstage had somehow learned about Bruce’s original statement, which included the explosive word “walls,” and Springsteen’s manager, Jon Landau, had convinced him at the last minute to change it to “barriers.” But after finishing his statement, Springsteen quickly launched into “Chimes of Freedom,” which includes the key reference: “while the walls were tightening.” (See video up top which includes his remarks, then the song.)
The next day, he and the band “partied” at the East Berlin consulate, Springsteen writes, before heading back to the West to play a show for a mere 17,000 people — which “felt a lot less dramatic than what we’d just experienced.” Referring to the “stakes” of rock and roll, he writes, “The higher they’re pushed, the deeper and more thrilling the moment becomes. In East Germany in 1988, the center of the table was loaded down with a winner-take-all bounty that would explode into the liberating destruction of the Berlin Wall by the people.”
German historian Gerd Dietrich would later tell Rocking the Wall author Erik Kirschbaum, “Springsteen’s concert and speech certainly contributed in a large sense to the events leading up to the fall of the wall. It made people more eager for more and more change,” he said. “Springsteen aroused a greater interest in the West. It showed people how locked up they really were.”
As Springsteen himself would later put it, “Once in a while you play a place, you play a show that ends up staying inside of you, living with you for the rest of your life. East Berlin in 1988 was certainly one of them.”

So I’m really interested in the climate tech space and especially how AI/ML can be applied to help make the world sustainable.
In particular I found the Climate Change AI (CCAI) paper has a great taxonomy to start thinking about areas AI/ML applies to the climate tech world. However it does not offer a lot of on-the-ground examples of real startups working in the space. I was also unable to find a really satisfactory list anywhere online so I decided to make my own:
The current mapping is built an underlying dataset I built and have published publicly below. It’s an aggregation of the following sources: (Dealroom, Climate-KIC’s alumni page, PwC’s report on state of Climate Tech 2020, Angel List jobs board, this article from Tech Founders, this one from EU-Startups, and this one from MTC, as well as some conversations from the Work on Climate Slack and my own personal knowledge.
This is by no means an exhaustive mapping, but I do think it is currently the most comprehensive list for Berlin. However if there are any companies I’ve missed and you think should be added, I’d be really happy to hear from you.
As mentioned above, the CCAI paper has a great taxonomy which I used to start thinking about areas AI/ML applies to the climate tech world:
I did the categorization manually for both domain and subdomain, as the number of companies was still relatively small and I was interested in researching each organization individually.
I also added an additional boolean field ‘AI/ML’ in the data for companies who specifically mentioned using Machine Learning in their venture.
The climate tech space in Berlin is growing fast and it's exciting to see so many new companies and founders joining the space.
I hope to maintain and update this market map as the space grows and hopefully to expand to other areas in the EU (see, London). I’d also like to run some analysis on the dataset as it grows to understand some of the key trends emerging in this space.
In the meantime, feel free to reach out if you have any questions or comments.

(From someone who grew up there)
Berlin is great. It has culture — so much culture! It has a party scene, a café scene, a bookshop scene, a thrift store scene, a flea market scene, and a farmers market scene. And yet, six weeks ago, I felt the urge to pack up my things and leave. Berlin is like that one popular girl in high school whom you would lock eyes with in the hallway — the moment you couldn’t believe your luck, you would realize that she was looking right through you, as if you were water. Listen, everyone had a different take on the popular girl in high school. Most people simply loved her, which is what made her so popular. Yet, terminology such as “popular girl” or “mean girl” wouldn’t exist if there wasn’t also a certain fear or at least disdain involved. Berlin is a popular girl. You can’t fight me on that. And still — most likely, she will enchant you.
Imagine boarding the subway — yes, the famous yellow U-Bahn that is redonant of piss and houses two thirds of the city’s homeless population [figure deliberately invented]. And while you may think breathing through your scarf is the worst thing, or having to avoid eye contact with creepy strangers, or school children bumping their massive backpacks into you during rush hour, I can tell you that it isn’t any single one of those things. It’s that all these things are happening at once. You don’t get a second to yourself, not a second to just hold still and think, because there is someone very near you breathing down your neck.
At this point, you may have sworn to yourself to never visit Berlin or at least its subway — especially if you generally dislike big-city hustle — but there may be some of you who find the idea of the Berliner U Bahn romantic. And you know what? It is! We even have a world-famous musical that is merely about that. It’s called Linie 1. If you ever visit Berlin, you have to go. It’s wonderful and one of a kind.
I already mentioned that Berlin is the popular girl in high school, and what I mean by this is that she is pretty (very, very pretty) and a trendsetter in a rather basic and unoriginal way. She’d never try something truly new or crazy out herself but would only wear it if her peers approved it. I know that this sounds like a survival guide for high school, and it is, but in Berlin, it’s true for anyone from the age of five to thirty-five, and it is true any time you leave the safety of your own four walls. Popular girl is pretty, but she bites. Are you safe if you’re older? No. Popular girls ripen into Karens and lord knows they’re not safe to be around. You may be confused — am I talking about Berlin or people? The popular girls are the people who shape Berlin. They have no specific gender.
What is my conclusion? Berlin is fantastic if and only if you have a thick skin. If you can handle a stranger screaming at you on the street for no reason or a drunk person harassing you, you will enjoy a city full of sunshine, culture, delicious food, and endless things to do. Just make sure the popular girls like you.

This post is describing the best photography spots in Berlin. Most importantly these are not touristy places but the best for fine art and portrait photography. I do not mention such places as Brandenburger Tor or East-Side Gallery because it’s an author’s blog and I don’t try to make another copy-paste post about some landmarks of Berlin. I also work as a portrait photographer in Berlin and tried them out myself. If you search for unusual and interesting places to take pictures — this is the right place!
Hopefully, there are quite some photography lovers in Berlin who are also using Medium.
I will always update this list with the best photography spots in Berlin when I find new ones.
If you are coming from outside this platform and would like to read my articles for free you can also subscribe to my blog here
These are only my opinion on which locations are working well, but, of course, the photographer defines how the pictures will look like and not the locations.
I would say of course there’s no perfect place for photography, each photography project requires a different atmosphere, but yet some areas have a lot to offer while others are more generic. This post will be for mid-range pictures and photographers who prefer lenses between 35–70mm. It’s best to use prime lenses for learning photography. I would…

Coming June, we’ll have completed two years in Berlin. And let me tell you this: Berlin is not the easiest city to love at first. There, I’ve said it upfront.
When I first moved to Berlin, I didn’t get it. I had moved from Luxembourg, a rich-people’s rich country with rich-looking houses and squeaky-clean streets. Even the air there tasted rich. Compared to that, Berlin felt… rough around the edges. Littered roads, worn-out buildings, and unsmiling faces with austere eyes. A month in, and I was less than dazzled by the city. Nothing quite felt quaint, classic European about it — not the homes, not the streets, not the people, nothing. And this was when we lived in the allegedly prettier, greener, cleaner part of the city. For a while, I sulked like a brat refusing to eat lunch because they didn’t like what was served. But after a few months of indifference, boredom made me curious about what all the fuss was about Berlin being ‘so cool, so amazing, such a vibe’. And, boy, was I surprised!
Cut to a year later:
The more I wandered through Berlin’s history, art and subcultures, the more I read about its history, the more I witnessed its evidence pulsing at every turn (and underground), the more I submitted to its quirks and contradictions, the more the city grew on me.
This is, however, not a list of the historical and cultural milestones of the city, Google’s got that covered. This is about a weirdly funny realisation that crept up on me as I went about befriending the city.
The realisation? Berlin is a Scorpio, through and through: intense, magnetic, often misunderstood.
If I had to describe Berlin in five words, they’d be: Wall. Underground. Non-conformist. Creative. Transforming — each, a reflection of Scorpio’s soul.
Here’s why I think so.
The Berlin we know today rose from the ashes of Cold War destruction; the city quite literally rebuilt itself from ruins. Much like the Scorpio’s strength that lies in its unwavering resilience in the face of adversities to emerge victorious, Berlin’s greatest triumph is its inspiring story of resurrection. That Scorpio-spirit of reinvention pulses through daily life and subcultures: fashion that is not luxury but lived-in-cool; vintage, thrifting, and second-hand culture; abandoned spaces and empty lots upscaled into clubs, flea markets, event hubs, galleries, community gardens, and other breathing ecosystems, all without erasing their past. The city’s reinvention, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the city’s diverse subcultures mirror the Scorpio lifecycle: death, rebirth, and transformation.
This rebirth was not a one-shot event; it was a slow-burning movement that simmered through the 1970s and 80s in the abandoned factories and shunned industrial underbelly of the city. During these decades of secret underground rebellion against the Soviets emerged a palpable flood of creativity — punk, techno, dark comedy, graffiti, alternative museums — all forms of raw, unapologetic expression.
Unlike many other underground subcultures that eventually succumbed to the mainstream, Berlin has fiercely protected its exclusive, elusive and effervescent aura — a classic Scorpio move. The city is not trying to be seen. The city is not trying to impress. It chooses what to reveal, channeling mystery, secrecy, and that unmistakable magnetic pull of a Scorpio.
This night crawler lurks in plain sight, unleashing its passion and poison after the dark — much like the city’s nightlife and club culture. You know what they say about a Scorpio? Even when they’re incognito, you feel them. Same with Berlin.
If underground is one definition of Berlin, unconventional is the other. A city where weird is normal and kinky is loved, where vanilla is boring and edgy is celebrated, Berlin openly embraces what others may turn away from: the grey skies, the black moods, and even their dark history. Here, fashion is not the classic European chic; here, fashion has no rules and no boundaries. Sexy or minimalistic, both are welcome with zero judgement. In fact, goth is Berlin’s gospel and black, a no-nonsense dress code that the city loyalists swear by.
In essence, if counter-culture had a face, Berlin would be the poster child. This non-conformist vibe, however, is not a sign of smugness or arrogance. In fact, the city is not trying to please, it is simply comfortable being its honest self. Unapologetically unpretentious, often misunderstood — that’s Berlin. That’s Scorpio.
An interesting fact: beneath a Scorpio’s calm exterior is relentless desire for personal transformation and self-discovery — much like Berlin’s pulsating creative industry that is home to several cultural entrepreneurs, international artists, and media and entertainment companies. The city boasts a creative diversity few others can match. In Berlin, even when you’re alone, you’re never truly lonely. It blooms and booms with a plethora of passions: from pottery to poetry, hiking to pilates, stand-up comedy to gender fluidity, fetish and BDSM to role-play, drag to queer cabaret. There’s something for everyone here. Berlin knows no bounds when it comes to exploring emotional needs, a spirit that resonates deeply with the passionate and emotionally intense Scorpio.
Today, a part of the Berlin Wall remain, standing proud as a symbol of courage, creativity, and hope. Despite the unification of ideologies between East and West, a beautiful contradiction continues to exist in Berlin. Here, punk, goth, and kink co-exist with healing and mindfulness practices like yoga and breath-work, dance collectives, and gong baths. Here, edgy street culture blends with literature and intellectualism (you could literally meet a tattooed person in a hoodie in a bar and later learn that they’re working on a PhD). Berlin is as much about pride parades, climate protests, and anti-fascist graffiti, as it is about Prinzessinnengarten and community gardening workshops focused on rebuilding and nurturing. This is a city that supports radical, divergent fluidity, yet at same time converges like a moody monotonous canvas of black fashion and grey skies.
And finally, as journalist Emily Schultheis puts it: “Germans are increasingly debating how to balance their country’s collective responsibility for the past with a sense of national pride in the country’s achievements and culture.”
The contradictions — fiercely private vs. burning the dance floor, deeply emotional vs. capable of profound detachment, outwardly calm vs. fervent on the inside, constantly transforming and reinventing — all are quintessential Scorpio traits that Berlin embodies.
So, yes, Berlin may not have been the easiest city for me to love at first. The poignant history and lyrical culture aside, it comes with challenges that can feel monumentally frustrating in everyday life. Unless you are into — or open to exploring — the niche, alternative universe Berlin offers, you may not really get to taste the spicy flavour that makes Berlin uniquely Berlin. And without its one-of-a-kind charm, the city might feel like something you’ve already experienced elsewhere in Europe.
For me, the key to falling for Berlin was staying open, just like you would with a Scorpio: peeling back its layers of the unexpected, while also discovering everything else that makes it special — the food, the history, the warm summers, the lake-side picnics, the beautiful libraries, the green spaces, the inclusivity, the hundreds of fun things to do — all of which more than make up for some of the things I may never get to experience.
To me, this city is not all about fairytales; it is a dark romance. And that’s okay. Because Berlin is also a city with undeniably unique character. It is not classically beautiful, but it owns its scars. It does not always feel warm and welcoming, but it lets you be whoever you want with absolute acceptance. And once you learn to enjoy its many shades, it keeps you captivated.
The thing is, falling in love — and staying in love — with the complex, contradictory, beautiful chaos of a Scorpio takes time, patience, understanding, and a whole lot of emotional investment. And it’s absolutely worth it. Just like Berlin.

Rich history… these are the first words that come to mind when I think about Berlin. I was so interested in how much history is on display from this city in everyday spaces and museums. I loved how the city did not try to hide events of the holocaust or World War II but rather seeks to put it fully on display to make sure that folks never forget the horrendous events and make sure that it never happens again.
Learning about the Berlin Wall and being able to see and touch it in person was a very chilling experience. I could not truly grapple with how recent these events were and how life varied dramatically from then to now.
During our time in Berlin we did a lot of different tours and museums but one guided tour we had was particularly memorable for because of the detail we received. We saw a memorial that included time stamps of how some events unfolded on the day that the Berlin Wall fell. Understanding what that experience must have been like for some many East Germans was truly special. I am grateful to have learned more about what life was like during the Cold War at the DDR museum. The DDR museum showed a bit more about the ways in which life in east Germany was actually happening, from domestic life, cars, to military, we learned so much.
Lastly, our time in the Bundestag was memorable. Being able to watch the debate was interesting. Although I wish my German was better so I’d be able to fully comprehend the conversation, I still got a lot out of seeing democracy in action. I was left feeling more interested in how German politics compares to US Politics in terms of efficiency and polarization. I think there are actually a lot of similarities when thinking about the rise of Germany’s Far right party, the AfD, and some political factions in the US.
Although, I was sad to see the trip end so soon, I’m really glad that our last stop was in Berlin. Berlin to me encompassed the crux of it all in Germany. It had the culture, the rich history, the walkability, and so much more. I will cherish the memories made on this program and all the knowledge that I gained learning about sustainability.

Back in May I have announced, that I received an invitation from the Berlin Buzzwords org team to record live onsite.
The invite to do so actually came already for 2023, but due to family reasons I could not attend. It was a happy and an exciting moment to be able to finally come to Berlin to my favorite tech conference and record LIVE episodes with the speakers! In 2022 we have already spoken at the conference with Aarne Talman, our talk recording can be viewed here. Back then I have tried out an experimental format of recording an episode with conference participants. It felt nice, that this idea caught the attention of the conference org team.
The first episode I have recorded this year was with Doug Turnbull. It was also the first time we have met in person, although already in 2013 we have simultaneously attended the Lucene Revolution conference in Dublin. It turns out about that time Doug has also co-created Quepid, the tool I’ve been loud about for evaluating your search quality.
In this episode Doug shares how he thinks about everything he does as an act of learning in public: blogging, open source, book writing, speaking — I’d even add his posts on LinkedIn. Personally, I learn a lot from his thought leadership in search.
I will keep updating this blog post with more episodes I’ve recorded — so stay tuned! As usual, you will get to listen to these episodes on your lovely audio platforms — be sure to subscribe to be notified of new episodes.
And enjoy your summer!

Sociology is beautiful. Sociology is synonymous with stories, narratives, mythology, folktales, fantasies, fairytales and legends, foretold for generations and centuries by through the oral renderings of people : elders, grandparents etc. Myths are told and retold.
There is no better way to understand society without myths and folktales. We are nothing without stories.
Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué, a German author was the creator of the fable Undine (1811). The famous myth creature from European tradition called Undine, a water nymph who becomes human because of the love of a mortal man but will be forced to return to the water if he is unfaithful.
Some characteristics of Undine :
Must Watch : Undine (2020)
I love water, oceans and lakes, mermaids and Berlin. And this movie had it all! Undine is a modern-day fairytale romance, between diver and water nymph, successfully bringing the myth of Undine to life.
I made a list of locations and places in this movie I fell in love with and visited on numerous occasions. Nothing like wondering the streets of Berlin.
2. Berlin Hauptbahnhof, Berlin, Germany
3. Märkisches Museum, Am Köllnischen Park 5, Berlin, Germany
4. Spreebogenpark, Tiergarten, Berlin, Germany
5. Hackescher Markt
6. Galeria Kaufhof, Alexanderplatz

At first, just like any city, Berlin is full of strange faces and smells, the traffic sounds like most city noise, the streets full of tempting offers, doorways that lead into dark passages and cellars, and the next corner with its posted signs suggesting that you walk this way, or that way to discover a new experience, can make you feel as if a good weekend stay is ahead of you. But when your friend, whom you came to visit, takes you by the hand and leads you away from the shops, and into the real Berlin city, you may just, if lucky, begin to feel the magic of a city that holds secrets and temptations that have been the cause of some many a nomad to stop and become a villager, to settle and give up wandering through the world.
A visit to the hot spots of town where you can drink, dance, and meet all sorts in one night, becomes an introduction to a city that clearly offers everything for any taste.
To see the malls and the boulevards of Berlin that connect the present with the past. The old streets that…

It is the spring of 2003, midway through my first year in graduate school, and my friend Nathan had earlier that day acquired a used vinyl copy of David Bowie’s Station to Station from Amoeba Music. Some months later, we are driving down Sunset Boulevard listening to the song “Negativland” from Neu!’s 1972 debut album. Again, an ominous quasi-industrial noise, something like a jackhammer, leads off the track. Again, a muffled guitar squeals in the background, defiantly on its own trip as Michael Rother’s plodding baseline and Klaus Dinger’s motorik-beat propel the song forward. Again I explain, “This is the sound of postmodernism. . .”
Julian Knox, David Bowie and Romanticism, pp. 117–118
Bowie’s Berlin period is both famous and misunderstood. Well before the end of 1976 Bowie’s cocaine addiction had led him in and out of psychosis, dropped him to 90 lbs. on a diet of peppers and milk, and pushed him to the point of death. He knew he had to leave the United States and its easy availability of drugs just to save his life. In late 1976, he and his wife Angie moved to Switzerland, where they purchased a house. The couple was largely estranged by this point, alternating their time spent in the house rather than living together, and Bowie eventually moved to Berlin to share an apartment with Iggy Pop, whose career was floundering after the breakup of the Stooges.
Check out the iTunes playlist for David Bowie and Romanticism.
Bowie’s work after moving to Europe included co-writing and producing two albums for Iggy, both in 1977: The Idiot (recorded in Switzerland, final mixing in Berlin) and Lust for Life (Berlin). These albums most famously produced the songs “China Girl,” a later hit for David Bowie rerecorded for the album Let’s Dance (1983), and “Lust for Life,” Pop’s signature song. Bowie wrote music and Pop lyrics on both songs. Bowie then teamed up with Tony Visconti as producer and Brian Eno as collaborator on the albums Low (1977) and “Heroes” (1977).
Bowie wrapped up his work at the Hansa studio in Berlin with the soundtrack for his performance of Brecht’s Baal (1981). Lodger (1979), typically mentioned as the last of Bowie’s Berlin Trilogy, and the last album on which he collaborated with Brian Eno until 1995’s 1. Outside, was recorded in Switzerland and New York, not Berlin.
Watch “Station to Station” live on YouTube.
Julian Knox’s “Too Late to be Late Again: David Bowie, the Late 1970s, and Romanticism,” chapter 6 of David Bowie and Romanticism, explores the arrival of the “European canon” in Bowie’s music from Station to Station through the Berlin Trilogy to Scary Monsters against the background of German electronica, German Romanticism, Byron, and Coleridge — and his own personal life and growth.
Bowie’s Romanticism in this chapter is described as “a philosophy of artistic creation as self-disclosure, not through purportedly unfiltered, unmediated ‘sincerity,’ but rather through permutation and flux. . . [which] lies at the heart of a major strand of Romantic aesthetics, articulated by Coleridge in his appraisal of Shakespeare-as-Proteus: ‘to become by the power of Imagination another thing–Proteus, a river, a lion, yet still the God felt to be there’” (p. 122). Read more in David Bowie and Romanticism. Pick up a copy in The Bookstore or ask your local, college, or university library to order it.
Julian Knox is Assistant Professor of English at Georgia College & State University, where he teaches Romanticism, the eighteenth century, and Victorian literature, and where he coordinates the M.A. Program in Literature.

(In Search of George Wyllie’s Berlin Burd)
Last month, as one of the minders at The George Wyllie Foundation social media (For The Burds) I received an interesting late night message from Stevie Neil. Stevie is a member of the of the Ayrshire Ukulele Clan.
As a homage to George Wyllie’s favourite instrument, Stevie and the Clan played on the opening night of the George Wyllie Paper Boat exhibition at the Scottish Maritime Museum, Irvine back at beginning of July. (Exhibition continues until Monday 26th September)
While looking at the exhibition, Stevie became intrigued by the story of George Wyllie’s five-metre high Berlin Burd sculpture. George sited this gangly creature beside a section of the (four-metre high) Berlin Wall in 1988 just weeks before the wall came down.
George Wyllie made this Burd from stainless steel in Scotland and and transported across Europe to Berlin to look over the Berlin Wall. He worked with local school-children in Berlin and The George Wyllie Foundation has since been in touch with a few of the kids who remember the experience fondly.
At the time, given the political sensitivities surrounding the wall, politicians in Berlin were very cagey about giving George permission for such a project. One of the planning officials said to George at the time: “Ein vogel ist keen stein,” (“a bird is not a stone”).
This appealed to George’s sense of the absurd. Which of course the Burd was. As was the Wall. Despite the Burd not being a stone, George was given permission to place it beside the wall so that it keeked over it.
The George Wyllie Foundation (of which I am a Trustee) has always been a wee bit mystified as to the exact location of the big Berlin Burd. A couple of years ago, when his wee brother Burd found a permanent nest in The Scottish Parliament at Holyrood in Edinburgh, we made some enquiries but our lack of German stymied our attempts to track him down.
Intrigued, Stevie decided to seek out this giant flightless wonder for himself…
Stevie wrote to us: “I’ve just returned from Berlin where I managed to track down the Berlin Burd with the help of a German-speaking friend and some helpful locals.
“I found an article on the Burd on the Whysman education website and sent the link to my friend Amanda as we were heading to Berlin on holiday and thought it might be good to try to track it down.
“Amanda noticed from the picture in the article that it was in the French Quarter and did a bit more research on German websites before we left for Berlin. Once there we went to the area and went walkabout, initially without success.
“Amanda, who is fluent in German, then asked at the information office in a shopping mall whether anyone knew of it. No one did, but we were directed across the road to a small building where a representative of the factor responsible for maintenance of ‘monuments’ had a small office.
“Amanda made enquiries there and after a couple of phone calls we were directed further up the road.
IS IT A BURD…?
“I must say that while I had the notion of finding the Burd it was Amanda who did all the hard work and emailed the factor to advise of our success. It was also Amanda who translated the plaque for me and gave the explanatory notes.”
THE PLAQUE READS:
George Wyllie put up the Berlin Burd on the West Berlin side of the Wall on 1st December 1988 as part of a cultural initiative with children from schools in the Märkische Viertel under close observation by the East German police.On 9th November 2009 the Berlin Burd was finally moved to the former route of the Wall in memory of the Fall of the Wall.
Reinickendorf Youth Arts School Atrium
Explanatory notes:
The Berlin Burd is located on Wilhelmsruherdamm, near numbers 61–63, in the Märkisches Viertel, Reinickendorf, Berlin. It is on the route of the Wall marking the border between West and East Berlin, today between the administrative districts of Reinickendorf and Pankow.
The Märkisches Viertel or Quarter is the name of the large housing estate built in the 60s and 70s on West Berlin’s northeastern fringe.
The Jugendkunstschule Atrium or Youth Arts School is a local council funded institution which offers classes, projects, after school activities and workshops in all areas of the arts for children and youth in the area.

Right before Christmas, I had a wonderful chat with the Italian pastry chef Riccardo about baking, gastronomy, and quality over quantity food philosophy.
Navigating past two Turkish kiosks, an abandoned Uzbek restaurant, and a vibrant Argentinian empanada eatery, I finally reached the acclaimed Albatross Bakery on a rainy December afternoon. Culture fusion continued as I could see a fridge full of Italian sausages and cheeses along with organic German eggs from the outskirts of Berlin right beside a display proudly showcasing Panettones and German mulled wine. This imagery of flavours gives a snippet into the multicultural essence of Berlin; through food, you can journey through its history, learn and experience different communities that call this free-spirited city home.
Walking into the snug space of this Kreuzberg gem, the rich aroma of espresso notes hit my nose right away. Good coffee is not the main star here, though very important to accompany the praised Queen B pastry or a phenomenal and totally unexpected crem brulee croissant. Everything I tried was bursting with flavour and I didn’t even get to breads yet.
Pastry sizes are generously big here, and most would be happy about it. My partner had a different opinion, which I contemplated and eventually agreed with. The issue with regular pastry sizes in highly rated and ‘viral’ bakeries is that you want to try bits and pieces of each of them and not get stuffed. Has anyone ever considered mini-bite-sized pastries? The ones you get at the hotel breakfast buffet?!
One of the skilled Italian pastry chefs welcomed me warmly and showed me around as I introduced myself and my obsession with local bakeries. Riccardo proudly said that almost 90% of the produce in the bakery is organic and most come from Germany. Germans are real appreciators of bread and sourcing local ingredients is surely important for the younger generation, especially in a progressive city like Berlin.
Almond Croissant
Almond Croissant is a classic for me. The key is not to oversweeten it and make the almond paste flavour shine. Albatross made it work for my taste. The croissant was soft and not too crunchy on top. Sometimes I feel like bakeries overbake them until the hard biscuit-like texture forms on top, which I am not a fan of. If you feel like almond, marzipan and a soft pleasantly sweet buttery croissant — I’d say you’ve got some of the best in Berlin Almond Croissants here at Albatross Bakery.
Crem Brulee Croissant
I wasn’t the fan of a cronut — a well-known attempt to marry two unrelated in my humble opinion pastries. But it turned out to be surprisingly scrumptious. Not an overly sweet and well-balanced creation. I just love seeing such creative combinations of two fantastic on-its-own desserts It’s an act of courage. I recently saw a combo of cheesecake + baklava and I am still thinking about it. It can go either wrong or oddly good. This was the latter and I would certainly come back for more.
Queen B
This one I saw raving reviews about and had to test it. It was good. Really good. For the crunchy pastry fans especially. Unless you consider it cookie then. The pastry is quite well-baked and not much softness left inside. It was more like a combo of a buttery flaky caramelised cookie and a pastry. It was salty on top with sea salt flakes enhancing the caramel flavour. I loved the combination of flavours and would highly recommend trying it. For my preference, I do enjoy a variety of textures in a pastry and this one had the crunch dominating the entire experience.
Brownie
If you like your brownies fudgy and not spongy, this one is for you. It was like eating a fudge yummy candy. It is accidentally gluten-free as they use a tiny bit of starch instead of flour to attain the gooey texture.
Panettone
I am sure I wasn’t the only one attacked by panettone videos this year. I was curious to understand what is so special about panettone and maybe replace the usual “kučiukai” we eat during Christmas in Lithuania with the proud Italian sweet brioche.
What’s special about panettone?
Panettone is a rich and flavourful sweet brioche usually made from first class flour, egg yolks, lots of butter & raisins. Quality ingredients is the key here, no shortcuts. The one I tested had Sicilian mandarines and extra dark chocolate on top.
Italians also have Pandoro, which is kind of a brother of panettone. It is a bit more plain in flavour, without a filling inside.
For the artisanal panettone, stiff Italian sourdough is usually used, which requires much more skill and time than traditional bread sourdough. The long fermentation process, special skill required and top-quality ingredients are what make a price difference.
The best tip from an Italian pastry chef was to make sure you heat your panettone for a little bit so it becomes more fragrant and soft.
I picked one up and my family ended up with three different panettones this year. It was so soft and fluffy that we ate it easily on its own. I had some recipes in mind on how to use up ‘old’ panettone (french toasting it or whipping up mascarpone as a spread). Safe to say that no ‘old’ panettone was left in our house. And I am already thinking about the flavour I want to try next year, which is a pistachio-filled one.
Albatross Bakery also has a Pistachio Croissant that I didn’t try and a rotating Seasonal Danish that changes every few months depending on the local ingredients.
Have a flaky weekend and a buttery Monday:)

An ex-pat turned local’s favorite photo spots
If you have read any of my articles before, you know I love history. Huge fan. So indulge me as I walk you through a bit of Berlin’s history. Berlin first appears in the history books in the 1200s. Its strategic location along the river Spree allowed it to become a hotspot for traders and mercantile. There was even a sister city, Kölln, nearby, but as Berlin grew, it ended up engulfing the city with it.
The story of Berlin begins around Nikolaiviertel, or Nicolas Quarter. Here the Nikolaikirche dominates the small square surrounded by rebuilt shops and restaurants that give you a feel of how Berlin would have looked before the war.
As Berlin grew it would later become the capital and permanent residence of the Hohenzollern’s, the electoral princes of Brandenburg, in the 1400s. The city would later become the capital city of the Prussian empire and in the 1700s would expand and grow, adding palaces and infrastructure worthy of a capital city.
Things would stay this way until the World Wars. Berlin was destroyed and divided and served as the playground for the world powers after World War II. This split history would also lead to different alternative movements, the Berlin Wall, and different architectural styles. Which leads us to the now — the alternative, “poor but sexy” Berlin that attracts millions each year.
As a photographer and lover of history and architecture, my favorite photo spots revolve around my favorite historical places. But, to keep this interesting, I will not just point out my favorite locations, but where you should go to shoot the best shots. Now there are things that factor in to this, like construction, etc., but these are generally the best locations that I like to shoot from.
Nikolaiviertel — A tragically missed location in most people’s visit to Berlin, the Nikolaiviertel is the historic heart of the city. Don’t make that mistake. It is right by both Museum Island as well as the Rotes Rathaus, so just take an hour here, even plan lunch or dinner. You won’t regret it! Also, if you do a river cruise through here you get a really great view of the quarter from the river.
Berliner Dome — The Berliner Dome is stunning from all angles. Hike to the top for views over the city, and find new angles along the spree. My favorite spot is back by James-Simon Park, but I also love the view from the other bridge, from Marx & Engels Park.
Gendarmenmarkt — The twin churches that surround the theatre is probably the greatest example of Berlin in its prime. Built in the 1700s, this square is the perfect place to wander and explore new angles to shoot. I love the view from the stairs of the church, or if you can stitch a panorama then smack dab in the middle is where you want to be!
Berlin Wall — The Berlin Wall can be seen from all over the city. There is the section by Checkpoint Charlie, as well as the famous East Side Gallery. This is where all of the graffiti is, and next Oberbaumbrücke as well, so you can easily combine those things!
Teufelsberg — Devil’s Mountain, the famous old NSA spy grounds during the cold war, has some of the best graffiti you will find. In the middle area you will find a tractor. Amazing prop to add some depth to your photography.
TV Tower — The iconic Soviet TV Tower stands tall in Berlin and can be seen from almost anywhere. Literally. You can climb it and photograph the city from above, or search for all sorts of different locations to nail the view. There is the top of the Berliner Dome, Hackescher Markt, and even out by Brandenburg Gate. I also love the view from Prenzlauer Allee as you move further back from the tower (as long as you have a zoom lens mind you).
Brandenburg Gate — The iconic Brandenburg Gate will definitely make it on your photo list, and for good reason. If you can, and the weather is good, wake up for sun rise and you can get stunning light coming through. If not, sunset works from the other direction just as well!
Schloss Charlottenburg — The little escape from Berlin provides amazing photo opportunities as well as beautiful parks to stroll around. The photo at the front gate is incredible, but back by the bridge in the gardens there is always some amazing reflections you can get!
Reichstag/Bundestag — the seat of parliament and the German government is really a stunning building. Get tickets in advance to climb the iconic glass dome, or simply walk around it. The view from the river by Marie-Elisabeth-Lüders-Haus is stunning, as are both side angles. Generally the front on picture isn’t my favorite as there is dead grass and generally police boxes stationed there, but you can take one there too if you want! Also, the view from Brandenburg Gate is also really cool!
Oberbaumbrücke — A stunning bridge from the pre-war time, the Oberbaumbrücke is an amazing location to shoot. Try up close, up the roads a little bit, from the s-bahn stop, and then my personal favorite is from the water around Hotel nhow Berlin.
If you made this far I would like to reward you with my map of my locations. Thank you for reading, and what are your favorite locations in Berlin and where do you shoot them from?

Now sit back and relax because it’s time to talk about more travel lessons from our first European Christmas! While not an official birthday trip, I have always wanted to experience Christmas in Europe, so as part of our post-pandemic family travel and to celebrate turning 40, we went to Europe with my brother and my parents for two weeks in December.
If you’ve read my entry about our trip with Sergio’s parents and sister to Paris and Rome, this blog is in a similar vein, with travel planning, tips, and reflections. Each trip is a little different, and the lessons are a little different as well — in this case, traveling in winter meant a little extra planning to stay warm and dry.
But let’s get into it! I can smell the mulled wine…
Sergio and I have long been shoulder-season people — a luxury to indulge in if you’re not a parent and thus married to a school holiday schedule — but we tend to split holidays between my family in Washington State and his family in Chihuahua, Mexico. Christmas tends to be family-centered because everyone is together and it’s easier to see everyone at once.
It’s not that I don’t like tradition — but Christmas is a special season, and I’ve wanted to experience it elsewhere (say, Hawai’i) for some time, but it just hadn’t panned out. Christmas in Europe, however, ended up being a (more immediate) family experience and it was fun to travel in the true off-season.
Depending on your family members, you might have a group of eager travel planning beavers or a low-key set of folks who are happy to travel to a variety of places. For my family, I’ve always found it useful to come with some ideas while putting their preferences in mind (eg; clean and quiet accommodations, easy to see sights, etc.). Europe is chock-full of Christmas markets, but Dresden was one that popped to the top of the list in my research, giving one point on the map and making it easier to choose the end-points on either side — Berlin, with which we had some familiarity, and Prague, which my brother knew. That helped us narrow down the list of possibilities and put together the main Prague-Dresden-Berlin itinerary.
I did a lot of the planning with some assumptions (many of the considerations about mobility, walking distances, etc. that I mentioned in my previous post), but I also had the good fortune to learn from our first family trip to Paris and Rome. The biggest difference between the two trips was that we saw virtually no American tourists in any of our cities in December. Really and truly, basically none save a few folks here and there. And maybe this was a pandemic hangover as well, but there weren’t a lot of tourists in general! There were only two sites that required tickets far in advance (more info later in the post) so it was a relief to be in a space that wasn’t nearly as crowded. It makes me curious what other European destinations would be great in the winter!
But back to the planning — I already wrote about creating a shared doc and a Google Map so anyone can participate. The most important thing I’ve learned? Taking a trip together doesn’t mean you have to do every activity together! It was something that I knew before, but to have a harmonious two weeks, it helps to have a lot of flexibility so that people can travel at their own pace as well as see those places that most interest them. Case-in-point: My dad had a minor foot injury that meant walking longer distances on back-to-back days was difficult, so that necessitated putting longer walking activities a day or two apart, or choosing activities that he wasn’t interested in during the afternoons when he was resting.
We chose hotels for our previous trip to Paris and Rome but decided on AirBnbs for this trip. Our options in these December cities were much, much better, and much more affordable, especially when we needed three bedrooms. It’s hard to find rental apartments with 4.98 stars, but we stayed in three of them and it was lovely. This put us in central neighborhoods with good public transit and access to sights, all super-important to reduce walking and increase accessibility. You probably have a preference for hotels or rentals, but I’d encourage you to look at both quickly because in some cities there’s a clear winner.
Now to packing — as much as I prefer to pack light, it’s a little bit more difficult when you’re traveling in December, and we knew we had to prepare for rain, snow, and wind. Another factor that tipped us towards apartments was that we were able to get two with laundry facilities, making it easier to pack fewer pairs of pants and shirts so that we could make room for snow boots (and souvenirs). The most important items were warm, waterproof shoes, wool socks, very warm jackets, warm gloves, hats, and a scarf. One positive about all of these destinations is that they’re not fancy cities (we’re not fancy people!) so a nice sweater or top with dark jeans was enough for any meal out. As a Seattle girl, I must tell you that your winter jacket is likely not warm enough (but if you’re from Minneapolis or Chicago, you’re probably prepared).
With everything packed it was just a manner of days before we boarded a plane in Seattle for our SEA-LHR-PRG journey! I tend to feel a little anxious before a big trip, but we had planned very well so sometimes you just have to let the butterflies flutter a bit and just do the damn thing.
So let’s start with our first stop, which was Prague! There’s something about Prague that makes it a perfect jet-lag city: The main attractions are in a rather compact area, there aren’t that many of them, and public transit links most of them togther. We chose a longer layover in LHR to allow for enough time to move throughout Terminal 5 with my parents (the right choice) so we landed in the Czech Republic in darkness, tried to stay awake in the cab for the ride to our apartment, and passed out as soon as heads hit pillows.
The castle complex was a perfect first-day activity — whether it was the tomb of Saint Wenceslaus (a duke, not a king as the song suggests) or the Old Royal Palace, we were greeted with beautiful views of the city and kept moving so as not to fall asleep. The views of the old city are beautiful, and depiste the cold there was a festive atmosphere.
For me, the highlight of the city was taking a Christmas Market walking tour with Jiří (George in English). He took us by tram to some local Christmas markets with a bunch of quirky stops along the way, including sparklers, writing wishes on dove-shaped papers in a cathedral, and drinking some sort of homemade Czech liquor. The introvert in me doesn’t gravitate towards these sorts of activities, but my biggest travel insight of 2023 was that these local experiences can really make a trip more memorable. Again, a huge benefit of traveling with different people is that you try activites that you otherwise might skip, and for some people those personal connections make the city come alive!
Prague isn’t a very heavy museum town — and I’m past the point of taking photos in most museums — but I can wholeheartedly recommend the Mucha Museum as well as the Museum of Communism. I could spend hours upon hours in a museum (see visiting four Smithsonians in two days in January), but smaller museums are more manageable and allow you to get a taste of something while balancing everyone’s interests.
Prague really was a short stop, but I felt like it was a city that was doable in a few days. We ended our last day with an incredible walk across the Charles Bridge with the castle shining on the hill above us. It was one wild train ride from Prague to our next stop — Dresden!
Dresden was the city I was most excited about for this trip, and it didn’t disappoint! Are you ready for the Christmas Market to end all Christmas markets? Well, we went to the main market in Dresden which was started in 1434 and it was it’s 589th year when we visited. It also has the world’s tallest Weihnachtspyramide (Christmas pyramid, fondly called “The Twirly” in our house)! But beyond this, Dresden is a friendly and walkable city with easy-to-navigate public transit, and wind aplenty.
So let’s talk a minute about how to get around as an American — or non-German speaker. As with most places in Europe these days, English fluency is as high as it has ever been, and this is especially true in Germany. Like our trip to France, I was the only person who had any German language skills to use, but there were only a few situations where English alone wouldn’t suffice. The trickiest items tend to be ticket machines or menus, but with Google Translate you’ll get there. As always, hello, thank you, and please are good to know wherever you go (that’s Guten Tag, danke, and bitte, if you are wondering).
Dresden was firebombed at the end of the Second World War by the British and the Americans, destroying its inner city and burning alive about 25,000 inhabitants. The city center was largely recontructed in a traditional style (compared to a city like Frankfurt that re-built itself as a modern city), but the beautiful Parade of Nobles (below) survived because they were fired at a higher temperature than the incendiary bombs. It is a procession of famous local nobles from the twelfth to the first years of the twentieth centuries.
Unfortunately not all of the landmarks were so lucky, and because Dresden was part of the Deutsche Demokratische Republik (East Germany, to Americans), many historical buildings remained ruins until German reunification in 1990. What was particularly inspiring was that the town’s citizens donated 92% of the funds needed to reconstruct the church in the style of the one that was destroyed.
Lastly, Dresden is also a museum city, but one that is still under construction. The Green Vault (no photos inside, sorry) was one of the two attractions this trip that needed an advanced reservation, and security was particularly tight because of a 2019 theft. But its jewelry, porcelain, and decorative collections were amazing — but, as in other museums, few benches are available, so consider your companions and give plenty of time for rest. The Zwinger complex (also under construction — it was a mud mess!) included one of the quirkier museums of the trip — a museum of math and physical instruments. How fantastic to see the evolution of the globe and microscope!
Before we go to Berlin, let’s take a short break to talk about one of my favorite parts of the trip — the food! I look forward to any trip to Germany to eat delicious bread and dumplings and any sort of meat I can imagine. But Berlin in particular is a fantastic food city — we had incredible vegan pastries, Persian food, a wide variety of pastries, and fantastic Thai food.
The food at the markets was just as good as I thought it would be. Since I’m currently not drinking to keep my autoimmune hepatitis in remission, I only partook in a few sips of Glühwein (literally “glow wine,” or mulled wine), but you can collect little mugs from each market to take home (or return it and get your Pfand — deposit — back). There was ample Wurst (sausage) and Knödel (dumplings), and a variety of sweet pastries, hot doughnuts, and desserts. Our last Christmas Market in Berlin had indoor tent seating — how lovely to sit on faux furs and eat dessert while the wind whips outside!
So the biggest oops! of this trip was renting the Mega Van in Dresden. If you know Sergio at all, you’ll know that he’s a fantastically-skilled driver, even when we visited England and he drove a mega-van on the opposite side of the car/road and parallel-parked in one go (might I say that I live my life very impressed at his skill in all things and sometimes very jealous because how can he do all this stuff so well?).
Barry and Sergio went to the airport in Dresden to pick up the Mega Van from Hertz — and as they left I felt really positive about it. I’m a big fan of train travel, but our ride from Prague to Dresden was pretty chaotic on the Prague side, and with larger bags and extra space, a car seemed like a great idea. We would have the car — with free street parking in Dresden and a garage space in Berlin — to enable some day trips and also make it easier to cart luggage. It felt like a great way to ensure more comfort and mobility for my parents too.
But.
… As soon as I saw the Mega Van I knew this wasn’t the right decision. First of all, Dresden was so easy to get around that we didn’t need the car. We did have a reserved garage space in Berlin, but after measuring the van dimensions and the garage dimensions there was no way it was going to fit. We agreed to eat the cost of it and return it so we wouldn’t have to move it around every eight hours on the street. But this albatross didn’t go easily! Navigating the van return to the nearby train station was the most stressful part of the whole trip — and when we got to the rental car return garage, I was literally outside of the Mega Van running alongside it to make sure that we didn’t burst a pipe or get stuck on the ceiling (it didn’t), but after that experience we agreed never again. Never. ever. again.
That being said, if we didn’t get the Mega Van, we wouldn’t have had our random drive from Dresden to Berlin with a stop at what we thought was a beautiful castle but was actually an exhibit on a very niche East German film called Three Hazelnuts for Cinderella — and if you think it’s weird, I can’t even start to convey how bizarre it is to be in an experience where everyone around you knows and loves a thing and it’s completely lost on you.
Well, at least the outside looked nice.
Did you know that this part of Germany is Luther country? It is — and Luther is a complicated guy (I‘d recommend Martin Luther, Renegade and Prophet to learn more about him) but despite the bitter cold Sergio and I decided to stick it out and take a train to Wittenberg (since the mega-van had been returned), so our first day in Berlin was actually spent in Wittenberg. Sergio and I started going to church just a few weeks earlier (worthy of another blog post, but not today) so it was also an opportunity for him to learn a bit more about Lutheranism, as he was raised Catholic.
Wittenberg was a perfect day trip! I imagine December had something to do with it, but we felt like we had the entire town to ourselves! The two main things to see in the town are the two churches — the Schlosskirche (Castle Church) and the Stadtkirche (Town Church) of Saint Mary’s. The former was attached to the university and both the location of the doors where the 99 theses were (supposedly) posted as well as the tomb of Martin Luther himself. Rick Steves had a fantastic walking tour for the city — he’s also Lutheran — that helped us to understand the meaning what started in this humble university town.
There isn’t that much else to do in the winter in Wittenberg, so we had a long, lazy lunch, perused the Christmas Market (which included an accordion choir concert!) and a nearby shopping mall, and then took a long walk back to the train station… for a train that was almost two hours delayed!
As I always say, never go anywhere without a book…
So despite all of the travel that we’ve done, I’m not sure that I’ve ever visited a place that I’d like to live in more than Berlin. And as I researched for this trip I was thrilled to discover that many sites and museums are open over the holiday, even on Christmas Day itself, making Berlin a wonderful place for Christmas.
It’s easy to be attached to your American view of Christmas — everything bedecked in lights and tinsel — but that might just be the United States being (yet again) a little extra. For example, Christmas trees are trimmed on Christmas Eve and there were no mall Santas to be found — though the Cathedral had a beautiful tree and manger scene. So if you can set aside Christmas expectations, December was a fantastic time to travel with many fewer tourists and attractions to oneself!
My favorite site this trip was the Reichstag Dome climb. The Reichstag is the home of the German Federal Parliament — the Bundestag — and the building it self is rich in history. It was burned to the ground in the 1930s and not reconstructed until the Berlin Wall fell. The modern dome sits atop a classical building, and within the dome itself you can see all the way to the parliament’s floor, symbolizing the belief that the people of Germany should know what’s happening in the government. A wide, gently-sloped ramp circles up and then down the outside of the dome, providing a sweeping view of the city… that would’ve been better in the daytime.
Since Berlin has so much history and character, it was hard to narrow down all of the sites to visit, but we really enjoyed the DDR Museum (compact and full of daily-life exhibits), the Berlin Wall Memorial (outside and included real parts of the Wall that were still standing), and, of course, Museum Island. While the Pergamon Museum is still closed for renovation (sob!), the Old and New National Galleries are spectactular.
We love you, Berlin. You make any trip a little bit sweeter!
Things are delayed even in Germany — in fact, during one train delay on our day trip to Wittenberg, the Germans were saying to one another, “This wouldn’t be happening if we were in Switzerland!” and for the two of you that think that’s funny, I hope we’re already friends.
We packed everything up, double-checked that we had our passports ready, set some early alarms, and made it out of the apartment by 7am… to find out that our flight from Berlin to London was cancelled en route. Poor Sergio was on the phone with British Airways and the calls kept dropping, so it took four or five calls before we were rebooked for the following day. There were a few hotels at the airport and we were able to get some rooms to make our airport experience the following day much easier.
I think everyone else was pretty tired by this point, which was a reminder that two weeks is a long trip from home when you’re not in your best travel shape. As a maximizer I want to fit the maximum days into a trip if I’ve flown to another continent, but two two-week trips showed me that perhaps it would be better to aim for 10–12 days abroad so we’re finishing on a high note!
Me being me I looked up some attractions that didn’t involve returning into Berlin proper, which included a WWII museum that focused on the Soviet experience (something you learn little about as an American ) — and then Sergio and I decided to get another long day of walking in at Tierpark Berlin, their “safari” park outside of the city center. We went to bed tired and happy, and the homeward journey went off without a hitch.
Well, we’re at the tail end of this post, so it’s time to wrap things up on this trip! Whether in this post or my previous entry about traveling with the Ricos, I hope you enjoyed tagging along with us and perhaps came away with a few travel ideas for yourself.
So what’s next? Let’s say I’m an antsy lady unless I’m dreaming of another trip. Since we’ve had some great road trip energy lately, we’re gearing up for potential road trips in Norway and France this year! No definite plans, but a lot of planning and excitement about our next trips to the Continent!
Auf Wiedersehen, S

During our five days in Berlin, we visited a different museum nearly every day. We enjoyed seeing many intricately framed old masters and stunning landscapes, but what we noticed most was the inclusion of interactive screens and buttons. We wondered how much it had to do with a generation raised with cellphones.
Berlin’s Hamburger Bahnhof (the old train station whose trains went to Hamburg) was turned into a modern art museum with a new wing devoted to mostly large and noisy pieces of art. There were a few beautiful pieces, like the floor constructed of ropes and fabric, but many of the displays were shockingly ugly and required turning things on, watching screens, or listening to blaring music. I thought that messages and meaning too frequently took the place of aesthetics.
One afternoon we walked to Jewish Museum, renowned for its Daniel Liebeskind designed building that required a rigorous security check followed by navigating an underground tunnel. It took a while for us to recognize that there wasn’t a single right angle in the museum. We found much of it disorienting and depressing, because for the most part, it wasn’t designed for those of us who are Judaically educated and involved in Jewish life.
Instead, it reminded me of the museums Hitler planned, the ones that showcased the life and artifacts of a people that no longer existed. The exhibits, one after another, portrayed Jewish history and artifacts via video installations, exhibits that required interaction, and recordings of music or spoken descriptions of day-to-day Jewish life in different centuries and regions.
The museum was packed with groups of tourists and student groups engaged in pressing all those buttons, for example, hearing the voices of Jews who loved Wagner’s music but struggled with his antisemitism, and watching video clips from films with essentially Jewish themes.
I spent a few moments re-watching the video of Raid on Entebbe, about the 1976 Israeli military operation to free hostages after a French flight was diverted to Uganda and Jewish passengers were separated from the rest of the passengers. The terrorists were two German militants and two Palestinian operatives — five people were wounded and the only one to die was Yonaton Netanyahu, older brother of current prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.
After nearly two hours, we were tired of all the input, the screens, the noise, and the technology. We headed to the Israeli-run Museum café where we shared an excellent spinach boureka topped with tahini and pomegranate seeds.
Then we left the museum and meandered a bit, suddenly coming upon a street filled with engraved plaques embedded in the pavement. Each plaque contained a quotation of one of the world’s great minds (I snapped a picture of Baruch Spinoza’s quotation.
There were few people about and nobody else seemed to notice that this was the Path of Visionaries, a “symbol of global unity.” The path, we learned is a city project that passes Checkpoint Charlie (formerly a dividing point between east and west Berlin), and ends at the Oranienburger Tur, near where we were staying. Exhausted by then, we hopped on a train and returned to the hotel for a nap.
Since we’ve already been back in Chicago for a week, and I just found this unsent essay, I’ll end my notes about the trip by extolling the fabulous concert we saw that evening. It was part of the Berlin Jazz Festival, a sold-out performance about the Music of Django Reinhardt, in one of the Berlin Opera’s smaller halls.
Although my German wasn’t advanced enough to understand the narrator describing the life of the great Django, I’d studied the jazz musicians during a college elective and knew his trajectory (I remembered being shocked about the fire that left him only able to use two fingers on his left hand and he still managed to play like he did).
Waiting to get into the concert hall, I struck up a conversation with a young woman who was there on her own, and we ended up sitting together for the concert, talking in between songs. We were both blown away by the virtuosity of Joscho Stephan, one of the world’s great gypsy jazz guitarists, and it was delightful to make a new friend in Germany.
The next day, Christine, my new friend, sent a list of good places to eat, but we only had time to try Princess Cheesecake. Berlin is now officially on my list of the cities I want to return to.

The Berlin Exit is the not-so-secret escape hatch used by a certain type of Berlin resident — usually broke, usually clever, and usually somewhere between Neukölln and Bali. It’s not to be confused with the Irish Exit (leaving a party without saying goodbye), though it’s spiritually similar. The Berlin Exit is more like leaving the country without saying goodbye to the bureaucracy — while still collecting its money.
This strategy walks a tightrope. Sure, it’s fraud if you’re caught. But it’s also a wink at the sluggish system that gave you a six-month wait to speak to a Sachbearbeiter. Germany expects you to be physically available for work if you’re getting benefits. If you’re in Mexico? You’re not physically available. Overcharging subtenants? Also illegal under § 556d BGB.
If you get caught, expect fines, repayment demands, and possible criminal charges. But until then… you’re just another expat ‘working remotely’ from a beach café.
Some got sloppy. Some got unlucky. But a few notable cases have emerged of Berliners being chased down for:
Investigations often begin with anonymous tips, undelivered mail, or suspiciously tan Instagram selfies.
To some, the Berlin Exit is a middle finger to the system. To others, it’s freeloading dressed up as digital nomadism. Either way, it reveals the cracks in a system that hasn’t caught up with a world where “home” is just a postal address and Wi-Fi signal.
There are Telegram groups, half-ironic t-shirts, and coffee table guides titled things like “How to Finesse the Jobcenter from Georgia”. The Berlin Exit is not just a tactic — it’s a meme, a mood, and sometimes, a mistake.
The Berlin Exit has, over time, evolved from a quiet tactic into a kind of underground lifestyle aesthetic — equal parts survival strategy, protest, and meme. In online forums, Telegram groups, and bar conversations from Neukölln to Chiang Mai, the Berlin Exit is discussed not only as a practical option but also as a tongue-in-cheek critique of neo-liberal bureaucracy and Germany’s increasingly precarious middle class.
Entire threads on Reddit, Facebook expat groups, and private Signal chats have dissected the ins and outs of pulling off the Berlin Exit successfully. Users swap tips on mail forwarding hacks, proxy logins, remote job contracts, and the friendliest social workers. Some create guide PDFs or Google Docs titled things like “How to Vanish Elegantly” or “Bürgergeld from the Beach.”
T-shirts reading “Ich bin systemrelevant (aber in Thailand)” and “Amt Ghost Mode: ON” have been spotted in Kreuzberg bars and Lisbon cafés. A niche Berlin techno label once released a vinyl compilation called Exit Strategies Vol. 1, whose tracks were named after Jobcenter forms and abandoned mailboxes. Now who would want to have anything to do with you — if you wore a tee shirt like in german man is another thing. Oh let me talk to the guy who is scamnin the system a wears a tee shirt about it.
For some, the Berlin Exit isn’t just fraud — it’s anti-work praxis. It represents a refusal to engage with exploitative labor models while pointing out systemic inconsistencies in who gets help and who doesn’t. Critics call it freeloading; others call it economic jiu-jitsu.
Academic circles have even begun to reference the trend in papers on post-capitalist migration, urban gentrification backlash, and algorithmic welfare surveillance, often framing it as a quiet rebellion against punitive state mechanisms.
This article is intended for satirical and informational purposes only. Do not commit benefit fraud. Or if you do, don’t blog about it. don’t put it on tik-tok or Instagram.

Unglaublich is the German word for unbelievable — the best way to describe visiting Germany for the first time and communicating with people in a language I first started learning in college.
Especially when I was able to go to a shop in the Schöneberg district and feel at ease.
The boxes of ink for fountain pens in front of me were like the alphabet building blocks of my childhood — colorful, with some easily understandable to me and some not.
“Wie viel kostet es?” I asked without thinking. (How much does it cost?)
The answer was, in fact, too much. I decided on something else, and when the shop attendant rang me up saying my total was “seven Euros and fifty cents,” she quickly apologized for speaking English — since I had addressed her in German.
As an American who has been learning German for just three years, I would have never expected a German to say Entschuldigung (pardon me) for speaking my native language to me, instead of their own.
Berlin is known as a multicultural city, whose 940,000 foreign-born residents come from more than 170 countries. Though there’s no clear data about how many Berliners speak English, it is a prevalent second language, with many signs, restaurant menus, and often even public transit announcements offered in both German and English.
In my experience, language learners wanting to practice their German in Berlin need to be adamant about using it as often as possible, because it’s easy to travel here without needing to use it.
I don’t have other colleagues with German experience on the Berlin Beyond Borders editorial team, so I’ve mainly practiced my German ordering at restaurants. In more tourist-centered areas such as Holzmarktstraße in Mitte, service workers have automatically spoken to me in English.
According to Rolando Montanchez, a Peruvian restaurant manager who has lived in the city for seven years, sometimes they are German speakers that want to flex their English muscles and sometimes they are foreign-born workers with stronger English skills. It’s stressful to lack fluency, but I push myself to speak German through my mistakes.
What’s more challenging than being understood is to understand. Luckily, German speakers have never been more accessible. From the prerecorded overhead announcements at the U- and S-Bahn stations to catching up at a café with friends who now live here, I’ve been improving through keeping my ears open and piecing together the words I know.
More than that, I’ve been exposed to the written language absolutely everywhere. I brought my habit of reading everything around me to Berlin and it really is the best practice. My favorite aspect of the culture, that I’ve been able to absorb this way, is German humor — which I would say exists, but is very subtle. And much of it is text-based.
For example, the gift shop at the Cecilienhof villa in Potsdam has a few minimalist postcards with ‘inspirational’ quotes. One with earnest commentary from Spanish painter Salvador Dalí reads: “Was mich interessiert ist Geld (What interests me is money).” A Euro and 50 centsdoesn’t accurately measure the joy I felt to have understood the postcard.
That is all to say, sometimes I look at sentences in job advertisements and go back to being four years old, building structures with alphabet blocks. When I speak, I build with the ones I recognize and can grab the quickest. When I listen, it’s as though I’m reconstructing a preexisting — sometimes much too sophisticated — structure. And when I read, sometimes theblock combinations don’t make much sense.
But I am not without resources to figure out how to build better. Thanks to the online bilingual dictionary LEO, the translator app DeepL, and our course researcher-interpreter Vanessa, I feel more confident going at it again the next time. It all comes down to making the next attempt. AndI consider it a privilege to not just have the opportunity to practice these language skills, but to finally live in German. Unglaublich.

This will not end well.
Or at least, that was the first thing we saw in Berlin. An art exhibition with exactly that title.
Arriving Saturday morning, we would not start with brunch. Of course not! Man, it’s Berlin, we gotta do the extraordinary stuff. Or at least if we follow the reputation of Berlin among Germans.
Extraordinary. Edgy.
And everything but mainstream.
And if something is mainstream, be sure it’s hard to find in Berlin. So here we were – at that exhibition about drugs and relationships, in a large glass cube surrounded by snow, at 10 in the morning.
Artist Nan Golding put her life (evolving around drug addiction) on 6 or 7 video clips and delivered a disturbing and empathetic basis for discussions with my friends. But this deserves another article.

Berlin is the vibrant capital of Germany. It is one of Germany’s most attractive cities, for fair reasons as it is Home to the World’s longest bear garden, epic music, and art scene. This capital of diversity and freedom sets trends and there is always something unique to discover. Berlin is also honored with a matchless rich history as compared to other European Cities. Ranging from the world’s longest beer garden to the most currywurst, we will lay odds you must be unaware of these Top Facts about Berlin. There must be some fascinating reasons why people keep coming back to Berlin.
Here are some top facts about Berlin, that you shouldn’t skip out on
Although Berlin is nine times bigger than Paris, it is not as crowded as Paris. Paris has a population of 21000 per square km while Berlin has 4000 inhabitants per square km. That’s why Berlin feels even more voluminous.
The length of the East Side Gallery is 1,316 meters and displays over 100 murals from artists around the world. The most captured mural is the Fraternal Kiss, which manifests the former Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and GDR Erich Honecker. The gallery is sited on the banks of the Spree in Friedrichshafen where scraps of the Berlin Wall can be seen.
Berlin has 180 museums while on average 106 rainy days. The most fascinating museums on the check-list to visit are:
This stopover zoo accommodates over 1,300 different species with 20,000 animals and covers an area of 82 acres. It is open to all and entertains both young and elders and permits some fun activities with animals so marked as the most famous zoo in Europe
The Doner spits possess around 63 kg of meat, which shows that 60 tons of meat are consumed in a day. The Berlin Doner originated from Turkish-style kebabs.
Can you imagine that there are about 1700 bridges in Berlin? The most memorable and well-known is the Oberbaumbrücke between Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain. Researchers also investigate the fact that Berlin has more waterways than Amsterdam, Venice, and Stockholm combined. So, get ready to explore the beauty of nature in Berlin.
There is a Spati located in almost every corner of Berlin. Late-night workers who are helpless to purchase groceries or essentials during the day originated the Spati stereotype in East Germany where they built it to serve their demands. Currently, Berlin people can’t survive without a Spati. You can buy your grocery or any essentials at any time of the day or night just near at hand.
Another top fact about the Capital of Germany, Berlin is that it is very lucky to accommodate more than 2000000 dogs and so was voted as Germany’s most dog-friendly city in 2011. There are about 114,968 registered dogs and along with unregistered dogs, it sums up to above 2000000 dogs. Yes! You got to know the right thing that you need to register your dogs in Germany and have to pay taxes accordingly.

Currywurst is one of the most demanded fast food dishes in Berlin. Back in 1949, a woman named Herta Heuer invented this delicious snack. She mixes ketchup or Worcestershire sauce with curry powder delivered by a British soldier. She blended this mixture with other pieces and marinated it over grilled pork sausage. Then put it on sale at a street stand in Charlottenburg. In its full swing, this stand could sell 10,000 currywurst every week. Now, about 70 million currywurst are consumed in Berlin each year.
Berlin, the capital of Germany is among the fifth most beautiful capitals in the World. So, here you can explore another top fact that Berlin is blessed to be the greenest city in Germany. It is devoid of skyscrapers and bureaucratic buildings. Open green space and woodlands cover about 30 percent of this city. There are almost 2500 parks and 431,000 trees packing the streets of Berlin. The tallest tree in the capital of Germany is a European larch that was planted in the Tegel Forest in 1795. It was named Dicke Marie.
Yeh! You have just read the true fact about base flying in Berlin. You can enjoy the breathtaking view of Berlin from 125m above Alexanderplatz from Park Inn. here you are free to choose your Base Fly ride. Berlin’s horizon glows in the night so go for the base fly after sunset or at night.
The cleaning of this Berlin’s graffiti cost about € 35 million every year. This magical street art is a fantastic piece of craft that should never be overlooked.
The Berlin transport system is so extensive that it covers almost 8.7 times around the Globe each day. It extends to about 473 km and adds about 120 km of tram lines. This capital of Germany possesses one of the most impressive public transport systems in the world. Just for correlation, Paris and London have 214 km and 400 km of public transport systems respectively. It would also be worth knowing about the sightseeing bus to Guimaraes.
About 40% of Berlin runs down your shoes, making them about twice the size it seems to be from the surface. The undercover world of Berlin consists of a compound railway network, a complex network of bunkers, and escape tunnels from World War II and brewer cellars. There is a wide range of underground beer over there. These underground bunkers including Nazis’ secret tunnels and living areas are now accessible to tourists.

When I learned that Globetrotters Monthly Challenge theme this August would be Street Art, my mind instantly travelled there: Berlin.
Berlin! I have been there twice, and the first time I was there I noticed one specific thing about the capital of Germany: It feels guilt, a lot of guilt.
One can spot this guilt all around the city. At the countless monuments, memorials, and artworks devoted to World War II, the Holocaust, and the Cold War. Most of these works, despite beautiful, are understandably gray in color.
A city that still digests the horrors of World War II, and still somewhat believes it has to repay something to the world. And the same city that still has scars of being torn apart, becoming ground zero for a whole world that was cut in half by two struggling giants. Berlin became the symbol of a broken world that lasted for four decades.
But it is exactly in the greatest scar of that great city that the colors bloom their brightest. The remaining parts of the Berlin Wall long became an open-air gallery, that to some extent purged all the dark from the past and celebrated life in a city that needs to show everybody it is much more than its history.
A city that feels the need to scream “I’m Alive!!”
The art at the west face of the wall started in the mid-80s, and as far as I could notice, it is as flourishing as ever.
So keep on, Berlin! Keep throwing colors over the wall of shame, so as Fulvio Pinna would say, freedom is ashamed no more.
I would like to share these two stories, the first one is from Anupa Jayakody, and her three days around Berlin;
medium.com
The second one is the beautiful Anne Bonfert story full of amazing photographs of the Berliner autumn. Need to confess that I have a kind of soft spot for that season.

We didn’t consciously plan to be in Germany for Trump’s second inauguration. It just worked out that way, a quirk of our schedules. When we realized that we would in fact be in Berlin on January 20th, my girlfriend joked maybe we could seek asylum.
I’d never been to Germany before. I guess I’d kept nursing a grudge born in the afternoon Hebrew School sessions of my Anne Frank-forward reform-Jewish childhood. But my best friend was in Berlin on a research grant and invited us to visit. So while Trump and his cronies shuffled around to bar mitzvah staple “YMCA” (not a gay anthem, apparently!) at the pre-inauguration rally, we staggered, jet-lagged, to a co-ed bathhouse in Kreuzberg.
First thing on our Monday agenda was a Berlin Underworld tour, where a charismatic tour guide led us through some of the tunnels beneath the Berlin Wall that people used to escape. He broke down Berlin 101 for those of us with only hazy 1980s childhood memories of divided Germany: After WWII, Germany was divvied up and occupied by the conquering forces. The US poured resources into West Berlin, and the USSR siphoned resources out of East Berlin, installing the socialist DDR government (GDR to us English-speakers).
Nearly overnight, East Berlin became a prison, with border guards given orders to shoot anyone trying to pass into West Berlin, even if they were just trying to visit the friends or family who a few days earlier had been neighbors. The DDR blocked off the city’s subway tunnels, installing guards to make sure no one was using the tunnels to sneak from West Berlin to East Berlin. “Why didn’t the guard system work very well?” the tour guide prompted the crowd.
“They could be bribed?” someone guessed.
He nodded while saying no, like a stern school teacher. “They escaped themselves,” he said. “The DDR had to make adjustments.” He directed our attention to a photograph of guards chained to their outposts.
We learned about how, as the wall became more fortified, people snuck through the sewers, preferring to literally swim through shit than to stay in their suddenly oppressive regime. A question that came up a lot was some iteration of: Wasn’t it telling that people hated the DDR so much they would risk their life to escape? If nothing else, wasn’t that bad PR? The tour guide answered this by widening his eyes and nodding meaningfully.
Eventually, he told us, people started to dig their own tunnels. “Mostly young men,” he explained, “because you know, young men can be stupid enough to be brave.” I felt an uncharacteristic surge of love for stupid, brave men.
We emerged blinking into the weak January sunlight.
“Would I be brave?” I kept asking. “If things were so scary?”
My girlfriend’s German friend said, “You probably would, if you had to be.”
After the tour, we stopped for coffee and cake at a nearby cafe, me and my girlfriend and my best friend, three queer women living our lives so freely that we’d taken this rather spontaneous trip to Europe because we felt like it. I checked the New York Times on my phone. “Oh god,” I said. “That’s right, he’s being inaugurated.” We all groaned, and changed the subject.
The next thing on the agenda that day was the DDR Museum, an oddly whimsical exhibition tucked into the bank of the River Spree, across from the Berlin Cathedral, a giant Baroque structure that somehow survived Allied bombing in one of those unscathed bits of Berlin that looks like any European city.
The museum breaks down the different aspects of daily life in East Berlin, including a replica of a typical apartment. I have to admit this really backfired for us, freelance creatives from New York City. “Wait, everyone was given a job? With benefits?” we marveled. “There was universal childcare? Everyone had a cute little apartment? And then they took vacations to nude beaches on the Baltic Sea?” I read that people in East Berlin had more sex than people in West Berlin, and contraception was readily available for women. I mean, we got that it was generally a bad scene, but still.
We kept taking pictures of the cute 60s wallpaper and fixtures. A plaque in the apartment replica explained that since so many things were so shitty (I’m paraphrasing), people retreated into coziness, focusing on making their living spaces as cozy and welcoming as they could. “Maybe coziness is what will get us through the next four years,” my best friend said, and we both laughed nervously.
It was a busy time for us, but things were busier stateside: Our country’s new president signed a stack of executive orders, promised mass deportations and more border barriers at the US-Mexico border, moved to end birthright citizenship, withdrew the US from the Paris Climate Agreement and the World Health Organization, ordered the dismantling of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives, pardoned members of extremist groups, and established a policy of “recognizing two sexes,” targeting transgender and LGBTQ+ Americans. His unelected advisor gave a Nazi salute.
Back in Berlin, it was date night. After dinner at the lush Tajikistan Tearoom, my girlfriend and I made our way to a queer bar called the Tipsy Bear in Prenzlauer Berg, a neighborhood that during the occupation was home to East Berlin’s counterculture of activists, artists, and the gay community. A sign at the bar read in English: “Welcoming Environment for Everyone — If you are racist/sexist/homophobic/or an ASSHOLE, don’t come in.”
We ordered stiff drinks, tired from the day and the dribs of news we couldn’t stop peeking at our phones for. Soon the music began. It turned out there was a drag king show that night. We held hands in a crowd of queer people from all over, and watched painfully hot women in drag act out winking stories of machismo lotharios and foolish kings. I wanted to cry, especially during the finale, when the drag kings from each act got up on stage together for a rousing rendition of “YMCA,” a song I’ve never before been overjoyed to hear.
Did they know how much we needed this? Did they know what this meant in this moment for Americans? Or is it just a gay anthem, no matter what anyone says?
There in East Berlin, everyone danced and sang along.
PS Preorder my novel Animal Instinct, a “juicy novel exploring what it means to start again at midlife” (according to Nightbitch author Rachel Yoder) and one of LGBTQ Reads’ Most Anticipated LGBTQ+ Books of 2025

Berlin is internationally famous for its techno clubs and my visits to Tresor and Berghain upheld the stereotypes: dark spaces with intense flashing light shows, blurred by the occasional smoke screen. Loud, heavy, four-on-the-floor industrial techno rattles the concrete structure of the buildings, as well as the bones of those either dancing in ecstasy or swaying as they try to not to fall over from exhaustion.
But just because the techno scene now lives above ground doesn’t mean the rest of Berlin’s music scene does.
Hidden across the city are many punk and DIY venues that offer a space for a community of musicians to create their own art. In my time in Berlin, I’ve looked at posters taped to walls and light poles, searched names online, and asked around for some places to see a show.
Køpi, a squatting development in Kreuzberg, has a couple spaces for live music performances. I entered through a gate, obscured from street view by some vegetation. Behind it was a courtyard area flanked by the building’s two short wings. Its cracked, concrete facade was well adorned with colorful graffiti murals of contorted human figures, stencil art, and the common message of “kein foto,” no photography allowed.
German Punk Time meant I waited well over an hour for the show to start. In that time, I played a game of pick-up basketball with a few of the people who lived there, trying to avoid splashing in the puddles in the courtyard’s potholes. At Køpi, the line between public and private living spaces feels non-existent.
Koma F, the performance area at Køpi, was down a flight of stairs in a basement. Old bricks, rounded from age, formed arched ceilings in what felt like a former storage space. A crowd of around 30 people — who were well beyond their 20s — fit the punk cliché, dressed in black vests with studs and large boots.
The two bands that played, Shell-Shocked from Berlin and Disturbance from Rotterdam in the Netherlands, both reflected this vintage aesthetic in their music. Shell-Shocked had quick tremolo pickings that droned over blasting d-beats. The band’s vocalist stumbled around the front of the stage, leaning back while screaming into the mic, looking as if he was trying to swallow a sword.
Disturbance was much more straight forward, playing into the punk sentiment of less-is-more. They had a definite Oi! punk sound with frequent gang vocals sung over more classic stylings of simple rock-and-roll songs, but played faster and noisier. This affinity for the past makes sense as Disturbance has been a band since 1995. Perhaps you can critique them for never evolving, or holding onto the past too hard even from the beginning, but they were still entertaining enough for the people who came to see them.
The other venue I went to was OGH, located somewhere in the sprawling southern neighborhood of Neukölln. The entrance was tucked in an alleyway. Beyond the door, a stairwell splotched with graffiti and posters led up to the fourth floor of the warehouse space. There, the stage stood at the front of what looked like a former office area. In the backhalf of the space, people sat and talked between sets at a bar and lounge area. Large windows lined the entire wall of the venue, where many people looked out over the alleyway at surrounding apartment blocks.
The show at OGH followed a more post-punk garage sound, without the aggressiveness of hardcore. The bands were Dackelkontakt from Potsdam, Fantuzzi in Berlin, and Teo Wise, an Italian living in Leipzig. About 50 people filled the space. Dackelkontakt went first, sitting behind a small synth array set on a repurposed ironing board. They played fast, peppy, synthpunk tracks with a bit of added whimsy from the little squeals of a theremin. Often songs would pause for brief spoken word parts, traded off between members, including at the climax of their set when two of the band members quickly and aggravatedly talked over each other for about 30 seconds before falling into the last riff.
At the end, Teo Wise performed his light but robust punk tracks. Together with the other members of his band, they mastered the balance of playing locked-in and succinct while effecting a sprawling free spirit that gave the music so much livid personality. Wise’s set moved the audience into an ecstatic dance, with shoes slipping across a sweat slicked concrete floor.Most enthralling was that everyone danced together. There were no imposed boundaries as people whirled around each other, one person making contact with another’s psyche, before turning to the next, until there was a point of connection between everyone in the room. Theboundaries of the individual became invisible.
After the set, people lingered in the fourth-floor warehouse loft for well over an hour. They were simply talking, making new acquaintances, and building on the commonalities they had found during the performance. Whether it be two people just passing through the city, or someone finding a new community, these moments define life and cannot be manufactured. In Berlin, they can still be found in DIY spaces — if you just know where to look.

A Lesbian’s Guide to Berlin: 3 must-visit places (disability friendly),https://medium.com/@artementis/a-lesbians-guide-to-berlin-the-3-best-places-to-visit-disability-friendly-40e4e55cb73c,"Sign up

I’ll be honest, when I first got to Berlin, I was underwhelmed. For years, my friends had told me how much I would love it in the German capital — it’s the gay centre of Europe after all. Perhaps my expectations of rainbow bunting hanging from every balcony and LGBTQ+ museums dominating the streets were set a little too high.
I did find some lesbian history in the obvious places; the recognition of the suffering and slaughter endured by homosexuals in war-time Germany is poignant and moving, and the video memorial in Tiergarten is beautiful. Only, in the so-called gay capital of the continent, I expected to find, well… more. I should have taken the title at face value. While there are lots of events, bars and even sections of parks dedicated to the getting together of gay, cisgender men, the scene for women-loving-women and non-binary people (FLINTA* as it’s known in German) is scarce, under-advertised and according to one server I met in a lesbian-owned cafe, “disappearing fast”. The events that do exist for lesbians are almost exclusively weekly club nights. While fun for dancing, drinking and mixing with other FLINTA folk, these events are, at best, a little dull after your 51st Lesbian Tuesday of the year and at worst, are exclusionary to whole sections of the disabled community. I’ve included the club nights I encountered at the bottom of this post, so feel free to skip ahead if that’s more your scene. But the main purpose of this post is to shine a light on the few FLINTA-focused places I, a disabled lesbian, sought out when visiting Berlin.
Hands down, this is the best place to go if you’re looking for a lesbian crowd, without the partying and alcohol. Run by a British/American lesbian couple, Lonely Hearts Cafe is a fusion of both countries’ breakfast staples. Pancakes and fry-ups sit side-by-side on the menu and they have extensive allergen info readily available for my IBS buddies. Coeliacs can also enjoy food here — they were happy to prepare my order on a separate surface and brought out gluten free toast and vegan butter for me to enjoy with my fry-up.
When I walk in, the place is full of eccentrically-dressed people who (call it gaydar) I immediately assume to be queer. I take a seat along a bench under a neon sign that reads Lonely Hearts and from the back of the room, admire the other quirks this restaurant has to offer. It’s a cosy cafe, which mashes together British and American aesthetics so well, from the black and white letterboard for hot drinks, which looks like it might belong in a chippy, to the hand-drawn sign advertising iced tea. The teaspoons are in Marmite jars, the knives and forks in a large Coleman’s mustard tin, but there’s Tabasco in the condiment container. The red wooden benches have you believing you’re in a 50s American diner until you look at the throw pillows, which place you more in a granny-owned cafe in Surrey. My server, Amy, brings me iced water in a jug and I order a pot of Yorkshire Tea and a Full English. The bandana in her hair screams cottagecore lesbian who abandoned home to run off to a European city and set up a café with her wife... which seems to be exactly what happened. After eating, I use the bathroom. Opening the door is a queer cultural experience in itself. The small room I find myself in is decorated floor-to-ceiling with pictures of Dolly Parton. Even the toilet is Dolly-themed. I have to stop and laugh, take pictures and smile at my reflection in the neon-clad mirror. When I go back out to pay, I spend all my pocket change on merchandise — a t-shirt, mug and sticker set — to remember the queerest café I ever did meet.
It’s impossible to tell what this place is from the outside. The blue canopy is like a red herring for heterosexual people to be lured in, suspecting a green grocer’s and then you see the pink signage, graffiti and rainbow doormat and know they’ve got LGBerlin to a T. Inside, Keller Kreuzberg is full to bursting with art, clothing, cards, tarot decks, books, badges and so much more. I’ve never seen so much merchandise dedicated to LGBTQ+ people in one place. The store does a good job at catering to women as well; the kink section in the basement level has a good range of products for all body types and artwork that bares the same diversity. It’s got a furry pink ceiling which is beside the point but cool. I loved the sex-positive merchandise all around. Though the spiciest stuff remains downstairs, the shop isn’t shy about its stance on sex. My favourite items were a keychain that read, ‘it’s vulva not vagina’ and two naked women in a car painted on a coaster. The only thing I was a little disappointed in was a slight lack of lesbian-specific merchandise in the store, though there was some — I found a hat with the lesbian flag and some prints and cards featuring two women. The main focus was on queer-centered merchandise, which I understand from a business perspective sells better to the masses. But the owner of this shop also agreed with the Lonely Hearts team: the lesbian scene in Berlin is slim pickings. They did give me a tip on a good place to spend some time though, so I headed there next.
Lesbian pal of mine, how many times a day do you think about abandoning your desk job to start a female-focused, bookshop-cum-coffee shop? Five times a day? Nine times a day? Just fifteen minutes from Keller Kreuzberg on foot is She Said bookshop, which specialises in queer, literature written by women. And it’s got a café. They did it folks, they really did it. I spent over an hour wandering around here, picking up books in English and in German — partly to test whether or not I could still remember vocabulary from A-level German. (Spoilers, reader: I could not.) The level of diversity across the shelves is what you want from all bookstores, all written by FLINTA on a wide variety of subjects from fiction to memoir to poetry. I ended up walking away with a bundle of titles I hadn’t heard of before and devoured them on my night train to Brussels the next evening. With its cute café serving sandwiches, cakes and hot drinks, you could easily spend an afternoon here browsing the shelves, consuming coffee and queer literature ’til closing time.
Thanks to the wonderful small business owners I spoke to in the places listed above for these recommendations!
Other Nature — “a queer-feminist, sex-positive, eco-friendly and vegan sex shop” specialising in body-safe sex toys, locally-made kink gear, natural lubes and feminine hygiene products (amongst other wonderful things!)
Siegessäule — an online resource dedicated to queer information, events and guides in Berlin.
Schwules Museum — Berlin’s LGBTQ+ museum and art gallery. I did actually visit this museum but it didn’t make my top three purely because of its size. I paid almost the same entrance fee for this museum as I did for entry to Museum Island, and as far as I could see there was just one, small exhibition room. The exhibition itself was fantastic, full of lesbian artwork which I loved and bought prints of, but it would have been nice to see more! The tea in the cafe, however, was some of the best I’ve ever had. Their website states that admission is free on the first Sunday of the month, so I’d advise taking advantage of this when planning your trip.
I didn’t visit one myself but a lesbian friend of mine who lives in Berlin recommended the Tuesday lesbian night at Möbel Olfe — a bar widely known in Berlin for its gay scene. As far as I’m aware, Tuesday seems to be the night for bars and clubs to lesbi-fy, so bear this in mind if you’re planning a party trip!
Notes:
*Meaning “Frauen, Lesben, Intergeschlechtliche, Nichtbinäre, Trans und Agender”. Or in English, “Women, Lesbians, Intersex, Non-binary, Trans and Agenda”.

I’ve come to realize just how much our surroundings can immediately influence the way we feel and live. Even with the best intentions, if our environment doesn’t align with the life we’re trying to build, it can slowly drag us in a different direction.
As someone who genuinely values wellness — not just fitness, but a balanced lifestyle — I started feeling really out of place in Berlin, where the culture often revolves around techno, party scenes, kink, smoking, drinking, drug use, and getting by on gig work and state support.
Yes, I said it.
So yeah… I’m counting down the days until I leave Berlin.
I’ve been feeling exhausted — not just physically, but mentally and spiritually too. Lately, my coping mechanism has been traveling, trying to shake off the energy around me. If I can afford the trip, I go.
But then I have to come back, right? And as soon as I do, it all hits me again.
So, I’ve started seriously thinking about ditching Berlin for good. Wild, I know. But, as I’m not exactly rolling in money, and as dreamy as it sounds to just chase sunsets and sip cocktails by the beach, reality’s got other plans. Like, you know… needing an actual job. Minor detail.
But you’re talking to Miss “I Got a Plan” over here. Structured as heck, checklist in hand.
First, things first, I will finish my short-term work contract in Berlin, then find a proper job — ideally one that doesn’t evaporate in six months. Radical idea, I know. And, move! Somewhere. Anywhere. Preferably with fewer existential crises per square meter.
Surprise, surprise — after a six-month-long panic search, most job leads pointed right back to… you guessed it: Berlin (shockingly original) or in that other glittering gem of excitement: Frankfurt am Main. Honestly, I don’t even know what’s worse — Berlin’s militant wokeness or Frankfurt’s charming little drug haven, the Bahnhofsviertel.
Oh, the irony… Am I giving off too much of “Alan is Morissette ’95” vibes if I start singing, “Isn’t it ironic?” Because that feels like the perfect soundtrack.
If you’ve ever felt like you love a place but it just doesn’t love your lifestyle back — trust that feeling. You don’t have to shrink your values to fit.
Seven months of job hunting across Germany’s “livable” expat-friendly medium-sized cities, and the only way out is out of the country. The economy’s going straight down the drain, so jobs are disappearing faster than my patience. Oh, and to add some extra spice, every single role now expects you to be a SQL, Python, and AI specialist.
I asked around with some colleagues and friends who are job hunting too, thinking maybe I’m just unlucky. Turns out, nope, the same story for them. Everyone’s just hanging on to whatever they can, and the ones who actually can do something are waving goodbye and not in a “see you later” way.
So yeah, the options right now? Not great. In Berlin, most jobs are short-term contracts, with only a handful leading to permanent roles. On top of that, tons of German and international companies based in Germany are outsourcing operations to cheaper countries or relocating staff abroad. So basically, if you’re not planning to survive on social welfare, you either have to accept lower pay and live paycheck to paycheck in constant instability or… well, there’s not really a “or” at this point.
I always wanted this blog to be as honest as possible, because life as an immigrant is way more about adapting to constantly changing circumstances. I chose this path, and I’m fully aware of what it means. But… deep down, I still wish I could make it all work without so much stress.

This guide contains a collection of dos and don’ts to make sure you and everyone you’re raving with has a great time while clubbing. Although it’s based on the Berlin club culture, I’d be happy to see this applied everywhere where people are enjoying music together — be it at a club, festival or concert anywhere in the world.
I’ve spent a significant amount of my lifetime on the dance floor, because that’s simply one of the things in life that gives me the most joy. I was lucky enough to get introduced to the Berlin nightlife, festivals and Burns by great friends and experienced ravers, but often enough I meet people who didn’t get a chance for such an introduction. And although I don’t think that too much of advice is needed for yourself to have fun while clubbing in Berlin, I feel like there certainly are some things to keep in mind in order to make sure your fellow ravers are also having a great time.
So basically this is me wanting others to behave the way I consider appropriate, just so that I can keep on enjoying my time raving as much as possible. But that sounds terribly egocentric, so let’s not put it that way…
Figuring out where to go and how to dress can be challenging. There are quite a few guides available for selecting the right club or what to wear to blend in, but let me quickly add some points: The vibe you’ll experience will greatly vary between different clubs — and even between different events at the same club — so try out as much as you can. You’ll eventually find the scene you’ll enjoy the most. And while you generally should adhere to dress codes (e.g. no streetwear), don’t overthink it. The most important thing is that you’re being comfortable. Feel free to express yourself, your fellow ravers won’t judge. The people that do are not the people whose opinion you should care about. Avoid dressing a certain way just because others are doing it, go with your own style.
Although you should pack as light as possible, make sure to bring essentials that you or others may need. You’ll need cash in most clubs unfortunately, and ATMs in or at clubs often come with deposit fees. Don’t underestimate the importance of ear plugs, preventing hearing damage is reasonable in general and in some locations the sound can be unpleasantly loud. Bringing chewing gum, a lighter (even if you don’t smoke) or tampon and pain killer (even if you’re not going to need it) are easy ways to earn some karma points.
If you’re planning to do drugs: Do proper research about the substances that you consider consuming and also check how they interact with each other. The TripSit wiki is a great resource for that. Don’t try out stuff for the first time in a club you’ve never been to before or without people you trust and don’t push your limits. Remember that set and setting are key for psychedelic experiences. If possible, purchase what you need outside of the club, prepare it for consumption and label it properly. Club toilets are not a great place for doing that! Read about safer use guidelines.
If you’re not planning to do drugs: Awesome, chances are you’ll get into ecstasy just by focusing on the music and visual effects anyway! However, I would still recommend reading up on the effects of common party drugs, since quite a few people around you will be high. It will help you understand why people are behaving in certain ways, and empathy is key for having a great time together.
Most people will be joining the queue between 12 am and 3 am and it can stay crowded until the early morning. I personally never understood that and feel it’s much more comfortable to avoid arriving at the prime time.
Perks of arriving early: You get to skip the super long queues and are less likely to be rejected. I get that, for many people, queueing is part of the experience and I’ve met a fair share of my friends randomly while waiting in line. However, I’d rather spend that time chatting in a chill-out area inside, or dancing on the not yet crowded dance floor. Some clubs also have a reduced entry fee or cheaper drinks before midnight.
Alternatively, arriving in the morning can also be great (given you selected a club that isn’t closing): You’ll also avoid the entry queue, and the people that are still there or arriving with you are the really motivated ones. If you got some sleep during the night before, this will also be easier on your sleep schedule for the next day. Unfortunate timing can have you queuing for the coat check together with people that want to leave though.
Whenever you arrive, please don’t skip the queue unless you know someone who’s already in line. Some people make a sport out of it, but it’s simply annoying for everyone else.
Just like at the entry queue, please don’t push to the front. Know what you want to order before being asked. Have money prepared and don’t start looking for cash after your drinks are ready. Give a tip if everything was alright. Leave the bar counter after you paid. Same applies to the coat check.
Chances are that you’ll spend more time queuing for a bathroom stall than for drinks at the bar. And that’s mainly because they’re being used for taking drugs without needing to worry about the security.
If you’re in need for a place to consume stuff, first check if there are other options. Many clubs provide some conveniently separated small areas, these are there for this exact purpose (not to be confused with dark rooms meant for sexual encounters). The club staff won’t disrupt you there. If only bathrooms are available, make sure to minimise the time you spend in the stall and share it with other people that just need it for the same reason.
If you’re actually in need to relieve yourself with some urgency, it’s not unlikely that people will let you take their place in line if you ask nicely. Look out for groups of people that seam like they’ll not use the toilet for its intended purpose. Remember to check if there’s toilet paper in your stall before you need it, since there often is none.
Let loose and dance like no-one is watching. And smile while you’re at it. Having fun is contagious, your motivation will lift the mood of everyone around you. Similarly, if you’re not currently feeling it, don’t stand still right in front of the DJ looking like you’re forced to be there. Maybe go explore the other areas or grab a drink instead.
Dancing is so much more fun if you’re seeing how others are enjoying the music too. The dance floor is not the place to have smalltalk at, or to call the friend you’re supposed to be with, or to check your connection for the way home. Focus on the music and allow others to do the same.
The single most annoying thing for many ravers are other people using their phones (occasionally challenged by rude wasted people). A few clubs will require you to leave your phone at the coat check, most will cover your cameras. And that’s for a reason. Capturing the experience you’re having using a phone camera will likely be underwhelming and it’s degrading the experience that others are having. If you need to message someone, don’t do so in the middle of the dance floor. Your screen will be blinding and distracting for people around you. You and others will have the best time if you manage to not use your phone at all.
This should go without saying, but just be nice. Respect the personal space of others. If you bump into someone, say sorry. If you spill someones drink, go get a new one. If you find something that someone else lost, return it at the bar or coat check. If you see someone that could use help, offer some or go get the awareness team. Treat others the way you would like to be treated. Try finding joy in others having a great time with you, e.g. by doing a random act of kindness to a stranger. Offering water to someone who looks like they might be dehydrated is an always appreciated gesture. Imagine strangers just being friends of friends that you didn’t get introduced to yet. They might actually are!
For some more general guidelines that are worth being aware of, I’d recommend checking out:
If you’ve made it this far, I’m certain you’ll be a great rave companion.See you on the dance floor!

The spectrum only has two ends. No in between. People hate or love Berlin. The city hosts the most colorful contradictions: Snobby districts, fucked up districts. Start-up career character or totally lost. Techno drug scene, sober yoga class society. Grey in grey or wild nature. Go home with understatement, the city screams. Choose your mix of extremes!
Describing Berlin as a whole is merely feasible. It makes me say ‘anarchy’. Not in a purely chaotic sense. Rather with a tiny sparkle. ✨ I just don’t recognize a concept in Berlin. There is no average reference point. Which is probably the most remarkable thing about the city.
“In Berlin, anti conformance is a default” — my old roomie, who lives there
If you are an outlier in your hometown, you’re gonna feel pretty normal in Berlin. Therefore, outliers are wildly attracted to the city: The city makes non-average the new average. And people are proud of it. “I live in Berlin” is rather a phrase to describe an identity than a residence.
Everything, also the tyniest, most unremarkable part of Berlin seems unique. Even the train sound when arriving at a station was dedicated an anthem to by famous Berlin DJ Paul Kalkbrenner. It’s called Train. As if that would be the most normal thing.
And I love it. 🖤

After living in Berlin for almost six months, it’s time to remedy my failure in writing about its multitude of offerings.
That’s the thing with cities like this, ones spread out over land and history and culture; the sites of early palaces and modern immigration centers. The latest example of gentrification and one of the most well known sites of counterculture movements. A club scene for the leather-clad, but also a site for the wannabe artist and yoga practitioner. It’s just got too much!
Not even a year here will give me a chance to truly sense the song sung by the pulse of this city’s enduring arrhythmia. Instead, I’ll share a few of the spaces that have brought me joy while fall turned to winter and Berlin became the place I call home.
No list of recommendations by a Feldman exists without copious consideration for the locale’s foods. Without an aside on food’s integral place in cultural definition and experience, I’ll recommend a small slice of Berlin’s best culinary experiences.
From April to October, Thai Park street-food market swarms the green space of Preußenpark with delectable, colorful, lustrous-smelling Thai goodies. A cultural event as much as an opportunity for food, grabbing a steaming hot bun and a boba tea, a plate of rolls and a small fruit cake, sitting on the grass to enjoy your scores, Thai Park brings a joyous mix of culture to every demographic in Berlin.
Transported by the sound of Thai spoken at every stall, I used German to order my friends and I steaming vegetable buns, mini pumpkin cake, traditional tea, and noodle dishes. The food was good, the experience was better. Counting down the days until April.
The United State’s lacks a lot of Europe’s most redeeming qualities. And no, not the welfare state or the responsible gun laws, I’m talking about proper Western-Chinese cuisine. I love Chinese food as much as the next coastal Jew, but nothing could prepare me for finding out I’ve been lacking Sichuan noodles my entire life.
In comes Wen Cheng’s, the noodle house of my dreams. Hand-pulled, Sichuan noodles and a low-intensity atmosphere. Just the people of Berlin, and their f*cking delicious noodles.
Split — or don’t — a Gua Bao (Bao Bun) and a classic noodle dish on the sidewalk of Prenzlauer Berg (you can expect a decent line). You won’t think of much else for a while.
Another food I’ll truly never find an equal of elsewhere is, you guessed it, Döner. I like to joke that Döner is one of Germany’s most vital infrastructures, and I have yet to be proven wrong. There’s no one that doesn’t love it. A gift of the Turkish population in Berlin since the 70’s, Döner really is special to the mix of cultures in German cities, and more rural areas alike.
Don’t be mistaken and compare your local Kebab house for the satisfying flavors of Döner sauces, the endless carts of breads that steam as they’re split for filling, or the unmistakable script of most Döner location menus.
My local spot, the roadside Crispy Döner in Charlottenburg, has never done me wrong. Consistently the best 5 Euros one can spend on a given night. I don’t believe the cultural significance and deep satisfaction of a Döner is easily explained. I wish you the best Döner experience when that day comes.
Nestled in a bustling section of Neukölln, neighbored by rows of Middle Eastern sweets shops and Spätis, is Azzam Restaurant; my favorite Middle Eastern restaurant in Berlin.
As low maintenance as it gets, but the staff’s kindness and the sense of community overpowers any “finer” dining experience I’ve had. Azzam, like many businesses that cater to Berlin’s many culturally specific Kiez (neighborhoods), is the embodiment of community and the transportable abilities of food.
Order one or two dishes and you’ll have enough to split between two to three people. If you’re lucky, like my friend and I were, commenting on how good a dish looks will have you walking back to your table with said dish in hand, “a gift for you” from the kind men behind the counter.
Richly flavorful, wonderfully comforting, spiced in a way that makes you forget you’re in Germany — and my favorite — made with an authentic love of a culture I’m newly acquainted with.
Across the street, Azzam Market is a world of its own and while not a restaurant, deserves a visit. A portal to some far away country, or maybe to one that doesn’t exist — a perfectly balanced mixture of Arabic life and culture in Berlin. Grab spices by the kilo from enormous mounds, fresh spreads and Halal meats, local produce, imported specialities, and the most beautifully crafted sweet treats I’ve ever laid eyes on.
YamYam’s Mitte location is packed on an average evening. Rightfully so, as its adorable low tables (or floor-seat options for those with functioning knees), orange atmosphere, and well lettered signage create the most delightful dining aura. More expensive than a hole in the wall, ordering the bean pancake, Bi Bim Bap, traditional Korean sides, tea, and their house made ice cream. really are worth it.
Happy, satiated, and just plain old delicious — YamYam satiated the love for Korean food I discovered when I tried it for the first time. I’m in no rush to find a YamYam rival spot.
If you know me, you’ll have no objection to the distinction between a Cafe and a “food” specific location. Coffee is one thing, but I seek out a cafe for the illusion it brings to my day, the cuteness factor it exudes, and — the baked goods. Maybe to work, maybe to sip coffee, maybe to listen to a podcast, cafes are an entirely different experience, good food is just a positive bonus.
A German “chain”, but a loved one at that. In case you forgot the cinnamon bun intentions, Zeit für Brot brings you back. Translating to “time for bread” in German, this bakery and cafe brings freshly made cinnamon rolls of all kinds, the best cardamom bun I’ve had outside Scandinavia, and loaves upon loaves of fresh German bread. Not to mention other baked goods, sandwiches, and consistently good coffee.
With five (!) locations in the city, I’ve rarely turned down a wonderfully moist, usually enormous, Zimtshnecke for 3 euros.
If you had to model a cafe after me, I’d hope it to look something like The Greens. This cafe, plant-shop hybrid in an alley on the eastern side of the Spree brings the coziest atmosphere possible to an archetypal Berlin day. Warm and full of plants on every surface, The Greens serves great coffee and lunch options, and keeps some spaces laptop-free (which I love despite always coming there with the intentions of productivity).
Its loft feature might be the icing on the cake of this adorably lush space, but nothing beats the rotating selection of plants that accompany you on every visit.
Neukölln’s coziest cafe! The atmosphere in Leuchstoff evokes a neighborly familiarity — welcoming, in progress, and glowingly warm. Chock-full of vintage seats and plywood tables, the main room’s overhanging loft seats customers on a couch only a few feet away from the ceiling. Not for the tall.
Their coffee is some of the best I’ve had in Berlin, and the rich touches of their signature blue grace signs across the cafe, looking wonderfuly quaint in the (rare) winter sunlight. Read a newspaper, work on your laptop, chat with friends on a cramped couch, Leuchstoff makes me yearn for a shorter commute to Neukölln.
Another cozy hit, Cafe Odor makes you feel like you know the owners well after descending its short staircase from street level. Once inside, the Harvard library-esque green lamps, the cozy seats, and the adorable dog perched in the corner place an unrivaled sense of calm over the room.
Along with the best matcha I’ve had in the city, founders Dani and Heo can offer you an assortment of small treats be it rosemary-topped carrot cake, matcha bread, sandwiches. While the two South Korean founders put a sense of distinctly Korean aesthetics into their edible offerings, the cafe’s environment is entirely its own: cozy, sweet, serene.
Whew, consumerism was getting a little worried it would be left out of this list! Worry not, because Berlin’s eclectic, individual, stereotypically grunge, anything-but-German style has to come from somewhere.
Like many cities in Europe — or honestly anywhere except the US — flea markets boast stalls and streets overflowing with treasures of all kinds. Berlin’s flea market scene is astounding, exhausting. Its curated vintage shops offer a refuge from the bustle of markets, but tend to lack their anonymity and charm. Buckle up for bargaining or hum along to the German music agonizingly well dressed teens play in shops.
No household name recognition like its famous counterpart Mauerpark, RAW flea market is its own beast. You could easily spend hours wandering the seemingly endless stalls which mix professional vendors with kids selling their old clothes, the occasional vintage-influencer, and artists. Food is easy to grab too, because you’ll be gone so long hunger is destined to strike.
I’ve snagged a handful of treasures here — some great deals and a few less great, but all trophies of a Sunday activity that makes you feel, well, cool.
Less established than large park fleas, Maybachufer is a street in Kreuzberg along the Spree with a food market that takes place during the weekdays and flea markets on weekends. Another gathering of community where neighborhood residents line the cobblestones with their possessions adjacent to the food stalls and coffee carts.
Nothing beats a 1 Euro bin from a Berliner with copious amounts of tattoos after grabbing a croissant or vegan donut at one of the many and popular nearby cafes.
A blast from the past if I’ve ever seen one, VEB Orange brings East Germany to vivid color with authentic items from the GDR. Clothes, kitchenware, sewing supplies, household items, cards, and almost everything you can think of with color-blocked 70’s patterns is crammed on their shelves. On my favorite street in Berlin, this spot is worth a visit whether you come away with a souvenier or not. The counter-top cat (a real one, not from the GDR) adds to the cuteness of an overly crowded room.
My favorite store in the city, this multi-level art heaven has every creative material I can dream of, and doesn’t help to keep money in my pocket. Walking around with no project on hand is as legitimate as any endeavor, and the adjoining bookshop cafe might extend your visit. Their supplies strike wonder into my heart every time I walk out of the U-Bahn 8 and up their steps.
Just as much of a sight as a shop, the Berlin charity shops of Humana are not few and far between. The one on Frankfurter Tor however, is 5 stories tall. With more floors than you’ll ever need, the shop has got it all.
Alexander Platz’s Humana doesn’t rival in size, but its contents have never let me down — in fact the opposite. While locals frequent Humana, it can be a tad bit pricier than the even more locally-frequented ReSales. Worth a shot if you want to see how much stuff this world really has!
There’s not much to say on Soul & Style except that their 4 locations are full of nicley curated but approachable clothes and accessories. Priced accordingly, you won’t find the same deals as flea markets, but they’re worth a browse if you want cool and unique pieces or have something particular in mind.
I rarely find myself in Berlin’s northern district of Wedding, but one of its truly hidden gems is Bar Henriette. The flat, conjoined walls of the surrounding flats disguise the soft glow from Henriette’s windows as nothing other than a home on a winter night. But when you’re in front of it, the candles emanating from wine bottles and the consistent moody glow draw you immediately in.
Quiet and comfortable, their drinks are affordable, house specials picked with care, and the atmosphere restores years to one’s life that may have been lost in the endurance-sport that is Berlin clubbing. Grab a bottle of wine and you can easily spend hours sinking into their chairs as if it were your own living room.
Cafe by day, bar by night, An Einem Sonntag Im August is well known for good reason. With tiered step-seating, couches, and tables, the interior blends seamlessly from day to night as lights switch off. The cocktails are just as good as the fresh tees and coffee and the bustle all week long does nothing to detract from the intimate feelings wherever you sit. When the weather is warm, outdoor seating and bench swings host you under awnings, giving the best people watching view in Prenzlauer Berg.
Pub culture in Berlin is harder to find than you might think. Real Kneipes are all the better for it. While dive bar culture provides a night of fun in its own right, Shurke’s small space gives you the feel for a Kneipe that I fear may be slipping from Berlin’s landscape.
If there’s no space, move on! But if you find a spot to rest, the air is cloudy, the beer is German, and the energy is classic.
A recent recommendation brought me to Mano unsuccsesfully. Even the slanted hallway with old wooden auditorium seats smashed against the wall was crowded. Next time around we were lucky enough to land a little nook by the window, which required a step up above the lower seating and a pretzel-maneuver to sit comfortably. But the small details in this place from the tree-loft area in the main room to the delicious house cocktails and well worn pillows made this an instant favorite.
There are some aspects of cities that don’t necessarily fill a typical “activity” slot, but end up being the best ways to spend your time. A few of my favorite pastimes, for Sundays when the markets are closed so you can’t (and shouldn’t) do your grocery run; for when it’s raining and cabin fever strikes; or when the weather is grey and something needs to happen.
Airport turned public space, Tempelhofer Feld is my favorite place in Berlin. Rich in history and contemporary activity, Tempelhof information could fill a thesis project.
Go for a run, bike, walk, skate, rollerblade, or wind-sport (yes — an entire green is dedicated to wind sports), and find a community doing the same, usually with music, too! Check out the art mini-golf course or the kids carnival area, read the historical tour plaques, admire the real airplane on display in the center, or walk through the community gardens. Start with a coffee and pastry at a nearby cafe and find a spot to picnic near the bird-breeding grounds, apple tree cultivation, or sheep grazing when it’s the season.
Nothing is so exceptional as this urban oasis, smack dab in the center of Berlin, bordering more than three neighborhoods and connecting a city through recreation.
Off the otherwise unremarkable area of S-Bahnhof Bellevue, Park am Präsidentendreieck is a fantastic place to soak up any rare piece of Berlin sun by the water. Or pick up a paddle at the public ping-pong tables and reignite a competitive fervor only found in Kita playgrounds.
While I continue to note nearly every worthy location I visit in Berlin, I’m haunted by the knowledge that I’ll forever be missing endless experiences in this wide city. Here’s to four more months of exploration!

Berlin has a complex history that has significantly shaped its urban landscape and development. As the capital of Germany, it has experienced monumental shifts over the centuries—transforming from a Prussian capital into a divided city during the Cold War and now into one of Europe’s most dynamic and modern cities. What makes Berlin so captivating is how its infrastructure and urban planning tell the story of a city constantly rebuilding and reinventing itself.
Berlin’s modern identity is rooted in a unique combination of historical events and urban resilience. Initially, Berlin was a modest settlement along the River Spree, but it gradually became a trade center during the Middle Ages. By the 18th century, Berlin had become the capital of Prussia, a major European power, and it underwent significant development under the rule of Frederick the Great. However, it wasn’t until the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century that Berlin truly began to transform into a major European metropolis. Factories, railroads, and grand boulevards like Unter den Linden were constructed, making Berlin a vital economic and cultural hub.

Berlin is a big city. Of course, compared to Beijing, Tokyo, London, or New York, it is not intimidating at all. But still, by German standard, it is pretty huge.
A friend of mine once told me that Berlin is pretty big because its tourist sites are scattered across the city, and they can be far away from one another. Indeed, no tourist would try to walk from The Brandenburg Gate to East Side Gallery since, according to Google Map, it takes around one hour.
Another friend argued that Berlin is big, and that is why it can host so many gigantic things; big streets (e.g. Straße des 17. Juni and Karl-Marx-Allee), large parks (e.g. Tiergarten and Tempelhofer Feld), huge buildings (e.g. Berliner Fernsehturm and Berliner Schloss), just to name a few.

On the 21st of March, 2025, I had the pleasure of exploring the magnificent collection displayed at the Gemäldegalerie. What follows is a selection of paintings that deeply resonated with me, each accompanied by descriptions carefully crafted from my personal impressions, research, and understanding of the artwork. The photographs included were taken by me during this inspiring visit, capturing the ambiance and visual depth of the exhibition. Art, for me, has always been a dialogue between the artist, the canvas, and the observer. I invite you to join me on this journey and hope these reflections offer a window into both the artists’ intentions and my own interpretations.

In an extraordinary cultural collaboration, Berlin’s Gemäldegalerie presents “From Odesa to Berlin,” an exhibition showcasing 60 remarkable European paintings evacuated from the Museum of Western and Eastern Art in Odesa, Ukraine. These artworks, spanning from the 16th to the 19th century, escaped the devastating impacts of war to find temporary refuge in Berlin.
This exhibition is more than a display of artistic masterpieces — it symbolizes solidarity with Ukraine during a challenging historical moment. Each painting not only reveals Odesa’s rich and often overlooked cultural heritage but also sparks meaningful dialogues when paired with related pieces from Berlin’s own collections.
Established in 1924, the Odesa Museum holds a trove of significant artworks that resonate deeply with European art traditions, featuring celebrated artists like Frans Hals, Bernardo Strozzi, and Francesco Granacci. Now, for the first time, these Ukrainian-held masterpieces are introduced on a large scale to audiences in Germany, offering fresh insights into shared histories and common artistic threads between Eastern and Western Europe.
Organized around nine thematic chapters, the exhibition invites visitors to discover the striking connections between artworks from Odesa and their Berlin counterparts. Through carefully curated juxtapositions, the exhibition provides illuminating encounters and reveals the depth and diversity of Ukrainian-held European art.
Curated by Sabine Lata and Dagmar Hirschfelder of the Gemäldegalerie, with meticulous conservational oversight by Anja Lindner-Michael and Thuja Seidel, “From Odesa to Berlin” is an essential exhibition that underscores the power of art to foster unity, raise awareness, and protect cultural identity amid conflict.
Amidst the unfolding conflict in Ukraine, extraordinary measures were undertaken to safeguard Odesa’s cultural heritage. The Odesa Museum of Western and Eastern Art, located in a historical palace dating back to the 19th century near the iconic Transfiguration Cathedral — partially damaged by Russian air raids — faced severe threats. Immediately following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, volunteers and museum staff rapidly mobilized, fortifying the museum palace with sandbags and meticulously packing the most valuable artworks. Around 80 masterpieces were evacuated to an emergency storage center within Ukraine. Documenting this urgent rescue, the exhibited photographs, taken between March and May 2022, poignantly illustrate the lengths taken to protect culture and history amidst the devastation of war.
There have been a lot of paintings which have been brought to Berlin, I’ll show some of them.
This compelling portrait by Johann Baptist von Lampi the Elder depicts Joseph de Ribas, a notable admiral in the Russian Navy of Neapolitan and Catalan heritage. Painted around 1796, it captures De Ribas shortly after he played a pivotal role in Russia’s capture of the Ottoman fortress of Khadjibey, leading directly to the founding of modern-day Odesa in 1794 under Catherine II’s reign. De Ribas’ significant legacy endures in Odesa, where a main street still bears his name. Yet, amid contemporary geopolitical tensions arising from Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, there have been discussions — though no final decision — regarding the renaming of this iconic street. This artwork thus not only highlights a key historical figure but also symbolizes the complex interplay between art, history, and contemporary identity.
Rendered with subtle grace and delicate realism, Rinaldo Boldrini’s Portrait of Emilia Boldrini (1857) captures the quiet dignity and elegance of its sitter, Emilia Boldrini. The artist, active primarily in Bologna, later became a key figure in Odesa’s cultural scene, co-founding the Society of Fine Arts in 1865. Emilia, a renowned opera prima donna, toured Odesa in 1848, where she married and spent a significant chapter of her life. The painting poignantly reflects her serene beauty and refined posture, suggesting the strength and vulnerability of her personal journey. Tragically, Emilia returned to Bologna in 1852 and soon after lost her voice, abruptly ending her distinguished opera career. Thus, this portrait not only encapsulates a refined example of 19th-century portraiture but also resonates deeply with personal narrative and cultural exchange between Italy and Ukraine.
Thomas Lawrence’s dynamic portrait of Count Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov captures the complexity and charisma of one of Odesa’s most influential historical figures. Vorontsov, a Russian count raised in London, served as Governor-General of New Russia based in Odesa. Under his administration, Odesa flourished culturally and economically, deepening its ties with Western Europe. Lawrence, famed for his vivid brushwork and expressive characterization, portrays Vorontsov with an air of dignity and command, his confident posture and refined attire emphasizing his significant role. Yet Vorontsov’s legacy is not without controversy: as commander-in-chief during Russia’s colonial wars in the Caucasus, his reputation today carries critical reflections. Lawrence’s portrait thus invites viewers to contemplate not only the grandeur of Vorontsov’s contributions to Odesa but also the complicated moral legacies that historical figures inevitably embody.
In Virgin and Child (1903), Finnish painter Albert Edelfelt beautifully combines spiritual intimacy with everyday simplicity. Known for his interest in depicting rural Finnish life, Edelfelt reinterprets the traditional religious motif by portraying the Mother of God as a humble young peasant woman, tenderly cradling her child. Soft, bluish daylight enters through the window on the left, harmoniously contrasting with the warm orange glow from an unseen fireplace. This interplay between cool and warm illumination symbolizes the profound mystery of Christ’s incarnation, merging divinity with human vulnerability. Edelfelt’s subtle use of color and gentle brushwork imbues the painting with a comforting serenity, capturing the viewer in a moment of quiet contemplation.
This evocative devotional painting from around 1520, inspired by Gerard David, powerfully captures the profound sorrow of the Virgin Mary mourning the loss of her son, Jesus. Characterized by its close-up intimacy, the artwork invites viewers to engage deeply and empathetically with Mary’s grief. The detailed emotional portrayal enhances the spiritual experience, compelling viewers to contemplate the shared humanity and divine significance of Christ’s suffering. Originating as one of the most reproduced devotional compositions in the early 16th century, this Odesa painting exemplifies the influential artistic legacy of Gerard David. Its emotional intensity was influential enough to inspire subsequent Netherlandish artists to adapt and expand upon the motif, reinforcing its enduring resonance across European religious art.
This exquisite altarpiece from 1519 by Francesco Granacci beautifully captures the stylistic influences of his close friend Michelangelo. Granacci, who studied alongside Michelangelo in Domenico Ghirlandaio’s workshop in Florence, frequently took inspiration from Michelangelo’s drawings, a fact evident in this depiction of the Madonna. Here, the Virgin Mary, enthroned gracefully, exudes serene majesty, while the Christ child gently blesses the viewer. On either side stand John the Baptist, shown humbly in contemplation, and the Archangel Michael, radiating quiet strength. Granacci’s delicate colors and carefully balanced composition speak to the high Renaissance ideals of harmony and humanist beauty. This masterpiece from Odesa provides a remarkable example of artistic dialogue between Renaissance masters and serves as a testament to the significant cultural treasures preserved through Ukraine’s challenging times.
This tender depiction of the Virgin Mary with the Christ Child, created in the Southern Netherlands (likely Bruges) after 1567, beautifully illustrates the enduring emotional and devotional appeal of this classical motif. Inspired by a celebrated composition by Rogier van der Weyden dating from around 1450, the painting captures a touching moment of intimacy as the standing Christ child lovingly embraces his mother. The floral background, abundant with roses symbolizing purity and divine love, accentuates the emotional warmth and spirituality of the scene. Inscribed below is the phrase “Virgo salutiferi plena favoris ave” (“Hail Mary, full of salvific grace”), drawn from a prayer printed in 1567, emphasizing Mary’s role as a compassionate and grace-filled intercessor. This popular devotional image, replicated extensively throughout Europe, highlights the deep spiritual resonance and lasting influence of Northern Renaissance art traditions.
In this compelling late-18th-century depiction of Saint Jerome, Giuseppe Antonio Pianca vividly portrays the revered ascetic in deep contemplation. Set within the isolation of a dark, mysterious forest, Saint Jerome’s muscular yet weary form suggests a life of rigorous self-denial and spiritual introspection. Pianca masterfully uses chiaroscuro — intense contrasts of light and shadow — to accentuate the saint’s meditative expression and rugged physique. The presence of a human skull symbolizes Jerome’s reflection on the transience of earthly life, while the rosary and crucifix embody hope for spiritual salvation through faith and devotion. Pianca’s dramatic interpretation invites viewers into a profound meditation on mortality, devotion, and redemption, making it a powerful exemplar of religious painting from the Odesa Museum collection.
In this gripping depiction attributed to Antonino Alberti, known as Barbalonga, the dramatic biblical event known as the Massacre of the Innocents is portrayed with intense emotional energy and raw realism. Painted between 1623 and 1649, the work vividly captures the frantic desperation of mothers as they struggle to shield their children from brutal assailants following King Herod’s ruthless decree. Barbalonga’s dramatic composition and dynamic movement amplify the chaotic violence and profound anguish of the scene, drawing viewers into a moment charged with fear, sorrow, and tension. Beyond its religious significance, this powerful canvas poignantly resonates with contemporary themes of violence, loss, and human suffering, serving as a striking reminder of the enduring relevance and emotional impact of historical artworks.
In this vivid and dynamic 16th-century work from Jacopo Bassano’s workshop, myth and pastoral life intertwine seamlessly. The painting depicts the abduction of the Phoenician princess Europa by Zeus, who famously takes the form of a white bull. Yet, typical of Bassano’s distinctive approach, this mythological drama unfolds within the charming simplicity of an everyday pastoral scene. Richly detailed figures, animals, and objects imbue the narrative with a sense of realism and immediacy, bridging the divide between divine myth and human experience. The striking interplay of shadow and vibrant colors heightens the dramatic tension, while the careful attention to rural elements grounds the ancient myth firmly within the tangible textures of 16th-century life. This remarkable piece from the Odesa Museum’s collection exemplifies Bassano’s talent for bringing classical stories to life through vivid storytelling and meticulous observation of daily life.
Annunciation to the Shepherds, 17th century (Unknown painter, after Abraham Bloemaert) and Adoration of the Shepherds, c.1604, Abraham Bloemaert
This pairing of remarkable paintings illustrates the rich artistic dialogue of the early 17th century. The first artwork from Odesa, attributed to an unknown artist, vividly portrays the biblical Annunciation to the Shepherds and closely mirrors a detailed 1599 engraving by Jan Pietersz. Saenredam based on an original by Abraham Bloemaert. Its vibrant colors and dynamic composition suggest direct familiarity with Bloemaert’s original work, now lost. Complementing this, the Adoration of the Shepherds (c.1604) by Abraham Bloemaert himself showcases his characteristic clarity and rich coloration. Both paintings exhibit Bloemaert’s profound influence, highlighting his importance as a central figure in the Utrecht artistic tradition. Together, these works not only explore a cherished biblical theme but also provide insight into how compositions traveled, were adapted, and influenced artists across Europe.
This lively painting, dating from around 1700, portrays Hercules, the legendary hero known for his extraordinary strength, in a surprisingly vulnerable moment. Following the original composition by Peter Paul Rubens — created for his own Antwerp residence — Hercules is depicted here struggling with the effects of excessive wine consumption. Barely able to stand, the mighty demigod relies upon a satyr and a nymph for support, highlighting a stark contrast between heroic strength and human fragility. The rich colors and dynamic forms reflect Rubens’ distinctive style, full of movement, energy, and emotion. Notably, this interpretation, previously held in the Odesa Museum, exemplifies the widespread influence and enduring popularity of Rubens’ mythological compositions, bridging the gap between classical ideals and the human condition.
In this captivating portrait from the 1630s, Utrecht artist Abraham Bloemaert presents a deeply expressive portrayal of an elderly woman. Characteristic of Bloemaert’s work during this period, the painting belongs to a genre known as tronies — studies of heads or busts not meant as formal portraits but rather as explorations of human expression and character. Painted after living models, these pieces often depict older individuals in modest attire, emphasizing realism and emotional depth over social status. Bloemaert’s Old Woman embodies this approach, her lined face gently illuminated against muted colors, revealing subtle textures and a contemplative presence. The piece not only showcases the artist’s technical mastery but also reflects broader trends in Dutch art, influenced by Rembrandt and his circle, highlighting the dignity and quiet beauty found in everyday humanity.
Portrait of a Man (1660s)
The male portrait from Odesa is comparable to Dutch portraits of naval officers from the 1660s and 1670s. The probably carved wooden handle of the weapon attached to the sitter’s belt resembles that of a kris, a Javanese dagger. The man’s large eyes are reminiscent of portraits by Jan de Bray, who was considered the most important portrait painter in Haarlem during the second half of the 17th century. A similar type of face and hairstyle can also be found in the Berlin portrait of a Haarlem priest, also attributed to Jan de Bray.
This work captures the essence of Dutch portraiture, emphasizing dignity and character through detailed depiction of clothing and weaponry, hinting at the subject’s rank or profession.
St. Luke, depicted by Hals, was originally part of a series representing the four Evangelists. The half-length figures of these Evangelists show similarities to Hals’s genre paintings from the mid-1620s. St Luke’s typical attribute, a bull, blends into the painting’s background, becoming visible only upon closer inspection.
Hals is known for his vivid, lifelike portrayal of figures, characterized by dynamic brushwork and naturalistic details. This work exemplifies his style, showing a contemplative and introspective Luke engaged in writing his gospel.
The 18th painting is titled “Rest of the Comedians,” created in the 1730s by Alessandro Magnasco. It is an oil on canvas painting previously housed in the Odesa Museum of Western and Eastern Art.
In this artwork, Magnasco portrays a diverse group of soldiers, mothers with small children, and comedians assembled under dimly lit arcades. Alessandro Magnasco is recognized as one of Italy’s most original genre painters of the 18th century. He is notable for his distinctive, imaginative style and his ability to depict eccentric scenes, often centered around the marginalized segments of society such as outlaws and vagabonds. His paintings have thematic similarities with contemporary Spanish picaresque novels.
My personal favourite because of the use of colours and shadows, the painting “Winter Landscape,” created by Andreas Achenbach in 1859, beautifully captures a serene winter scene bathed in soft, silvery evening light. At the heart of this tranquil landscape lies a frozen pond on which figures can be seen skating, depicting the leisurely activities typical of a winter’s day. Surrounding the pond, snow-covered houses and structures nestle comfortably amid tall, dark evergreens, contributing to the painting’s intimate, cozy atmosphere.
Achenbach’s careful handling of light imbues the entire scene with a gentle luminescence, highlighting both the delicate texture of the snow and the reflective surface of the ice. The composition’s detailed realism is reminiscent of Dutch painting from the 17th century, yet it also evokes a distinctly Nordic ambiance, influenced by the artist’s travels to Norway and Sweden.
The painting exemplifies Achenbach’s status as a key figure of the Düsseldorf school, celebrated for landscapes that combine precise naturalism with poetic atmosphere, capturing moments of quiet beauty and contemplation in nature.
“The Coachmen’s Quarrel,” painted by Jules-Alexis Muenier in 1893, vividly portrays a dramatic and violent incident set against the scenic backdrop of a sunny day along the Côte d’Azur. The painting starkly contrasts the serene beauty of nature, with rugged mountains, lush greenery, and tranquil waters in the background, against the shocking human drama unfolding at its center.
In the foreground, two men are depicted on a bright, open road. One man stands assertively, holding a knife, clearly the aggressor who has just committed an act of violence. His expression is intense and resolute. At his feet lies the victim, sprawled helplessly on the ground, conveying the brutal aftermath of their confrontation.
Muenier employs a broad perspective with exaggerated depth, placing the attacker at the compositional center, which emphasizes the tension and gravity of the scene. This approach intensifies the narrative, bringing a stark and haunting contrast between the vibrancy of the sunlit setting and the gravity of the violent act, encapsulating a poignant and powerful moment of tragedy.
Gabriel von Max’s painting “Light!” from the early 1870s portrays a deeply evocative and spiritual scene set against a simplistic yet symbolically rich backdrop. At the focal point of the canvas is a young blind Christian woman dressed in pure white, a color signifying innocence and spiritual purity. She is depicted seated gracefully on a stone bench, calmly offering a small burning oil lamp towards an unseen recipient, symbolizing the spreading of Christian enlightenment.
To her side lies a collection of similar oil lamps, each softly glowing and illuminating her serene features. In front of her feet rest palm branches, poignant symbols foreshadowing her martyrdom. Behind her, partially hidden in the shadows of a doorway, stands a beggar woman, quietly observing the scene — an element adding a sense of intrigue and quiet reflection to the painting.
Gabriel von Max’s thoughtful use of light accentuates the tranquility and gravity of the narrative, underlining the historical context of Christian persecution implied in this scene. The overall mood is both gentle and deeply symbolic, effectively communicating themes of faith, sacrifice, and spiritual illumination.
In “Sunny Day” (1895), Emile Claus captures a delicate moment of tranquility, perfectly illustrating the essence of Belgian Luminism — a style emphasizing the subtle interplay of light and atmosphere. The painting portrays a peaceful, rural landscape bathed in warm, radiant sunlight. A flock of geese calmly moves along a grassy path toward the viewer, drawing attention to the serene pond in the background, which softly reflects the sky and surrounding foliage. Claus masterfully employs gentle brushstrokes and harmonious, pastel-like colors, creating an atmosphere of quiet beauty and contemplative calm. The painting resonates with a tender observation of nature’s rhythms, inviting viewers to pause and appreciate the simple elegance of the natural world.
Visiting the Gemäldegalerie was more than just viewing art; it was a moment of profound connection and inspiration. I left with a renewed appreciation for these masterpieces and their timeless ability to speak across generations. Thank you for accompanying me on this artistic exploration — I hope it encourages you to experience these wonderful works in person.

The happiest hour (two hours) is from 5–7 pm. After dinner, I returned to the bar every evening. Either solo or with my new friends Gabriel or Ria or Michèle. Started with cocktails as you do, mojito, Aperol spritz, gin basil squash. All new taste sensations for me.
I finally managed to fit some touristing into the drinking schedule. It’s my last day. I have to do something! When I’m asked what did you do in Berlin, I can’t say, “I partied, swam naked, made some friends and drank cocktails.” Well, I suppose I can. I have some great memories.
I started at Checkpoint Charlie, the most famous of seven crossing points between East Berlin and West Berlin.
I went looking for the Berlin Bears… these were the only ones I saw in a gift shop. I decided if I couldn’t find a bear, I’d buy…

When you walk into my Friedrichshain apartment, there’s a room labeled “Kinderwagen-Rollstuhle” next to the elevator. On the door, a paper reads:
“Only for strollers. Do not use this room for bikes!”
This was my first inkling that Friedrichshain was a neighborhood for more than hipsters and its club scene.
When I first moved to Berlin in 2019, stroller rooms and family policies were the last thing on my mind. My husband and I moved here to live in a big city, travel across Europe, and start a new adventure. As we stayed longer though, more of our friends started popping out pandemic babies. We soon decided to start our family here as well.
Americans love praising Scandinavian countries' utopian family policies. The NY Times recently touted Finland for giving all new parents the same leave, following Sweden’s example. Bringing up Bebe, which explores the differences between American and French child rearing, has become standard pregnancy reading. Achtung Baby is the German equivalent. I also read these books during pregnancy in my quest to glean child-rearing wisdom.
This post is my version: a personal story about my 22 months of pregnancy, birth, postpartum, and parental leave in Berlin. This isn’t a how-to guide, and I’m not promising to confer any wisdom. But I’d like to show what it’s like to live in a city built with both physical and social infrastructure for families, during one of life’s most tender junctures.
At my first appointment with my Frauenartz (OB/GYN), I received a little book called the Mutterpass (Mother’s pass). All the tests and examinations throughout my pregnancy and birth were recorded in it. Although it may seem archaic to bring a paper booklet with you to every appointment, it actually made a lot of sense in practice. During my pregnancy, I received care from a disparate group of doctors and midwives. Instead of transferring electronic medical records, I simply handed over my Mutterpass at the start of each appointment.
Holistic medicine is more widely accepted in Germany and supported by the medical establishment. Like in the US, I went to routine OB/GYN checkups where I would do a urinanalysis, blood pressure check, weigh-in, periodic blood tests, and consultation at each appointment. I did ultrasounds and genetic testing at predetermined weeks. Unlike the US, I also went to a Hebammenpraxis, a midwife clinic.
One of the downsides I experienced with public health insurance was that my OG/GYN was often overbooked and rushed—sometimes my appointments started one to two hours late. But at the Hebammenpraxis, the midwives took their time. They explained each test in my Mutterpass, making sure I understood each result. They also recommended acupuncture and acupressure for my debilitating first trimester nausea. This was all covered by my public health insurance.
I split the costs of my public health insurance with my employer—I pay around €‎440 per month. This is calculated based on your income level. Health insurance is mandatory for everyone living in Germany. Some people pay for private health insurance if they don’t qualify for public, or want greater control of their providers. See here for more details.
My favorite part of the German medical system is the hebamme, a personal midwife. Hebammen are trained medical professionals that can perform examinations on the mother and the baby. They also guide parents through this huge life transition. In Berlin they work hyper-locally — usually only in one neighborhood. My other mom friends advised me to start looking for a hebamme as soon as my pregnancy was confirmed.
Unfortunately there is a shortage of hebammen in Berlin. To find one, I posted in facebook groups, registered for search websites, visited Hebammenpraxes, and asked friends of friends. Finally, by the end of the first trimester I found my match: Mandy.
Mandy only worked in my zip code, and took a handful of new mothers each month. She visited homes by biking from apartment to apartment — sometimes up to 8–10 homes a day! After our initial meeting at the end of my first trimester, we signed a contract. We didn’t talk for a while, and then around week 35, she came for a few home visits. She checked out my baby room and recommended a few items I might need postpartum. She was also available on call if I thought I was going into labor, and could advise me on when to go to the hospital.
In Berlin, you have a couple of options on where to give birth: a hospital, a Geburtshaus (birthing center), or Hausgeburt (home birth). All options are mostly covered by insurance. In birthing centers, you are attended to by a 1-on-1 midwife in a more “home-like” environment. Doctors are not on-site and there is not the option for epidurals or other drugs. At home, a Beleghebamme (personal birthing midwife) supervises your delivery.
I chose to deliver in a hospital because I wanted the option to have an epidural, and probably because of my American tendencies. I registered at Charité Mitte, a top teaching hospital 20 minutes away, where most doctors and nurses spoke English.
Germans believe that all pregnant women are entitled to not only adequate medical care, but also mental and physical preparations for birth. My public health insurance, Die Techniker, reimbursed me for yoga classes and a Geburtsvorbereitungskurs (birth class). Although most couples take a weekly birth class in their neighborhood, we chose a weekend online course because of COVID. It was also challenging to find one in English.
The German system acknowledges that pregnant mothers not only need a physical break, but also a mental break. They respect the experience of pregnancy and motherhood.
In Germany, your maternal leave starts six weeks before your due date, with the statutory maternity leave, called Mutterschutz. During this time, you receive full pay, and are expected to relax and focus on preparing for the baby. At first I wasn’t sure if I wanted to take that much time off. I felt extreme FOMO — worried that I’d miss out on important moments at work.
However, since I’d be paid the same whether I worked or not, I embraced the German benefits and stopped working. I spent the first few weeks off “nesting” — preparing the baby room, washing and sorting hand-me-down clothes, and stocking our freezer. I also tried to stay active by doing prenatal yoga and going for walks with other moms on leave. One of the benefits of longer maternity leaves is that there is a higher likelihood that your friends are also on leave.
After my due date came and went, I went for daily check-ups and CTG (electronic fetal monitor, EFM) scans at my Frauenartz. Five days after my due date, I had a blood test at the hospital and they decided to have me stay to be induced. While I waited for the induction pills to work, I waited in a separate hospital room in the maternity ward.
German hospitals provide a range of equipment to support vaginal deliveries. Charite’s delivery rooms had specialised equipment such as an exercise ball, birthing stools, ropes attached to the ceiling and walls, and adjustable birthing tables. Some even had a bathtub for water delivery. The midwives embrace moving around and changing positions to help the baby “spin” down the birth canal.
I had the fortune of a quiet delivery ward, which allowed a midwife to accompany me the entire time I was in active labor. Oftentimes in a hospital a midwife splits her time between two or three women. One downside of giving birth in a hospital though is that you may need to change midwives mid-delivery. This happened to me 6 hours in. But in the end, I had a positive experience as I liked the different approach of both midwives. I didn’t see a doctor until the very end, just a few minutes before I delivered my baby boy.
Grant was born after 9 hours of labor.
After birth, I stayed in the hospital for 3 days. This allowed us to have Grant’s U2 appointment at the hospital, which needs to happen between the third and tenth day of life in Germany. Similar to US wellness checkups, Germans have a set of preventive medical check-ups from the first day of birth through adolescence.
We were lucky to get a “family room” after birth, where my husband was able to stay with us in his own bed. We were supported by postpartum midwives 24–7, who were just a button press away. Charite doesn’t have that many family rooms though, so most people need to share a room post delivery. Other families choose to leave the hospital as soon as possible, because their hebamme can also support them at home.
The one downside of staying in the hospital was the German food. This was what I was served for dinner on the first night. Yes, that’s a raw tomato in the corner and a large pickled cucumber in the other.
I had heard the hardest trimester isn’t the 3rd, it’s actually the “4th trimester”, otherwise known as postpartum. I was worried about sleepless nights and how my body would recover. But after reading the book “The First Forty Days,” I learned it could be a magical time if you’re prepared and have a strong support system.
The Germans also have a culture of resting after birth called Wochenbett which literally means “weeks in bed.” The new mother is supposed to stay in bed to recover and focus on skin-on-skin and feeding the new baby.
This is actually quite similar to the Chinese tradition of Zuo Yuezi (坐月子), which literally translates to confinement. During this time, new mothers aren’t supposed to leave the house or touch cold water.
My parents came to Berlin for my Zuo Yuezi, and rented an apartment a block from my apartment. My mom made me warm Chinese soups, didn’t let me touch cold water, and helped take care of Grant. I didn’t leave the house for almost 30 days, which wasn’t that hard for me as it was in the middle of winter.
As I mentioned before, my favorite German benefit is the hebamme. My midwife Mandy came the first day we got home, and visited every day for the first few weeks. Each visit started by weighing Grant, tracking his progress to regaining his birth weight. She also checked and cleaned his umbilical cord stub, and showed us how to bathe him once it fell off.
At the beginning she also supported me in breastfeeding: teaching me different positions, helping wake Grant up mid-feed (his breastfeeding persona was a “dinner dozer” / “rester”), and teaching me how to use the pump (which I only used before my supply came in). This was invaluable, as it prevented common breastfeeding problems like mastitis and nipple pain. If I had any major issues, Mandy could have also referred me to a lactation consultant.
Each day, my husband and I would write down all our questions to review with her. Are his hands too hot or too cold? How should we dress him at night? Should we start vitamin D drops? When will he get over his jetlag? Are we doing tummy time right? Is this a normal amount of spit up? I think she single-handedly prevented us from having postpartum anxiety. :)
She also checked on my health — both physical and mental. She asked about my bleeding, checked my stitches, and examined my abs for diastasis recti. It was such a blessing to get maternal care without having to leave the house with a newborn. Oftentimes, there is so much focus on the baby, not on the mother’s recovery. I didn’t feel this way.
All German employees (people with a German employment contract) are entitled to parental leave. There are two concepts: Elternzeit (parental time off) and Elterngeld (parental allowance / money).
In my circle of friends, most mothers took at least a year off — usually until their child went to Kita. This also lines up with how long women are recommended to breastfeed for, about one year. Babies can start drinking cow’s milk after one year of age. I noticed that most fathers took a few weeks off at the start with the mother, and then some weeks later when the baby is older. Many took it during the summer holiday so the whole family could vacation together.
In a bit of a tangent, I’m going to compare Germany’s policy to Sweden’s. Unlike Sweden’s equality focused policy, Germany doesn’t have a minimum number of days each parent must take. In Sweden, their 90 days of “use-it-or-lose-it” time for fathers incentivizes men to take their full parental leave. Sweden also has an “equality bonus” of 50 kr each per day if you share your parental leave equally. This has led more Swedish men to take more paternal leave than other countries, and even created a “latte pappa” culture.
While I was pregnant, we visited our friends in Sweden with a 1 year old. The couple took the first month off together. The mom then took the next 6 months on her own, and then the father took the next 6 months on his own. Leaving the baby with the father made it easier for my friend to go back to work, and helped them establish a more equal division of household and child rearing. In the US, studies have shown that when a baby arrives, working couples no longer share their housework equally, even when they did before (study). This was a pattern I didn’t want us to fall into.
So what did we do? My husband and I both took the first month off. Then I became the primary caregiver from months 2–10, though my husband took off 6 weeks of vacation throughout that time. He also works from home, and was able to support me during the day when needed. He will become primary caregiver when Grant is 10 months, and plans to take at least 3 months of paternity leave. We chose this split because I wanted to take about one year off of work, and because by the time Grant is 10 months he’ll be breastfeeding less and less dependent on me. I also wanted us to both experience being primary caregiver to develop our own parenting styles and build empathy for each other.
The thing I appreciate the most about this experience, is that I had the privilege of going back to work when I was ready. I took a total of 12 months off — something I never would be able to take, or even thought I’d want, in the US. Some moms are ready to return to work after 3 months, and others at 3 years. I didn’t have to choose between being a “stay-at-home-mom” or a “working mom” when I wasn’t ready. And throughout my leave, even though my day to day was being a full time caregiver, I considered myself a UX designer. This is an important part of my identity.
So what did I do with my time?
Not going back to work allowed me to continue breastfeeding on-demand. I didn’t need to pump, though I used the passive Haaka pump to collect extra milk for bottles.
Women in Berlin breastfeed practically everywhere– restaurants, playground, the Ubahn… No one bats an eye!
Around 6–8 weeks after birth, many German women take a Rückbildungskurs to strengthen their pelvic floor. Pregnancy and childbirth can stress, stretch, and weaken the muscles in your pelvic floor and abdomen, which can cause pain and urinary incontinence. Germans don’t wait for a doctor’s diagnosis. Almost all women sign up for a course after their hebamme clears them. In the class, a physiotherapist walks you through a series of breathing and muscle exercises. This is also covered by health insurance.
This can also be a great way to get out of the house with your baby and meet other new moms in the neighborhood. Unfortunately I was only able to find an English course online.
A few months after birth, a social worker contacted us for a home visit. I had never met a social worker before, and wasn’t sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised though! The woman came with a large folder of flyers: lists of pediatricians, local hospitals, family centers, and kitas (day cares). She reassured us that the local town hall could put us on a waitlist for kita (daycare), if we weren’t able to find a spot ourselves. This is a common concern of parents, as kita spots can be notoriously hard to find in Berlin. She also made sure we how to fill out all of the required German paperwork and navigate the bureaucracy.
As Ali Wong said in Hard Knock Wife, “when you’re a new mom on maternity leave it’s like The Walking Dead. You’ve just gotta hook up with a crew to survive.” Neighborhood family centers saved me, and helped me find my survival crew. All around Friedrichshain there are family centers with programming for kids and their parents. Many have free play times and classes such as “baby massage” and “yoga with baby.”
When Grant was around 4 months old, I started going to a “baby time” every Friday. With a facilitator, we went around sharing how each of our weeks went — recounting what’s changed with the baby, and checking in on how we are each doing. We sang some German songs and did some playful activities. It ended with a lovely breakfast and tea. The whole class was donation based.
Although it was tough for me to always understand what was going on in German, I managed to make one good friend from the group. When the class ended, we started going to drop-in “open play times.” Grant loved playing with all the new toys and structures, and I enjoyed some adult socialization. It can be incredibly lonely and isolating to be caring for your baby at home alone all day.
I’m not going to say much about Kita (daycare), because unfortunately we will be leaving Germany before Grant can go to Kita (at one year of age). The most important fact though is that Kita is free. Yes, daycare is free in Berlin. Well, except for a €23 / month lunch fee.
Parents apply for a Kitagutschein voucher that determines the number of hours you qualify for based on their age and the number of hours the parents work. Most kitas don’t take babies under the age of one though. If you’re curious to learn more, this is a great guide.
What?! You’re leaving Berlin? You might be surprised to learn after describing this seeming family utopia, we’ve decided to return to the US — the only rich country without federally mandated paid parental leave.
We miss our family.I had a really hard time the weeks after my parents left Germany when Grant was three months old. My relationship with my parents, and my in-laws, has completely changed since becoming a parent myself. I call my parents almost every day, and can’t imagine having them only see Grant once or twice a year. I think that one of the best things we can do for Grant, and for our sanity, is to surround him with people that love him — which means moving closer to my family in the Bay Area.
We miss our friends.Although it was hard to make many friends during the pandemic, we managed to make a few good friends in the past three years. However, almost all of them have now moved away as many were also expats, and went onto their next location. We know how important friendship is to our happiness, and how lonely and isolating parenting can be. Back in the bay area we have friends we’ve known for 10–20 years, and many of them are now having kids too. We’re actually planning to co-live with a friend I’ve known since birth!
We’re tired of speaking bad German.We had grand plans to learn at least conversational German when we first moved here. We took a month-long intensive course, and then biweekly classes for the first year. But after a year we only made it to A.2, at best. When I got pregnant, I lacked the energy and motivation to continue. In the area we live in, we’re able to use English in our day-to-day encounters, but when we hit bureaucracy, it is all German. And becoming a parent doubled the amount of bureaucracy we’ve hit. I also couldn’t imagine not being able to speak to Grant’s daycare teachers fluently.
We want to continue working with our American employers, but want family friendly hours.My husband and I continued to work for American companies when we moved to Berlin. He stayed with his previous company, and I started at Google Berlin. This meant we worked somewhat shifted hours, usually 10 am to 7 or 8pm, with a healthy midday break. This is not compatible with a baby’s schedule (3pm kita pickup, 5:30pm dinner, 7pm bedtime). From my experience, most Googlers in leadership positions based in Europe take a break to watch their kids, and then go back online from 8–10pm. This is not the lifestyle we want.
We want to establish a permanent home base.To my husband’s dismay, the idea of moving back to the bay and staying there for the rest of our lives terrifies me. I’m not ready to stop our adventures! But I do agree that we’d like to establish a home base and permanent community. Maybe we’ll move to Taiwan or Singapore in 5 years though :)
I’m extremely thankful for my experience from pregnancy to parental leave in Berlin. I know how lucky we are to be able to move here, have our parents stay with us, and work at well paying jobs. We are extremely privileged to get this new perspective on what having a baby can look like. I’ve had friends in the US who had to fight for time off from their employers or beg their doctors to take their pain seriously to get a PT referral. It would have been hard for me to advocate for myself during this tender and vulnerable time.
I am grateful that Germany welcomed us as a temporary residents (we have EU Blue Cards), and allowed me to qualify and pay for public health insurance. I’ve felt supported by the city and healthcare system, with community spaces and services that I didn’t even know I needed.
After 12 months off, I feel ready to return to work, and step aside to let my husband become the primary caregiver. Love you dear! :)
Thank you Owen and Kalvin for the edits, and Alana Range for the lovely photos.

I’d been living in Berlin for almost a year before I managed to write about why I chose to give up my life in Canada to start anew in the German capital. I’d moved here in June 2011 and months later, found myself without words or an ability to share what was a very personal story. I’d typed dozens of drafts but felt none of them ever seemed fit for publishing. I guess I needed more time to realize why I’d really moved here and what exactly it meant to me.
Finally, the day came when I ended the suspense by sharing why I moved to Berlin in the first place.
Some people move to Berlin to be part of the city’s creative community, others to work at a startup, while some come for love, and many simply, for the hedonistic party and clubbing lifestyle.
My story’s much more different. I moved here never having visited the city, completely alone, without a job, and not knowing a word of German.
From the outside looking in, my life in Toronto seemed like a really good one. I was lucky enough to have close friends, an amazing apartment, and a job that paid well. I kept busy by playing sports, taking classes, and going to events and parties. I traveled a few times a year and did awe inspiring things like cruise the Galapagos Islands and hike the Inca Trail in Peru.
What most people didn’t know was that I was deeply unhappy. I loathed my job. I was ashamed I didn’t have a steady boyfriend, never mind a husband or children. I felt guilty for not being able to appreciate what I had. To be honest, I didn’t feel deserving of my good life. I cried each day, regularly had full blown panic attacks, and suffered from unrelenting insomnia. I was tired and drained all of time and even though I didn’t realize it yet, was sinking into a deep depression.
I was in complete denial of my depression for a very long time.
A lot of traumatic things had transpired in the decade leading up to that time of my life:
I’d married an abusive man, only to get divorced a year and half later. It had been devastating, as he’d been unfaithful and never once showed any regret. I’d also been pregnant and when he found out, he pressured me into having an unwanted abortion. When he left, he immediately moved in with his new girlfriend as if our seven years together meant nothing. Our parting was the best thing that ever happened me and my life immediately improved when he left, but I never once took the time to process what damage the relationship had done to my well being.
Just a couple of years later, I found out my father broke his 20+ years of sobriety. Things went downhill pretty fast from there and it got to the point, that every time the phone rang, I would collapse into a panicked state. The phone calls never meant anything good. He was either in the hospital from overdosing, getting picked up by the police for public drunkenness, and once, even arrested for driving under the influence. These events continued for quite a while until one weekend when I went home to visit him and my sister and I found him dead on the kitchen floor. As much as I’d been expecting something like that happen, there isn’t too many things as devastating as finding your father’s decaying body. I’ve never been able to get the image out of my head, or even the smell.
As if his death wasn’t enough, my siblings and I had to take care of my dad’s estate which involved a lot of work and stress. My sister and I ended up taking on the bulk of the responsibilities, a huge burden to say in the least. To make matters worse, no of the kids could agree on anything and what followed, was two years of pointless arguments and disputes. When it was over, one of my sister’s stopped talking to the entire family.
During that time, we also had to care for my elderly grandmother who was dying from Alzheimer’s. She ended up passing away just one year after my dad did. Even though it sounds wild and totally unbelievable, when we arrived at the cemetery for her burial, we discovered that they’d dug up the wrong grave site, my dad’s grave site! Trying to cover up their mistake, the grave diggers had carelessly tossed my dad’s cremated remains into the forest adjacent to the cemetery. My family and I had to comb through piles of dirt to find them and on the day we were supposed to bury my grandmother, we had to rebury my father as well.
So much insanity in such a short time would challenge the best of us, but I kept going by avoiding any and all opportunities to face the enormity of all of those life events by all means possible. I played sports, took classes, went to parties, and threw myself into work — just so I could keep busy and avoid checking myself into a mental hospital.
In 2005, I’d bought a house with the proceeds from my divorce. It was an investment property, as I purposely bought in a developing area so I could sell at a profit later on. Five years later, I did exactly that, leaving with a very handsome amount. Around the time I sold my place, I was also laid off from work and scored a decent settlement package.
It was the perfect chance to take a sabbatical and figure out what I really wanted from life. I could breathe and not worry about things for a while, perhaps finding the happiness that’d always eluded me. I ended up taking nearly two years off of work and spent the time being a lady of leisure, a champion lady of leisure actually. I slept in, got day drunk, watched countless reruns of Golden Girls, took cooking classes, and most importantly traveled. And once I started, I couldn’t stop.
A woman previously obsessed with South America, I finally decided to give Europe a chance. Figuring there was no better place to start than Italy, I ended up having my best vacation ever. It was then I felt free, happy, and joyous for the very first time ever in my life. I lost count of how many times I cried simply because it felt so surreal, to be there in a place I’d always dreamed of visiting and to feel happiness that I still didn’t feel I deserved. The new emotions overwhelmed me, but it became some kind of natural high I started to chase.
Upon arriving home, I ate and drank Italian food and wine at every opportunity, enrolled in language classes, and even vowed that someday I’d move there. I took comfort in dreaming about what life abroad would be like and indulged in silly movies like Under The Tuscan Sun for inspiration.
Not wanting to stay away from my new love for long, I returned to Europe again for Christmas to do a tour through Munich, Prague, Bratislava, Budapest, and Vienna. To be honest, I’d low expectations for the trip and thought there was no way that Italy experience could ever be topped. To my surprise, the Christmas tour turned out to be even better than I ever could’ve imagined. One cold snow filled night, as I walked across the Charles Bridge in Prague, I suddenly just “knew”. I was someday going to make that big move abroad to Europe. Not only did I want to do it, but more importantly, I knew I could do it.
Those trips were pivotal for a few reasons. First, it solidified the fact that I loved the continent. The happiness of that first trip was repeated with the second. Second, I discovered there was more to Europe than Italy and I knew I’d be happy living almost anywhere. I started thinking about Germany, France, and even Spain. Third, I felt a new and very surprising confidence that it was something that I could really do on my own.
The new year arrived and so did a new job in Toronto. The adjustment back into being employed was not gentle and again, I found myself feeling completely and utterly miserable. The honeymoon was over and I wondered what had really changed. Even though I still planned to move, I hadn’t taken any concrete actions to make my dreams a reality. I felt stuck and didn’t know how to move forward.
Then while in Cuba on vacation three months later, I received a call from my landlord announcing that they were putting my flat up for sale and public viewings would start the very next day. At first I was deeply upset with the news but then realized this was the time and a perfect opportunity. I decided right then and there I’d move to Europe. I cancelled my vacation and flew back to Toronto the very next day so I could start the process.
Just a few weeks later, I quit my job, gave my landlord notice, and applied for a working holiday visa in Germany. Without it being approved, I sold all of my possessions, booked a one way flight to Berlin, and secured a holiday apartment in Prenzlauer Berg. I was finally ready to move to Berlin.
After I put the wheels into motion, everything happened really fast. I was so busy taking care of details, I barely had time to think about what I was doing and one day, the enormity of all suddenly hit me. I was ending my way of life as I knew it and had no idea what the future held. I didn’t have any real plans except to try and make my blog successful, get to know Berlin, and see as much of Europe as I could. I knew it was possible (even likely?), I’d fail miserably and would have to come home. I made sure I had enough money to last about six months.
I was scared, exhilarated, and stressed but mostly, excited.
Saying my farewells was the single hardest thing I had to do and it wasn’t without tears. I had to bid adieu to some of the best friends in the world and of course, my family. It finally got to the point during my last week in Toronto where it was all getting to be too much and all I wanted to do was hop on the plane. Time was dragging by much too slowly and I was ready to start my life with a vengeance.
Reactions to my big announcement were mixed. While most expressed their support and wished me well, others weren’t so kind. Some were jealous, worried, and even thought I was crazy (which I now realize I was!).
These were just some of the comments — “Are you experiencing a midlife crisis?”, “You’re so naive. You’ll never succeed at travel writing. It’s not really a profession.”, “You need to grow up.”, “Aren’t you taking the whole Eat, Pray, Love thing a little too far?” “I’d do the same if I didn’t have a mortgage, spouse or children.”
While some of the concern was certainly warranted, the narrow mindedness of some people also shocked me. How can you not be thrilled for someone who wants to embark on a new adventure? I wondered, how couldn’t they see what I saw? The possibilities, the potential, the chance for true happiness.
As expected, everyone asked me why I was moving to Berlin. I’m still asked this question on a regular basis and still find it a hard one to answer.
I can’t really narrow it down to just one reason. My answers varied but went something like this:
It wasn’t at all because I watched this amazing video.
Of course, there are usually more questions:
“Do you have a job in Berlin?” I didn’t have a job when I first arrived.
“Do you speak German?” I didn’t know any German outside of bier, kindergarten, and scheisse but planned to take classes. I quickly become quite good at saying “Mein Deutsch ist nicht so gut.” to get through daily situations.
“Have you ever been to Berlin?” No. Based on the advice of two girls I met in Cuba and a friend that had lived in the city previously, I chose to live in Berlin as opposed to Munich, Hamburg, or Frankfurt.
“Are you moving there for a man?” Nope. Although the idea of dating fashionable, well educated, multilingual men who watched movies with subtitles was definitely appealing.
“Do you hate Toronto?” I didn’t hate Toronto. It was just time for a new beginning. I’ll always consider it home.
Did it work out? Yes, and no. Shortly after my arrival, a fellow newly arrived Berliner remarked to me over late night beers, “I don’t know whether you’re fucking brilliant or fucking crazy, but you certainly have balls.” Now that I look back, I admit that I may have been just that but I harbour absolutely no regrets.
I ended up staying in Berlin for 18 months. While there were plenty of ups and downs, moving to Berlin was one of the best decisions I’d ever made. Unfortunately, those downs caught up with up me with untenable work and relationship situations, so I took the very right decision to go back to Canada to figure things out.
It was also another opportunity to make myself feel grounded myself again and take stock about what I wanted from life. It didn’t take me long to realize that I missed Berlin a lot and I soon began plotting my way back. After two years in Canada, I returned in November 2014 and have been here ever since.
A decade later in 2021, I sometimes still find myself astonished that I’ve been in Berlin for all of this time. I’ll admit that I have moments where the urge to go back to Canada has been strong, most especially at the beginning of the pandemic.
Looking back, I can really see in the years following those traumatic events I discussed above, I took every possible action to avoid confronting my emotions. While I thought travelling around the world and moving to Berlin made me happy, I also realize that this was only furthering my escapist behaviour.
Following my move back here, I fell into bad habits like smoking and drinking, partying, and excessive travel. My happiness was superficial and even though there were plenty of fun-filled moments along the way, my unhappiness and depression only deepened, and as time went by those cracks only became more open and exposed. The depression was always lingering there, just under the surface, ready to bubble up and explode at a moment’s notice.
Then the pandemic came and I hit rock bottom, fast and hard. The lockdown, uncertainty surrounding my job, being so far away from home, and completely alone was just too much. While I’m still not so ready to write about that whole experience, I can say that I was in really, really, really bad shape.
Thanks to support from plenty of cool people who spent time with me on video calls, understanding doctors, a sympathetic employer, and regular therapy, life looks much differently than it did before. I’ve put absolutely everything into bettering my well being. I quit smoking, found a new job, and managed tough events like losing my grandmother and cat in the same week. The panic attacks have stopped (for now), I’m off of antidepressants, I sleep through the night, and wake up many days with a smile on my face. My life is all the better with the recent arrival of a new rescue cat from Poland, who sports such a thick moustache that I named him after Burt Reynolds.
I (cautiously) say that I may be finally be feeling happy. Something I never thought I’d be able to say with any conviction. While I have a lot of work ahead, I’m in a really good place and look forward to building a much healthier and happier life here in Berlin.

KREUZBERG, Berlin — At the Berlinische Galerie on Alte Jakobstraße, I rounded the corner to an exhibition room and was taken aback by a large, ape-like creature sprawled across the concrete floor in an installation that I can only term narrative art.
The ape was coated in black, stringy fur that small worker figures were stripping from her back, leaving her torso a bloody mess. Her mouth hung wide open as wooden structures leaned up against her face with other small human figures trying to extract resources from her teeth. Some laborers had even gone to loot her private parts, loading her treasures into overflowing trucks. They were stripping her bare, capitalizing on her death, and destroying her corpse to feed their greed.
On display until Aug. 21, the art installation “The Sweet Certainty of Deliverance from the Darkness that Surrounds Us” portrays the imminent threat the planet faces, with rising temperatures and natural disasters caused by greenhouse gas emissions and unsustainable ways of life and production.
Witnessing this artistic raid on the creature’s body, a feeling of violation crept up in me, confronting me with the reality animals have faced in the race toward industrialization. My feet quickly moved to the next room.
In the middle of that hall, a flower bud-shaped paper-mâché spaceship draws the eyes, luring people to enter. Within it, the faces of animals stared back at me. Surrounding the vessel are large brown leaves, each holding a painting depicting the story of human evolution and collectivism that was set ablaze by mankind.
Apes fall from trees transforming into humans. Together, the apes burn down the forests and trees from where they came. In a last effort to preserve what remains of the land, the animals work together to build the vessel featured in the center of the room, which sends humans into space as animals watch them leave the world they have destroyed.
Leaving the exhibit, I was overcome by guilt and shame.
German and Romanian artists Matthias Boehler and Christian Orendt present their shocking view of the future of civilization, attempting to explain why humans waste resources, burn acres of forests that provide the Earth with oxygen, and produce more gas emissions than ever recorded. The two have worked together since 2008, creating art installations that provoke their viewers into questioning their responsibility and prompting them to change their ways of life by experiencing impactful and ironic mixed media exhibits.
While the storyline is a work of fiction, the work portrays a reality that is eerily familiar. Thoughts of billionaires flying into space and power plant fumes drifting up through the Earth’s atmosphere entered my mind. The exhibit conjured the smell of fires burning and ashy-covered streets in California — now also happening near my home in Queens, New York, where glass shards and Styrofoam litter concrete roads that used to host freshly cut fields of luscious poppies.
Now, walking around the streets of Berlin, I am reminded of how we globally share the challenge of survival. Advertisements for sustainable products surround me. It is easy to be a more eco-conscious guest on Earth in Berlin, where the importance of conservation is posted along the walls of train stations and covers the beams of streetlights.
This is not the case in the United States, where recycling is an afterthought and rarely enforced. It is difficult to find a can to throw out trash along the streets of Manhattan. Walking is not an option in Los Angeles, when there are no sidewalks, forcing me to get behind the wheel.
In Berlin, I am rewarded with a Euro coin every time I return a glass bottle or cup, urging me to reflect on my plastic consumption. When riding the U-Bahn, I am given four options on how to dispose of my trash, prompting me to discover what materials my waste is made of. To beat the summer heat, I can find solace on a former runway at a reimagined Tempelhof airport, surrounded by lush gardens and commuting cyclists. In this city, greenery stretches across historic streets crowded with people enjoying the sunshine, filling me with hope.
Berlin seems to understand the pleasures of living on the Earth and the need to take action now. After walking out of the Berlinische Gallery, I am beginning to as well.

By Carly Kay
The familiar rumble of plastic suitcase wheels against cobblestoned streets was suddenly drowned out by the pulse of techno music and a cacophony of languages as I finally dragged my luggage over the threshold of Generator Hostel in Berlin Mitte.
The words “You are crazy my child. You must go to Berlin” and “Make love not war” were boldly printed upon cabinet doors that displayed a photo of the now-iconic kiss between former East German president Erich Honecker and former Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, painted on a piece of the Berlin Wall known as the East Side Gallery.
Within an instant, this dimly lit corner of the hostel lobby seemed to reinforce Berlin’s international reputation for chaos and creativity. After spending months researching the famously reunified city, I was prepared to enter in real life the picturesque vision of history-laced eccentricity that had vividly taken shape in my mind.
Yet, instead of being met by hordes of passionate young people, as I had imagined from the comforts of Santa Barbara, I encountered silent unblinking stares and direct, unapologetic words. Known for embracing freedom, the city exists at the same time in a culture that rigidly abides by unspoken rules.
Soon after I boarded a bus from Tegel airport, it became apparent that the local passengers had very little tolerance for visitors who unknowingly violated these mutually-recognized social agreements.
Taking in my new surroundings, I was suddenly ripped from my tranquil, contemplative state when the sound of loud banging against glass filled the air.
“My wife! My wife! Please, someone stop the bus. My wife is out there,” shouted a flustered man with two daughters in tow.
Despite the panic in the man’s voice, the bus driver continued to pull out of the station. I watched in disbelief as the nearly full bus watched the situation unfold without the slightest inclination to help the man left on the sidewalk.
After a few seconds of the traveler’s incessant pleading, a man inside the bus rolled his eyes and reluctantly yelled something in German to the bus driver, apparently driven more by annoyance than altruism.
Berliners and travelers alike glued their eyes to the confused family as they attempted to reconvene and reevaluate the transit system in the doorway of the bus. As I gaped at the family, people around me began to shift uncomfortably in their seats and a palpable frustration settled over the crowd.
Growing impatient with the family’s indecision, the same German man who spoke to the bus driver began aggressively making shoo-ing gestures towards the door.
“Out, Out,” he shouted bluntly to the family. “A different bus for you. Out.”
The confused family finally stepped off the bus to discuss travel logistics elsewhere.
As the engine revved, the bus driver’s voice came over the intercom. Unfamiliar syllables and guttural noises drifted over my head and provoked an outbreak of laughter from the locals around me.
I did not understand what the bus driver said, but could only imagine it had something to do with the visitor’s inability to understand the social expectations for proper bus etiquette. My suspicion was confirmed during our orientation when I heard stories of bus drivers denying rides to passengers if they were waiting just off to the side of designated stops.
These small codes and standards seemed to contradict the glorified free-spirited energy that I strongly associated with Berlin. The city fosters a sense of radical self-expression. But at the same time, its occupants are afforded a certain level of responsibility, to respect mutually-understood social values.
A bit unsure of our new temporary home, I considered how to navigate such a complex system of both rigidity and independence. The system both welcomes daring innovations with open arms, while it exiles particular deviations from the norm with sharp rebukes.
So, despite my apprehension, I confidently dragged my suitcase through the hostel lobby, ready to engage with a convoluted labyrinth of social norms that co-exist in the city that has an explosive sense of self-identity. I guess you could call me a ‘crazy child.’ I had truly arrived in Berlin.
UCSB journalism students are now reporting daily in Berlin for feature articles which will be published here in July. Meanwhile, they are blogging from the city about their travel and journalism experiences.

Should you visit Berlin? Absolutely not, as these five points prove. Not only will you have to endure a city where everyone seems to have no responsibilities and only want to party, your trip will then ruin the rest of your life when looking back at the very few things Berlin does well. Read on for some important warnings on why you shouldn’t bother visiting Berlin…
Clubbing in Berlin is like nothing else I’ve experienced. From the ridiculous door policies and marathon opening times to the endless techno, you’ll find that the nightlife in Germany’s capital is very unusual. But after just one night of being indoctrinated into the Berlin way of doing things, you’ll realise that they just do it better.
In Berlin clubs, it’s frowned upon to take photos — in some, photography is banned. But why would you want to take photos of your mates in the club anyway? Just enjoy the moment, your life shouldn’t be about showing off to your Instagram followers. Who cares if you got into Berghain, anyway??
You also won’t find any mirrors in the club toilets, either. Or anywhere else for that matter. But if you’re actually there to have a good time, does it even matter what you look like?
Next is the music. No one loves techno quite as much as Berliners do. Last time I went to Ipse in east Berlin, the crowd cheered after each DJ finished their set. Moments later, the next DJ would come on and play what sounds like the exact same track, only with a slightly different snare drum sample.
SEE ALSO: 4 things you’ll learn about clubbing in Berlin
And if you’re not into the hypnotic, monotonous music, you’re not getting in, because the bouncers will quiz you on who’s playing.
However, after clubbing in Berlin, you’ll realise that clubs elsewhere are full of posers who are just there to be seen, pretending to have fun. Does anyone even have fun in clubs outside of Berlin? Most likely, they’re not. In Berlin, they’re actually there because they love the music.
And that’s how it should be. Why go to a club with ludicrous drinks prices to pretend you’re something you’re not and live a lifestyle you don’t lead, just to impress a load of other people who’re in exact same boat as you. You might be sitting in the VIP booth, but truth is after tonight you’ll be back on your zero hours contract job or skipping your media studies lecture.
At least in Berlin, clubbers are honest. When you get home, clubbing will be ruined for you as you’ll realise just how futile and pathetic it is anywhere else.
Berlin is probably one of the cheapest major cities in the world. Want a latte at the train station? It’s yours for the princely sum of €1. Want a kebab? That’s €3.50. In fact, the only thing that’s overpriced is entry to the TV Tower.
Trust me, in just a few days you’ll get used to the low prices (unless you head over to Poland or Hungary next!) and when you get home, if you’re from the UK, the USA, or elsewhere in western or northern Europe, things will suddenly seem so expensive.
On a night out in east Berlin, you could have a beer for under €2. That would cost you around £5 in London. We even picked up 0.5l bottles of beer at a convenience store for €0.60. Sixty cents. That’s insanely cheap!
Nothing ever happened in Berlin. It might be the capital of Germany, but Germany only became a country in 1871. Even the USA has 100 years on that, while England was unified in the 10th century and has been a country ever since.
Plus, Berlin was almost totally destroyed in 1945. And nothing really happened after that…
Of course in reality, Berlin was one of the major flash points in the Cold War. Take the Berlin Crisis in 1961, where US and Soviet tanks had a standoff for 16 hours, 50 meters apart, with live ammunition. Chilling stuff.
Or the Berlin Wall, and the numerous escape attempts that led to hundreds of East Germans tragically dying at the hands of the border guards, as well as the fascinating stories of how a handful of people got away with it through their audacious escape attempts. You can learn about these at the Berlin Wall Museum at Checkpoint Charlie.
And who can forget the former German Democratic Republic? If you’ve been watching Deutschland 83, you’ll already know about the East German Communist state. Find out what life was like behind the iron curtain in the DDR museum in Berlin Mitte. Though it was one of the more successful communist states, you’ll learn that freedom was severely restricted, and find out how the population coped by listening to communist music, watching steroid-fuelled sports, and going on nudist beach holidays (yes, really).
Berlin is known for it’s chilled freewheeling spirit, that’s much less intense than other large cities like London or Paris. You’ll find the people here are really down to earth and relaxed. In the summer months, many people sit out drinking at beach bars on the banks of the river Spree, or take a dip in the Badeschiff.
They’re not uptight about when clubs close like in other cities — parties from Friday night are known to stay open until Monday morning. No matter what time of day or day of the week, you’ll see people relaxing and having fun, partly down to the rise of flexi-time working hours in the city.
SEE ALSO: What in the world is travel hacking?
The city is also home to around 20,000 artists, drawn to the city thanks to cheap rents and tons of studio space. Similarly, Berlin is a hotspot for tech startups, meaning there’s lots of hipsters to meet in the multitude of quirky, independent bars.
After you leave, you’ll miss the constant party scene, particularly if you’re going back to the daily grind of the rat race back home.
Bologna has bolognese, Tokyo has sushi, and Berlin has… doner kebabs?
But these aren’t the standard greasy kebabs you’d pick up at 3 am after stumbling out of a grimy provincial Essex nightclub. The döner im brot is ubiquitous across Berlin, and absolutely delicious, served with salad, and both garlic and herb and hot sauce. The grilled bread that these kebabs are served in makes all the difference, rather than the dry pitta you’d get served in the UK. While you can pick up a doner anywhere, you can find the best in the city here.
Let’s also not forget the famous curry wurst, made from a steamed, then fried pork sausage, served with a ketchup based sauce topped with curry powder, and a side of fries.
The humble curry wurst owes its existence to World War Two. The dish was invented by Herta Heuwer in Charlottenburg, west Berlin, in 1949. Having acquired curry powder, ketchup and Worcestershire sauce from the occupying British troops, serving up the first curry wursts to the construction workers rebuilding the city.
Today, Berliners can’t get enough, guzzling 70 million of them each year.
So yes, food in Berlin really is the wurst (sorry)

While chatting a few years ago about Berlin with a venture capital veteran from the Silicon Valley, he mentioned that he saw Berlin as ‘a city finding itself’. As a recurrent visitor of the city since 1998, I can relate to that statement; I can happily say that by now, this city has developed a character of its own (on the startups’ side).
Berlin is the capital of Germany, and one of the most eventful cities in the world.
It is a city of contrast where history and newness encounter each other on every corner.
A good example is that the city serves as the center for all political decisions in Germany as well as the hub for startups and technology advancement. But before we look at the current state of the city, it is useful to go down memory lane and understand the following:
After World War II (1945) the city was mostly destroyed. Situated at the center of such a dark recent history, the city needed to rebuild itself and was in an awkwardly divided position: West and East Berlin. The West side was controlled by the American, British and French, while the East side was controlled by the Soviet Union. The division was so strong that there was even a physical manifestation of it, the Berlin Wall, which was built in 1961 and only fell in 1989. The city became the capital of the German nation in 1991 and then started its reconstruction process.
Two main factors determined the type of people that lived or moved to the city and would later become critical for the development of the startup ecosystem:
These factors attracted talent to Berlin, creating density over time and increasing its appeal to internationals. In the words of a friend:
“Berlin is not a city where people brag about a 6-course menu at a restaurant, but rather one where people talk about the clubs they frequent.”
That alternativeness in what it means to have “made it” in the city attracts a distinct crowd.
So let’s create a short timeline with some of the main events in this ecosystem building process:
In the early 2000s, there was arguably not much happening in the city in terms of industry. In Germany, a highly decentralized country, every region or “Bundesland” was relatively specialized in terms of a certain type of business: insurance in Munich or energy in Essen. Berlin was mostly known for being the city where the artists and the government were located, but there was no big industry, which made it a fertile ground for people to build from scratch.
The first wave of startups in Berlin dates to the interval between 2007 and 2010. Within that time the city gave birth to startups like studiVZ (social network), Immobilienscout24, Zalando, Idealo, Gate5, and Jamba. Jamba was the second exit from the Samwer brothers who later became the founders of Rocket Internet. Gate5 was sold to Nokia, and the founder, Christophe Maire, would later go on to start Atlantic Labs.
This period saw the rise of venture builders; since these types of companies are not common everywhere, I’ll explain: Venture Builders are companies that focus on launching new businesses from a core team that develops them and supports them with some central functions such as HR and Legal. In short, these are companies whose purpose is to create other “child” companies. While venture builders are now present across the world, there has been a strong concentration in Berlin.
Around 2011, there were two venture builders in the city: Team Europe and Rocket Internet. Team Europe was started by Kolja Hebenstreit, Lukasz Gadowski, and supported the early days of Delivery Hero (Lieferheld back then), Wooga, and Spreadshirt. Rocket Internet was started by the Samwer brothers who had previously founded and successfully exited companies such as Alando and Jamba. There has been plenty written about the Rocket Internet and the Samwer brothers’ story, but I personally recommend reading this version by The Generalist.
While there are mixed opinions on the company and its ethics, no one can deny that they were one of the largest catalyzers to make the Berlin startup hub “happen”. Among the companies that benefited from the Rocket Internet force, we can find some of the most iconic scale ups such as Delivery Hero, HelloFresh, Zalando, Home24, and Westwing.
As time progressed, startups originated not only from venture builders but from other founders entering the scene; some of those stories relate to SoundCloud, Wunderlist, EyeEm, SumUp and Amen. On the venture capital side of things, some VCs started to see an opportunity in Berlin and one of the first ones to establish a presence here was Earlybird, which moved from Hamburg to Berlin in 2013. Berlin started to appear in the international startup scene, so much so that even Ashton Kutcher decided to invest in the city back in 2012.
Several of the companies mentioned before were the bootcamps for much of the talent we see today, and as talent churned from the bigger companies, more ventures got built. At this point in time, most of the companies built in Berlin had a flavor of commerce, consumer and copy-cats. People associated Berlin with power of execution, but not necessarily with innovation.
By 2014, Oliver Samwer, the older brother of the trio, started to professionalize his investing and from that Global Founders Capital was born. It was right around that time that Rocket Internet was considered to have reached its peak success, where many of its ventures such as HelloFresh, GlossyBox, DeliveryHero, and Zalando were present not only in Germany but had also started international expansion.
As Berlin became more recognized as a startup hub and the venture building practices became internationally known, more venture builders started to emerge such as Hitfox (now IONIQ), which expanded into fintech with finleap and later into healthtech as Heartbeat Labs. Many of these venture builders not only built for themselves but also for corporations, and soon enough it became common for several German corporations to establish their innovation practices in Berlin. Examples include Lufthansa Innovation Hub, BCG Digital Ventures, and Körber Digital enabled by consultants such as BCG Digital Ventures.
In 2015 Wunderlist, a startup from entrepreneur Christian Reber and the Wunderkinder crew, was sold to Microsoft for $125 million. While compared to some of the valuations and exits we are seeing in the current VC climate this might seem small, at the time this was a major milestone for the Berlin ecosystem. This made it clear that it was possible to build something out of Berlin and exit to global players.
By 2016, Berlin was well recognized as the second largest startup hub in Europe, only behind London. It is around this period when Rocket Internet stopped incubating more businesses. At an ecosystem level, there were already enough small successes to have attracted more capital to Berlin and many new VCs were founded: Point9, Cherry Ventures, and LaFamiglia.
As aspirations in the city grew, it became increasingly attractive to international funds opening offices in Berlin– properly committing to the city. Some examples of international funds opening offices in Berlin include Creandum, Heartcore, and Speedinvest.
The success stories of previous years have encouraged more people to pursue entrepreneurship as a viable career path. As we look into the future of Berlin, the city has diversified the type of industries it serves into fintech, logistics, mobility, edtech, etc… Furthermore, it is expected that some of the Berlin based unicorns will IPO or be acquired in the coming years, leaving several employees with disposable income to invest or start new things on their own. At the same time, this also means more second-time founders and operators with scale-up experience that will continue the flywheel in the ecosystem.
On the VC side, the proliferance of smaller VCs led to a general sentiment that Berlin has consolidated its spot as one of the leading European hubs, taking on increasingly more ambitious challenges. Two movements that were not discussed in this narrative so far were the governmental initiatives to enhance the startup ecosystem, such as the Adlershof, and the fact that for a while Berlin was considered one of the crypto hubs of Europe.
For now, I believe it is time to bring the story to the current times and identify who the movers and shakers in the ecosystem are:
By now it is no secret that nearly every important fund in the world has at some point invested in a Berlin-based company, however I want to focus our attention on funds that are “headquartered” or “committed” in Berlin.
The first category, “headquartered”, contains funds who were founded or moved their headquarters into the city. The second category, “committed”, contains the funds that have at least one person permanently based in Berlin; hence they have formalized their commitment to the city.
While the city’s stars are and will always be the startups, it is useful to see some of the VCs as the catalysts for innovation happening in the city. Many of those VCs are operators turned investors or individuals who have boldly betted on Berlin being the next innovation center of Europe. By late August, Sifted reported that Berlin startups had already obtained €5.1bn in investment:
As we can see this means that by the time I publish this article, the city is likely to have doubled the investment from 2019, the record year until now.
On the startup side, I don’t think I’d ever finish this article if I were to list all the startups in Berlin. Nonetheless, I want to highlight some of the ones that have successfully put the city on the global map:
I want to finish this article by encouraging everyone to move to, invest in or visit Berlin. Nowadays, there are more factors that contribute to the city continuing to gain the hearts of many, so here are few selling points:
Overall, it has taken a while for Berlin to become the startup capital we know and love. I am bullish on Berlin continuing to attract highly qualified talent and increasingly incubating more European unicorns. Come visit or message me if you have extra stories on the city.

This article is a reflection of my recent journey to Berlin, Germany’s capital to attend a party given by my company. I felt Berlin is warm to newcomers, and it has tons of history from world wars and, homes, people from different backgrounds and nationalities. In a few phrases, what I feel about Berlin:
Berlin is a human rights capital of Germany. It embraces a new inhabitant with both hands and Berlin always has room for someone: a tourist, an expat or a refugee. I find the culture is so open that for millennial, Berlin can be an ideal city to live and work.
Unfortunately, that was not my opinion when I last visited Berlin 6 months back for attending AWS Summit, Berlin. On February 26–27, 2019, I participated in the summit or conference whatever you call it, and didn’t get much time to explore the city and its famous landmarks and attractions. I stayed in Ibis hotel, Postdamer Platz. We book it because it is close to the summit venue, Station Berlin. It was a sheer business trip in the mid of the week.
Station Berlin is one of the old railway stations in Germany that opened in 1875. Later, it is used by the German Postal office as a hub of packages and mails. Now the location is rented for conferences and events.
The whole area is an old city and looks more gloomy in winters. The first impression is the best. After seeing the modern, vibrant southern towns like Munich and Nürnberg, I found Berlin Postdamer Platz as a disappointment.
The Berlin Hauptbahnhof(Central Train Station) makes you think of an alien spaceship in terms of architecture, but when you come out, you find the old Berlin which is not so appealing in winter.
You can see the Station Berlin 3D tour here:

The Berlin Hauptbahnhof(Central Train Station) makes you think of an alien spaceship in terms of architecture. But when you come out, you find the old Berlin which is not so appealing in winter.
I got a chance to go to Berlin again, in the form of a summer party given by my company. My company, Zalando, annually throws a huge party(4000+ attendees) for employees working all over Germany. As part of it, we traveled from Tradebyte office in Ansbach, Bayern to Berlin’s Leipziger Straße by company-provided bus.
The company booked hotel rooms in Motel One, Leipziger straße for 30 plus of us. The plan was to go to the party on that evening, get back to the hotel, rest and travel back on the next day. People can also stay again and explore Berlin in a relaxed way, after-party and come back whenever they wish to return to Ansbach.
It was slightly an overcast condition in Ansbach, in the early morning. I got ready by 6:45 AM and prepared my morning coffee. Then I left straight to the meeting point in Bahnhofstraße for boarding the bus to Berlin. The plan was to start from Ansbach, then detour Nürnberg and pick few employees living there.
Our bus rolled on Autobahn A9(Highway) via Bayreuth swiftly through the landscapes of many meadows where cattle and horses were feeding. Construction works are going on in many places to the highway. For frequent travelers, the bus trip could be annoying as you see a lot of cars zipping next to you and Ferrari and supercars are quite common. Trucks should take the last lane of a six-lane road.
The most eye-pleasing stint in the journey is the sight of gigantic windmills on A9. They rotate slowly and sometimes with moderate speeds when the wind is high.
You also spot beautiful meadows and green pastures right next to the road. The soil type varies as we travel from south to east.
My friend and I played a small guessing game on the autobahn. It is to see the number-plate of trucks pass by and guess the city/town/municipality of the vehicle registered in Germany. Like for example, Ansbach registration is AN XX-YYY. Below is a number plate from Wolfsburg, Germany home of Volkswagen. The blue color “D” is Deutschland(Germany) with an EU flag in the background.
We saw trucks from European union, and also from other countries like Great Britain and Switzerland who has different number-plate. I came to know that when you enter into a different Schengen state, you have to pay a toll. But within Germany, for using autobahns(fast-driving roads), you pay no fee.
We stopped near a gas station in midway because our driver has to take rest for 45 minutes. In Germany, driving laws are strict and transparent. A driver should compulsorily for halt 45 minutes after driving straight for 8 hours. We had our lunch at around 11:45 AM.
The bus equips an in-house bathroom and a fridge. The ride was comfortable, and 5–6 hours journey didn’t exhaust us at all. Now, after the break, we headed towards Berlin. Our bus driver, on some occasions, announced the exciting facts about the regions like “Ahoy! Now we are entering into East Germany” etc.
Near Leipzig, we spotted from the bus a cargo airport of some private company. My friend told me that the planes halted there are Russian by observing their body paints. I wondered what Russian planes are doing there. But I later recollected that the same region was under the soviets until 1990.
Finally, at 2:45 PM, we entered into the outskirts of Berlin and soon into the city. The bus went through the Ernst-Reuter-Platz into the famous Tiergarten(Botanical gardens).
Since we are pouring in a lot of German words, here are some of the common words you see as a tourist and what they mean in English:
Nouns:
der Platz — the Square
die Straße — the Street
die Stadt — the City/Town
der Markt — the Market
die Garten — the Garden
die kirche — the Church
der Bahnhof — the Train Station
Adjectives:
Haupt — Central/Main (adj.)
Alt — Old
You can attach adjectives + nouns to form new words. Like:
Hauptplatz — Main square
Hauptgarten — Central garden
Hauptbahnhof — Central station
Altstadt — Old Town
Tiergarten is home for hundreds of huge trees in the heart of the Berlin city. There are many squares in the garden. Our bus passed by the famous Siegessäule(victory column) that is a remarkable piece of architecture which lifts the spirit of Berlin. The Prussian empire constructed it in 1873 as a memorial for its victory against the Danish forces. People in our bus stuck their noses to the window to see this marvelous figure.
After crossing a few traffic signals, we saw the Soviet war memorial, which is a statue remembered for the legacy of soviet soldiers in the Berlin city.
We then passed through the famous Brandenburg Tor(gate) from the west side of the city. FYI: The gate entrance faces East Berlin.
We will talk later more about this de-facto mascot of Berlin. Our bus took a right turn here onto Ebertstraße and faced few more traffic signals. Finally we reached hotel in Leipzigerstraße around 3:15 PM.
Within half an hour, everyone checked-in to Motel One. Many seem to be exhausted from the trip and want to have a nap before going to the party that starts at 6:00 PM and goes until 3:00 AM. But I have a different plan in my mind. I washed my face, locked my room 3:45 PM, and left the hotel for exploring the Berlin city. I have time until 5:30 PM when the bus starts from the hotel to the party venue.
I then checked the nearby attractions in Google and started walking towards a few of them. There are Germans, Chinese, Balkans, Turks, and tourists from many other nations walking in the streets. The good thing about my hotel location is every major attraction in Berlin is walk-able and under 2 KM distance. The only thing I am running against hard is the time.
People filled the Cafes and open restaurants who are enjoying the weekend atmosphere. I first took Friedrichstraße from Liepzigerstraße and walked onto Taubenstraße to reach Gendarmenmarkt. It is a square that has a concert hall and two churches Deutsche Kirche und französische Kirche (German church and French church). The architecture of all three is mind-boggling. I didn’t enter into them, but the vast square with cheering families, lovely couples, and, senior citizens made a lively atmosphere.
I then walked past the French church onto Markgrafenstraße and other streets just watching the architecture of buildings and observing people around. I also went to a few parks nearby where parents are playing with their kids and, few are biking. I sat there for sometimes and started to the next attraction, Berlin Gallery, which is 1.4 KM from that point.
While I am walking to the attraction, I received a call from my colleague saying office bus is ready to leave to the party venue and all are waiting for me at the hotel. Oh my god! I stared at my watch and found it was 5:30 PM already. Then I dumped my plan of going to Berlin gallery and walked back to Leipzigerstraße where my bus was standing on the road to take off. I didn’t even get time to change my clothes, and I jumped onto the bus coach, and it left after 7 minutes delay, curse me.
Berlin’s Tempelhofer Feld (Tempelhof airfield) hosts our party, which is an old airport where military airlines/cargo planes used to operate at the time of World War 2. Now it is a park, and like Station Berlin, the runway area is rented for parties and events to generate revenue. This place is famous for a cold war time event called “Berlin blockade and airlift.”
As a quick fact of history in the times of cold war from 1948–49, soviet occupied East Germany and cut down the entry for allies into west Berlin to provide the food supplies to its citizens. East Germany, which is under communist rule, surrounds West Berlin.
There is no other option for the US and its western allies(France, UK, Canada, New Zealand, etc.) than to fly supplies from West Germany to West Berlin. Tempelhofer Feld is used by Allied powers to receive the food supplies and then distribute them. It went for a year. I am lucky enough to stand on the same grounds where a lot of dramatic events took place 70 years back.

The party was great. I can see thousands everywhere, met many new folks. For Ex: I met a Spanish guy named Alex, who come from Palam de Mallorca island of Spain. He told me that Germans are the majority of tourists to his island because it was once a German territory. He said he is currently learning German and likes the job he does in Berlin.
As our conversation progressed, I told him when I think about Spain, Rafael Nadal comes to my mind. To my surprise, he said to me that Nadal too lives in Mallorca and Nadal’s home is just 5 KM from away from his. Wow! How often do you hear that from a stranger? Like “Do you know? Sachin Tendulkar lives two blocks away from me”.
My colleagues and I played many games like fußball, Table Tennis, Basketball at the party. We spent almost four hours playing, eating, networking, dancing, and enjoying the music and environment.
At night, people had a high time with drinks and danced to playing songs by a DJ. My friend and I decided to say goodbye to our colleagues at the party around 10:00 PM and planned to go out for sightseeing Berlin after dusk. Hurray! This time, I don’t have to go alone.
Now comes the exciting part! One of the friends and I took U-Bahn(Underground rail) from Tempelhof station to Hallesches Tor and planned to walk from there to Checkpoint Charlie. We don’t want to go till Französische straße, which is close to our hotel because we want to wander more on foot.
My friend is a history buff, and I was lucky that he is an unofficial tour guide for me. Apart from his mother tongue Turkmen, he speaks Russian, German, and also, Turkish. He was there in Berlin before, but he wants to explore the places again.
When we got out from Hallesches Tor station, we saw a water channel, a tributary of the Strengbach river right under the station. There is a small steamer boat drifting in the waters. It is like having a stream under the underground rail. In the station, you also find the historical pictures of the station lines damaged in WWII.
Then we walked around Mehringplatz, a circular residential square and steeped into Friedrichstraße. On the way, we have seen many buildings with graffiti and messages like “Make Art not War.” Many houses were silent and seemed like there is no activity at 11:00 PM.
Initially, I thought there were off to bed, but I came to know that Berlin people love nightlife and most of them will be hanging around bars and nightclubs along with friends drinking beer and eating sausages.
In the same street, we have reached a famous tourist spot called Checkpoint Charlie. It is an immigration checkpoint between East Berlin and West Berlin. East Berlin and West Berlin are divided by Berlin wall until 1990. The only road which you can take to cross the border is through this checkpoint. Here you have to prove who you are, show the permissions.
Before the Berlin wall was built in 1961, many people fled from East Germany to West Germany, which irked Soviet to construct a wall. Checkpoint Charlie is a very crucial point where sometimes soviet and the USA used to deploy tankers to show their power. I felt thrilled that the things from my history books are right in front of my eyes.
While we are at Checkpoint Charlie, a lovely young couple who are riding an e-scooter approached us and asked for help with directions. Their phones were dead, and they were confused about the location of their hotel. They are heading to Invalidenstraße. They noted the directions from Google maps on my phone and bade us goodbye.
From the Checkpoint Charlie, we headed towards Brandeburg Tor(gate) by taking the famous Wilhelmstraße. It was named after Friedrich Wilhelm I, a legendary Prussian king. Many government offices lie in this street, which gave it the name ”Government District.” It is one of the prominent streets in Germany before and even now. This street also has a museum that has Soviet TV Sets, landline phones etc.
We also walked past the Jew cemetery memorial, which is constructed by the German government and US embassy where you can see a bear idol, which is similar to the Statue of Liberty. Berlin’s coat of arms has a bear, so bears are very popular in Brandenburg, Berlin. Now comes the famous Brandeburg Tor(gate). We have reached the gate at around 11:45 PM. It was empty from tourists. It has a chariot on top with goddess Victoria riding it.
I stood at the East Germany side in front of the Brandenburg gate. Behind the gate is the Tiergarten where my bus took a right. East Germany entirely closed this gate in the communist regime. WWII conflicts destroyed the gate partially but then after restored.
I thought I have the whole night to explore this beautiful Berlin city and there were few to almost no tourists in the main attractions. Right next to the gate, I found there are US, France, and Russian consulate generals. My friend told me that every powerful nation tries to get the closest consulate near the Brandenburg gate. As I told you, he is my unofficial guide(chuckling)
From the gate, I can see a building that has round glass, Dom. I learned it is Bundestag(German Parliament office) in Platz der Republik(Republic square). They closed it already, so couldn’t explore it. I heard that people could attend the sessions but have to register online upfront.
www.bundestag.de
By then I felt exhausted because of the long bus journey, afternoon walk, party games, and two and half hours long walk again. We started walking back to our hotel via Charlottenstraße, where we once again went past Gendarmenmarkt, and I had an opportunity to glance at the famous Humboldt University of Berlin.
The specialty of this university is it has won 50 Nobel prizes till now and has great alumni: Sociologists like Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Physicists like Max Planck and Heinrich Hertz. The legendary Albert Einstein taught at this university from 1915–1928. I also collected few invitation cards those spread on a sitting bench as souvenirs for myself.
With all the good memories, we reached our hotel at 1:20 AM. I dropped myself on the bed after changing clothes. I slept soundly until 7:30 AM next morning, had my breakfast at the hotel and traveled back to Ansbach with my colleagues.
That ends my Berlin visit!
Now you know why Berlin completely changed my earlier impressions! Because it offered so much in very less time which I can cherish for my lifetime!

Edit: After posting this, I got a lot of responses from people who also attended the Berlin Opera Academy and had something to say. I’ve asked for their permission to share their stories. You can find them at the bottom of this article.
On the first day of BOA 2022, during the general assembly, the head of the program gave us a rousing speech. It really was very good — you could see people eyes lighting up, and I felt my own face glow with anticipation.
However, he said one thing that made me a little suspicious. ‘Be positive,’ he told us. ‘Have a positive mindset. Don’t grumble or complain. Make something out of it.’
Of course, I completely agree with the benefits of a positive mindset. There’s a lot of whining and complaining in any world, and we’d all be better off without it. But at the same time, this sounded defensive to me — as if he knew there were things that weren’t right, and hoped to not get too much pushback.
As it turned out, the BOA program, for all its merits, has a few drawbacks that I think people should be aware of before signing up.
But let’s start on that positive note.
BOA is a great initiative and Berlin is a great city. The teachers that they attract are often amazing and will give you valuable feedback. They will often give you their honest opinion, and because you’re seeing lots of different people in a short amount of time, you will start to notice which comments keep popping up. I, for example, heard that I was moving around rather aimlessly from three different teachers. That’s when you know it should be the first priority on your list of things to fix.
This is a great opportunity that might be worth paying for, especially if you’ve never done it before (I hadn’t).
You’ll get to actually do a whole opera and you will be guided by professional conductors and directors. I got extremely lucky: my opera (Suor Angelica) was directed by Susan Stone. She displayed a kind of professionalism that I really learned a lot from over the span of four weeks. She was kind and open, but not overly familiar. She was ridiculously smart, had very original ideas for the piece which the executed with meticulous precision, and held us and herself to a very high standard. It was one of the most inspiring things that month.
You might make some new friends, and you’ll be able to see how you measure up to others. This will be both encouraging and discouraging. Personally, I learned that, repertoire-wise, I was way better prepared than almost anyone else there, which was lovely. But I also learned that my interpretations suffered because I wasn’t intentional enough in my on-stage movement. This was painful to realise, but it was very important as it allowed me to work on it.
During the first two weeks, I got into exactly zero masterclasses. That’s right. The booking system where you are supposed to make your own appointments was deeply flawed. It basically meant that whoever had the fastest internet connection could get multiple masterclasses every day, while others went weeks without getting a masterclass. When the students of BOA 2022 complained, there were “warnings” issued to those who over-booked. But by then, many people had fallen behind in a way that could not be fixed. When I finally got my first masterclass in week three, I let the teacher know how happy I was to finally have snagged a spot. The teacher said: ‘Are you serious? I’m seeing some people for the fourth time today.’After that, I took it upon myself to help distribute classes fairly by snagging masterclasses I’d already been to and contact people that hadn’t worked with that teacher yet, to give them my spots. I even contacted some teachers separately and paid them for private lessons at their homes, because BOA wouldn’t have them back for more classes. The people at BOA had no solution for this problem, other that to issue warnings and block people who had had too many masterclasses — but as this only happened halfway into the program, most people were not able to make up for their lost time. This meant that some people got way more than their money’s worth from BOA, while others really did not.
This was one of the factors that resulted in the over-booked masterclasses. While I was there, they were staging three or four operas at the same time, all with three separate casts. This meant an absurd number of singers, all fighting over the same finite resources. It also means that everyone’s attention is spread very thin. The maestro has to work with two other people singing the same role as you, and they’re also working on the other productions. In my case, our director was working with four casts simultaneously — two for Suor Angelica and two for Gianni Schicchi — while the conductor was working on every production that was going on at that moment (do the math: 4 operas x 3 casts per opera). Whelp.
The Berlin Opera Academy also accepts people with little to no experience (who then eat up all the time with the conductor because they haven’t studied or cannot sing their parts). I knew all my parts by heart when I got there. My “time with the conductor” was five minutes in a huge rehearsal, after which he said ‘Great, thank you’ and moved on to the two other people singing the same part.
Let me be clear: there were people at BOA 2022 who said: ‘It wasn’t like this last time.’ I think I caught the program at an especially bad time. I came during the busiest month, and halfway into the production, the entire costume and set department quit because of unsafe working conditions and the fact that BOA had not delivered on their promises to them (which BOA admitted). They tried to salvage the situation, but in the end many productions had to scramble to get any kind of costumes together.
This is a relatively minor issue, but the venue where the operas were staged was a letdown. The ‘changing rooms’ were a gigantic, completely dark garage-like space that was open to the elements. When it rained, there was water everywhere. The hall is very oddly designed and is clearly better suited to an art exposition than music. The orchestra sat to the right of the performers, while there were a couple of chairs herded together in the far corner for a tiny audience. I felt a bit embarrassed that I had invited my family to come see the production.
If you’re looking for that glamorous opera feeling, this is not the right program. Considering sticker price is almost €5000, I would have expected more.
Well… that depends. For me, it was worth the money, but mostly because I hadn’t done anything like this before, I got a partial scholarship and because I was willing to pay teachers separately for extra classes. I learned a lot and had lots of fun experiences. But I don’t think I would ever go there again, and I would not pay the full price to go there.
After I published this article, I got lots of comments from fellow students. Some of them were generous enough to let me share their opinions here.
I’d have mentioned the amount of commuting you have to do between rehearsals and classes/coachings. But overall, I think it’s too generous to BOA, to be honest. The thing is a scam. I felt so bad for the kids who paid €5000 to be triple cast as the third genie or something. And members of staff sexually propositioned people on the course after they’d finished their final show. I’ve told so many people not to do it.- Anonymous
Honestly, I think you covered everything very well — the only thing I would maybe add was that we weren’t really in “Berlin” we were very much on the outskirts of the city and had to take public transit for like 45 mins to each location, which made it hard to be able to participate in everything, to be honest.- Charlotte Forknall
I think what we received as participants in the programme was completely unacceptable. If I hadn’t received scholarship from BOA and from another source, I would probably be fighting to get a refund. I’ve done other summer programmes before and this was easily the worst, and cannot even be compared because the standard is so low. If anyone were to ask me about BOA, I would without hesitation tell them it’s a scam. - Anonymous
1000% agree with everything you said. The only reason I do it, is it’s the cheapest conducting program that includes opera. - Anonymous
I totally agree with each and every word. We as singers are so desperate to sing and do our job, that sometimes we don’t ask ourselves questions like: ‘Did I pay too much and get too little?’ This whole industry is telling us to be happy and grateful, and not to advocate for ourselves. But I think it’s important to not only be positive. Especially if you’re a woman and you’re a bit angry, people call you a bitch. But it’s not a bitchy quality, it’s a human quality to protect yourself and stay with the truth. I think it’s really important to speak about, if we want this business work for everybody, and not just for money.- Katsia Kaya

You’ve probably heard of Elon Musk. You’ve definitely heard of Berlin. What I didn’t know before moving here two years ago is that it’s not just Germany’s capital — it’s also Europe’s techno capital, home to some of the most famous clubs in the world. One of them, Berghain, is a ten-minute walk from my apartment. Yes, that Berghain — the one that supposedly denied entry to Elon Musk. Now, it all makes sense. And that also tells you everything you need to know about this place.
Berlin is a story.
Berlin is many things.
For many Europeans, Berlin is an escape — from old values, expectations, responsibilities. It’s a weekend escape, a semester-long detour, a soft rebellion. You drink, you party, you feel unglued.
Berlin is an open air museum of war, destruction; but also of freedom and choice. Berlin has transcended its strictly geographical boundaries, and has transformed into more of a lifestyle.
Clothes — black; chains, nets.
Smell — urine, tabacco, weed.
Drink — beer or weinschorle.
State of mind — sad or happy.
Free time — nature, parks, rivers, lakes, nudist beaches, biking.
Money spent — on rent; in small cafes, flee markets, secondhand shops.

Fancy taking on a fast, flat World Major Marathon where world records are made? Here’s what you can expect if you’re thinking about running the Berlin Marathon!
The Berlin Marathon is one of the six Abbott World Major Marathons and is the fastest of them all. With only 285ft (87m) of elevation gain it’s not surprising Eliud Kipchoge ran world records here in 2018 and 2021, clocking a massive 2:01:09 at the latter.
So if you’re thinking about taking on a race that’s renowned for producing PBs, here’s what you can expect from running the Berlin Marathon.
Berlin Marathon sends lots of comms, but many were only in German. Yes, yes, I know it’s a race in Germany, but I’d signed up in English, selected my communication preference as ‘English’ so I didn’t understand why I was getting emails in German.
The pre-race programme was terrible — one of those useless digital e-books that was impossible to flip through a single page when using a mobile phone. And as the first half was in German (again, no issues with that) and second half in English, it was almost impossible to easily find the details you were looking for. Even a pdf would’ve been a big improvement on this, but for anyone with digital accessibility needs it would’ve been virtually impossible to find any information.
It was disappointing.
The Berlin Marathon Expo took place at Tempelhof Airport to the south of the city, an easy ride there on the U-bahn (which was free to ride for marathon runners during the whole time the Expo was open and on race day).
I arrived about 08:00 so I could take part in the Generali Berlin Marathon Shakeout Run. It was free to enter and anyone could attend, so if you were with family or friends (and they were happy running about 6k!) everyone could run (althought from 2023, the shakeout run has moved back to its usual spot at the Olympic Stadium, starting at 09:30).
It was very relaxed, I’d highly recommend taking part.
The Expo itself was inside several old airport hangars. It had quite an old-skool, Cold War-era vibe to it, which just added to the atmosphere of running in Berlin.
To enter, I had to show my race card (I’d added mine to my iPhone so it was quick and easy) and photographic ID, then they heat-sealed a wrist band to my wrist. I was told I needed to keep this on until after the race, but very frankly after the Expo, no-one asked for it — my race bib was enough. That said, I wouldn’t tamper with it, just in case… even though I had to cut mine off as there was no way it’d come loose by itself!
Race bib pickup was at the very back of the Expo and once there was quick and easy. If you’d bought a finisher’s t-shirt, you had to pick that up at another counter, where you had to go outside, join a queue, then come back inside the hangar. It again was quick, but not very intuitive.
Adidas had loads of official gear for sale, so if you liked the Berlin Marathon merchandise you could load up before you left.
My family had come with me to Berlin so I’d signed the kids up to do the kids’ races taking place on the Saturday. The first was the Bambini Run for my 5 year-old, which also took place at Tempelhof.
It was pretty congested getting the kids to the start line and they didn’t allow parents through for our age category (parents could accompany the 0–2 year olds and 3–4 year olds, but not the 5–6 year olds onwards). I was a concerned my Little Girl would freak out being by herself — especially as most of the announcements were only in German — but she was fine, the marshals were great at herding the kids around and she finished with a beaming smile on her face!
Her run was only about 500m, but it was enough so she felt like she had taken part.
On the Saturday afternoon, there was a Mini-Marathon for older kids, starting at Potsdamer Platz. There was very little information about it online — and nothing in English — so I’d emailed the organisers and asked how I could sign up my son and they were very quick to get back to me with a link and a code.
Apparently the Mini-Marathon — which covers the last 4.195km of the main Berlin Marathon route — is a big schools event, with around 10,000 schoolchildren from all over Germany participating. We had a bit of a nightmare trying to pickup my son’s race bib as apparently pickup at the Expo had ended on the Thursday and when we got there on Saturday, no-one at SCC (the event organiser) knew what was happening. We eventually found the bib pickup area but it was closed down.
So we headed to the start line in Potsdamer Platz and asked SCC there, and got Little Man’s bib in about 60 seconds — very easy! Although by this point they only had large finisher’s t-shirts left, so he’s got a good few years to grow into it!
He absolutely loved the race, it was by far the largest he’d participated in and he even got to run through the Brandenburg Gate before I did!
Collecting him afterwards was hugely stressful, however. There was no clear signage on where to go — all the parents headed into the Berlin Marathon finisher’s area but the actual end of the Mini-Marathon was further down the road. There were also two exits, so we were freaking out a bit as we didn’t anticipate that so had no idea where Little Man would emerge. I took one exit and my wife took the other, and thankfully I found him pretty quickly.
So from his perspective, the Mini-Marathon was awesome… I’m so happy he enjoyed it but as a parent it was a massive stress from start to finish.
On Marathon Day itself, getting to the start line of the Berlin Marathon was one of the easiest experiences I’ve ever had.
No need to get up in the middle of the night to catch a ferry to Staten Island like you do when running the New York Marathon, or jumping on a bus from pretty much the finish line to the start if you run the Athens Authentic Marathon or Boston Marathon.
Berlin Marathon starts in Tiergarten near the Reichstag and travel by U-bahn and S-bahn is free, with the trains run every few minutes.
There’s not much there at the start village of the Berlin Marathon.
I only recall massive queues for toilets (until the men discovered they had outdoor urinals). There were also many bag drop areas, which you could walk up to and drop-off without queuing.
Before entering my corral, I found a small piece of ground to run some warm-up loops, then saw a team mate from my running club so we headed into the corrals together.
There are no toilets in the corrals, but there are more toilets and urinals just before you enter. And if you’re tempted to go in the bushes you’ll be out of luck — literally everywhere was fenced off, so it was either go in the toilets/ urinals or not at all.
Berlin Marathon is a loop, starting and finishing in Tiergarten in the city centre.
You start in the park just beyond the Reichstag parliament building and head west past Victory Monument before turning right and looping round Tiergarten and into Mitte.
There are a couple of small bridges over the Spree but you’ll barely feel them. The first ‘uphill’ segment is around Mile 4, with an elevation gain of +25ft (7.6m). There’s another +22ft (6.7m) segment in Mile 6, then the course is virtually flat until Mile 19 when there’s a -26ft (7.9m) segment and another downhill -24ft (7.3m) segment in Mile 21.
So bottom line is, you’re not really going to feel any of the elevation gain, but there are a couple of nice (but short!) downhill sections later in the race.
The Berlin Marathon begins to draw to a close running through Potsdamer Platz, where the crowds become thronging again. Support is great along the entire marathon course, and even though for 90% of the race it’s thin, the crowd gives off a welcoming vibe.
Lots of families were out supporting, with dozens of kids looking for high-fives, which was really motivating. Berlin Marathon also prints your name on your bib, and even though my name is difficult for non-English speakers to pronounce I had more personal shout-outs running the Berlin Marathon than any other race. You really feel a close connection with the crowd.
The final stretch of the Berlin Marathon has you running through the famous Brandenburg Gate and past the Reichstag to the finish line. But as the Brandenburg Gate is still a good 400m from the finish line, it’s prudent to hold off that sprint finish until you get a little closer!
Water and aid stations are plentiful along the course, the first set are at the 5k mark and then every 2.5k afterwards. Just watch out for the brown liquid — it’s cold, sweet tea, so not to everyone’s liking!
Eliud Kipchoge may have ran a new world record that day, but I knew I wasn’t going to PB at the Berlin Marathon.
I’d had a terrible training block over the summer with two consecutive injuries that put me out for five weeks, then two weeks before the Berlin Marathon I caught COVID-19.
I also had to think about running the Chicago Marathon two weeks later, so for me the Berlin Marathon was going to be an exercise in discipline.
I decided to try to run negative splits for the first time at this distance, running the first 20 miles between 7:20 and 7:40 min/ mile, then seeing what I could give for the last 10k.
I managed to clock my first 5 miles at an average pace of 7:35 mins/ mile, then upped it to 7:20 mins/ mile up to Mile 20. I felt surprisingly good at this point, so cracked on to average 6:50 mins/ mile for the last 10k, with a sprint finish peaking at 4:59 mins/ mile at the end.
Without any hills or other notable terrain to contend with — unlike the monster hill in the middle of the Athens Authentic Marathon or the ups and downs of the New York Marathon over the many bridges — Berlin Marathon lets you focus on what pace you’d like to run to achieve your goal.
I can see why it’s so fast!
The Chicago Marathon may be flatter, but Chicago suffers from poor GPS coverage through The Loop, which makes it hard to know exactly how fast you’re going at the start and the halfway point, plus all those 90-degree bends mean you slow down at every corner.
Berlin Marathon, on the other hand, just flows, and bar one sharp turn just before Mile 3 when the two lanes of runners merge, the rest was easy going.
Post-race was excellent!
There was a massive positive vibe as Kipchoge had just ran a new world record, then the sun started to peep out. It had been a comfortable 12C (54F) for the race, so the timing (for me at least) was perfect.
You get your medal pretty much right after you finish, then water and a few other bits and pieces. It’s about a 1km walk to the end of the finish area, where it’s extremely important NOT to miss the Erdinger tents giving out their Alkoholfrei beer!
I headed to the grassed area in front of the Reichstag and sat on my poncho, drinking in the sun and my ice cold beer. I could’ve stayed there much longer, but besides the Erdinger tents there wasn’t much else going on. So after half an hour to chill, I headed back to the U-bahn station and my hotel for a well-earned bath.
I really, really enjoyed running the Berlin Marathon.
Even though the organisation wasn’t always been plain sailing up until race day, the Berlin Marathon itself was superb.
The atmosphere was relaxed, the support had a real warmth to it and the course lets you concentrate on your race.
One thing I will say about the Berlin Marathon is that it’s hard to notice anything specific about many of the areas you run through as they all kinda blend into one. Sure, the downtown area around Potsdamer Platz had a unique vibe to it, but bar the final mile through the Brandenburg Gate I had no idea where in the city I was at any given time. For sure that’s mostly on me for not being very familiar with Berlin, but I didn’t have the same issues when running the New York Marathon or running the Chicago Marathon, where it’s very clear when you move from one borough or neighbourhood to another.
This isn’t really a criticism, just an observation, and it certainly hasn’t put me off wanting to run the Berlin Marathon again.
As one of the six Abbott World Major Marathons, Berlin Marathon always sells out every year. So if you’re thinking about entering, you’ll need to be fast!
Odds through the lottery are decent — I got in on my first attempt — and it opens right after the race finishes, so one year ahead. Time qualifiers need to meet a pretty tough standard — a sub-2:45 for men aged 44 and under and a sub-3:00 for women in the same age bracket.
But if you’re looking for a marathon PB on a fast, flat course with amazing support, give running the Berlin Marathon a go!

A hundred years ago, Berlin was among the biggest cities in the world as its population rapidly grew from 2 to 4,5 million. Just imagine the demand for new housing at that time! Eventually, the city became a testing ground for architectors’ creativity and social experiments.
Passionate about the ideas of affordable mass housing, modernists were trying to make utopia come true — create cheap, standard, and, if possible, lovely houses. Not to mention, it was also a time of the Nazi’s rise to power. Nowadays, pretty small apartments and compact blocks are concealed by colored plaster, original door patterns, and manicured lawns. I’m sure that living in these houses may feel totally different from the careless meditation of a passerby. We are privileged to observe modernist estates from a distance of decades and draw our own conclusions.
This piece should have started with a bird’s-eye view of the horseshoe-shaped building, but let’s leave it to the birds. City explorers like you and me, not aided by drones or helicopters, see this site differently. When I came, the frost was gleaming on the grass in shadows, and the sun shone gently through a gap between “horseshoe” edges.
The Horseshoe Colony is a complex of townhouses and 3-story blocks of flats, and the central one — as you might have guessed — is curved like a horseshoe. A humble memorial stone at the pond tells this estate was designed by Bruno Taut and built between 1925 and 1933.
I was lucky enough to visit the Horseshoe Colony twice, at dawn and dusk, although it took me an hour to reach Britz, a part of the Neukölln district. As I left the metro, sunlit rosy-and-tartare houses with fiery doors popped up. At first, I was walking past them pretty fast, not realizing they were also part of the architectural ensemble — not just the shaped block.
I didn’t expect such a burst of color either because the whole modernist architecture (and Bauhaus in particular) had always seemed minimalistic and monochrome to me before.
Although this estate appeared as affordable housing for rapidly growing Berlin, it was designed with privacy in mind, thus feeling neither fully urban nor entirely rural. In this densely populated area, you’ll notice a lot of hedged yards with lovely arbors, swings, braziers, beds of flowers, and other attributes of carefree leisure.
The Horseshoe Colony doesn’t look luxurious; however, it gives space for individuality and embodies a passion for detail. I spotted a dozen door variations. My favorite ones are the black-framed ones with colorful rectangles in the middle. You can hardly find the same building color and door pattern combination twice.
But let’s turn back to the horseshoe building for a while. What amazed me the most about it was the optical effect of using sky-blue paint. Loggias look like holes in the building, and you can pretend to see the sky through them. As a result, this pretty massive building doesn’t feel overwhelming.
I noticed something about color that would also be relevant to other housing estates in this article. So, color is probably, the cheapest way to convey style, whereas columns or sculptures require a lot of work and material. It’s remarkable how modernists used the power of color, creating affordable yet original housing.
And the icing on the cake — a crimson wall, which turned out to be just the opposite side of those tartare houses I mentioned at the beginning. The setting sun cast its light on the wall, and the windows and balcony frames got lilac. After all this, I did realize why this settlement gained its status as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
I left the Horseshoe Colony after sunset. Black silhouettes emerged from the gloom but didn’t obstruct the sky view. If you stand on the stairs between the horseshoe edges, you’ll see magnificent scenery — the sun sets behind the building, people switch on the lamps, and this light reflects on the surface of the inner pond.
You can easily spot the White City from afar. Its white minimalist geometry stands out among yellowish houses nearby, and the five-story corner towers, like guardians, stand on both sides of the street, Aroser Allee. This housing estate in the district of Reinickendorf was built in 1928–1931 and turned out to be the last modernist quarter of the Weimar era.
The key role in the White City design belongs to Otto Rudolf Salvisberg. The central structure of this ensemble is like a sea resort hotel hovering above the street. I hate when parked cars spoil the picture, so I squatted in the middle of the boulevard and shot through a hole in the hedge, thus “hiding” the vehicles behind the bushes.
And how can an authentic German building be without a clock on its top?
Look! Another clock on the opposite side of the same building. I adore how classical modernist architects could create a style with the simplest geometric shapes: squares, circles, and rectangles. Although all the buildings generally look uniform, they have numerous unique parts — like these clocks.
Now, the doors. Doors are where modernist architects burst into various color combinations and rectangle compositions. Bright red and blue doors look incredibly vivid on the white facades.
Not to mention gorgeous blue windows along the staircase, an eye-catching stripe of volume on a flat facade.
A couple of paragraphs above, I mentioned so-called “towers,” higher parts of the corner buildings. So, I found five of them: two large towers on both sides of Aroser Allee and three narrow ones at the corner of Emmentaler Straße and Genfer Straße. They create a distinctive border with other buildings and hold the borders of this settlement.
I had visited the White City before chestnuts and poplars started blooming and one more time after trees went green. In spring, there is a short period when the sun is bright enough to make the walls sparkle, but the trees, still leafless, don’t obstruct the view. I was happy to enjoy this contrast between glaring facades and black trunks.
My final unexpected observation was red and blue bands underneath the roofs. On the one side of the street — blue; on the other side — red. Pre-war architects used to leave numerous unobvious details, aesthetic gifts for an attentive urban wanderer. By the way, White City also is UNESCO-protected and part of the Berlin modernism heritage.
Call me old-fashioned, but the number of floors in a residential building should be a one-digit number. For example, five. It seems compact enough and doesn’t turn a house into an ugly “anthill” similar to Soviet-time quarters in East Berlin. I decided to check the Carl Legien Settlement late in the evening, just before sunset.
This housing estate is located a 5-minute walk from the station Prenzlauer Berg in a district of the same name. Like many buildings displayed in this article, it appeared between 1928 and 1930 and was designed by Bruno Taut and Franz Hillinger.
Carl Legien estate is more uniform than, for instance, Horseshoe Colony, but belongs to UNESCO World Heritage, too. Its buildings don’t have varying characteristics like doors or facade colors. What fascinated me the most was the pinkish tint of the walls and, of course, red, yellow, and blue frames. Gazing at them, I immediately recalled paintings by Piet Mondrian.
And again, we observe the same simplicity and minimal expressive means — no columns, no sculptures, no molding. Rounded balconies and loggias are all facing the inner yard, and I guess it must create a feeling of privacy and own space for the dwellers.
Not many buildings in Berlin have bare brick facades. Brick is typical for factories and warehouses, but most residential estates are plastered and painted in pastel colors. However, the UNESCO World Heritage complex at Shiller Park stands out; the exposed concrete grid of balconies and ochre walls immediately drew my attention. It was designed by our good old friend Bruno Taut and constructed in 1924–1930.
I noticed a bright green car on the street between the historic houses and decided to look closer. Like the settlement itself, the car turned out to be also vintage. Citroën 2CV was a popular economy vehicle in the 1950s, and it fitted in here so well. The phrase on the car, “I fly bleifrei,” is a pun. In German, “bleifrei” means “lead-free” or “unleaded” (without added tetraethyl lead), which is a characteristic of petrol or paint. This motto and a cute duck mascot made me smile.
I noticed the streets where this estate stood were named after English cities — Bristolstraße, Dubliner Straße, Oxforer Straße, and Windsorer Straße. Later I understood why — in Google Maps, this area was called the English Quarter. Except for the car and street names, there were some other beautiful details, like a white doily in one of the windows.
The way how I instantly spot historically significant buildings in Berlin is by well-preserved wooden doors and windows. Look at these bold red frames. If the door is original, not a later replacement, the paint must have been scratched off and carefully repainted a dozen times. Paint sagging and overshooting on the glass look so heartwarming and naive when you can visualize the story behind it.
At the end of that walk, I was thinking about the balconies, which were half-glazed and half-opened. Large windows with white “skeletons” created the impression of porches. Maybe this is why so many local dwellers have beds of flowers, sun umbrellas, and chairs on their balconies. It’s a blessing when your home has a special place to meditate, sipping coffee to the sounds of birds’ songs.
It’s getting more challenging to impress you with Berlin modernism, but I’ll try. The ace up my sleeve is this lovely settlement on the southeastern outskirts of Berlin. It was built a bit earlier than most estates introduced here, in 1913–1916, and the design belongs to — surprise! — Bruno Taut.
While walking and taking pictures, I felt uncomfortable — like an obnoxious intruder or a guy chewing popcorn and slurping beer at the museum. Fortunately, there is little chance you disturb someone at 6 a.m. on Saturday because people (except for me though) prefer to bask in bed a bit longer. But my weird pleasure is to stay one-on-one with architecture and avoid city dwellers casting suspicious glances at me.
This settlement is probably the richest in styles and colors and feels specially designed for vacationing. Not surprisingly, it’s called “Gartenstadt” (garden city) in German and belongs to UNESCO World Heritage.
All the buildings have two or three floors, bright wooden shutters, and terraces. Even though most houses are arranged in blocks, they don’t feel like dull clones.
On some doors, I saw eye-shaped stickers with a silhouette of a thief and a phrase in German, “Neighbours are watching.” I don’t know about you, folks, but to me, this is a typical village security system when people notice more than any video surveillance from highly urbanized districts.
So far, the “garden city” was primarily painted in warm colors: orange, red, and yellow; however, it has a winter-cold section, too. If I happened to choose my favorite building here, I’d choose this stunning blue villa. The tree, in the shade of which it stands, seems to be at least a century old, planted at the times of settlement construction.
Sorry, I cannot overcome a desire to show you the lovely doors of Falkenberg once again in detail. See how carefully a trellis (this white frame for supporting climbing plants) is covered with a sheet of glass. Residents’ needs might have changed over time, but they didn’t spoil the initial design with a massive overhang. And the red door below, besides being amazingly beautiful, has a sticker I’ve already told you about.
Did you think there was just one blue house in the garden city of Falkenberg? Here is another one. You can compare how differently the same tone looks in the sun and after the sunset. In the light, it is glossy, and in the gloom, it gets matte and soft like a gouache drawing.
It was pretty late when I headed back to the station, yet I couldn’t miss an opportunity to take one more picture. What a combination of a cold-blue sky and pavement and orange-warm lights and a bush.
I’m not overwhelming you with historical facts from Wikipedia, so you should have some energy left to cope with the last chapter. This so-called “Waldsiedlung” (forest settlement) is located in one of the most picturesque districts of Berlin, Zehlendorf. You cannot take a single photo here without capturing at least one pine.
All the previous modernist settlements were located 5–10 minutes from the nearest train stations, but this one surrounds the station with an unusual name, “Uncle Tom’s Hut.” These beautiful 2–3-story blocks of flats and townhouses were finished between 1926 and 1931. Could it happen without Bruno Taut? Of course, no, folks. And Taut was accompanied by fellow architects Hugo Häring and Otto Rudolf Salvisber, whom I mentioned many times in this and previous articles.
Onkel Toms Hütte, unfortunately, hasn’t been (yet?) honored with the status of UNESCO World Heritage and remains the only settlement in this article without this status. However, it doesn’t mean city authorities neglect its preservation. All the buildings look well-maintained and don’t have noticeable stains on their bright facades.
In childhood, my granny dressed me in not-so-new grey and brown stuff because she knew I’d be dirty by the end of the day. A residential building is something people “use” very often, and why the hell do you make it so bright? I admire the courage of architects who cared about the dwellers’ moods, too. It is much more pleasant to live in a place that also pleases your eyes than just a practical and robust apartment!
My poor German skills, though, were sufficient to interpret gorgeous letters on the building below. It must have been a hairdresser’s workplace, but now it looks unoccupied by any business.
The shadows were growing higher and getting longer. Time to return home and view all the photos taken that day…

This year, I was able to finally cross off a major dream of mine: visiting Europe for the first time! It was a dream come true to visit Germany and Italy, but Berlin in particular caught my attention in unexpected ways. I had the chance to stay with a close friend in Wilmersdorf, a neighborhood that offered me a fresh outlook on living in Berlin away from the tourist attractions. I spent 12 days learning about the city’s interesting history, lively markets, thriving food culture, and quirky retail spots from my travel companion and the kind Berliners I met along the way.
I was so affected by this experience that I was motivated to write this guide. In order for anyone considering a trip to Berlin to experience the history, culture, and distinct charm of this incredible city as I did.
Since the tours, I’ve realized that the reason Germans sometimes come out as aloof or uncaring might be directly related to their past. Deep wounds from World War II’s loss and the terror of Nazi Germany persist to this day. Through memorials, museums, and the Stolpersteine — brass “stumbling stones” commemorating Holocaust victims — Germany confronts its past head-on, admitting its collective guilt. It’s simple to see how this emotional burden, which hasn’t been resolved, might be inherited and cause a reserved, occasionally disconnected mannerism.
Berlin is well-known for its lively flea markets, each of which offers a distinctive blend of local culture, art, antiques, and vintage finds. These are a few of the more well-known ones:
Kreuzberg’s Markthalle Neun transforms into a street food paradise on Thursday nights that you won’t want to miss. I had the opportunity to try a variety of international cuisines while exploring the ancient hall, including fresh oysters, Venezuelan arepas, and Korean dumplings. It was more than just cuisine because of the vibrant ambiance, which was full of wonderful scents and welcoming sellers. It’s a must-see if you’re in Berlin on a Thursday!
I got the opportunity to go to Hosek Contemporary, a unique art and music venue situated on a Spree River boat. It was a bizarre experience to listen to experimental music there; the live sound, artwork, and soft boat swaying created a unique experience. This location is a must-see in Berlin’s art scene if you’re looking for something immersive and different.
For those interested in avant-garde music culture, other venues such as Sophiensaele, Quiet Cue, Radialsystem V, and Berghain are also worth seeing.

A city is nothing without its people. Yet a city is also a silent witness to the past. Walk any berlin street, day or night, and you feel the past. If you can see marks of the past in the cobblestones, then you can surely feel it in your bones.
I look for clues of the past in Berlin’s architecture. I’m always walking, looking upwards, often too much; Car horns warn me to watch where I walk.
Architecture shows us the present and the past. Tall columns that reach up high enough to make your neck ache. Designs that mix up a little of the Romans with the Greeks, Doric, ionic, Corinthian, Tuscan and Composite.
Northern European architecture favours smallness. Not tall columns reaching towards the heavens, but squat doorways, tiny windows that protect dwellers from winter weather. Country homes that are functional, workshops only big enough to roll a wooden cart into then load up with goods. That’s my imagination. Walking on Berlin cobblestones fires up the heart.

One day I found myself on a flight to Berlin, Germany. Berlin didn’t even rank within the top ten places to visit on my list but I had to go for work, so why not enjoy this obligatory adventure? I had heard that Berlin was moody and grungy, like the emo child of Europe except it’s not “just a phase”. I was prepared to be met with a lot of punk rock and broody, techno vibes but (as is custom when traveling) I discovered the unexpected.
I landed in the mid evening in Berlin and my colleagues and I were starving and excited to sample Berlin cuisine. Three of us were American and were humbly disappointed that many restaurants nearby were already closed — how inconvenient! It’s usually good to be humbled like this as an American abroad, it definitely enriches one’s character. We did manage to find — what else —but a McDonalds. At this moment, I was less than dazzled by Berlin’s seemingly inaccessible evening meal options but figured it could only get better from here.
In the days that followed, I found Berlin to be a fascinating albeit (at times) icy, bustling city of natives, expats and tourists with cool modern buildings and large boulevards. While the overtone of German austerity, order and efficiency was undeniable, there were surprising pockets of whimsy mixed in here and there.
My personal favorite site was the Brandenburg Gate. A stunning piece of architecture with a lot of history and easily one of the most recognizable landmarks of Berlin.
I also visited Checkpoint Charlie, which was historically the Berlin Wall crossing point. This was a quirky museum overflowing with objects large and small, significant to a major turning point in German history. Not too far from the Brandenburg Gate was the beautiful, lush state park called the Tiergarten. Dense with trees, I would describe the Tiergarten as “Central Park with European elegance” — definitely another favorite location.
While Berlin certainly had highlights of grunge, some parts were charming and even rather quirky with fun thrift stores, local farmer’s markets and the unexpected hipster-style cafe.
Before traveling to Berlin, I was looking forward to sampling famous local fare (currywurst and sauerkraut of course) but Berlin also had much to offer in terms of international cuisine, with a lot of Turkish influences. I made it a priority to sample at least one döner kebab (something I would describe as a cross between shawarma and a sub sandwich) and it did not disappoint. To date, one of the best breakfasts of my life (avocado toast, covered in sautéed mushrooms over thick, fresh bread) was at a highly aesthetic cafe called Kaffee Karamell Berlin. And when I finally got my fork into some local sauerkraut, I knew that I was ruined for any canned, store-bought variety…forever. At the end of my trip I discovered that Berlin was certainly more complex than I had originally imagined. Quirky, grungy, cool, refined, steeped in history yet unapologetically modern, a bit edgy with it’s soft sides as well. Snag your ticket to Berlin and see for yourself!

Everyone I know who visited Berlin came back saying the same thing:
“Berlin is a magical city.”
They weren’t lying. It’s hard to capture the essence of this place with just a few words, but there’s something really special happening here. Every block is teeming with energy and creativity. Walls are plastered with interesting graffiti and residential balconies are bursting with floral arrangements. Sidewalks are wide enough to accommodate outdoor seating for cafes and restaurants, pedestrians, and bikes all at once, and the streets are bustling with people at all hours.
The cultural atmosphere feels leisurely and less profit-driven, and people seem to be actively enjoying living and working in their city. There’s a sense of civic harmony here I haven’t experienced anywhere else. Most importantly, beer is suuuper cheap, sometimes cheaper than bottled water. It’s also legal to drink in public which makes it tempting to buy a drink for the road (any road). I was afraid I’d bankrupt myself on booze if I stayed any longer.
My German experience began before my plane touched down. The stewardesses on my flight were dressed like beer maidens and handing out free schnitzel and brews for Oktoberfest. A yodeling contest was held at the front of the plane moments later. I arrived in Berlin around 10pm and took a train to my hostel.
I spent the first half of the week touring the city together with some floor-mates from the U.K. We wandered Berlin’s deceptively large streets and hopping on and off public transportation (which had a pretty high learning curve) to visit public squares, churches, and landmarks. Luckily for me, my hostel-mates had a local friend who showed us some fantastic spots, like a rooftop bar called the Klunker Kranich that sat atop a seven-story parking structure and overlooked the city. The most memorable was a mind-blowing place night club called Sisyphos. Here’s my journal entry if you’ve got some time to kill.
On the days I wandered by myself, I joined random walking tours, ate at an African food collective that helped re-integrate refugees into Germany, and went to a bar where all the furniture was upside-down and attached to the ceiling. I visited the Holocaust Memorial at sundown and walked in silence between the large concrete blocks, thinking about the United States and the path we’re headed towards if we don’t remain proactive and vigilant of our bubbling fascism.
I walked around Templehoff Regional Park, an abandoned airfield with old hangars and dilapidated planes. It was a bit surreal seeing kids riding bikes and flying kites on airstrips where bombers used to take off. I strolled through Tiergarten, Berlin’s central park, on my last day. It was raining on and off, but when the sun finally came through, the trees shimmered like verdant jewels.
On my last night, I met up with five other travelers through the Couchsurfing app and we drank late into the morning, (which made for a very rough trek to the bus station a few hours later).
One week doesn’t feel like enough time to do Berlin justice, but I guess that gives me a reason to come back. I’ve got the rest of the world ahead of me and it felt like the right time to get going. I still feel a bit timid whenever I enter a new hostel or restaurant, especially when I can’t speak the language, but I’m slowing getting more comfortable with the discomfort. Getting by in a multi-cultural city like Berlin wasn’t too difficult, but I know the language barrier will only become more challenging as I travel east. At least I’ve got time to ease myself into it. My phone has been an invaluable companion, allowing me to book tickets and hostels in the same sitting and save maps for offline use. I purchased my first international SIM card today, but all of the instructions are in German. So I’ll have to figure that out at some point.
I’m writing you from a hostel in Dresden now, where I’ll be staying for at least the next few days. I’m waking up early tomorrow to visit one of Germany’s national parks. I’ve been craving some nature after being immersed in such rich urban environments for the past few days.
Thanks for taking the time to read this. I’ll be trying to post weekly, so shoot me a message if there’s something in these you’d like to hear/see more or less of in the future. Any feedback is deeply appreciated.
Until next time!

It’s been 5 months since we moved to Berlin; I’m still astonished we pulled it off as a family. Here are some things we did and learned along the way:
That’s it. I don’t mean to sound cheeky but it’s actually completely doable and only seems daunting in principle. Once you’re executing, you’re operating a checklist, it becomes all about unwavering project management. The biggest deal breaker for us was the school and it worked out rather well.
I’ve got a ton of early impressions and can only spew them out in random order:

Steeped in history, Berlin has been the capital city of the united Federal Republic of Germany since 1990. In that time, it has become one of the hippest and most vibrant urban centres in Europe — with a flourishing cultural scene, brilliant nightlife, and a plethora of bars, restaurants, shops and cafés, as well as green open spaces. Read on for a few insider tips on what to explore off the beaten track.
The loop route along the boundaries of former West-Berlin is also known as the Berlin Wall Trail (Mauerweg). The approximately 160 km (100 miles) loop road is accessible by bike, skates or on foot. The trail follows the former border that ran through and around West Berlin. It turned those parts of the city into an island surrounded by the former East Germany from 1961 until 1989.
Everyone is invited to enjoy all the sights along the road from forests, rivers and parks at the “outer parts” of the trail, as well as architecture and lively city atmosphere at the inner parts of the loop. Along the route there are information stands about historic events in the time of the Cold War and successful escapes. Fears as well as hopes of those fleeing former East Germany are described. But it also depicts personal stories and notes about the dead of the wall (known as Mauertote).
The Berlin Wall Trail combines history and being active in a very distinctive way. At the same time you can see how nature took back areas which used to be known as “death strips”, where people in East Berlin were prohibited to go.
Click here for more information on the Berlin Wall Trail
Berlin’s Wall Park (Mauerpark) that used to be a border strip, is the perfect place to go on a sunny Sunday afternoon. Check out the huge weekly flea market, which sells almost anything you can imagine, from vintage handbags to Soviet helmets. If you’re feeling particularly brave, you can also try out a Berlin tradition — outdoor karaoke! Organised by locals, Bear Pit Karaoke lets anyone turn up and have a go at serenading those relaxing in the park with their favourite song. Don’t be put off by the intimidating name, however — almost every singer, no matter how horrendous, is guaranteed a round of applause.

Formed of sections from the former Berlin Wall, the East Side Gallery is a permanent installation showcasing some spectacular examples of street art.

Tiergarten is the second biggest public park in Berlin and is located right in the city centre. Within walking distance to other famous Berlin sights like the Brandenburg Gate, the Victory Column or the Reichstag, home of the German Bundestag, the park is a refuge from the loud and busy city life. Tiergarten used to be the royal hunting ground in the 16th century. Nowadays you can walk among mature trees, classic sculptures, ponds and breathe fresh air in an area much more similar to a forest due to its massive size and bunch of trees.
Click here for more information on Tiergarten
Only a few years ago Tempelhofer Feld was an airfield. Used by the American Allies as an airport and army base until the 1990’s, Tempelhofer Feld is today the biggest park of the German capital. Since 2008 it has been used as a public park, where everyone is invited to spend their free time. Whether it is by bike, on roller skates or even flex-wing, you can get active in the designated areas. But you can also take your barbecue and have a nice BBQ with your loved ones around or meet people from all over the world. Note: there are almost no trees, because the aim to preserve the impression of an airfield does not allow the plantation of trees.

A former Cold War listening post, the spectacular Teufelsberg complex looks like something out of a science fiction movie, perched on an artificial mountain to the west of the city. Abandoned for almost twenty years, the site has since been reinvented as a creative space by Berlin artists and musicians. Whilst off-limits to the public due to the somewhat dilapidated state of some of its buildings, the Teufelsberg is open for official tours.

A striking courtyard complex made up of restaurants, shops, bars, cinemas, theatres and galleries, Hackesche Höfe is one of Berlin’s hidden gems. The striking Jugendstil (Art Nouveau) architecture makes for a gorgeous backdrop for a cocktail outside on a balmy evening. If the weather’s a little inclement, take in a film or a cabaret show.

Berlin’s Kreuzberg district is home to many people of Turkish heritage, so it’s no surprise that the riverside Turkish Market, which runs twice a week all year round, has so much on offer. Here you can find a wide range of delicious Turkish food and drink. It’s a particularly good place for fresh fruit and vegetables — go along to the very end to get the best deals.

Town twinnings between British and German cities play an important role in promoting cultural exchange. Berlin has been twinned with London since 2000.

I’ve been fascinated by the subway all my life. Maybe it’s the fact that there’s nothing outside the windows; that when sitting in a subway carriage one has no other choice than to focus on the other passengers – how they look, what they’re doing, what they’re reading – or, god forbid, oneself.
There’s also that unique feeling of descending into the bowels of a city and being propelled from one brightly-lit station to the next through dark, mysterious tunnels.
In Berlin, there is the additional sensation of stepping out of the present and directly into subterranean history, since the city’s U-Bahn and S-Bahn were both complicit in transporting border traffic between West Germany and the GDR.
The fact that the city was divided along apparently randomly-drawn borders meant that some of the U-Bahn lines from West Berlin actually travelled beneath East Berlin, though passengers were not able to leave the train until it reached West Berlin again. The stations those trains passed soon became known as ‘ghost stations’ amongst Berliners – dimly lit stops where armed East German border guards would peer at passengers through slits in bricked up huts.
Due to the geography of the boroughs of Wedding in the West and Mitte in the East, the U6 had, after the U8, the second highest number of ghost stations, namely the five stations from Schwartzkopfstraße to Stadtmitte. On a cold March day in a still snow-covered Berlin, I decided to ride the U6 to Friedrichstrasse. I wanted to get a feel for what the underground city may have looked and felt like during those Cold War days, and to simulate a journey from West to East, if only in my head.
I start right at the beginning of the U6, at Alt-Tegel, which opened as ‘Tegel’ station in 1958 as part of a northern extension of the U6, which had existed since 1923 as the North-South Line between Seestrasse and Tempelhof. In 1992, the station was renamed Alt-Tegel (Old Tegel). As it’s the end of the line, it comprises eight exits, and is an important feeder in summer for people visiting the nearby Tegeler See to explore its pleasure boats and beaches.
On this cold, winter day though, the area reminds me of the small, boring town in West Germany I grew up in: all 1980s plastic and concrete with sharp edges, a Commerzbank, and a C&A next to a café full of huddled, grey-haired pensioners.
GDR U-Bahn and S-Bahn. West Berlin does not exist on this map.
Borsigwerke, Holzhauser Straße, Otisstraße and Scharnweberstraße are the next stops on the line, and also part of the 1958-extension.
Due to the very high water table, the track was raised onto an embankment, meaning passengers can view the quintessential urban scenery: business parks, small estates, grey and brown houses from the 80s.
The only excitement for me is at Scharnweberstrasse, where one can see glimpses of the planes rolling along the runway of Tegel Airport.
Speaking of planes: Kurt-Schumacher-Platz must be the best place in Berlin for plane spotting. There’s something genuinely appealing about standing at the bus stop near the kebab stands and Chinese restaurants and watching the planes roar just 50 metres over your hand on their final approach to Tegel airport.
The locals, long used to the noise and the sight of planes with the landing gear extended, continue strolling and feeding the pidgeons without blinking. For visitors like me, it’s hard not to imagine the plane careening into the bus stop rather than the runway behind it.
From Kurt-Schumacher-Platz, the U-Bahn runs underground again, traveling through “wild” Wedding (formerly in the French occupation sector) along Afrikanische Straße (with the nearby Centre Culturel Français and its very own Eiffel Tower replica), Rehberge (the best stop to explore the Siedlung Schillerpark, a modernist housing estate and UNESCO World Heritage site), Seestraße and Leopoldplatz — a.k.a. the heart of Wedding, with its Brutalist town hall, Schinkel-designed church — and to Reinickendorfer Straße, the former ‘last stop in Berlin West’.
From 1961 on, when the wall was erected, trains from Reinickendorfer Strasse did not stop until Friedrichstrasse.The line was then called the C-line, and its trains would pass under the border and through Schwartzkopfstraße then Stadion der Weltjugend, Naturkundenmuseum then Nordbahnhof and Oranienburger Tor at a snail’s pace.
All the station exits were bricked up, and armed border guards or police patrolled the platforms vigilantly. There was barbed wire beneath the platform edge to prevent fugitives from crawling along the tracks, and even the emergency exists were blocked: the only way to leave when a train broke down was to walk along the tracks to the nearest western station.
On the surface, all references to these stations were removed; the GDR did not want to remind its citizens that there were trains rumbling in and out of the capitalist West right beneath their feet.

Today, nothing reminds passengers that these stations, now cheerfully painted in yellows and greens, had once been in another country – except maybe a vaguely claustrophobic atmosphere.
The stations seem smaller and more crowded than the ones further up the line, but that could admittedly be my imagination. The atmosphere doesn’t seem to affect the school classes alighting at Naturkundemuseum, nor the noisy group of Spanish tourists entering the carriage at Oranienburger Tor for the short hop to Friedrichstrasse.
Bahnhof Friedrichstrasse is one of the most important stations in Berlin history. Different to the other GDR ghost stations, it was transformed from a former central station for subway, commuter and regional trains into a major border crossing, and became a bottleneck where people from the capitalist west and from the workers’ and peasants’ state passed each other unseen.
The station’s facilities and the underground station were only accessible for passengers from the western sectors transferring here. West Berlin citizens could also avail of the border crossing and enter the GDR here, after passing through a labyrinthine maze of tunnels and walkways designed to prevent any direct contact with GDR-citizens.
East Berliners, on the other hand, could not enter the U- or S- Bahn – the only way to leave the GDR was to get on a long-distance train to West Germany. To do so, GDR citizens had to pass through the so-called ”Tränenpalast,” the palace of tears, a building on the square north of the station erected in 1962. The expression is derived from the tearful goodbyes that took place in front of the building, where family members with travel permits had to say farewell to their relatives.
After the fall of the wall, the blue glass pavilion of Friedrichstrasse became a cultural center for concerts and readings, and was eventually turned into the Tränenpalast museum in 2006, enabling visitors to relive the experience of officially crossing from the GDR to West Berlin.

BERLIN — Berlin is gritty and urbane, where techno music throbs against the graffitied walls of sex clubs and drag bars. The city is known for being progressive and tolerant — but hop on the S-Bahn to one of the last stations in the East and you’ve entered Marzahn.
This is the other Berlin.
Marzahn is tucked in the northeast corner of Berlin, a working class industrial region, dotted with high-rise flats dating from the Communist era. Far-right politics find fertile ground here. After the Berlin Wall fell, Marzahn became a hub for skinheads and swastikas in the 1990s, an area rife with nationalism and populism.
Today, Marzahn is a stronghold of the country’s most successful nationalist party, the Alternative for Germany or AfD. The party embraces a platform of familiar right-wing causes — anti-immigration, isolationism, anti-LGBTQ, anti-vaccine, antisemitism and climate change denial — which are part of the American political landscape as well. Like former U.S. President Donald Trump, some in the AfD have grudging admiration for Russian leader Vladimir Putin. They oppose supplying arms to Ukraine to defend itself against Moscow’s recent invasion.
Although AfD support slipped in the most recent elections last year, its formerly fringe politics are moving deeper into the mainstream —in Germany as abroad.
Jorn Geissler, treasurer of the Marzahn branch, is keen to explain himself and his views to American readers. He invited me into his office, projecting a voice that exuded his buoyant demeanor as he walked me through the local city hall. This German nationalist wore a pair of gray khakis and greeted me with vanilla wafers and black coffee.
“You are now leaving the politically correct sector,” reads a mousepad on a desk in the AfD Marzahn office. This is a party that trades inclusive policy and progress on human rights — or political correctness — for nationalist and anti-immigrant sentiment.
Of course, speaking to an American journalist, Geissler presented the polished rendition of the far-right faction, meticulously packaged as socially acceptable. Geissler wanted to make this remarkably clear.
“I’m not a Nazi and I’m not a racist,” said Geissler. “We hear so much about fascists and Nazis in Germany, in Berlin, in Marzahn, but I’ve never seen a Nazi.”
The AfD party was founded in 2013 by mainstream Christian Democrats, who wished to abolish the euro as Germany’s currency. It adopted a clear anti-immigration platform amid the influx of Muslim refugees in 2015, when the party’s popularity rose.
Supporters are primarily from the former Communist eastern part of the country, where the political divide today reflects a split along the former Iron Curtain. During the AfD’s peak in the 2017 election, only 11.1% of western German voters cast a vote for the AfD as compared to 22.5% in the eastern states, according to tracking carried out by the German publication FOCUS.
Right wing parties have made strong inroads in the former East Germany, a phenomenon attributed to high unemployment and loss of identity after the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989, what Germans call the Wende, which means ‘Turn.’
“The whole East lost its political orientation in 1989,” Geissler said. “The former parties collapsed and all people in East Germany had to orient in a new way because we had no strong connection with the existing parties.”
Upon its creation in 2013, the AfD did not meet the five percent threshold to elect members to the German parliament. Very quickly, however, party support skyrocketed due to its feisty social conservative politics and its opposition to an influx of asylum seekers from the Middle East and Africa.
In Marzahn, support in 2021 hovered around 16%, maintaining the right-leaning reputation of the neighborhood. In the 2017 national election, 20.6% of Marzahn voters chose the AfD in the first round of voting, the party’s peak year.
Geissler, a construction engineer, joined the far-right party in 2014, attracted to its nationalist stance against the euro. He came to appreciate the party’s disruptive politics, seeing it as the German counterpart to Trumpism.
“We are not controlled by the system,’’ he said.
Even as a young man, growing up in the Germany Democratic Republic, or East Germany, Geissler was the rebellious type, dissatisfied with the living conditions maintained by the ruling Communists.
The same goes for Jeannette Auricht, 62, a member of the Berlin Senate who as a child danced around her room to Michael Jackson and Earth, Wind & Fire on the radio. In all areas of Berlin, TV and radio channels were left unrestricted which also gave her and other East Berliners access to the American Forces Network, a U.S. Army-run radio channel that contributed to her rising angst over lack of freedoms in the East.
Auricht was arrested in her teen years for demonstrating against the Berlin Wall. Now, she represents the AfD in Berlin and says she has “learned to read between the lines” in German politics, meaning she has a long-standing mistrust of government.
As she pledges to hold onto her center-right stance, not all of her party co-members do the same, instead drifting further right.
The alternative ideology of the party has attracted many extremist members, prompting the German courts in March 2021 uphold the government-declared designation of the AfD as a “suspicious entity,” which makes it legal to monitor groups who may be engaging in anti-constitutional activities.
Germany’s attempt to put the AfD under surveillance for extremism does not phase Auricht, who said she does not fear wiretapping because she has nothing to hide.
“I’m not planning a revolution,” she said. “Criticizing the government is a job you have to do and that is nothing against the country or the democratic ways.”
Within the party, leaders try to push out extremists by researching whether they have a racist or fascist history, Geissler said. However, German laws make it difficult to remove members from their parties and this proactive measure was only implemented a couple years into AfD’s existence, he said.
So, extremists do still exist here. And while the party is currently split between center-right and far-right directions, the far-right fringe casts a dark shadow on the reputation of the party.
In late 2020, former AfD party official Christian Lueth was recorded saying that to allow more migrants into Germany would be better for the party because it would attract more membership. As for the immigrants, he said, they can “shoot them all afterwards.”
“Or gas them, whichever you like. I don’t care either way,” the Lueth was quoted as saying.
Geissler said that other political parties in the governing coalition fight against the AfD because of some outspoken extremists, and he also blames the media for misrepresenting the party, due to what he considers a journalistic lean to the left.
He also points out that most party officials are beginners in the political scene.
“AfD members are mostly newbies,” Geissler said. “Most people have no political experience compared to other political parties. And you have to go a long way to get to the top.”
The fringe is gaining ground not only in Germany but in other parts of Europe, where voters in countries like Hungary and Poland are also continuing to accept the far-right in their political mainstream. Despite the AfD’s drop in votes in Germany’s most recent parliamentary election, the nationalist movement is gaining traction among the general public.
“Far-right groups are starting to share straight-out white supremacist ideas that used to be unacceptable in ‘mainstream’ politics,” said Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the U.S.-based Global Project Against Hate and Extremism.
The AfD’s social platform places it far into the political edges with its subversive ideology on human rights, she says, adding that its populist platform reflects the shifting political climate in Germany.
“There is a hard move to the right built mostly on anti-immigrant positions, a simultaneous collapse of the left, and a scramble at the center to keep the fringe out,” Beirich said.
Far-right anti-immigration sentiment is the most obvious example of social conservatism that has the potential to turn dangerous — as it has on a few other occasions in the three decades since German reunification. The AfD platform pushes for strictly regulated borders, especially for Muslim migrants who “don’t take up German culture,” said Marzahn party treasurer Geissler.
He says there is a stronger opposition to Muslim refugees than to Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian invasion because the new arrivals are of European descent and share Christian principles and other cultural norms.
“Migrants from Islamic countries are completely different from European countries like Ukraine,” Geissler said. “The culture is more similar, such as how to speak to women, and the family culture.”
The AfD is vocal about its anti-immigrant stance, but its antisemitism is more hidden. It does not support certain inclusive laws and regulations, such as those governing circumcision and animal slaughter rituals — some of which affect both Muslims and Jews, said Sigmount Koenigsberg, Commissioner Against Antisemitism at the Jewish Community of Berlin.
“The AfD is pretending to be pro-Jewish and pro-Israel,” Koenigsberg said. “It’s a fig leaf to hide their anti-Muslim sentiment. The far right parties are all antisemitic and that is clear.”
In July, the state of Brandenburg, outside Berlin, voted to amend its constitution to include stronger language banning discrimination against Jews, and specifically naming the Sinti and Roma diaspora for protection, codifying a commitment to fight antisemitism and antigypsyism.
The AfD was the only party to vote against it.
Beirich, of the global anti-hate project says the AfD’s populist rhetoric is now part of a global fabric, and she cites parallels between the German AfD and the American Republican Party.
“There’s a lot of political science work that’s been done about where the Republican party sits now and AfD is one of the parties that they most compare our GOP to nowadays,” Beirich said. “So it just shows how far the Republicans have moved to the right.”
She said the GOP and AfD dovetail most on their anti-immigrant positioning, seeking to deny benefits to migrants and cut back on numbers.
But while abortion laws are politically charged in the United States , especially after the Supreme Court reversed the Roe v. Wade right to abortion, the German right has maintained a more ambiguous stance.
“Every woman should make their own decision about their body,” said Auricht, who represents the AfD in Berlin. “With vaccinations too, you cannot say ‘my body my choice’ and then not hold that same principle with receiving the vaccine.”
Gun rights and regulation is also a hot topic for polarized America, and the AfD spokespeople cannot understand the American obsession with guns.
While the far-right narratives are similar worldwide — anti-lockdown fervor, dangerous conspiracy theories, and opposition to gay rights, just to name a few — the U.S. might be in more danger of veering into reactionary politics than Europe is, say analysts.
“There are some parallels with a hard shift to the right and openness by regular conservatives, especially here in the United States, to white supremacy and street movements,” American anti-extremism activist Beirich said. “I think the situation actually is worse here in the United States than it is in Germany.”
Because of Germany’s Nazi past, democracy is better protected by a state that is highly concerned with anti-democratic movements and hate speech, she said.
Beirich points out that far-right wing parties tend to be opportunistic, attaching themselves to crises such as the pandemic to keep their numbers up. If there is another social or economic crisis tomorrow, she said, party support would likely reflect the country’s circumstances.
“They are going to rise and fall in various ways depending on the mood of the country,” Beirich said. “The fringe is not disappearing like they did in previous eras. They seem to have a foothold now and are surviving.”
So the AfD may have lost some ground electorally, but its ideas have seeped into mainstream politics, strengthening the broader array of rightist parties.
Annemarie Schmidt, 74, a retired teacher from Marzahn who identifies herself as left-leaning, admits that she shares the AfD’s concerns over refugees, over rising housing and energy costs and the financial burdens of the war in Ukraine.
Schmidt thinks the climate is ripe for the AfD to do well in the future.
“Poor people here get nothing and the refugees get a lot, so the state makes it difficult for everyone to get along,” Schmidt said. “Though the AfD is taking advantage of these problems, they could be right on this topic. I wouldn’t vote for them, but during the next election the AfD will be very strong.”

By Annie Mark-Westfall
My column is due in two days, and I am staring into a panicked abyss. To inspire myself, I take a brisk walk while my husband puts the kids to bed. As I set out, I narrate and write in my head, badly. I get stuck on whether the word “brisk” is meant to describe the pace or the biting cold, and roll my eyes. For the duration of the walk, I will wrestle my thoughts, alternately trying to focus and to let my mind empty itself. Think. Don’t think. Think.
It gives me flashbacks to being a middle-schooler at a mall in middle America, standing in front of a large display of those 3-D hidden image posters. Those posters were the fake news of the 1990s, I am sure of it. My friends always claimed to see a floating sailboat, while I stood there dumbly.
“Just focus on one spot. Do you see it?”
“No, no! Don’t focus on anything, just let your vision get blurry. Do you see it now?”
My thoughts return to the present, where I am walking quickly in the freezing cold of January in Berlin, musing now on the cliché “waste not, want not.” For a year, I have been rolling this concept over in my head, wondering at the direction of causation. How a refrigerator full of leftovers does seem to reduce my appetite. Just don’t think, Annie.
I pause at the site of Albert Einstein’s old apartment building. It was destroyed in the war. In Berlin, we say “the war” the way New Yorkers say “the city” — as if there is only one. An etched sign marks the location. Berlin does not light its streets the way US cities do, and my neighborhood is particularly residential, so the sign is barely visible. We bring all our visitors here, so I know that it details, both in German and English, how Einstein used to host famous and talented guests. How they would spend evenings discussing the secrets of the universe and other urgent and important matters. Here, he wrote his theory of relativity. THINK, Annie!
The numbness is setting in. I forget how cold Berlin is, and should have worn a longer coat. It was almost 60 degrees when we were back in Ohio for the holidays. A friend who attends the climate negotiations texted me from Katowice, Poland in December, “We are all f*cked. Learn survival skills and move to higher ground.” Don’t think about that.
On the move again, I return to another friend’s idea to relaunch a Berlin salon, reminiscent of the ones run by Jewish women starting from the late 18thcentury. I am desperate for her to do this, and to include me. I think about my living room: its warmth from the radiator, inviting Persian rugs, and soft floor lamps. Our 12-foot ceilings and stained-glass windows. I am a Jewish woman. Can I make this happen? I chasten myself to sit back and stop it. It was not my idea. And my living room is not my own. It has French doors that connect to the kids’ room, and is perpetually strewn with baby dolls, mateless socks, child-size kitchen supplies.
Approaching home now, I recall how earlier in the evening, my 3-year-old asked, “How do you say ‘salad’ in Polish?” I vow that 2019 will be a year of delighting at these questions, rather than a sighed, “I don’t know, baby, eat your dinner.” Think.
I grab my computer and thaw out on the couch. I go online and am both relieved and dismayed to read that my column from last January similarly noted this soul-level exhaustion and lack of inspiration. Think, dammit!
Next to me on the couch is the latest unopened letter from Grandma Bea, her familiar cursive handwriting shaky across the envelope. I adore these letters and their everyday non-news. The essence of her character leaps off the page even as she claims she has nothing to write. This letter once again recounts her delight from a deer’s visit to her backyard bird feeder a few weeks ago. The event has found its way into three letters over the weeks, along with a detailed weather report. “My freezer is full and my fridge is stocked, so let it snow!” Grandma Bea knows how to warm a soul, even from across an ocean.
To start my year, I read When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi, the terminally ill brain surgeon on a quest for the meaning of life. His memoir intersperses quotes from literature and facts from neuroscience, and left me bereft when I turned the last page at the solitary hour of 2:00 am. Thinking now about Dr. Kalanithi’s calling as a doctor, and Grandma Bea’s notes on substituting gluten-free flour in her famous banana cake recipe, my breath catches at their hyper-focused sense of purpose.
Last summer, while I was still on maternity leave, I met up with a friend from college who was passing through Berlin. We sat in a café together, and as I shushed my baby, I hungrily asked questions about her life as a writer, feeling pangs of jealousy. Although I have meticulously crafted my dream life here in Berlin, I admittedly had hoped writing would play more of a role in my life than it currently does.
The conversation turned to one of her award-winning essays, on the topic of whales and something else brilliant and divergent like prison reform. The combination came to her after a professor urged her to return to a subject that she was “passionate about as a child.”
As I sit on my couch now, eight months later, trying again to conjure something that inspired me as a child, I hear the baby cry in the next room, followed by my husband’s voice, urgent, patient, frustrated, calm. I google “3-D image posters” and try to focus.

The P-51 Mustang is one of the most recognizable aircraft in military aviation history, and the story of “Berlin Express” illustrates just how far the Mustang’s legacy reaches.
The warbird’s story begins with American World War II aviator William B. “Bill” Overstreet who hailed from Clifton Forge, Virginia. After enlisting following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Overstreet trained with the U.S. Army Air Corps and was eventually deployed at Raydon Airfield in England. There he joined a squadron of the Eighth Air Force flying Republic P-47 Thunderbolts from RAF Leiston. As the AAF transition to the newer Mustang, Overstreet got his first opportunity to pilot a P-51 on January 30, 1944.
Overstreet named his first P-51, which he received in February 1944 “Southern Belle.” However, the aircraft was lost while being flown in combat by a different pilot a couple of weeks later, causing him to rethink the name. At the time, his squadron was assigned to bomber escort missions with the 357th fighter group regularly flying sorties to Germany, and thus the “Berlin Express” was born. All his subsequent planes went by the same moniker.
The “Berlin Express” P-51B Mustang achieved legendary status during an epic World War II dogfight in Paris in 1944, when Overstreet flew the aircraft under the Eiffel Tower in hot pursuit of a German fighter. Overstreet eventually downed the German Messerschmitt Bf 109G and eluded heavy enemy fire while escaping the battle with the “Berlin Express” intact. This victory was later immortalized by Len Krenzler in a painting of the “Berlin Express’” Eiffel Tower victory.
“Our man Bill was like Daredevil, the man without fear. Between flying so low and dodging enemy fire, he still shot a few bursts of his guns and hit the 109’s engine. In a last-ditch effort, the 109 flew under the Eiffel Tower hoping Overstreet would avoid it — NOPE!” recalled Brian Burnett II, Tour Guide at National Museum of the U.S. Air Force. “Bill followed him under the tower, and as the 109 pulled up, Bill sent him back down in flames. Afterwards, Bill went down to the river and followed it, barely above water level. Under the cover of the structures on either side, he made his way out of the city and back to base,” continued Burnett.
Today, the restored Mustang “Berlin Express” is based on the remains of the P-51B 43–24837. This Mustang flew with the 9th Air Force’s 363rd Fighter Group out of RAF Staplehurst in Kent, England. It crashed in Beckley on June 10, 1944, after the pilot was forced to bail out during a training exercise. Sporting a “Malcolm Hood” canopy and wearing the markings for “Berlin Express,” its paint scheme models the 357th Fighter Group Mustang that Overstreet made famous.
The modern day “Berlin Express” also made a historic transatlantic flight from the U.S. to England with U.S. Air Force Heritage Flight alumnus Lee Lauderback in the cockpit, following the same route it took in 1942 as part of the military troop buildup in the United Kingdom during WWII. The four-day, 5,470-mile journey began June 28, 2017, in Texas and culminated with its landing at Duxford Airfield in England on July 4.
Nearly 80 years after its original landmark moment, the “Berlin Express” will take to the skies with the Horsemen Flight Team in honor of the Italian Air Force’s centennial celebrations in Rome from June 16–18.
Dan Friedkin, who owns “Berlin Express,” will fly the historic aircraft and perform in the Pratica di Mare Air Show on the right wing alongside his longtime Horsemen Flight Teammates Jim Beasley, Jr. and Ed Shipley.
“The ‘Berlin Express’ is an iconic aircraft that symbolizes a defining period in the history of aerial combat,” said Dan Friedkin, chairman and CEO of The Friedkin Group, Horsemen Flight Team member and AS Roma football club president and owner. “It’s an honor to fly in the Pratica di Mare Air Show as we pay homage to the brave men and women who have shaped the course of military aviation. We’re excited to offer people around the world the chance to celebrate Aeronautica Militare’s memorable history and look forward to flying our routine for the first time in Rome, a city that holds a special place in my heart.”

Berlin has become one of the most interesting and exciting cities in Europe to visit. You can go back in history to a church from 123o A.D., to the more recent history of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the ever-changing city and rejuvenating neighborhoods. Berlin is a terrific city from a runner’s perspective, but it takes some planning because it is big and sprawling. You can run almost anywhere in Berlin — the sidewalks are wide and there is an unbelievable network of bike paths (but note they really are for bikes…).
From the city’s center, there are wonderful runs around some of the most important sites and monuments, along the Spree River, and into some wonderful parks, notably the Tiergarten and Volkspark. Just outside the city, highlights include the Grunewald Forest, Spandauer Forest, Tegeler Forst, and some wonderful parks for running near the convention center and airport. If you have the time, hop on a train and go to Potsdam and run in on of their wonderful parks, including our famous ‘Palace Run’.
Berlin is very spread out — about 5x the size of Paris, and distances are big. So, best to plan your runs and where to stay, and use the
fabulous transportation system with extensive subway and rail (U-Bahn and S-Bahn), and bus lines. This allows you to do a run one way and hop the U-bahn back!
Topographically, the city is fairly flat. For some hills, go to Volkspark Friedrichshain.
Berlin climate is typical of continental Europe. Winters are cool but not frigid and there is rarely persistent snow or ice. Summers can be warm and humid but not hot, with lovely long days. Rain is plentiful and os spread throughout the year.
14 miles of paths. Start: Brandenburg Gate. MAPNice add-on: Schlosspark Charlottenburg, ~2 miles west. Baroque castle surrounded by beautiful gardens, with paths along the River Spree. ~2 mile perimeter run and ~2 miles of paths.
The Tiergarten is the running capital of Berlin. A vast, 545 acre green space right in the city, Tiergarten is a running paradise for locals and visitors alike. There are about 14 miles of mainly gravel trails. A ‘straight’ option is to take the paths alongside Strasse des 17 Juni, past the Victory Column. There are several small lakes, lovely English Gardens, and paths along the Landwehrkanal and Spree River. Several of Berlin’s important landmarks are also part of this run: Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag building (seat of the German parliament), Bellevue Palace (German President’s residence), the Congress Hall, the Kanzleramt (Chancellor’s Office), some remnants of the Berlin Wall, and the Soviet War Memorial. Our embedded map shows a nice 7k tour of the park, courtesy of the Sheraton Grand Hotel, and our linked map shows the park’s entire trail system. There are maps well situated throughout the park, as well as WCs, water, and places for snacks or an after run beer.
2 miles or more. Start: Park. Access: Ubahn Richard-Wagner-Platz. MAP
The largest palace in Berlin and its lovely gardens are a popular tourist attraction. The park surrounding the palace makes for a lovely run, with grand paths approaching the palace and then along the water. The perimeter paths add to ~2 miles, with a couple more miles possible using all the interior paths. Closest subway access is Richard-Wagner-Platz or Sophie Charlotte Platz. A nice add-on is to run west along the Spree to Tiergarten, which is ~2 miles. Then you can run even more in the park, or along the water.
A great ‘long run’ option is to start at Brandenberg Gate, run through Tiergarten to the end, and then take the canal paths to Schlosspark Charlottenburg. Do a tour of the park and take the lovely tree-lined Schlosstrasse to the Sophie Charlotte Platz U-bahn for a return. About 7 miles one-way.
7.5 miles. Start: Alexanderplatz. MAP
This is a “jogging sightseeing” tour, incorporating some of the visitor highlights of Berlin. It’s about 7.5 miles, and you can jump on or off depending on whatever location is most convenient. Our route starts at the centrally located Alexanderplatz — a major transport and shopping center, and near the Berlin Congress Center. There are several examples of important German architecture and history in this area. Head west, running by the Aquarium, East Germany museum, and on the river, just across from the Museumsinsel — an island with several of Berlin’s important museums. Head south, passing by the Berlin opera and the Communications Museum, to Checkpoint Charlie. Pass by a the Topography of Terrors (actually a very serious exhibition of Nazi atrocities), up to the Potsdamer Platz — a square at the heart of the city’s history, and area with several concert halls and theaters. Head north, on the outskirts of Tiergarten to the Brandenberg Gate and German Parliament (Reichstag). The run concludes with a 2 mile jaunt east, through the University of Berlin, along Unter Den Linden, a wide street with many important buildings and museums (and tons of construction). Easy add-ons to this run are the paths of Tiergarten. See river paths, or west along the Kurfürstendamm.
This is an island right in the heart of Berlin that has several important museums and buildings. One can run on the island, and on paths along the river on either side, using the many pedestrian bridges to cross over. It is a good 3.5–4 miles on the paths around the island. Lots of ways to add on with river paths in area. Note: lots of construction in the area.
4.8 miles out and back along the Kurfürstendamm. Start: western end in Hallensee, or eastern end at Wittenbergplatz subway. MAP
This is Berlin’s most important commercial street, akin to the Champs Elysees. The Ku’damm, as it is called, has been the heart of west Berlin, lined with cafés, clubs, fashion stores, car dealerships (nice looking ones) and restaurants. It is pleasant to run along this wide road, especially in the morning before it’s too crowded. Also a good night running option. A there and back along the main sections of the road is ~4.8 miles. Good options to continue south of Kurfürstendamm into the Wilmersdorf area and lovely Volkspark. Also, the side streets off Kurfürstendamm are pleasant for running. An interesting site here the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church.
5 mile Loop w/shorter options. Start: S-Bahn Treptower park stop. MAPLonger option or separate run: Over bridge and along Spree River paths. MAP
Treptower Park is a good anchor point for running in east Berlin. It’s a bit of a ride from the city center but easy to get to via S-Bahn. The pleasant park has numerous paths that can be combined with a run along the Spree River. Our route starts at the S-Bahn station, through the Treptower Park trails and the Planterwald nature preserve. An important landmark is the Soviet War Memorial, which commemorates the 80,000 Soviet soldiers who were killed in the Battle of Berlin. Then loop back along the river paths, viewing remaining elements of the Spreepark amusement park, which operated from 1969–2001. Our run is 5 miles. For a nice add-on, cross the bridge over the river and run along Spree River paths of the Rummelsbergarea. It’s a This is mostly waterfront running, with some 7.5 miles RT possible. A 3.5 mile loop would be the finger out to Friedhof Alt-Stralau. Nearby is the massive Arena Berlin, and good running options along the Landwehr Canal trails.
6.25 mile loop. Start: U Hallesches Tor U-Bahn or other stops. MAP
This is another pleasant run in east Berlin, taking in the trails along the Landwehr Canal and Gorlitzer Park. The dirt path goes along the water here, with weeping willows and by beer gardens and restaurants, including Restaurant Boat van Loon. There are lots of restaurants and cafes along Maybach-Ufer or Paul-Lincke-Ufer. Our route includes a tour of Gorlitzer Park, with its big open fields and paths. This run can also be combined with Treptower Park, about 1 mile away. On Tuesdays and Fridays there is a wonderful Turkish market, which makes for a great post-run stop.
Many trail options. 3 lakes w/good perimeter paths. Access: Grunewald station (closest to the city), Nikolassee station (south end), or Wannsee station (closest to the beach)
At 7,000 acres, this is the largest park in Berlin. Nearly 100 miles of roads and trails. Some fairly rugged for running. Hard to proscribe a particular run since there are so many options. Some lakeside path perimeters include 2.5k around Grunewaldsee, 4k around Krumme Lake, and 8k around the Schlachtensee. One option is to do a long run, such as to the south end of Lake Schlachtensee, and then the S-Bahn Nikolassee station. A good hill option is to follow the trail called Teufelsberg, which is a 350-foot high mountain made out of rubble from WW2. Now that’s a one-of-a-kind ‘er.!
Prenzlauer Berg
A nice neighborhood for running. Combine this with Volkspark Friedrichshain. Lots of pleasant streets with cafes, parks, and playgrounds. Stay west of Prenzlauer Allee and east of Brunnenstrasse. Good streets include Kollwitzplatz and Kollwitzstraße.
The Wilmersdorf. Pretty neighborhood in the southwest part of the city. Volkspark Wilmersdorf is a lovely linear park that has a tour of 5–7k. Western end is along small ponds. Access via subway: Rathaus Schöneberg. Others nearby. MAP
Volkspark Rehberge. Nice park which, combined with Goethe Park to the southeast is nearly 300 acres or ~3 miles of pleasant biking and walking trails, and a nicely manicured memorial garden. ~4 miles west of the city and only 2 miles from Tegel aiport. Can be combined with Volkspark Jungfernheide, which is 1.5 miles east. Access: Rehberge metro.
Volkspark Jungfernheide.Nice 300 acre park with sporting facilities. Great option near Tegel airport.
Volkspark Friedrichshain. a path-packed melange of wooded rolling hills, grasslands, a Baroque fairy-tale fountain, and two good-sized hills made from surplus rubble. Berlin’s oldest park. Combine with nearby Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood. MAP
Spandauer Forest. Access: Spandaur U-Bahn. This is a huge park about 10 miles west of the center of Berlin. Closest public transport access is Spandauer, 1.5 miles from the park. It is nearly 4 miles from the southern end of the park to the northern end. There are tons of trails, with a good variety of woods, fields, and waterside paths. Good maps and loop options right off the parking lot at Schoenwalden Allee. A couple of highlights are to run along the stream paths one way, and then along the Brandenberg Wall path on the way back. If 10+ miles of running in this park isn’t enough, Tegeler Forest, with its more wooded, rugged trails, is just to the east. Spandauer Forest is a good running option near Berlin’s international airport.
Tegeler See. Access: U-Bahn Tegel. Just north of Tegel airport. Wonderful waterfront run along the Tegler See. Run across Borsigdamm towards Greenwichpromenade. Once past the mooring sites, you’ll reach the beautiful park of the Tegel Palace. Just past Villa Borsig via Schwarzer Weg, you’ll reach the Tegeler See and a beach & swimming site. This out and back is just over 4 miles, and can be combined with trails in the Tegeler Forst. MAP
6 miles RT. Start: Potsdam Train Station. MAP
About 15 miles from Berlin and an easy train ride, Potsdam is the capital of the German state of Brandenberg and was the residence of Prussian kings and the Kaiser until 1918. Running options here abound — there are wonderful palaces, paths along the Havel river, and wonderful parks. Our route highlights the famous castles and landmarks of Potsdam. Start at the train station and take Friedrich-Ebert-Straße to the northern city gate. Then take the park path to the main city gate, and into the Marlygarten and the main palace area. Use the northern end paths of the park, running by the Sanssouci (Frederick the Great) palace and gardens, the Orangery Palace and Botanical Gardens, and then along Hauptalee to the Neues Palace — enjoy the stairs! Return along the other area paths. There are great options to add on here: University of Potsdam, paths along the Havel river 2k just to the south, Babelesberg Park and several other wonderful parks, particularly to the east.
There is a huge selection of hotels in Berlin. The city is very spread out, so best to plan you stay near one of the routes and near a metro station. Recommendations:
Many of the running shoe companies have running stores in Berlin.
Runners Point. Has 5 stores in the Berlin area. They have a very centrally located store right on Kurfürstendamm A fast growing group run culture, with events nearly every day.
Nike Store. Near Tiergarten. Group runs.
Spreeläufer. Good running store in Prenzlauer Berg area.
Puma Store and Adidas Store, Potsdamer Platz, and a couple of other locations.
Group Runs
Mike’s Sight Running. Has wonderful running tours of Berlin.
SFB running club that meets every Saturday at 2 p.m. at the Siegessaule in the Tiergarten. Groups break up into all levels, from a slow 15-minute run to longer than an hour at a faster pace.
Runners Point and the Nike Run Club store also host group runs.
Running in Germany. Good site for info about marathons and other interesting races in Germany.
Berlin Marathon. September. One of the world’s three largest and best marathons. It has two gentle inclines at miles 17 and 21. Otherwise, it’s a fast, flat course through the whole city, and 800 years of history with a spectacular new finish, through the Brandenburg Gate.
Berliner Half-Marathon. April. Nearly 15,000 runners take a 13.1-mile sight-seeing tour of the city. Visit www.berlin-marathon.com.
Big 25 Berlin. May. An undulating urban route that starts and finishes at the Olympic Stadium. Great race, going back to 1981, through Berlin sites.
Berliner City Nacht. Summer. This summer evening 10-K starts at the Europa Center Mall and runs down the Ku’damm.

This is the Fernsehturm Berlin, the TV tower. Built in the late ’60s, at 1206 feet it is the tallest structure in Germany and third tallest in Europe.
During the Cold War, there were two independent Germanies:
Berlin was entirely within East Germany but was divided into sectors, the US, French, British, and Soviet. Westerners were limited in going to Berlin in the first place, but getting to East Berlin was a major hassle.
There were three roads from West Germany to Berlin, and they were carefully monitored. None of my friends even considered trying that drive. There was also a rail service from Frankfurt to Berlin, the Berlin Duty Train. Like the three highways, carefully planning and getting the required approvals was essential for the train.
However, I did get to East Berlin for a couple of days in 1981. Co-worker Bill (of the Vienna trip fame) and I got a military hop from our base in West Germany to Berlin. Melinda, one of our friends, had just been transferred there as a protocol officer. Clever of us to have a friend in that business, wasn’t it? She had arranged rooms for us in the huge hotel at Tempelhof airport.
Because the city was still occupied, you couldn’t just go into East Berlin and wander around. We had to wear our military uniforms so you know how much we stood out among the locals.
My first thought when we started sightseeing was how stern all the people looked. Not that they disliked us, but like they were not enjoying life there. We saw lots of rubble still there from the war years. Guess I’d have expected more repair work to have been done by then, 1981.
Checkpoint Charlie was and is still known as a major symbol of the Cold War so we wanted to see it. It was the only approved checkpoint, walking or driving, for foreigners and military personnel. (Sorry, my picture isn’t too good; couldn’t Photoshop it enough.)
This is me, in uniform, at the Brandenburg Gate in the Soviet zone. People and vehicles could use it freely until August 1961 when the Berlin Wall was built. The Wall enclosed the entire city, passing right by the west side of the gate. President Ronald Reagan gave his famous ‘Tear down this wall’ speech near the Gate in June 1987. As you may remember, the Wall was ended in December 1989.
Thanks again to Melinda; we got a tour of West Berlin, the Wall, and even into East Berlin just a bit. She’d arranged a helicopter tour for a visiting US Air Force general. You know biggies often get special treatment and opportunities.
Since the General’s aide was the only other passenger, Melinda asked the General to take two visiting USAF officers. He kindly agreed. I’d been in a helicopter before, even saw the Tucson home of a mafioso kingpin from one! This trip was unique, a matter of international law, I guess. Flying over the Wall into the Soviet Zone was a huge no-no. But the crew said they did it regularly, just a brief crossover, to maintain US rights!
Is this cheating? It’s me at the Berlin Wall from the good guy side, on a different trip.
Now, about that TV tower…
Like the Brandenburg Gate, it is one of the most prominent symbols of Berlin. When the sun shines (as it does once in a while in Germany) it reflects on the tower’s dome in the shape of a Greek cross, a symbol against the East German removal of crosses from churches during the Cold War!

I was back in Berlin last year after a long gap. The last time I was there I was lucky enough to attend an event the Business Design Summit. I can safely say that event changed the course of my work and heavily influenced the canvas card based approach we are using in IASA Global across the BTABOK and the IASA learning programs.
The event was pitched for visionary leaders, executives, entrepreneurs, and consultants (hard to know what I was then). It was an exciting point in time where a group of visionary thinkers were coming together to share their ideas, merge methods, find connections and co-design a new toolbox for business.
The pitch…
People improving todays businesses and building tomorrows need new, practical, strategies to deal with today’s brutal new business environment. A handful of visionary business thinkers, educators, authors, and world class entrepreneurs know this. Separately, that’ve been crafting a new business toolbox and playbook. What if all that knowledge, experience, and all those tools came together?
The people behind this event brought together strategy, innovation, entrepreneurship, design thinking, leadership, culture.
Yves Pigneur, Rita Gunther McGrath, Mark Johnson, Luke Hohmann, Dave Gray, David Sibbets, Henry Chesbrough, Alex Osterwalder, Stefano Mastrogiacomo, Lisa Kay Solomon, Steve Blank plus Patrick van de Pijl (apologies for the image quality the best the internet could provide).
Each of them had published books, academic papers and created toolkits to support businesses in what they described as a ‘brutal new business environment’. About ~300 people from all over the world arrived in Berlin hosted in the Classic Remise Berlin on 19th & 20th April 2013 a restored tram depot with displays of Classic cars.
We were crammed in, packed tables and a palpable energy. The focus was to discuss, explore, evolve a practical toolkit to do the jobs that we needed to do. These were new thinking tools their goal to improve the quality of thinking and elevate the level of conversation.
What resulted was 2 days and nights of playing with these tools and realising that each one was like a finding a magic potion. Mostly presented as 2D canvases e.g. Business Model Canvas. They were infinitely flexible and multi-dimensional they had depth, they could jump through time and let me play with different futures. They were also scalable and malleable they could be scaled up & down, twisted and repurposed to suit different contexts and problem spaces. They were light and could be created and abandoned (not like the document heavy worlds that are still pervasive). And lastly they were ‘mostly’ open source allowing both use and derivative works to be created, moving away from strictly proprietary works, frameworks and methods which presumed to have some secret sauce that imbued the creator with the mystical powers of transformation. Alex Osterwalder recently posted a reflection on the journey here.
I came away energised and excited about how these ideas could be used; our company was christened Business Model Adventures as we saw the opportunity to take people on creative adventures to discover new opportunities.
I’m an Architect, I saw the need for a toolchain to help me do the work I was doing better. I started searching, curating and integrating lightweight tools, canvases, cards, kits, games and methods into my practice. Where a tool didn’t exist I tried to fill a gap, overtime what I realised was that each tool fulfilled a need I had and fit into my practice.
If you want a great article on the modern architect read David Jones recent CIO.com piece on juggling architect identities and activities.
My own view has always been that an architect worth their salt is involved in…
Architecture got lost in standards, frameworks, methods, debates about “what is architecture?” and “what is an architect?”, trend chasing and surfing and lots and lots of documentation for us by us (write-only; no one reads). In hindsight it feels indulgent, self-interested, self-important and self-centred. I wasn’t above this, I did these things; I committed these sins so I feel the self-criticism is justified.
It feels like an eternity since I wrote this article about the impact of our approach to documentation. What the canvas methods offered was an opportunity to strip this back and rethink the work. To paraphrase Lisa K Solomon “conversation is the technology of architecture” the canvases became a language to design strategic conversations.
First the language — to design a strategic conversation, I think through what I need to understand and the destination we (‘conversations’ are sometimes but rarely solo) want to arrive at. Canvases can be used to clearly describe the flow of the conversation and the outcome of each piece is clear.
Second, the canvas provides a frame and a constraint for a part or the whole of the conversation. Take business model canvas as an example, it’s trying to capture the essence of a business model in 9 panels. It’s highly opinionated it doesn’t care about low level detail, it omits the environment it lives in. It asks the questions —
Third it provides a shared externalised focus for a conversation and a frame to build a shared mental model. One thing I think is underestimated is the effort it takes to create a model for anything with multiple elements in the human brain. The problem is amplified when I’ve got more than one person involved. Imagine 2 people have to create a mental model of the same elements at the same time in the same way. Without a frame and a common language this becomes impossible. The canvas creates a space for shared focus and understanding inside a constrained model. Now we can engage with the canvas physically and share a mental model.
I’ve found that the ability to point at something to bring attention to an element is critical; “let’s look at the customers” brings everyone into a collective focus. We can then navigate and build a narrative e.g. “what’s our relationship to this customer?”. We let the story unfold using the canvas as the guide.
Fourth the canvas method allows injecting prompts as questions to support facilitation and improve the repeatability and predictability of the process.
The work Lewis Curtis and others have done on question-based analysis (PBAAM Perspective Based Architecture Analysis Method) comes into focus as the questions become part of the tool.
Fifth canvases are composable and connectable each canvas regardless of it’s origin or choice of terminiology can ‘usually’ be mapped onto a metamodel e.g. ebmm, archimate. We then have a model elements with clear relationships, we begin to join the dots. See here on creating a metamodel from Ardoq.
Sixth canvases promote rapid prototyping and refactoring in lo-fi friendly ways. I don’t need much to get started, a printer is handy or online tools like miro, but anything works — napkin, paper, post-it, whiteboard and something to make a mark with a sharpie, pen, crayon. I can create, adapt, destroy and repeat; all of this can be done at speed. One thing we do in IASA Training is model a business in 12 minutes. I stole this from Alex Osterwalder he did it with an audience of about 500 people in pairs modelling their businesses with a 12 minute time limit.
Seventh, we build collective memories; the artefacts we create build a collective memory that all participants benefit from, the structure aids memory and recall while the outputs act as physical/digital reminders of the process that can be easily referred to.
Eighth, last but not least, number 8. The canvas method lends itself to VIVID Thinking approaches, Dan Roam in Blah, Blah, Blah , David Sibbets and the guys at Grove, Sunni Brown the doodle manifesto and last but by no means least Dave Gray. Their collective work in Visual Thinking, Graphic Facilitation, Workshop design and Facilitation (e.g. Gamestorming) has helped. Lest I forget Per Kristiansen and the guys in Lego Serious Play who extended the LSP method to support BMC and other canvas-based methods.
Of all of these factors the most powerful for me has been #8. The creativity that comes from these visual approaches is rocket fuel, this quite literally rewired my brain. I couldn’t look at a business without trying to model it with BMC; I couldn’t experience a journey without starting to model the customer experience on a journey map.
I’ve been involved in IASA and the development of the profession and practice of architecture for 20 years now, I first contacted Paul about setting up an IASA Chapter in Ireland in 2005, after 3 tries we got it up and running in 2008. I went through IASA Core training in 2010 in Stockholm with Andy Ruth. I became an instructor and delivered this program many times all over world. I then had the opportunity to participate in a redesign of the course which ultimately led to the canvas-based methods outlined in the BTABOK and last year the publication in Miro Universe of the canvases.
As with everything my thinking has evolved with my experience. I’ve spent since 2018 working in the health service in Ireland. The journey has been incredible, the experiences and the people likewise. We’ve battled through COVID, a major cyber attack, the Ukraine response, the development of Digital for Care a strategy for digital health in Ireland to 2030, the development of the HSE Health App, the procurement of a National Shared Care Record and many other side hustles. I’ve used, stretched, stressed and tested most of the methods in different contexts and in different ways. I’ve never been pure about this, I’ve remixed and riffed where necessary to fit the situation, culture and people.
Like everything many of the canvases/cards captured what was going on in my head at that point in time; me today would certainly argue with me 10 years ago. The BTABOK will be the place where these updates begin to emerge.
Where did the journey lead? I was solving my own problems and following my own curiosity first and foremost. The work has helped me and hopefully clients and colleagues I’ve worked with over the years overcome some formidable challenges. It’s been a busy few years in Health in Ireland and I haven’t had a lot of time to reflect on the journey too much.
One thing that happened last year that I haven’t had a chance to mark yet is that I became an IASA Fellow. I was attending a CAF Summit (Chief Architect Forum) event in Amsterdam.
In a ceremony in the Miro offices (thanks Grisha and the team in miro) in Amsterdam I became the 15th IASA Fellow.
If my impostor syndrome wasn’t strong enough, I look at the other fellows and I wonder. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting and talking to many of them through the years Grady Booch, Angela Yochem, Scott Whitmire, Daniel Akenine, Max Poliashenko, Eoin Woods and I’m grateful and humbled to have my name mentioned next to theirs. Years of conversations with so many friends and colleagues also helped shape my thinking.
Paul Preiss, Leo Peyton, David Jones, Dennis Mulder and other friends and colleagues who have been along for the ride were there to help me celebrate. This ended in a wonderful wander through Amsterdam with Leo reflecting on what I have to acknowledge as a major event in my career.
Three final thank yous to Paul Preiss who has been a friend, co-conspirator, confidante, collaborator none of this would have happened in the way it happened if Paul hadn’t started IASA 20+ years ago (thanks brother :), to the alptitude and Happy Valley gang Laurence, Carlos, Jack, Arno and the rest of the gang, our recent trip recharged me. Lastly to Orlaith my life and business partner who has helped, created, developed, listened, and otherwise dealt with Gar’s canvas obsession and the mess of paper, post-its, canvi, thanks Orlaith!
My handle on medium, twitter and elsewhere was always @aspiringarc. I always felt that this acted as a constant reminder of the correct mindset to maintain.
Always be aspiring!
There is no end to the learning, growth development and there is certainly no end to my optimism, curiosity and enthusiasm. Architecture is a team sport, a collaborative endeavour and most importantly in my head it’s always been a big game to play and an infinite game at that.
So this started as a trip down memory lane and it’s ending on a hopeful and grateful note of thanks to all who have shared their knowledge and helped me through my career and life, you know who you are…

Travel Date: Oct 25, 2022Trip Duration: 4 daysLocation: BerlinCountry: Germany
It was late October, and autumn had fully embraced Europe. The air was crisp, the leaves were golden, and I found myself in a refreshed state of mind after months of routine in the Netherlands. My last adventure had been to Belgium, and I felt the need for another break — a chance to both recharge and reconnect with a close friend living in Berlin. With that in mind, I booked a BlaBla car, a budget-friendly option, for the 7-hour drive. It was a journey shared with strangers, but the ride turned out to be quite enjoyable, with pleasant conversations and the excitement of traveling to a new place.
As we approached Berlin in the evening, my first glimpse of the city was the iconic Fernsehturm, the famous TV Tower. Bathed in the soft evening light, it loomed over the skyline like a symbol of Berlin’s complex past. Once a broadcasting tower and a proud symbol of Communist power, today it stands as one of the city’s most recognizable landmarks. My first impression of the city was a blend of awe and anticipation.
Eager to experience Berlin, I spent some time wandering the lively streets, soaking in the urban energy and the distinct buzz of the city. The streets were a blend of old and new, modern cafes and shops nestled between centuries-old buildings that told their own stories of Berlin’s history. Eventually, I made my way to my friend’s apartment. It had been years since we last saw each other, so catching up felt like a breath of fresh air. After settling in and relaxing for a bit, my friend decided it was time to introduce me to Berlin’s legendary nightlife. The city came alive after dark, and we hopped from one lively spot to another, enjoying the pulse of the city.
The next day, on the 26th of October, I had planned something a little more structured — a walking tour booked through GuruWalk. The morning air was chilly but refreshing, and I made it to the meeting point just in time. Our guide, knowledgeable and passionate, took us on a historical journey through Berlin’s war-torn past. One of the first stops was Checkpoint Charlie, the best-known crossing point between East and West Berlin during the Cold War. Standing there, I could almost feel the tension and uncertainty that must have hung in the air during those days of division.
As we moved on, we visited the site of Hitler’s final bunker, the very place where he spent the last moments of his life. It was a sobering experience, knowing that beneath the unassuming ground lay a chapter of history that shaped the world. The tour continued, and soon we found ourselves at the Brandenburg Gate, standing tall and proud. This grand monument, once a symbol of division, now stands for unity and peace. Under the unexpectedly warm autumn sun, I took a few photos, trying to capture the magnificence of the gate with its classical columns and rich history. After lingering there for a bit, basking in the sun, I met a traveler from the United States. We clicked immediately, and together, we decided to continue exploring.
Our next destination was the Konzerthaus Berlin, an elegant concert hall known for its neoclassical architecture. The grandeur of the place was awe-inspiring, and I could almost imagine the musical performances that must have filled the air with harmony and culture. We walked the historical streets, each corner revealing layers of Berlin’s rich and sometimes tumultuous past. Eventually, we found ourselves at Berlin Cathedral, a majestic structure that has stood since the 1800s. The cathedral was imposing, with its grand dome and intricate details. Inside, it houses a massive organ with 7,269 pipes, a royal tomb, and offers breathtaking views of the city from its dome. We admired the architecture and strolled through its quiet interior, feeling the weight of history within its walls.
By late afternoon, it was time for me to meet up with some old colleagues from a previous job. Around 5 p.m., I grabbed a quick bite and made my way to Alexanderplatz, one of Berlin’s busiest and most famous squares. We spent the next few hours at Museum Island, a tranquil spot surrounded by stunning museums, and it was the perfect place to catch up and relax. As evening fell, we headed to a cozy bar nearby, where we shared stories, laughed, and reminisced about old times. The hours slipped away effortlessly — there’s nothing quite like the ease of conversation with familiar faces after so long apart.
The next day, October 27th, my friend had some time off, and he suggested we visit Teufelsberg, a unique and slightly offbeat destination. It was once a U.S. listening station during the Cold War, perched atop an artificial hill made from the rubble of WWII. Today, it’s known for its panoramic views and vibrant street art. We hopped on a train and made our way through the city, the excitement of exploring something new bubbling between us. After getting off at the station, we hiked through the Grunewald Forest. The autumn colors were at their peak, and the forest was alive with shades of amber, gold, and crimson. It was a peaceful walk, and the beauty of the season made it all the more special.
Teufelsberg itself was a fascinating place. The structure, abandoned and worn by time, was now a canvas for street artists. The walls were covered in colorful, intricate graffiti, each piece telling its own story. We spent hours wandering around, taking in both the art and the history of the place. The view from the top was breathtaking, offering a sweeping panorama of the city and the surrounding forest. It felt like a hidden gem, a place that not every tourist would think to visit.
Before heading back, we grabbed some Indian snacks at a nearby spot. Later that evening, we decided to make a simple but delicious dinner at home — Aglio olio. My friend had perfected the recipe, and it turned out to be a delightful meal.
The following day was more relaxed. After a leisurely breakfast, my friend gave me a mini-tour of his apartment, which had a fantastic view of the street below and a spacious terrace perfect for parties. The weather continued to surprise us, warm and sunny, which is rare for October in Germany. I spent the day revisiting some of the places I had already seen, this time at my own pace. Walking through the streets with my earphones in, I listened to Rick Steeve’s videos., taking in more of the city’s history and architecture. There’s something deeply satisfying about exploring a city on your own, taking the time to absorb its energy and appreciate its stories.
That evening, my friend invited me to dinner at a fancy Greek restaurant. It was my first time trying Greek food, and the dishes were amazing — rich, flavorful, and hearty. We were joined by a friend of his who was Greek, which made the experience even better as he explained the origins and significance of each dish. After our meal, we took a final stroll through the streets of Berlin. The city had left a lasting impression on me, with its mix of history, culture, and modern vibrancy.
The next morning, I caught my bus back to the Netherlands, reflecting on the incredible experiences of the past few days. Berlin had been everything I hoped for and more — both a journey through history and a personal adventure that I wouldn’t soon forget.

On January 18th, I flew to the city I've been most looking forward to (so far) on my travel itinerary, and Berlin lived up to the hype.
Berlin has a sordid past, but the city has done an incredible job of being as transparent as possible about it. Unlike Madrid, which largely sweeps up its past under a rug, it is impossible to avoid being confronted with the harsh realities of all that has happened in Germany's capital.
Throughout the centre, signs provide a long look at the historical events that tore the city apart over and over again, but also showed how resilient the residents are. Black and white photos reinforce the ravages of war, white crosses honour those who died trying to cross into West Germany, and the path of where the wall stood leaves a jagged scar through the city.
I stayed in an Airbnb Prenzlauer Berg, a hipster neighbourhood in what was Eastern Berlin, brimming with cute restaurants serving vegan breakfasts and stores selling colourful clothing and handmade ceramics from local artists.
My apartment was a stone's throw from the Berlin Wall memorial along Bernhauer Strasse, which was surprisingly informative. For blocks, you follow the line of where the wall stood and read placards in German or French that explain what life was like for people on both sides of the border.
There are also screens where you can watch archival footage, which makes the experience so much more immersive. On the buildings along the walk, giant pictures throughout the forty years of horror show what the area looked like exactly where you were standing. Unfortunately, some residents along the strip fought against having their property cut by the memorial line of the wall. I can't imagine caring more about having a space for a bike rack surrounded by a fence than allowing the city to honour its past and all the people impacted by it. It seems selfish and shortsighted in my opinion.
I'll go through my museum excursions in my next post, but can I just rave about the restaurant scene in Berlin for a second? First of all, no other city I've traveled to in Europe has had as many fantastic vegan options. From fancy and pretentious to junk, it was all easy to find no matter what area I was in, and SO GOOD. It's tasty things like this that demonstrate why not all vegans are skinny. Guilty!

The future is already here — it’s just not very evenly distributed. Stories about cyberpunk becoming our modern reality.

I travel the world exploring high tech low life places. Most of these places are in Asia, but what about Europe? Wikipedia Cyberpunk page mentioned Sony Center in Berlin as an example of cyberpunk-influenced cityscape. Modern incarnations of cyberpunk are exact focus of this blog, so we’re going to Germany!
First place we’ll visit is Potsdamer Platz in Berlin’s central borough called Mitte.
This place is awesome and looks more like Manhattan than a German city.
Being a kid in late 90s I loved a TV show called “Total Recall 2070”. It was loosely based on Philip K. Dick works. Plots of most episodes are quite cheesy, but its futuristic atmosphere was so damn dark and sinister! And you know what? Potsdamer Platz looks and feels exactly like Total Recall 2070.
As I know, no cyberpunk books or movies are based in Berlin, but they definitely should!
Berlin is worth visiting just for Potsdamer Platz, but let’s proceed to the Sony Center, which is nearby.
It is easy to approach Sony Center from Potsdamer Platz, just go where all the neon lights are.
This area consists mostly of shopping malls, offices, restaurants. But who cares? For me it looks exactly like William Gibson’s 80s vision of the future.
Large shining dome reminds me of Highlander 2 movie. By the way, the movie was very much high tech and low life.
Offices on the sides of Sony Center looks super futuristic even without glowing neon lights.
The area of Sony Center and nearby office buildings is quite crowded and noisy. Walk couple of minutes westward and suddenly the streets become empty.
Approaching Tiergarten, Berlin’s central park. It is completely empty at 8pm.
Going to Unter den Linden street, which passes Mitte horizontally. Westernmost part of the street is a place of famous Brandenburg Gate and different government building.
But let’s go east, where Berlin looks more hi tech and noire.
Probably low life is not what you’ll find here, but central Berlin still has its dark vibe at night with techno clubs and dark cold streets.
Mitte reminds me both Manhattan and Moscow, but feels darker than each of them.
Speaking of Moscow, we’re approaching Alexanderplatz which looks a lot like large soviet city, rather than Western Europe.
Which is quite obvious, since this district was a part of Eastern Germany.
When it is foggy, Alexanderplatz feels like a vampire movie.
Visiting Berlin is definitely a good idea for dark future fans. Other districts look less dark, but still interesting to explore. Berlin is easy to reach via major airlines (sometimes with connection in Frankfurt or Munich) and its relatively cheap, comparing to other Western Europe capital cities.

My first days in Berlin were terrible. The apartment I agreed to rent based only on photographs was too cold: Spartan in its hyper-masculine functionality. It would not warm up. It also became clear that I could not get by on English alone despite Berlin’s reputation as a cosmopolitan hub. I bought cream cheese when I wanted yoghurt, and had to use sign language in the grocery store, bakery, and flower shop. Buying tickets for the subway was not easy either. I walked around in an alienating landscape in which most of the signage was incomprehensible, newspapers made no sense, and I required GoogleTranslate to use the washing machine. It was unsettling to be able to discern the letters, but not the words. I realized that German acquisition, even basic German, was necessary if I wanted to interact with people outside the Anglophone expat cocoon, and if I wanted a more meaningful connection to my new home.
Fortunately, I am good with languages. That talent paired with a six-week language course and being unabashed about speaking terrible German has made a difference. Now I can talk to the butcher, the baker, and the Siemens washer. The other thing that has made a difference is my decision to get to know this city through its bookstores. I resolved to visit a different bookstore each weekend, and from there to launch my explorations of the neighborhood in which the store stood. This would get me out of my (cold) apartment, and into Germany’s capital, get me walking, looking at buildings, and discovering food, shops, and public spaces.
How happy I am with my choice, because Berlin is thick with bookstores. I won’t bore you with statistics, just my anecdotal experience coming from New York via Los Angeles. Brentwood, my old neighborhood in La-La Land, is thick with movie stars, and nail salons. There’s no lack of storefronts offering manicures and pedicures and juice cleanses, but there was not a single bookstore within walking distance (or even easy driving distance) of my apartment on Sunset Boulevard. Contrast that with at least ten bookstores within a ten minute walk of my current apartment in Berlin’s Prenzlauer Berg, and several just steps away. Even Morningside Heights, my Manhattan neighborhood, can boast of only Book Culture (formerly Labyrinth Books), the wonderful, intellectual heavyweight on 113th Street, and its sister store on Broadway and 116th Street, across from Columbia University’s gates.
But it’s not only Berlin’s high per capita of bookshops that I wish to extol, it is also their variety, specificity, and idiosyncrasy. You find the usual suspects of course, like bookshops devoted to children’s books or used books or art books, but I have also found bookshops aimed at naturalists; crime fiction aficionados; cookbook enthusiasts; travel nuts; theater buffs; sci-fi fiends; visual design freaks; and expat Anglos. There are so many others still waiting to be discovered. Let’s take a short walk from the Wasserturm,
the 19th century brick water tower that anchors my part of Prenzlauer Berg, to see what I mean.
Walking north on pretty, cobblestoned Ryke Straße, past the synagogue and its security detail, will take us to the intersection with Wörther Straße. A right on Wörther leads to St. George’s Bookshop, a purveyor of second-hand English books since 2003, and a left finds us in front of Georg Büchner Buchladen and its enticing window display. From Wörther Straße, walk north on Kollwitz Straße and its popular cafes and restaurants and cross Danziger to Senefelder; continue north until you get to the intersection of Senefelder and Raumer Straße and Buch Reigen. Their beautiful children’s books (yes, in German) have been tempting me since I moved into the quarter. Then walk west on Raumer to Helmholtzplatz, a lovely square where, on Sundays, neighborhood folks sell clothes, books, and toys. Then a quick right on Duncker Straße and a left on Letter Straße, following the tree-lined square, until you reach Buchbox! and its outdoor racks with postcards and wooden toys. From there, take Lychener Straße north and turn left on Stargarder Straße to find the Buchhandlung Moby Dick. If instead we had walked east and south from the Wasserturm we would encounter about one block east at the corner of Knaack Straße and Prenzlauer Allee the Mowgwa Antiquariat, a used bookstore with a small English section. Continuing south on Prenzlauer Allee and then going east on Heinrich Roller Straße takes us to the Einar and Bert Theaterbuchhandlung, a sweet corner where, on the right day, you can enjoy your tea and book in a sunny spot overlooking Leise Park.
Admittedly, Prenzlauer Berg, which was formerly in East Berlin, has changed dramatically since the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989: the once dilapidated apartment buildings are festooned with refurbished balconies and terracotta ornamentation, and their marble floors, tile work, and stained glass windows gleam. Coffee shops, yoga studios, organic food joints, and chic boutiques welcome both the local gentry and tourists.
Yet the bookstore is flourishing, when it has all but disappeared in comparable neighborhoods in American cities. In Berlin, the bookstore thrives even in less affluent and more demographically diverse neighborhoods. Two such are Kreuzberg and Neukölln, where a range of booksellers coexist with mosques, döner kebab shops, and Middle Eastern food marts.
What is it about this city? How do the book and the spaces in which it can be held, beheld, smelled, heard and, dare I say it, tasted, continue? Is it rent control? Is it state support? Is it Berlin’s vaunted independent artistic sensibility, emblematized by repeated references to body art and body piercings? Is it Berlin’s exceptional character, its special air, and its sexiness, as in Berlin ist arm, aber sexy? Translation: Berlin is poor but sexy.
Whatever it is, I have been seduced. I have fallen for this city’s intellect, its understated style — or is it studied shabbiness? — and the opportunities it presents to engage with the physicality of the book in a variety of spaces — sleekly modernist, cheerfully colorful, musty and cavelike, or hiply furnished in typical Berlin style with wooden pallets and mid-century modern. The sheer somatic pleasure of letting the eye wander, having it alight on a book, picking it up, feeling its heft, the pliability or resistance of its binding, turning its pages, noticing their typecasting, the sprawl of lines or their compact containment in stanzas, getting a waft of age or crisp newness, finding an inscription, a coffee smear, a tear, underlined text, or marginalia in a brisk hand.
I think it’s telling that the German word for bookstore is Buchhandlung, a compound of the words buch and handlung, the word retaining, unlike the English, the tactility of the operation, and the implication and involvement of the hand, and of the entire body in the act of engaging the book.
Editor’s Note: Tomorrow, we feature Subhashini Kaligotla’s interview with St George’s Bookshop bookstore owner Paul Gurner.

But what exactly is Pictoplasma? Similar to the question posed in “The Matrix,” I found myself needing to discover the answer for myself. Let me explain: In 2004, I bought the first Pictoplasma character book in a bookstore in Switzerland and was completely captivated. I also visited their very informative website at the time and gathered that it was a meeting for character designers. Since that day, I wanted to attend Pictoplasma myself. However, it took me 20 years to finally make it. So in May 2024, I attended the conference in Berlin. On the first day, I felt a bit overwhelmed, not because of what was offered, but due to the organization. Everyone had to wait patiently until they could register. I felt a bit lost, but around 3:30 PM, things finally got started. I went to the registration and then directly to the first exhibitions by the artists who would be giving talks in the coming days. I saw some of the works and took them in. Then I wandered around the venue for a while.
The next day, the conference truly kicked off. According to the program, some highly renowned artists from the scene had gathered in Berlin. I attended talks by Joe Bennett, a young designer and animator from the USA. He recently made waves with his series “Scavenger Reign” on HBOMax, a sci-fi series that looks like it could have come from the mind of the artist Moebius. He has been working on this series for over seven years, and it will be available on Netflix in the coming months. His other works for Adult Swim and Fox also stand out, characterized by a quirky but endearing sense of humor.
Additionally, the artist duo “Los Calladitos” really impressed me. Their stunning murals depicting a fantastical world centered around the preservation of light captivated me. They work on their pieces with incredible care and creativity. They also showed some animations from their own film, which brought even more life to their characters and world. Unfortunately, I missed a talk by Peter The Roman, an artist known for experimenting with AI in his 3D worlds. However, I saw some of his works in the exhibitions spread across various locations in Berlin. Overall, 20 artists participated, giving talks and workshops.
But what sets Pictoplasma apart? It’s not merely a stage for artists; it’s also one of the largest communities in the realm of character art and animation. The “Artist Talks” provided profound insights into the world of artists: their methodologies, how they develop ideas and strategies, and how they publish, sell, and make a living from their art. It’s a platform for exchange and collaboration, bringing creatives from diverse backgrounds together. Moreover, the conference reflects the zeitgeist of 2024. In a world dominated by AI, Pictoplasma artists emphasize the importance of emotion and craftsmanship. It became evident that while AI is a valuable tool for ideation, the execution of most artists’ works remains in human hands. This realization, which I suspected before Pictoplasma, was confirmed and reinforced during the event. Indeed, the use of AI elevates the significance of handmade art. Consider, for instance, the wooden figures crafted by artist Parn “Ani” Aniwat, who carves more than 30 charming characters each month. Or reflect on Los Calladitos, who seamlessly transfer their unique style from the vast walls of their murals to their animated films. Even the ceramic lamps crafted by Portuguese artist and entrepreneur Ana Seixas demonstrate how handmade artworks garner special relevance and appreciation. Ultimately, one desires to touch the art that inundates our digital world.
All the days at Pictoplasma were incredibly lively and full of inspiration. One of the most interesting talks was by Philip Hunt, a creative director at AKA Studios from the UK. He shared his experiences and insights about design and art, particularly regarding the film industry and the challenges of adapting a children’s book like “Here We Are” by Oliver Jeffers into a film. He discussed the extensive thought and effort required to translate beautifully drawn 2D characters into a 3D medium. After many ideas and experiments, he and his team successfully turned the book into a beautiful film, which can be admired on Apple TV. By chance, I met Philip on Sunday, the last day of Pictoplasma, at a small flea market in Berlin. I approached him because I didn’t get the chance to talk to him at the event. We had a pleasant conversation about the industry, covering topics like advertising, films, and other media. He asked me how I found Pictoplasma, and I told him that initially, I didn’t know what to expect or what I would take away from it. He responded that each year, he takes away inspiration and a reminder of why he continues his work. He loves attending Pictoplasma, getting inspired by other artists, and gaining a perspective beyond commercial work. He also shared that he attended the first Pictoplasma 20 years ago and didn’t know what it was about back then either. Now, he teaches workshops and helps lead the Pictoplasma Academy. It was a very enjoyable conversation. So, what makes Pictoplasma so special? It’s the chance to see designers and artists doing something different from just working on commercial projects. This is something I can definitely take away from it. I was deeply moved by the following artist talks. One of them was by the artist Parn “Ani” Aniwat. Out of necessity, he began carving small figures out of wood. Now, he makes 30 pieces a month — small, cute characters that he sells to collectors and exhibitors. It has become his business. He gave us a glimpse into his workday, which runs from 9 to 5, after which he spends time with his family, sketches ideas, and watches Netflix. The same goes for the Portuguese artist and entrepreneur Ana Seixas. During the pandemic, she started working with pottery and created clay lamp characters that sold faster in her shop than she could make them.
Of course, even at a conference focused on hand-drawn, painted, or crafted characters, the topic of artificial intelligence can’t be avoided. Some artists use AI as a tool to support their ideas. However, despite the technology and digital capabilities that AI offers, traditional craftsmanship remains one of the most important aspects. While no one insists that art must be created by hand, most artists still find themselves holding a pencil or an Apple Pencil. One of the most memorable statements about AI came from Philip Hunt. A young designer from the audience asked him whether she should focus more on AI. He responded that she should focus on drawing, as AI will inevitably come. But drawing with a pencil would always convey ideas better (or something along those lines; I’m not certain of the exact wording). Another artist, possibly Christopher Rutledge, mentioned that AI is a useful tool but compared it to mastering image databases or programs like Photoshop or After Effects. Artists have shown that they engage with AI, but in the end, it’s their ideas and visions that they bring to life. For the past few months, I’ve felt that we are returning to an era of “handmade” artistry, especially in art, film, and design. With the overproduction of AI-generated images and texts, which now look and read quite well, the personal touch is often missing. A good example is animator Joe Taylor, who makes his style unmistakable with hand-drawn loops that resemble flat designs from claymation. He showcased a commercial clip for the ProCreate app, which he both drew and animated using their software.
Aside from the talks, there were workshops, exhibitions, and parties. Unfortunately, I couldn’t attend all the talks or everything that was offered. Given that Berlin is a very large city and the event organizers thought it would be a good idea to use various locations across the city, it wasn’t easy to be everywhere. There was also an AR scavenger hunt called Character Hunt, where participants had to travel around Berlin using the Adobe Aero app to view the characters. Great ideas, but too little time to experience everything. Attending Pictoplasma was a fascinating journey into the realm of art, characters, and animation. It was far more than I could have ever imagined back then. For me, it was a significant source of inspiration for my work as a designer. Here, I could discover new perspectives and gain a wealth of inspiration.
The most captivating talk was also the last one of Pictoplasma. It was by Mila Useche from Colombia. She is an artist and filmmaker who had a tough journey. She had to fight hard in the working world, including working for a game company where she worked up to 15 hours a day. She then became a freelancer, working for studios like Disney, Warner Brothers, Nickelodeon, and Netflix. She also worked on her own concepts and film ideas. One of these is currently being realized in a German-Colombian co-production.
Recently, there has been a crisis in many animation studios in the USA, with widespread layoffs and job cuts. Adding to this were the aftermath of the pandemic and the surge of companies eager to use AI. Mila needed to find a way out, so she began sharing her hand-drawn images on Instagram, reaching many people who celebrated her art. She now lives in Japan, where she produces her art and characters. That was Pictoplasma 2024. A few days in another world, a world full of inspiration, art, characters, and animated films. Just a different kind of matrix.

This wasn’t a trip intending to explore the capital. No, I’ve never been to the capital of my home country. But the city of Berlin is also far away from where I grew up in the country.
This trip only led us to the city because we found no closer Decathlon than on the outskirts of Berlin. Decathlon is the sports store where I buy all my sports equipment. From swimsuits and snorkel to hiking pants and boots, sunglasses, and whatever else I need. We even bought an inflatable kayak here.
There are many stores across the world (we even found a Decathlon store in Thailand) but the closest one to our current home was about an hour's drive away. And in Berlin.
We were looking for a bicycle for my husband and that was the reason why we went on the journey to Berlin. Originally I had said I won’t be driving into the city. There’s public transport here. Use it. It’s much more relaxing than taking the car.
But remember, we live in the countryside. It takes a bit until we get to a train station. Or bus stop. Plus, we would be coming back with a bicycle as luggage. Maybe I should get over my shadow and just drive.
We’ve driven in many cities before and even though I wasn’t the driver in Bangkok’s crazy city traffic, I’ve done a…

While moving to Berlin was a dream come true and I could go on about all of the things I love about this hedonistic city, it came with its share of adjustments.
Some were easier to acclimate to as I quickly picked up a new way of doing things. Other things I still struggle with, even after a year of living here.
But at the end of the day, it’s all a part of the adventure. Anyone who picks up their life and moves abroad naturally craves change, newness, and a lifestyle shift. However, despite all of the best intentions and a can-do attitude, some things take longer than others to get used to.
— Want to know the flip side? Check out 20 Things I Love About Living in Berlin — From an American Expat for all the magical and exciting things I love about life in Berlin. —
Over the past year, I’ve noted what I’ve found to be frustrating, confusing, or a royal pain in the ass. Keep reading to learn about the harder, more challenging things for Americans moving to Berlin.
Finding a place to live where you can register your address (or Anmeldung in German) is by far the most challenging experience internationals face early on when moving to Berlin. As one of the most populous cities in Europe with the best nightlife in the world, not to mention the culture, history, and booming startup scene, it’s no wonder people from all over the world flock to Berlin’s gates.
Rent prices have skyrocketed in cities across the world, and it’s no different in Berlin. While it’s more affordable than Paris, London, or Amsterdam, it’s not as cheap as it once was either.
For example, I live in Neukölln where rent used to be extremely low since it was once a risky neighborhood to live in. That is no longer the case. Today, Neukölln’s known for eclectic bars, hipster cafes, music venues, green spaces, and some of the best street food Berlin has to offer. No matter what district you wind up in, finding a suitable place to live can be tricky.
Here are some tips that may help your search:
Just remember, when it comes to finding a flat, it becomes a lot easier once you’ve arrived and have feet on the ground. So, if you’re dealing with the madness of finding a place, getting rejected, and losing sleep over securing a spot before you arrive — take a breath and know it will work out once you get here.
2. Germany’s Cash Culture
The phrase “cash is king” takes on a whole different meaning in Germany. Paying with cash is mandatory at many bars, restaurants, shops, and even doctor’s offices in Berlin. If your purchase is a small one, you almost always have to pay with cash. I once got yelled at by a bartender in Friedrichshain when I didn’t have the cash to pay my tab, muttering “In Germany, we use cash.”
This is not the case in the U.S. or any other country I’ve visited in Europe. As one of the most prosperous and wealthy countries in the E.U., it’s surprising that card payments are frequently not accepted. I’m used to it now and always have some amount of cash on me, but it took time before this felt normal.
3. The Bureaucracy
Similar to my previous point, Germany is still lagging in the digitalization department. All important documents are sent by post. Video calls and emails to get legitimate documents are nonexistent. You have to physically visit the administrative and governmental buildings for anything official.
As a result, the system is backed up and it often takes months before you can schedule an appointment with any official administration. While the system is slowly becoming digitalized, it’s a slow process that was exacerbated at the height of the pandemic.
For example, when you’re registering your address or interviewing for a resident permit, it may take months before you can schedule your appointment. The slots fill up so fast, and you have to wait patiently on your computer, hitting the refresh button repeatedly every morning to see if anything opens up. It’s a major headache, but eventually, you begrudgingly accept that that’s just the way it is. You have to play the game.
4. Everyday Items That Are Only Available at the Pharmacy
Buying rubbing alcohol, skin care, flu medicine, or melatonin can all be bought at any drug store in the States. In Berlin, you have to go to the pharmacy (or Apotheke) for all of these things. This can be frustrating when working around limited hours of operation and dealing with the anxiety about speaking German, or trying to, before asking if the pharmacist speaks English.
Luckily, there are apps, like MAYD, that you can use to order from the pharmacy online and avoid this process altogether if you plan ahead.
5. Hours of Operation Aren’t Always Reliable
You know when you need to visit a store after work so you look up the opening hours on Google beforehand to plan your day? You expect it to be open when you get there before closing time, right? Well, depending on the shop, that doesn’t always go as planned in Berlin.
If the shop is slow and nobody’s walked through the door for a while as the end of the day approaches, shops won’t hesitate to close earlier. This has happened to me on multiple occasions when visiting a copy shop, photo studio, butcher, or bakery. Similar to my point about the lag in digitalization, online hours of operation are more of a suggestion than a rule for many small businesses across Berlin.
6. Learning German is Challenging When Everyone Speaks English
Perhaps a blessing and a curse, most people speak English in Berlin. You can actually get away with never learning German and only speaking English if you really want to. Sure, this helps during the initial transition moving from the U.S. to Berlin. But now, after living here for over a year, the improvement in my German language skills hasn’t grown much.
Whenever I try to practice and communicate in German, most people usually recognize that it’s not my native tongue and switch to English. Yes, this is helpful at times, but all in all, you have to work harder to learn the language than you would have to in a smaller city in Germany.
7. Winter Nights Begin at 3:00 PM
Coming from Florida, a state known for its sunshine and tropical climate, getting used to the winter season was a major adjustment — especially during my first winter. After Daylight Saving Time, it gets dark by 4:30 PM and gradually increases to 3:00 by mid-December. The winters are long, cold, windy, and grey. As a result, seasonal depression affects many people and vitamin D deficiency can easily become a problem.
To combat the dreary winter season, consider investing in a sunlight lamp that emits artificial sunshine. I just got one and it’s already making a huge difference. Now that it’s my second winter here, I’m much more mentally prepared. I already know I’m going to be inside more often, and I try to use this time for working on my goals and projects — like practicing my German.
Thankfully, summers in Berlin are incredible and make the winter season worth waiting out. Just hang on until then and you’ll understand why people rough it through the winter.
8. Understanding the Metric System
If you grow up in the U.S., you use the Imperial System for measurements and the Fahrenheit scale for temperature. Except for a handful of other countries, that’s not the case for the rest of the world where the Metric Scale and Celsius degrees are standard.
I remember the first time I tried to bake a pumpkin pie around Thanksgiving because I was feeling homesick. It took forever as I converted quantities for every ingredient from my mom’s recipe while using a measuring cup with few details. Needless to say, my pie didn’t come out splendidly. It didn’t take long before I got proper measuring utensils that converted cups, ounces, and teaspoons to grams, liters, and milliliters.
It helped to change my phone settings to Celsius degrees early on. While I had to look up the Fahrenheit conversions for a long time, it started making sense after a couple of months. Figuring out the differences becomes second nature with time.
9. Grocery Shopping
Shopping at the grocery store can be a bit intimidating the first time in Germany for several reasons, particularly the lighting speed that cashiers scan your items at the check-out line.
The hardest thing for me was grocery shopping in general translating all the ingredients from German to English. I’d often wander around my local Rewe, Aldi, or Nahkauf for hours before finding everything I needed. In retrospect, it’s probably easier to shop online in the beginning.
On the bright side, it’s good practice to familiarize yourself with the German terms for garlic, cinnamon, vegetables, potatoes, and more early on if you plan on making this country home for a time.
10. Doing Laundry Using a Drying Rack
Flats in Berlin don’t come with dryer machines. Instead, you dry your laundry using a drying rack. I made a mess of things my first time or two hanging my clothes that left noticeable indents and wrinkles. Thankfully, my flatmate was able to correct my technique to avoid this problem in the future. It’s simple once you figure it out. That first time or two, though, was something new.
The other aspect is understanding the German settings on the washer machine. I used the scan image feature on my Google Translate app in the beginning. After that, I could figure out the setting by just going off the time limit, temperature, and spin speed.
Even typing this makes me feel extremely privileged to have always had a dryer. Nonetheless, nobody wants to ruin their clothes doing laundry, and this was still something I had to get used to during the first few weeks of life in another country.
I hope this provides some perspective for anyone searching for a realistic view of some difficulties you may encounter when moving to Berlin or another European country from the U.S.
In comparison, my list of “challenges” is much shorter than the list of things that I love about Berlin. Some of the adjustments, like not having air conditioning or learning your shoe size in European measurements, are so trivial in contrast to all of the experiences and growth I’ve enjoyed since moving abroad. If given the opportunity, I’d make the same decision to move abroad a hundred times over — no questions asked.

Last summer I went to Berlin and it was beautiful. Despite the heat wave that had been sweeping across Europe when visiting, it didn’t ruin the experience — even if we were sweating.
After taking an overnight train on Friday, I woke and started my early day in Berlin on Saturday. I had planned the day out so that I would see most of Berlin in my limited time (I had to leave by Sunday night) and it was successful, hitting most of the main spots. However, there is some things I missed, so if you want a more in-depth experience I’d recommend staying longer. Berlin is not a smaller European city like Copenhagen, but a huge area a Manhattan-style feel at points.
Here is how I saw Berlin in about 48 hours:
Right off the train stop you will be able to walk towards Brandenburg gate and the Reichstag (German Parliament building).

Berlin Wall and Beyond: Discovering the Charm of Germany Over 120 Miles of Steps!,https://medium.com/@worldtravel1000days_83417/berlin-wall-and-beyond-discovering-the-charm-of-germany-over-120-miles-of-steps-34a577ef831e,"Sign up

A couple of decades ago, what began as casual weekend hikes with friends — just a few hours in the mountains — slowly evolved into a deeper exploration of local and state parks. A curiosity for new adventures soon led to the discovery of National Parks across the country, and that passion expanded into international travels, exploring nature’s preserved wonders in parks around the world.
Along the way, it became clear that some of the most breathtaking and inaccessible parts of nature could only be reached through multi-day hiking and backpacking trips. These journeys, typically lasting 7 to 10 days, became a regular part of travel, often solo. Trips around the world were undertaken, each offering a unique experience and challenge. Over time, 20+ hikes were completed, each with its own set of lessons and rewards.
This growing love for exploration led to a shift in how trips were planned. Hiking and biking along coastlines, following rivers, and exploring port cities offered new perspectives. Night walks through urban landscapes provided a chance to see cities in a whole new light, often traversing them in unusual shapes like O, S, W, M, and X.
Last year, the focus turned to recent history, with travels through the Balkan countries. A deeper interest in historical trails soon emerged, culminating in the discovery of the Berlin Wall Trail — a 99-mile loop around Berlin. Fascinated by the trail’s historical significance and the surrounding landscapes, this became the perfect opportunity to explore the city and its neighboring regions in a way that blended history, culture, and nature.
During the visit, the energy in Berlin was undeniable, with a culture that’s constantly evolving yet still deeply rooted in its vibrant past. It’s a city that attracts tourists, but somehow still manages to feel like a place where locals truly live. Over the years, it’s become safer and more accessible, but what really stood out was how seamlessly everything is connected. The public transportation system made getting around a breeze, which only added to what made the experience so memorable. With the river winding through Berlin, it’s impossible not to feel the weight of over 30 years of division between East and West. That history is still very much present, and its echoes can be seen in so many corners of the city today. Walking along the carefully crafted Berlin Wall Trail gave me a deep sense of how far Berlin has come since reunification. The city feels like it’s truly found its stride — growing, changing, but always preserving the memories of its divided past.
Though initially set to walk the entire loop of the trail, after 4 days exploring its most iconic portions, it became clear the industrial sections could easily be skipped. This saved time was then reinvested in visiting nearby cities — Hamburg, Hannover, Bremen, and Celle — spending another 4 days soaking in Germany’s unique charm.
In this trip of 8 full days, an amazing 120 miles (190 kilometers) were walked, with hardly 10% of the routes repeated. Staying in city centers made it easy to take public transportation, using time effectively. The convenience of downtown hotels also made nighttime exploration effortless.
Hamburg stood out as a major port city, with its significant role in global trade. The city’s impressive post-WWII rebuilding efforts were evident, and the mix of modern, sleek architecture alongside remnants of historic buildings created a unique atmosphere, highlighting Hamburg’s resilience. A tour of the Airbus plant offered a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at aircraft production.
Hannover, though less touristy, had a quieter, almost deserted feel, which allowed for relaxed exploration and the opportunity to take day trips to nearby Bremen and Celle.
Bremen charmed with its well-preserved UNESCO sites, like the Town Hall and Roland Statue. The medieval architecture and cobblestone streets exuded timeless old-world charm.
Lastly, Celle felt like stepping into a fairytale, with its picturesque half-timbered houses. The historical center offered a perfect blend of history, culture, and cozy cafés, making it a delightful place to explore.
Overall, this format of exploring cities with rich history by foot was incredibly rewarding. It keeps the mind curious, constantly discovering new details, and made this trip unforgettable.
Closing Thought — Berlin Wall and Beyond
This journey through Germany, spanning over 120 miles of history-rich exploration, reaffirmed the joy of traveling on foot. From the Berlin Wall Trail to the charming streets of Hamburg, Hannover, Bremen, and Celle, this trip was an immersive blend of history, culture, and nature. Each city added its own flavor — Hamburg’s resilient port spirit, Bremen’s medieval UNESCO treasures, Hannover’s quiet allure, and Celle’s fairytale-like charm — together painting a vivid picture of Germany’s past and present.
The decision to walk through these cities wasn’t just about covering miles; it was about connecting with the soul of each place. The Berlin Wall Trail, with its emotional weight, felt like a journey through time. I could almost feel the ghosts of the Cold War as I walked along its path. Even in cities with less obvious history, like Hannover, the quiet streets told their own story.
Walking gave me the freedom to truly absorb the atmosphere — no rush, no rigid plans, just a deep dive into local life. The convenience of public transport in Germany allowed me to move seamlessly between iconic landmarks, neighborhoods, and hidden gems, maximizing every moment of daylight.
Ultimately, this trip reaffirmed that history is best experienced on foot. Each step taken brought a new perspective, whether it was a look at post-WWII reconstruction in Hamburg or a quiet afternoon in Celle’s picturesque town center. There’s something powerful about walking through a place, experiencing its rhythms, and understanding its past.
After 8 days and 120 miles, it’s clear that this way of exploring — slow, deliberate, and connected to the land — offers the richest insights. Germany’s history, from the Berlin Wall to its modern-day cities, is an open book, one that’s best read one step at a time.

Note: Most of these are around Prenzlauer Berg/Mitte because I would be the last person to travel across the city for a workout.
I was born without a single athletic bone in my body, and I was okay with it until I moved to Germany. Why do Germans love Sport machen so much?! I began to feel the FOMO shortly after moving here. I tried going to the gym and also doing YouTube workouts- but turns out I am bad at consistency unless there is a later cancellation fee on the horizon. Luckily, the company I work at presented me with a discounted Urban Sports Club membership and so I was able to also mache Sport and discover my favourite studios/workout classes.
If you are a party person (I am not), you’ve definitely heard of Club Athleten’s CLUB BOXING classes. These are a mix of boxing and HIIT workouts, paired with a techno soundtrack and super groovy studios. But if you’re looking to build your booty, ASS ASS ASS is my favourite class at Club Athleten. They’ve got a bunch of workouts to choose from, and regardless of which on you choose, it’ll feel like a party!
If you’re on that clean girl or pilates girlie vibe, then a barre class is exactly what you need. Barre is mixture of pilates, yoga, ballet and strength training and will definitely leave the studio feeling the burn. Feel the Barre has some of the most attentive instructors who will make sure you’ve got the correct form. My favourite class is the BarreSIGNATURE- this gives you a taster of all of the classes they offer, that focus on different areas (core, strength, cardio, etc).
BEAT81 is another Berlin classic and I think it’s for the people that love an extreme workout (or maybe I am just that unfit). BEAT81 will push you to new lengths when it comes to cardio and strength training, as well as indoor cycling. What makes it more fun is the heartrate trackers you wear during the workouts, and you can track your progress on a screen. My favourite class at BEAT81 was the Strength class- which they describe as low on cardio but it still killed me (in the best way).
Despite having grown up in India, I was never someone who did yoga, except when I was forced to at school. However, because I grew up in India and have experienced real yoga, I am a snob when it comes to yoga instructors. To my delight, Yogic Escape offers that exact authentic Yoga experience. It is Indian owned, and all the instructors I’ve had so far have been great. I cannot recommend the Yoga for Beginners class enough. The class size is quite small so your form will be corrected and you will be pushed, but you will leave feeling lighter and stronger.
Yeah Studio offers a range of Pilates, Barre and Yoga classes, as well as teacher trainings. I love the Barre45 class by Tanja, and the Yobarre class too. Both classes use various props to elevate your workout and all the instructors are super motivating. There’s always a friendly community feeling as well.
Every week when I walk into Rocycle, I feel boujee and part of something exclusive- so you best believe I never skip a Rocycle class. Rocycle, on paper is a spin class but in reality is so much more. Not only does it incorporate some ab exercises and weights (all while on the bike), it is a great way to put away all your screens and forget about everything on the outside for 45 mins. A dark room, loud music, choreohraphy and a motivating instructor is really a great combination for a fun and effective workout.
Ride and Rocycle have the same concept and I would say they are equally good. The bonus with Ride is that you can book a class based on the type of music you like working out to. The closest studio to me is also smaller than the Rocycle one and it feels like the employees and regulars know each other well which is super cute.
Boaré is another one of my local studios that offers a variety of Pilates, Yoga, and Meditation classes. I enjoy their Pilates selection, as everyone class I have taken has left my legs SHAKING. I also tried a Sound Healing here and it left feeling ever so relaxed.
If the clean girl aesthetic was a studio, then this would be it. I have only taken classes at the Prenzlauer Berg studio, but all of their studios look equally beautiful. Hale.Now offers a range of Yoga, Pilates, Barre, Meditation and Sound Healing classes. I live for their Pilates Sculpt class (which literally books out instantly on Urban Sports). Their signature class is called Female Strength and it’s next on my list to try out.

The Guardian published a story in May 2024 about a left political party calling for a price cap on Berlin’s famous Doner Kebab. The price of this staple Berlin street food has doubled over the last couple of years. I still fondly remember the first time I tried out the Doner Kebab in 2017 when I had only paid 5 Euros for a chicken doner kebab and a beer. Putting a price cap on street food seems impractical in a capitalist country like Germany. The current economic state and rising inflation do not justify that.
But Berlin always has exceptions.
The opening sequence of Anthony Bourdain’s Parts Unknown episode on Berlin distills the history of Berlin and why it’s a hotspot for thrill seekers. Bourdain (rest in peace) was brilliant at getting to the heart of a city in a few sentences in his travel shows. That particular segment of the show ended with Bourdain having dinner at a local establishment called Domke Fleischerei with the bouncer of one of those notorious clubs in Berlin. Since seeing that episode, I have wanted to visit this place that serves ‘herzhaftig’ meat-heavy food. If you are a vegetarian or vegan, this…

“To me, Berlin is as much a conceit as a reality. Why? Because the city is forever in the process of becoming, never being, and so lives more powerfully in the imagination.” — Rory MacLean
Gabriela Trofin-Tatár
“Travel has been the fire that has shaped my current self, accumulating layers of complexity in my thinking, thoughts, and actions as a result of my journey’s successes and failures.” Gabriela Trofin-Tatár
Attending the Dreaming Europe Student Congress in 2006 was an eye-opening experience for the 20-year-old me. This trip left a lasting mark on my journey of self-discovery and wanderlust.
The visit to the hall of the European Parliament in Berlin fueled my passion for international affairs and diplomacy, igniting my determination to pursue studies abroad. During this transformative journey, I also had the unexpected pleasure of making two Danish friends, foreshadowing my future adventures in Denmark.

One of my favorite hobbies is collecting inspirations of art and design I come across while browsing the internet. Thanks to those new “save” features in apps like Pinterest or Instagram, I’m able to build little digital art museums for myself. I have thousands of “saved” pictures, from vintage photography to exotic art collage. One day I caught myself amused by the simple, elegant, extremely creative logo of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.
Whatever your career is, imagine yourself designing an orchestra logotype. First, you’d take a look at previous creations: mostly elegant curve-shaped designs with ornamental details or typographies. In color patterns, you’d see a majority of red, black and white, sometimes blue or green.
Second, you’d might brainstorm general aspects of orchestras. I’ll help: Tradition. Old Style. Chic. Elegant. Perfection. Beauty. Cult. Deep emotions. Beethoven. The frequency of sound wave. Instruments. Symphonies. The treble clef. The air-drawn lines of a baton.
The ordinary “elegant curve-shaped designs” illustrates these round elements of an orchestra. Music is not “straight”. Emotions are not “straight”. What about the color pattern? They are clearly trying to call attention, communicate passion (red tones) in a classic and elegant way (black, white tones) with notes of respectfulness or loyalty (blue, green tones).
The access to a huge source of inspiration enables the creation of my little digital museums, but it also harms uniqueness. You can create something beautiful and well constructed, but it’s easy to fall into ordinary. You can find many “how-to-do-a-beautiful-orchestra-logo-in-10-steps”, but the real challenge is to be creative and unique and still carry the message you are trying to transmit.
Well, here is why the Berlin Philharmonic logotype owned it:
This overlapped series of pentagon forms (straight lines), instead of illustrating common aspects of an orchestra, communicates the masterful architectural work of Hans Scharoun (1832–1972) for the orchestra’s concert hall, previously all fan or shoebox shaped.
The chosen yellow, a color that’s uncommon for this market, grabs attention, transmits creativity, motivation, optimism, and warmth. That conveys the Berlin Philharmonic is a modern, vivid, joyful orchestra but also warm — musically and emotionally deep.
There is also an easter egg: The overlapped pentagons clearly but not perfectly represent the floor plan of the concert hall. These overlapped pentagons suggest, besides all, a circular movement:
Yes. Circular. Do I have to say more? The logotype merges, in an exquisite way, an architectural uniqueness that characterizes the Berlin Philharmonic, without forgetting the musicality, elegancy, and round elements that surrounds an orchestra. All of those represented, with not a single curve.
“Good design is obvious. Great design is transparent.”
— Joe Sparano

He’s a trained cabinet maker, a qualified social pedagogue, and a professional graphic designer and illustrator. Christian Rothenhagen, also known as deerBLN, is a Berlin patriot with a conceptual flair. proud magazine sits down with the artist to discuss his love for the city, his creative ambitions, and what it means to be a true Berliner.
proud: What is your ambition behind putting tiles on the city’s streets?
deerBLN: My ambition is clearly to beautify my city and to express myself: in drawings, on t-shirts, on skateboards, in installations, wherever. I am happy to live in the most beautiful city in the world. I see myself as a modern local historian. I document the city through my drawings and give something back to it through my work in public spaces. My “street art” is, for the most part, not illegal, but rather tolerated interventions in the urban landscape. It’s an expression of my love for this city.
proud: You are a true Berliner. Do you even like the city anymore these days?
deerBLN: I have lived here since 1976. For me, the city is still the most beautiful, the roughest, the most diverse, the most interesting, the most incorruptible, the most broken — and the most honest. It’s the city that doesn’t lie to you. It wears its scars openly, shows its wounds, and is as direct as a punch in the gut. But it’s also the city that will always catch you. I love Berlin — now more than ever!
proud: You just designed a skateboard series for Artsprojekt. Are you a skater?
deerBLN: I used to skate a lot, but I wasn’t particularly good. I started in the mid-80s on one of those plastic boards from the department store. When I was 15, I bought my first real board, a Santa Cruz with Independent trucks and OJ II wheels — a classic! That board was my pride and joy and my ticket to a world that has shaped me to this day: skateboarding, punk rock, and hardcore. The DIY ethic of that scene has influenced my work from the beginning. So, to design a board series now is a huge honor for me. It’s a childhood dream come true.
proud: What are you currently working on?
deerBLN: Right now, I’m developing a T-shirt series for a Berlin-based streetwear label and working on a few poster designs. I’m also preparing my next solo exhibition, which will take place in the spring of 2009 in Friedrichshain. Besides that, I’m always drawing… my city… Berlin!

There are thousands of films shot in Berlin (click for city map). Opposite to many other shooting locations, Berlin surpasses the mere location tag. Instead, the city is a breathing creature, making it a character on its own.
It holds true not only in movies, though. When visiting Berlin, I felt like walking through Berlin is to walk through human memory, through disaster and overcoming. It was a walk through the urban movements seemingly never stopping to run its streets, breathe from its walls and remind us about the history and human condition.
Here are 4movies (to be frank, I only watched 3 of them, and adored 2.5) that are must-sees before visiting berlin. Or, you may just follow my path and watch the first three.
The movie takes a look into East Berlin life of intellectuals in 1984.
The scenes of the prison of the lives of others were filmed in the Royal Prison, the former Central Prison of State Security (Stasi) of the German Democratic Republic, today converted into the memorial site of Berlin-Hohenschönhausen. If you wish to book a visit, you must first register here. What’s more, former prisoners often offer guided tours where they narrate their personal experience.
Run Lola Run is a movie that literally takes you through Berlin in the turn of century. From now oh-so-hip Friedrichstraße to Charlottenburg near the National Opera, with stops on the Museum Island, Lola is on the mission to save her boyfriend’s life (literally). The other storyline of the movie conveys the saving of herself. Visiting her father, and running through the whole Berlin, she finds herself once again.
She also passes through Schlesischer Tor, Oberbaumbrücke in Kreuzberg or the beautiful square of Gendarmenmarkt in Mitte among many other streets.
In short, its route does not make any geographical sense, but how good and beautiful is Berlin from beginning to end from home and in less than an hour and a half?
Berlin, Symphony of a Great City has an incalculable historical value: this silent film immerses us in day-to-day life in the centre of Berlin in 1927, a Berlin that we neither knew nor will know as it would be reduced to rubble a few more years late.
Probably only the river Spree has remained immutable since then. The Berlin Cathedral, like so many other buildings and monuments portrayed by Walter Ruttmann’s camera, we only know of its recent reconstruction. And others, like the Royal Palace in Berlin, cannot be visited again until 2019 (next year).
Roberto Rossellini stood in what was left of Berlin in 1947, made a casting between non-professional actors and filmed the third chapter of the quintessence of the Italian neorealist: the trilogy of Rome, Appointment aperta, Paisà and this Germania, Anno Zero.
The result is devastating. Edmund Kohler is thirteen years old and wanders through the centre of Berlin with the sole purpose of surviving and helping his family survive. The backdrop is a Reichstag that is already only rubble and the barren esplanade of the Tiergarten, whose wood served to warm German homes during World War II.
The penury was such on and off the screen that many actors escaped when it came time for repatriation after recording the interiors of the film in Rome.

(Author’s note: A German version of this article was published in Berlin’s “Der Tagesspiegel” newspaper on March 15, 2025)
It didn’t matter if the neighbors looked on disapprovingly. The New Year had arrived, and spring began with a large fire that we, as children, would jump over for what felt like hours to leave behind the evil spirits of the past year. The scent of saffron rice and grilled fish. The loud music surrounded us and the families of my father’s Persian friends who visited each other, greeting with kisses and embraces. Whenever I remember the Persian New Year celebrations I experienced in West Berlin during the 1980s, I’m filled with a warm, hopeful feeling. Back then, I didn’t understand how much more this festival must have meant during that time, amid a terrible war between Iraq and Iran that lasted nearly a decade and resulted in half a million casualties. A celebration amid a German society that was still firmly convinced it was not yet open to immigrants and what they could contribute. For my dad and his friends, the celebration was a piece of home helping them feel more at home in a foreign land.
Only years later did I learn how widespread the tradition of this New Year’s festival is. According to UNESCO, “It has been celebrated by more than 300 million people for over 3,000 years in the Balkan Peninsula, the Black Sea region, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Middle East.” The festival’s observance traces back to the Zoroastrian ancestors of today’s Iranian people. Since 2009, the UN has even included Nouruz in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
When I would return to my Berlin school on Mondays after the festival, there was no mention of the Persian New Year. Only Christmas, Easter, and New Year’s Eve existed. Once, in 12th grade, our English teacher asked about our backgrounds and our parents. I remember it clearly because it was such an unusual experience. She wanted to know if we, as children of immigrants, felt any particular conflict. The only thing I felt were the glances of my classmates, which led me to give an evasive answer. The meaning and power of the New Year’s festival thus remained hidden from her and the rest of the teachers and students.
For example, the story of Kaveh the Blacksmith, who plays an important role in Ferdowsi’s famous Book of Kings. According to legend, Kaveh led an Iranian uprising against a cruel, child-devouring dragon king. This symbolism of resistance against oppression has led authoritarian governments to attempt to ban the festival over the years repeatedly. However, the most important meaning of the festival is the awakening of nature to new life in spring, the victory of light over darkness, and of knowledge over ignorance.
When I speak with my friends in Berlin every weekend, it becomes increasingly clear to me how important it is to celebrate the Persian New Year and remember its message, especially this year. For weeks, I’ve been hearing much about the challenges originating in Moscow and here in Washington, D.C., and the increasingly difficult political and economic situation for Germany and Europe. Even during the pandemic, I didn’t perceive this much fear and uncertainty about the situation.
Next week, I will tell the children at my daughter’s elementary school in Washington, D.C. about the Persian New Year. There are some children there who are directly affected by their parents’ dismissals by the Trump administration. There are flyers preparing for the possible removal of children of illegal immigrants at the school. The teacher invited me at my daughter’s request, who had so enjoyed the presentation of the Indian Festival of Lights, Diwali, in the fall by a mother of Indian descent. I will tell them about the great New Year’s festival and its message that we will celebrate with friends and neighbors. With a fire that many in the city will jump over to rid themselves of the evil spirits of the past year. And about how for me, the festival is also a piece of memory of Berlin and a home that I gladly share with all who currently need more confidence and community.

What is Berlin famous for and why do travellers everywhere recommend and rave about the German capital so often?
Berlin is an eccentric city with an eclectic culture and is one of the most ‘happening’ places in Europe. The city attracts over 14 million visitors every year and tops many tourist’s bucket lists who all want to experience its vibrancy and aesthetic. However, you probably want to know exactly why the city is so highly regarded before booking your next trip.
Let’s find out what is Berlin famous for? And why is it so different to any other capital city?
The city is home to many iconic, quirky buildings and monuments. From the Gothic design of Berlin cathedral, to the Rococo-inspired Charlottenburg Palace, and post-war Brutalist architecture, like the harrowing concrete landscape of the Holocaust Memorial. The city is full of diverse architectural styles.
The Berlin art scene is modern, vibrant and alternative. Whilst the city has many galleries dedicated to classic art, Berlin is probably most famous for its brilliant and bizarre street art, which coats buildings and the remains of the Berlin wall. The creativity of Berlin artists is unparalleled — no concrete surface is safe!
Berlin’s music scene is well known and respected across many genres. The city has three operatic houses — perfect locations to perform the works of German composers like Beethoven, Brahms and Bach, to name a few. Disco, electronic and synthpop are also very popular in the city and many club-goers enjoying dancing till dawn to this modern music in trendy venues.
Speaking of dancing in trendy venues, Berlin’s nightlife is widely considered one of the best in the world. The capital’s most exclusive club and notoriously difficult to enter is Berghain, but there are many other exciting and elusive venues to party in, dotted about the streets.
Berlin is renowned for its charming markets. Some weekly events include a traditional farmer’s market selling German craft food and drink, to hipster flea markets full of handmade treasures. Germany is also famous for hosting magical Christmas markets too, and Berlin is no exception!
Berliners are serious about their sausages! And the currywurst is the most popular item, available on almost every street corner of the capital. Quick n’ easy, yet filling and tasty, the sausage dish is a world-famous German delicacy.
Berlin famously contains many beautiful gardens and clean parks which contrast, yet compliment the built-up, concrete landscape. Tiergarten is perhaps the most famous central garden and is located next to popular attractions the Reichstag and Victory Column.
Berlin’s fascinating, dark past has left behind many abandoned and derelict buildings, some of which are open to exploration, such as an American spy station and an abandoned theme park. The sites are often covered in incredible street art and are a must-see amongst adventurous travellers who enjoy going off the typical tourist paths.
The bear is the mascot of Berlin. It proudly stands on the city’s coat of arms and the Berlin Buddy Bear is a fun interpretation of the animal. Berlin has 140 painted Buddy sculptures scattered around the centre. They have become an integral part of the streets of Berlin, not to mention inspiring many souvenir gifts. Many tourists enjoy counting how many they find on their travels through the city.
This is just a short list about what Berlin is famous for. The city is treasured and respected by so many for an abundance of personal reasons, but anyone lucky enough to have seen the capital can agree it is a unique and visit-worthy city.
Will you add Berlin to your bucket list?

“The strength of career success lies in the power of networking.” - Omotola E.O.
I shared in my previous post about my speaking engagement in Berlin at FOSS Backstage, where I spoke on Contributors’ Engagement and Monetization Opportunities.
In this series, I’ll share some of the new connections I made on this trip, particularly at the FOSS Backstage event.
This is my first international trip outside of Africa. I got the feeling you get when you go to a different country and meet people from different cultures. The good thing is I was already looking forward to connecting, learning new cultures, and having a good time.
I did! I met some cool folks from different organizations and career paths. One thing that brought us together is our love for open source.
Among many other connections I made at this conference, meeting with Outreachy mentors was one of my highlights.
I met with Antonin Delpeuch, an Open Refine community mentor, and Jarek Potiuk, an OpenStack community mentor.
We discussed their experience as an Outreachy mentor, how the program has benefited their projects, and them as a mentor. It’s good to hear them talk about what excites them about Outreachy applicants and interns and how the program has enhanced their projects.
After the conference, I had a good dinner with Antonin Delpeuch, and we talked more about the future of open source and outreach programs. We also shared individual goals, our steps, and what we see in open source.
It was such a great privilege to not only meet with other open source advocates who are interested in what the Outreachy program does but to learn more about how open source experts and the community can get involved, the benefit of the program to mentors, and the steps and requirements to participate in the program.
I was able to preach the gospel of Outreachy to these fantastic folks and build and strengthen their knowledge about the program and relationship. Looking forward to further connecting with them and having them support diversity in tech through the Outreachy program.
Until the next and final series, I will share my experience exploring the great Berlin. Mach’s gut (Welle)!

Germany is Europe’s most important country. It is the most economically powerful country on the continent, a heavyweight in political and humanitarian affairs, and the EU’s most populous country.
Yet its capital city, Berlin, is a bit of a disappointment. Despite its urban sprawl, it boasts quite a small population for the capital of such a big country — significantly lower than Istanbul, Paris or London.
It’s also quite poor for the capital of such a rich country — until 2018, Berliners were actually poorer than the national average. That means that Berlin was in the extraordinary position of being a capital city that dragged down the rest of the national economy. Even now, many big cities in Germany (Munich, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Stuttgart etc) are richer than Berlin.
Nevertheless, like virtually all capital cities, Berlin has a dream to sell. London and New York brand themselves as the financial rulers of the world; Paris sees itself…

You might expect a 91-year-old to have plenty of leisure hours. Not Francis Kilduff. The WWII veteran is so busy putting the final touches on his latest docudrama and hobnobbing at the USO headquarters, he barely made it to the theater. Though he managed to carve some time out of his weekend to enjoy a pre-performance meal at the Geffen Playhouse, he’s hurriedly slicing into his beef and hoping he doesn’t miss curtain.
It’s the Sunday night before Veteran’s Day, and Geffen has invited military vets not only to take in the final dress rehearsal of Hershey Felder as Irving Berlin, but also to enjoy a catered dinner buffet. Partnering with the Gary Sinise Foundation (Sinise and Randall Arney, Geffen’s Artistic Director, are pals from their days working together at Chicago’s Steppenwolf Theatre), the Geffen celebrates veterans by hosting these special veterans nights for every Gil Cates Theater subscription production. As a proud partner of Blue Star Theatres, the Geffen Playhouse also offers veterans free tickets to season productions year-round.
But tonight is extra special. For most of these vets, Irving Berlin composed the soundtracks to their lives.
Seated at the table with Kilduff is Alan Bertik, an affable vet who was on a Navy destroyer in the Korean War (“It was 30 below,” he says, chuckling). He and his wife used to usher at the Geffen. They saw Felder perform one New Year’s Eve, but he’s especially excited about this show for the simple reason that he knows most of the music. Of course, everyone knows the biggies: “White Christmas,” “There’s No Business Like Show Business,” “Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning.” Still, Berlin’s catalog is so expansive — he wrote at least 1,500 songs — there are many that history has forgotten. Yet the men and women who fell in love, broke up and fell in love again remember them fondly.
“Of course I’m excited!” Kilduff chimes in. “That’s my era.”
Hershey Felder has crafted one-man shows based on Gershwin, Chopin, Beethoven and Bernstein, creating experiences that are half concerto, half stage play. In fact, they’re so unique he’s become quite famous not only in Southern California, with many premieres at the Geffen, plus performances at Pasadena Playhouse, Laguna Playhouse, San Diego Rep and the Old Globe, but also across the nation and world. (You can read more about his work in a recent American Theatre magazine article that is also re-published as the program note for the show.)
For Hershey Felder as Irving Berlin, Felder recounts Berlin’s life story by weaving memories into songs. During the peformance, Felder plays one of Berlin’s most famous songs, “God Bless America,” and invites the audience to sing along. As voices surged with pride during the dress rehearsal, there were more than a few eyes filled with tears. The one constant in Berlin’s life — from being an immigrant baby to a “singing waiter” to Fred Astaire’s best bud to a lonely recluse — was that he found comfort in music. Berlin may be America’s most famous composer, but to that end, he’s not so different than the rest of us.

I visited many galleries and art exhibitions in Berlin and here’s my reviews.
It is not as difficult to purchase tickets as it is in Barcelona, but it is critical to double-check the opening days and hours.
I visited ""the soul station"" : the LAS Foundation in Halle am Berghain. An extensive interactive metaverse ethical gaming installation.Brathwaite-Shirley investigates marginalized histories, particularly those of the Black and Queer communities. When prospects go into Berlin’s renowned space, they are greeted by a dark, foggy environment filled with an array of varying screen displays flickering with artificial light, waiting us to tap in.
I spent a lot of time there trying to understand everything, but there still remain some parts of the journey that are perplexing. The storyline offers the sense of limitless possibilities. As my friend grace said , it kind of reminds me of Love + Death robots vibe too.
By the time I visited it was only 8 euro and it was episode 1 of the game.
Episode 2: ARE YOU SOULLESS, TOO?Will start from September to October.
Really really worth it.
Really famous on social media. An immersive museum exploring the concept of dark matter. It was really far away , and maybe I expected too much after the halle- exhibition visit. There are several rooms to explore and you can probably finish it all in 1 and a half hours. Or even faster without the drink/snack breaks in between. However, this place made for a really good video/ photos. The tickets are quite expensive for what it offer though…
I truly had fun that visit! Film buffs will thoroughly like this. There are free smartphone applications for audio guides, and it was simultaneously interesting and enlightening. Day tickets cost 9 euros and close at 6 p.m. After experiencing the museum, visitors can also visit the Library of Film Archives. Aside from that, it’s clear that the Deutsch kinemathek hosts a variety of exhibitions. On top of that, the permanent display will close in October. I had an absolute blast there.
Honestly ， I encountered a lot of fashionable people here. And I think they’re here for the IG post. It certainly is a cool place to take photos.
I saved a lot more museum visit as well but I just couldn’t make it because of prior plans. Next time , Berlin!

The Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG) — Berlin’s citywide public transportation system — boasts an sprawling web of trains running with cold, calculated efficiency. A moment’s tardiness leaves your arms struggling to stretch the closing doors. A Google search reveals a link to its website, which bears the slogan: “Because we love you.”
Evidently, this love only applies to the native and the lucky. As with any bureaucratic bunch, alas, the company’s true love remains the almighty Rulebook. German culture in general reveres tradition, so the guidelines of their businesses prove tighter to squeeze through than their departing train doors.
When I arrived in Berlin after 16 restless hours of international travel, I scoured the BVG ticket dispenser for the student option. I was desperate to end the day, but both I and my travel organizers had done our research. The website listed the 61 Euro “Ausbildung” (“education”) ticket as the one for students and nowhere did it state any specification beyond possessing a student card, so I bought the ticket and left.
A week passed. I grew infatuated with Berlin, its cosmopolitanism broadening my perspective on what a big city could be. Worried that if I didn’t lower my gaze from the high rises to my laptop I might miss my deadlines, I ventured off to the nearest U-Bahn station, aiming to write at a local café.
I boarded a U-Bahn remarkably devoid of people. Over that last week alone, I’d shared more physical intimacy with fellow train-riders than in many long-term friendships, so any room to breathe was precious.
The second a BVG officer boarded, however, all air left the train car. A heavyset, bald man, clearly born for this role, he bore a black vest thicker than any soldier’s. Beneath this riot gear he wore a black T-shirt, with the skull logo of Marvel Comics character The Punisher imprinted on its sleeve.
I was sure that I had no reason for concern. As the train left the station, he whipped out his scanner, demanding that all passengers present their tickets. A few good citizens later, he reached me, scanned my ticket, and stared me down.
“Let me see your student ID,” he said. I obliged. Staring at the UC Santa Barbara logo, he remarked: “This is not the ticket.” Confused, I emphasized that I was indeed a student studying here. Shaking his head, he replied: “You will get off with me.” As he turned to continue scanning, I made nervous eye contact with The Punisher’s skull.
Stepping off, I found my pitiful German akin to a fist in a gunfight. He claimed my ticket was solely “for job education” and set me an appointment to pay it the next day. Having conveniently reached my stop, I hobbled off, defeated, to the coffee shop.
The next day, I trekked over to the BVG headquarters for my appointment, with Vanessa — my trip-appointed German translator and true hero — by my side. The front of the building, complete with LGBTQ+ rainbow colors displayed, seemed inviting enough. Quickly, however, we were directed to a crude little crevice in the building’s back corner.
A bouncer-type at the BVG customer office bellowed orders from the front door. We sat together, awaiting our turn. I expressed confidence in our success.
Okay, you absolutely shouldn’t judge a book by its cover. But when I tell you my confidence melted the second I saw the man behind the counter, please let me off this one time. His eyes teemed with dissatisfaction. Mercy was not in this man’s vocabulary — nor was any English. Funny how this was the only place in Berlin I’ve been where no one has spoken English.
Vanessa fought valiantly, but it was a losing battle. The facts of the story — I am a student studying in Berlin and I had bought a ticket at the student ticket price — meant nothing to this man. “You wouldn’t go to Thailand and use your student ID to buy a ticket there,” he repeated. I am neither sure why that’s something I wouldn’t do, nor what his focus on Thailand was about. But we were chipping away at stone.
“You cannot buy this ticket as a foreigner,” he said. We emphasized that nowhere did the website specify this. “Go online and write a complaint,” he responded.
Vanessa looked at me sympathetically. I sighed, knowing the war was lost, and paid the fine. The 60 Euros aside, I felt robbed of the wide-eyed earnestness I’d brought in my suitcase. There was something potent in that initial Berlin buzz, the excitement of believing this new place might be better than back home. But now I felt disillusioned.
Make no mistake, I’m still loving my time in Berlin. You could spend weeks peeling back this city’s layers — the boundless events and different cultures it hosts — and still never find the end. Any place this large and bustling needs a public transit system, so one must deal with the BVG. Still, I wanted to issue this warning, just in case The Punisher tries to track you down.
Go online and write a complaint, huh?
Fine, man. Here it is, for the entire world to read.

Thinking of making Berlin your new home?
Take these things into account for a smoother move.
A “Wahlberlinerin” (Berlin citizen by choice) explains.
Visiting my hometown in Groningen, the Netherlands feels like a breath of fresh air, as if I’m walking through a village. Most pedestrians on the street greet me with a smile and a nod.
It doesn’t work like that in Berlin.
You ignore one another. Some neighbors who accepted my packages in the past and certainly know who I am ignore me in any other setting.
It’s no different when walking on the street. No one greets you, you greet no one. If you do, expect frowns, very confused, or even scared looks.
The temperatures drop to or below zero during the winter months. People get moody, sulky, and the city turns bleak.
The only good thing about Berlin winters from the perspective of a Dutch person: it doesn’t rain…

This Berlin flew by! A good overview is that of Screen Daily and if we’re lucky, you can read it here without subscribing. My own activities flowed from two sources:
1) Education: I taught and led tours of the market for Berlinale’s Talent Campus Meet the Experts, for Deutsche Welle Akademie Film Festival Workshop, and for INA Sup, a TV, film and new media school based in France and linked to the French National Audiovisual Institute (INA). This is the most rewarding work, seeing what talent is coming up in our world, seeing ideas take hold as the students learn about the market.
2) Our Consulting: Another pillar of our company, aside from blogging and professional education, is strategic planning with filmmakers. This Berlinale was very intense and very energizing for my partner Peter Belsito and me, with Beyond the Moonwalk having found a berth for international sales representation with Steve Arroyave’s Arrow Entertainment and a U.S. distribution commitment, and more actively involving, with Donna Deitch’s The Catcher, where a series of meetings with top German and Canadian producers and sales agents gave the project the momentum of a race horse bound for first place!
What follows are my impressions of various other Berlin events as they passed by — ever so quickly — but still with enough eye-catching power to capture my attention in the first place.
I was happy to see Jeff Lipsky and Adopt Films’ co-managing executive Tim Grady cleaning up with 3 acquisitions; no time to waste anymore as the third Bingham Ray memorial pointed out to those who have the mind to realize the message. Sister (L’enfant d’en haut) by Ursula Maier (ISA: Memento, Swiss rights with FilmCoopi), I hear is A+, Paolo and Vittorio Taviani’s Caesar Must Die (Cesare deve morire) (ISA: Rai Trade) won the Golden Bear, and Chris Petzold’s Barbara, all in Competition.
American indie works-in-progress have been granted a second chance to screen for European indie distributors (EuropaDistribution) at the upcoming Paris Film Festival in June. I have been invited to be on the jury of “U.S. in Progress” and am thrilled at the prospect. I was honored to have been invited to be on the jury in Wroclaw at the American Film Festival in November as well, for the first edition of this chance for U.S. filmmakers to win post-production and cash prizes. This is where the film Now, Forager was picked up by fledgling international sales agent, the only international sales agent in Poland, New Europe Sales founded by Jan Naszewski [jnaszewski AT gmail.com] and Anja Sosic [anja AT NewEuropeFilmSales.com]. The film went on to screen at Rotterdam Film Festival. Even hotter news will be forthcoming from MOMA and The New York Film Society’s New Directors/ New Films about one of the films at the AFF’s “U.S. in Progress”. If you missed it in Poland you will be able to see it in New York this April!
I was lucky to see two films during the market and after the market closed, this last Saturday and Sunday, when I caught some more films I was unable to see earlier due to my “real” work. Of the films I saw here in Berlin, here are my unique :) comments for what they’re worth.
Children of Srikandi (Panorama) is a very personal account by a female filmmaker collective in Indonesia on what it means to be a lesbian in their society. The sweet intimacy of the film overrides its non-professional veneer (the “filmmakers” were all non-professionals). In fact, this could serve as a template for other non-professionals who want to tell their stories. Schools come to mind as possible candidates for this sort of filmmaking, as does my own pet project, The Literacy Project. The Indonesian contingent here in Berlin was interesting and sociable as they met their audience and fans. They were hosted by Berlin based producers Laura Coppens who is a doctorate student in ethnological studies in Zurich and Angelika Levi, doc filmmaker (My Life, Part 2 about growing up Jewish in Berlin).
Bergman & Magnani: The War of the Volcanos. This invitation-only work in progress with Wide House uses a unique way to show the emotion filled and the biggest jet-set love scandal of all times, the story of Roberto Rossellini, Anna Magnani and Ingrid Bergman as Rosellini and the volcanic Anna Magnani ended their relationship after making Volcano (1950) and the married Ingrid Bergman and Rossellini began theirs with the filming of Stromboli (1950), the name of the second volcano on this Aeolian Island which has been in almost continuous eruption for 2,000 years. The visuals of their stories are illustrated entirely with the scenes from movies starring them as they enact the real life emotions and the commentary of the doc. I am most interested to see how well this technique succeeds.
Paolo and Vittorio Taviani’s Caesar Must Die (ISA: Rai Trade) is a moving illustration of the transformative power of art as hardened criminals in an Italian prison rehearse and perform Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar. The the 80 + year old Brothers Taviani deserve recognition for their artistic excellence. I can’t argue with Mike Leigh and the jury’s judgement except that on my emotional meter, Rebelle (War Witch) was the real winner.
Rebelle (War Witch) by Kim Nguyen (ISA: Films Distribution) should have won the Golden Bear. The Silver Bear for Best Actress was awarded to Rachel Mwanza, but this film is so deeply moving on the most primal levels, maintaining its African roots while touching our most sensitive emotions of parents, love, rape, pregnancy and infants as they are experienced by a female child soldier from ages 12 to 14. It should also win Best Foreign Language Film in next year’s Academy Awards. Produced by the industry vets Marie-Claude Poulin and Pierre Even, it is yet another feather in the cap of the the Canadian film industry.
Dieter Kosslick observed that with 15 Competition titles confirmed at the time Screen International interviewed him, “both thematically and geographically, we have many films coming this year from Asia, and particularly China and Indonesia. There is also an interesting focus on France this year, beginning with the opening film Farewell My Queen (Les adieux a la reine) (ISA: Elle Driver) and going through all of the festival’s sections. Moreover, we have two French jury members [Francois Ozon and Charlotte Gainsbourg] in the International Jury.“ Eight titles selected to date have German majority or minority participation, so German filmmakers and (co-)producers will again enjoy a record presence in the Competition on a par with 2011’s tally of eight films involving German directors or German production partners.” He also notes Competition films’ trending toward “times of upheaval and new departures… with many films coming from Africa and Arab countries”. My observation of the 23 Competition films finally selected is that the nostalgic look back at European aristocracy and top social tiers (A Royal Affair, Bel Ami, Farewell My Queen) and its mores stands in stark contrast to today’s upheavals of families and children (Childish Games, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, Postcards from the Zoo, Just the Wind, Mercy, Shadow Dancer, Sister, Rebelle, Home for the Weekend, Jayne Mansfield’s Car, Coming Home). Seven other films continue the theme of social upheavals: Tey — which deal with childhood memories of Senegal experienced by an American, Captive about Phillipine hostages, Barbara an Eastern German looking to move to the West, Caesar Must Die about prisoners finding art in their sequestered lives, Flying Swords of Dragon Gate about upheavel during the Ming Dynasty, White Deer Plain about upheavel towards the end of Imperial China, The Flowers of War about the upheavel of China by the Japanese in World War II. The exceptions, Tabu and Meteora, deal with love, the Saving Grace.
Two major disappointments were Steven Soderberg’s Haywire (ISA: Mandate) and Stephen Elliott’s Cherry. Both about women, they left me puzzled with what the plot was about. Pretty, well done and negligible.
This Berlin Diary Part 2 will continue after I work on my new and soon-to-be launched website! I have spent an entire day on this blog and I still have much more to write!

This is drawn from my recent bestselling book on heroes (cue Bowie) who dug escape tunnels under the Wall, The Tunnels: Escapes Under the Berlin Wall and the Historic Films the JFK White House Tried to Kill. Part of Bruce’s performance, and remarks, via link below. I would attend an epic Springsteen concert in Berlin almost 30 years later.
https://youtu.be/WBIcfPBVxxQ
On this date in 1961 the Berlin Wall started rising overnight (first as mere barbed wire) dividing East and West for almost three decades. The fall of the Berlin Wall, 28 long and deadly years later, has been attributed to lots of things, from Mikhail Gorbachev’s reforms and Ronald Reagan’s famous plea to the ineptitude of the Politburo and the collective courage of the East German protesters. But there’s little doubt that David Bowie and Bruce Springsteen did their own — if small — part.
When Bowie died several years ago, the German Foreign Office noted as much in a memorial tweet: “Good-bye, David Bowie. You are now among #Heroes. Thank you for helping to bring down the #wall.” For Springsteen’s role, you can read the 2013 book Rocking the Wall: Bruce Springsteen — The Berlin Concert That Changed the World. But Springsteen’s memoir, Born to Run, offers his full account of that epic concert for the first time.
Many Americans are surprised to learn that our rock stars were even allowed to play in East Germany while the wall, constructed in 1961, remained in place. But Communist Party leaders, noting the tremendous buildup of anger and tension among their young people during the Gorbachev “glasnost” era, decided to provide a safety valve of sorts by allowing major rock concerts starting in 1987. Tens of thousands of East German kids were already flocking to the wall to listen as Bowie and others played just on the other side — and there had been clashes between the music-starved youth and East German police.
Bowie’s June 1987 performance was remarkable on several levels. The stage was set up in West Berlin, very close to the wall, with the old Reichstag building as a backdrop. Unlike most Western performers, he had a fitting song for the occasion: “Heroes,” written a few years earlier and purportedly inspired by Bowie’s time living in Berlin. The line about standing by the wall while “the guns shot above our heads” may refer to dramatic attempts by East Germans to escape the East — which happens to be the subject of my book, The Tunnels: Escapes Under the Berlin Wall and the Historic Films the JFK White House Tried to Kill. (You can watch part of Bowie’s performance that day below.)
https://youtu.be/FdykmbbaZI8
And here, from a 2003 interview, is how he described it:
It was one of the most emotional performances I’ve ever done. I was in tears…And there were thousands on the other side that had come close to the wall. So it was like a double concert where the wall was the division. And we would hear them cheering and singing along from the other side. God, even now I get choked up. When we did “Heroes” it really felt anthemic, almost like a prayer. However well we do it these days, it’s almost like walking through it compared to that night, because it meant so much more. That’s the town where it was written, and that’s the particular situation that it was written about.
By then, Bob Dylan had been invited by a youth arm of the Communist Party to play in Treptower Park in the East on September 17, 1987, along with touring mates Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and Roger McGuinn. Protests were building against the regime and the wall, and East German officials hoped to defuse tensions with a few signs of openness.
The Stasi didn’t seem too worried that Dylan, then in a down period in his career, would prove to be a rabble-rouser.
Naturally, the Stasi (East Germany’s notorious secret police) were on top of it. Their six-page preview was filed at their headquarters under “Robert Zimmerman, No. HA XX 17578.” It mainly covered logistics and security — no secret bugging of Dylan, apparently — and the dispersal of 81,000 tickets, with at least one-third going to party officials and their pals. The Stasi didn’t seem too worried that Dylan, then in a down period in his career, would prove to be a rabble-rouser, as he was merely “an old master of rock” with no particular “resonance” with the youth of the day. The crowd, they predicted, would be mostly middle-aged and older. Dylan would act in a “disciplined” way and not cause undo “emotions.”
In the end, the gig played out pretty much as the Stasi had anticipated. By most accounts, Dylan — whose lyrical work just earned him the 2016 Nobel Prize for literature — gave a rather lackluster performance (his norm for the time), consisting of a couple of Christian tunes mixed in with hits like “Blowin’ in the Wind,” “Rainy Day Women” and “Like a Rolling Stone.” He reportedly did not speak a single word from the stage.
This was not the case with Springsteen, who arrived in East Berlin 10 months later to play his biggest concert ever. More than 200,000 showed up, twice what Dylan had attracted. Springsteen opened, pointedly, with “Badlands,” but the indisputable highlight was his cover of “Chimes of Freedom,” a Dylan tune that Dylan himself had overlooked. The show, which in typical Springsteen style lasted nearly four hours, was beamed to millions of East Germans via state television. Many middle-aged Germans I interviewed for my book fondly recalled attending the performance or watching it on TV. “It was a nail in the coffin for East Germany,” one fan told the Guardian years later.
In Born to Run, Springsteen recounts a previous visit to East Berlin with bandmate Steve Van Zandt. “You could feel the boot,” he recalls. The wall, in Springsteen’s view, seemed almost “pornographic.” The experience helped shock the then-apolitical Van Zandt into decades of activism. “The power of the wall that split the world in two, its blunt, ugly, mesmerizing realness, couldn’t be underestimated,” Springsteen writes. “It was an offense to humanity.”
When Springsteen returned to East Berlin for his epic 1988 show, as I note in my own book, he unhappily discovered that the state was billing it as a “concert for the Sandinistas,” the pro-Communist Nicaraguans. So he delivered an impassioned speech. His German was grade-school level, but he got the point across: “I’m not here for any government. I’ve come to play rock and roll for you in the hope that one day all the barriers will be torn down.” East German officials backstage had somehow learned about Bruce’s original statement, which included the explosive word “walls,” and Springsteen’s manager, Jon Landau, had convinced him at the last minute to change it to “barriers.” But after finishing his statement, Springsteen quickly launched into “Chimes of Freedom,” which includes the key reference: “while the walls were tightening.” (See video up top which includes his remarks, then the song.)
The next day, he and the band “partied” at the East Berlin consulate, Springsteen writes, before heading back to the West to play a show for a mere 17,000 people — which “felt a lot less dramatic than what we’d just experienced.” Referring to the “stakes” of rock and roll, he writes, “The higher they’re pushed, the deeper and more thrilling the moment becomes. In East Germany in 1988, the center of the table was loaded down with a winner-take-all bounty that would explode into the liberating destruction of the Berlin Wall by the people.”
German historian Gerd Dietrich would later tell Rocking the Wall author Erik Kirschbaum, “Springsteen’s concert and speech certainly contributed in a large sense to the events leading up to the fall of the wall. It made people more eager for more and more change,” he said. “Springsteen aroused a greater interest in the West. It showed people how locked up they really were.”
As Springsteen himself would later put it, “Once in a while you play a place, you play a show that ends up staying inside of you, living with you for the rest of your life. East Berlin in 1988 was certainly one of them.”

So I’m really interested in the climate tech space and especially how AI/ML can be applied to help make the world sustainable.
In particular I found the Climate Change AI (CCAI) paper has a great taxonomy to start thinking about areas AI/ML applies to the climate tech world. However it does not offer a lot of on-the-ground examples of real startups working in the space. I was also unable to find a really satisfactory list anywhere online so I decided to make my own:
The current mapping is built an underlying dataset I built and have published publicly below. It’s an aggregation of the following sources: (Dealroom, Climate-KIC’s alumni page, PwC’s report on state of Climate Tech 2020, Angel List jobs board, this article from Tech Founders, this one from EU-Startups, and this one from MTC, as well as some conversations from the Work on Climate Slack and my own personal knowledge.
This is by no means an exhaustive mapping, but I do think it is currently the most comprehensive list for Berlin. However if there are any companies I’ve missed and you think should be added, I’d be really happy to hear from you.
As mentioned above, the CCAI paper has a great taxonomy which I used to start thinking about areas AI/ML applies to the climate tech world:
I did the categorization manually for both domain and subdomain, as the number of companies was still relatively small and I was interested in researching each organization individually.
I also added an additional boolean field ‘AI/ML’ in the data for companies who specifically mentioned using Machine Learning in their venture.
The climate tech space in Berlin is growing fast and it's exciting to see so many new companies and founders joining the space.
I hope to maintain and update this market map as the space grows and hopefully to expand to other areas in the EU (see, London). I’d also like to run some analysis on the dataset as it grows to understand some of the key trends emerging in this space.
In the meantime, feel free to reach out if you have any questions or comments.

(From someone who grew up there)
Berlin is great. It has culture — so much culture! It has a party scene, a café scene, a bookshop scene, a thrift store scene, a flea market scene, and a farmers market scene. And yet, six weeks ago, I felt the urge to pack up my things and leave. Berlin is like that one popular girl in high school whom you would lock eyes with in the hallway — the moment you couldn’t believe your luck, you would realize that she was looking right through you, as if you were water. Listen, everyone had a different take on the popular girl in high school. Most people simply loved her, which is what made her so popular. Yet, terminology such as “popular girl” or “mean girl” wouldn’t exist if there wasn’t also a certain fear or at least disdain involved. Berlin is a popular girl. You can’t fight me on that. And still — most likely, she will enchant you.
Imagine boarding the subway — yes, the famous yellow U-Bahn that is redonant of piss and houses two thirds of the city’s homeless population [figure deliberately invented]. And while you may think breathing through your scarf is the worst thing, or having to avoid eye contact with creepy strangers, or school children bumping their massive backpacks into you during rush hour, I can tell you that it isn’t any single one of those things. It’s that all these things are happening at once. You don’t get a second to yourself, not a second to just hold still and think, because there is someone very near you breathing down your neck.
At this point, you may have sworn to yourself to never visit Berlin or at least its subway — especially if you generally dislike big-city hustle — but there may be some of you who find the idea of the Berliner U Bahn romantic. And you know what? It is! We even have a world-famous musical that is merely about that. It’s called Linie 1. If you ever visit Berlin, you have to go. It’s wonderful and one of a kind.
I already mentioned that Berlin is the popular girl in high school, and what I mean by this is that she is pretty (very, very pretty) and a trendsetter in a rather basic and unoriginal way. She’d never try something truly new or crazy out herself but would only wear it if her peers approved it. I know that this sounds like a survival guide for high school, and it is, but in Berlin, it’s true for anyone from the age of five to thirty-five, and it is true any time you leave the safety of your own four walls. Popular girl is pretty, but she bites. Are you safe if you’re older? No. Popular girls ripen into Karens and lord knows they’re not safe to be around. You may be confused — am I talking about Berlin or people? The popular girls are the people who shape Berlin. They have no specific gender.
What is my conclusion? Berlin is fantastic if and only if you have a thick skin. If you can handle a stranger screaming at you on the street for no reason or a drunk person harassing you, you will enjoy a city full of sunshine, culture, delicious food, and endless things to do. Just make sure the popular girls like you.

This post is describing the best photography spots in Berlin. Most importantly these are not touristy places but the best for fine art and portrait photography. I do not mention such places as Brandenburger Tor or East-Side Gallery because it’s an author’s blog and I don’t try to make another copy-paste post about some landmarks of Berlin. I also work as a portrait photographer in Berlin and tried them out myself. If you search for unusual and interesting places to take pictures — this is the right place!
Hopefully, there are quite some photography lovers in Berlin who are also using Medium.
I will always update this list with the best photography spots in Berlin when I find new ones.
If you are coming from outside this platform and would like to read my articles for free you can also subscribe to my blog here
These are only my opinion on which locations are working well, but, of course, the photographer defines how the pictures will look like and not the locations.
I would say of course there’s no perfect place for photography, each photography project requires a different atmosphere, but yet some areas have a lot to offer while others are more generic. This post will be for mid-range pictures and photographers who prefer lenses between 35–70mm. It’s best to use prime lenses for learning photography. I would…

Coming June, we’ll have completed two years in Berlin. And let me tell you this: Berlin is not the easiest city to love at first. There, I’ve said it upfront.
When I first moved to Berlin, I didn’t get it. I had moved from Luxembourg, a rich-people’s rich country with rich-looking houses and squeaky-clean streets. Even the air there tasted rich. Compared to that, Berlin felt… rough around the edges. Littered roads, worn-out buildings, and unsmiling faces with austere eyes. A month in, and I was less than dazzled by the city. Nothing quite felt quaint, classic European about it — not the homes, not the streets, not the people, nothing. And this was when we lived in the allegedly prettier, greener, cleaner part of the city. For a while, I sulked like a brat refusing to eat lunch because they didn’t like what was served. But after a few months of indifference, boredom made me curious about what all the fuss was about Berlin being ‘so cool, so amazing, such a vibe’. And, boy, was I surprised!
Cut to a year later:
The more I wandered through Berlin’s history, art and subcultures, the more I read about its history, the more I witnessed its evidence pulsing at every turn (and underground), the more I submitted to its quirks and contradictions, the more the city grew on me.
This is, however, not a list of the historical and cultural milestones of the city, Google’s got that covered. This is about a weirdly funny realisation that crept up on me as I went about befriending the city.
The realisation? Berlin is a Scorpio, through and through: intense, magnetic, often misunderstood.
If I had to describe Berlin in five words, they’d be: Wall. Underground. Non-conformist. Creative. Transforming — each, a reflection of Scorpio’s soul.
Here’s why I think so.
The Berlin we know today rose from the ashes of Cold War destruction; the city quite literally rebuilt itself from ruins. Much like the Scorpio’s strength that lies in its unwavering resilience in the face of adversities to emerge victorious, Berlin’s greatest triumph is its inspiring story of resurrection. That Scorpio-spirit of reinvention pulses through daily life and subcultures: fashion that is not luxury but lived-in-cool; vintage, thrifting, and second-hand culture; abandoned spaces and empty lots upscaled into clubs, flea markets, event hubs, galleries, community gardens, and other breathing ecosystems, all without erasing their past. The city’s reinvention, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the city’s diverse subcultures mirror the Scorpio lifecycle: death, rebirth, and transformation.
This rebirth was not a one-shot event; it was a slow-burning movement that simmered through the 1970s and 80s in the abandoned factories and shunned industrial underbelly of the city. During these decades of secret underground rebellion against the Soviets emerged a palpable flood of creativity — punk, techno, dark comedy, graffiti, alternative museums — all forms of raw, unapologetic expression.
Unlike many other underground subcultures that eventually succumbed to the mainstream, Berlin has fiercely protected its exclusive, elusive and effervescent aura — a classic Scorpio move. The city is not trying to be seen. The city is not trying to impress. It chooses what to reveal, channeling mystery, secrecy, and that unmistakable magnetic pull of a Scorpio.
This night crawler lurks in plain sight, unleashing its passion and poison after the dark — much like the city’s nightlife and club culture. You know what they say about a Scorpio? Even when they’re incognito, you feel them. Same with Berlin.
If underground is one definition of Berlin, unconventional is the other. A city where weird is normal and kinky is loved, where vanilla is boring and edgy is celebrated, Berlin openly embraces what others may turn away from: the grey skies, the black moods, and even their dark history. Here, fashion is not the classic European chic; here, fashion has no rules and no boundaries. Sexy or minimalistic, both are welcome with zero judgement. In fact, goth is Berlin’s gospel and black, a no-nonsense dress code that the city loyalists swear by.
In essence, if counter-culture had a face, Berlin would be the poster child. This non-conformist vibe, however, is not a sign of smugness or arrogance. In fact, the city is not trying to please, it is simply comfortable being its honest self. Unapologetically unpretentious, often misunderstood — that’s Berlin. That’s Scorpio.
An interesting fact: beneath a Scorpio’s calm exterior is relentless desire for personal transformation and self-discovery — much like Berlin’s pulsating creative industry that is home to several cultural entrepreneurs, international artists, and media and entertainment companies. The city boasts a creative diversity few others can match. In Berlin, even when you’re alone, you’re never truly lonely. It blooms and booms with a plethora of passions: from pottery to poetry, hiking to pilates, stand-up comedy to gender fluidity, fetish and BDSM to role-play, drag to queer cabaret. There’s something for everyone here. Berlin knows no bounds when it comes to exploring emotional needs, a spirit that resonates deeply with the passionate and emotionally intense Scorpio.
Today, a part of the Berlin Wall remain, standing proud as a symbol of courage, creativity, and hope. Despite the unification of ideologies between East and West, a beautiful contradiction continues to exist in Berlin. Here, punk, goth, and kink co-exist with healing and mindfulness practices like yoga and breath-work, dance collectives, and gong baths. Here, edgy street culture blends with literature and intellectualism (you could literally meet a tattooed person in a hoodie in a bar and later learn that they’re working on a PhD). Berlin is as much about pride parades, climate protests, and anti-fascist graffiti, as it is about Prinzessinnengarten and community gardening workshops focused on rebuilding and nurturing. This is a city that supports radical, divergent fluidity, yet at same time converges like a moody monotonous canvas of black fashion and grey skies.
And finally, as journalist Emily Schultheis puts it: “Germans are increasingly debating how to balance their country’s collective responsibility for the past with a sense of national pride in the country’s achievements and culture.”
The contradictions — fiercely private vs. burning the dance floor, deeply emotional vs. capable of profound detachment, outwardly calm vs. fervent on the inside, constantly transforming and reinventing — all are quintessential Scorpio traits that Berlin embodies.
So, yes, Berlin may not have been the easiest city for me to love at first. The poignant history and lyrical culture aside, it comes with challenges that can feel monumentally frustrating in everyday life. Unless you are into — or open to exploring — the niche, alternative universe Berlin offers, you may not really get to taste the spicy flavour that makes Berlin uniquely Berlin. And without its one-of-a-kind charm, the city might feel like something you’ve already experienced elsewhere in Europe.
For me, the key to falling for Berlin was staying open, just like you would with a Scorpio: peeling back its layers of the unexpected, while also discovering everything else that makes it special — the food, the history, the warm summers, the lake-side picnics, the beautiful libraries, the green spaces, the inclusivity, the hundreds of fun things to do — all of which more than make up for some of the things I may never get to experience.
To me, this city is not all about fairytales; it is a dark romance. And that’s okay. Because Berlin is also a city with undeniably unique character. It is not classically beautiful, but it owns its scars. It does not always feel warm and welcoming, but it lets you be whoever you want with absolute acceptance. And once you learn to enjoy its many shades, it keeps you captivated.
The thing is, falling in love — and staying in love — with the complex, contradictory, beautiful chaos of a Scorpio takes time, patience, understanding, and a whole lot of emotional investment. And it’s absolutely worth it. Just like Berlin.

Rich history… these are the first words that come to mind when I think about Berlin. I was so interested in how much history is on display from this city in everyday spaces and museums. I loved how the city did not try to hide events of the holocaust or World War II but rather seeks to put it fully on display to make sure that folks never forget the horrendous events and make sure that it never happens again.
Learning about the Berlin Wall and being able to see and touch it in person was a very chilling experience. I could not truly grapple with how recent these events were and how life varied dramatically from then to now.
During our time in Berlin we did a lot of different tours and museums but one guided tour we had was particularly memorable for because of the detail we received. We saw a memorial that included time stamps of how some events unfolded on the day that the Berlin Wall fell. Understanding what that experience must have been like for some many East Germans was truly special. I am grateful to have learned more about what life was like during the Cold War at the DDR museum. The DDR museum showed a bit more about the ways in which life in east Germany was actually happening, from domestic life, cars, to military, we learned so much.
Lastly, our time in the Bundestag was memorable. Being able to watch the debate was interesting. Although I wish my German was better so I’d be able to fully comprehend the conversation, I still got a lot out of seeing democracy in action. I was left feeling more interested in how German politics compares to US Politics in terms of efficiency and polarization. I think there are actually a lot of similarities when thinking about the rise of Germany’s Far right party, the AfD, and some political factions in the US.
Although, I was sad to see the trip end so soon, I’m really glad that our last stop was in Berlin. Berlin to me encompassed the crux of it all in Germany. It had the culture, the rich history, the walkability, and so much more. I will cherish the memories made on this program and all the knowledge that I gained learning about sustainability.

Back in May I have announced, that I received an invitation from the Berlin Buzzwords org team to record live onsite.
The invite to do so actually came already for 2023, but due to family reasons I could not attend. It was a happy and an exciting moment to be able to finally come to Berlin to my favorite tech conference and record LIVE episodes with the speakers! In 2022 we have already spoken at the conference with Aarne Talman, our talk recording can be viewed here. Back then I have tried out an experimental format of recording an episode with conference participants. It felt nice, that this idea caught the attention of the conference org team.
The first episode I have recorded this year was with Doug Turnbull. It was also the first time we have met in person, although already in 2013 we have simultaneously attended the Lucene Revolution conference in Dublin. It turns out about that time Doug has also co-created Quepid, the tool I’ve been loud about for evaluating your search quality.
In this episode Doug shares how he thinks about everything he does as an act of learning in public: blogging, open source, book writing, speaking — I’d even add his posts on LinkedIn. Personally, I learn a lot from his thought leadership in search.
I will keep updating this blog post with more episodes I’ve recorded — so stay tuned! As usual, you will get to listen to these episodes on your lovely audio platforms — be sure to subscribe to be notified of new episodes.
And enjoy your summer!

Sociology is beautiful. Sociology is synonymous with stories, narratives, mythology, folktales, fantasies, fairytales and legends, foretold for generations and centuries by through the oral renderings of people : elders, grandparents etc. Myths are told and retold.
There is no better way to understand society without myths and folktales. We are nothing without stories.
Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué, a German author was the creator of the fable Undine (1811). The famous myth creature from European tradition called Undine, a water nymph who becomes human because of the love of a mortal man but will be forced to return to the water if he is unfaithful.
Some characteristics of Undine :
Must Watch : Undine (2020)
I love water, oceans and lakes, mermaids and Berlin. And this movie had it all! Undine is a modern-day fairytale romance, between diver and water nymph, successfully bringing the myth of Undine to life.
I made a list of locations and places in this movie I fell in love with and visited on numerous occasions. Nothing like wondering the streets of Berlin.
2. Berlin Hauptbahnhof, Berlin, Germany
3. Märkisches Museum, Am Köllnischen Park 5, Berlin, Germany
4. Spreebogenpark, Tiergarten, Berlin, Germany
5. Hackescher Markt

At first, just like any city, Berlin is full of strange faces and smells, the traffic sounds like most city noise, the streets full of tempting offers, doorways that lead into dark passages and cellars, and the next corner with its posted signs suggesting that you walk this way, or that way to discover a new experience, can make you feel as if a good weekend stay is ahead of you. But when your friend, whom you came to visit, takes you by the hand and leads you away from the shops, and into the real Berlin city, you may just, if lucky, begin to feel the magic of a city that holds secrets and temptations that have been the cause of some many a nomad to stop and become a villager, to settle and give up wandering through the world.
A visit to the hot spots of town where you can drink, dance, and meet all sorts in one night, becomes an introduction to a city that clearly offers everything for any taste.
To see the malls and the boulevards of Berlin that connect the present with the past. The old streets that…

It is the spring of 2003, midway through my first year in graduate school, and my friend Nathan had earlier that day acquired a used vinyl copy of David Bowie’s Station to Station from Amoeba Music. Some months later, we are driving down Sunset Boulevard listening to the song “Negativland” from Neu!’s 1972 debut album. Again, an ominous quasi-industrial noise, something like a jackhammer, leads off the track. Again, a muffled guitar squeals in the background, defiantly on its own trip as Michael Rother’s plodding baseline and Klaus Dinger’s motorik-beat propel the song forward. Again I explain, “This is the sound of postmodernism. . .”
Julian Knox, David Bowie and Romanticism, pp. 117–118
Bowie’s Berlin period is both famous and misunderstood. Well before the end of 1976 Bowie’s cocaine addiction had led him in and out of psychosis, dropped him to 90 lbs. on a diet of peppers and milk, and pushed him to the point of death. He knew he had to leave the United States and its easy availability of drugs just to save his life. In late 1976, he and his wife Angie moved to Switzerland, where they purchased a house. The couple was largely estranged by this point, alternating their time spent in the house rather than living together, and Bowie eventually moved to Berlin to share an apartment with Iggy Pop, whose career was floundering after the breakup of the Stooges.
Check out the iTunes playlist for David Bowie and Romanticism.
Bowie’s work after moving to Europe included co-writing and producing two albums for Iggy, both in 1977: The Idiot (recorded in Switzerland, final mixing in Berlin) and Lust for Life (Berlin). These albums most famously produced the songs “China Girl,” a later hit for David Bowie rerecorded for the album Let’s Dance (1983), and “Lust for Life,” Pop’s signature song. Bowie wrote music and Pop lyrics on both songs. Bowie then teamed up with Tony Visconti as producer and Brian Eno as collaborator on the albums Low (1977) and “Heroes” (1977).
Bowie wrapped up his work at the Hansa studio in Berlin with the soundtrack for his performance of Brecht’s Baal (1981). Lodger (1979), typically mentioned as the last of Bowie’s Berlin Trilogy, and the last album on which he collaborated with Brian Eno until 1995’s 1. Outside, was recorded in Switzerland and New York, not Berlin.
Watch “Station to Station” live on YouTube.
Julian Knox’s “Too Late to be Late Again: David Bowie, the Late 1970s, and Romanticism,” chapter 6 of David Bowie and Romanticism, explores the arrival of the “European canon” in Bowie’s music from Station to Station through the Berlin Trilogy to Scary Monsters against the background of German electronica, German Romanticism, Byron, and Coleridge — and his own personal life and growth.
Bowie’s Romanticism in this chapter is described as “a philosophy of artistic creation as self-disclosure, not through purportedly unfiltered, unmediated ‘sincerity,’ but rather through permutation and flux. . . [which] lies at the heart of a major strand of Romantic aesthetics, articulated by Coleridge in his appraisal of Shakespeare-as-Proteus: ‘to become by the power of Imagination another thing–Proteus, a river, a lion, yet still the God felt to be there’” (p. 122). Read more in David Bowie and Romanticism. Pick up a copy in The Bookstore or ask your local, college, or university library to order it.
Julian Knox is Assistant Professor of English at Georgia College & State University, where he teaches Romanticism, the eighteenth century, and Victorian literature, and where he coordinates the M.A. Program in Literature.

(In Search of George Wyllie’s Berlin Burd)
Last month, as one of the minders at The George Wyllie Foundation social media (For The Burds) I received an interesting late night message from Stevie Neil. Stevie is a member of the of the Ayrshire Ukulele Clan.
As a homage to George Wyllie’s favourite instrument, Stevie and the Clan played on the opening night of the George Wyllie Paper Boat exhibition at the Scottish Maritime Museum, Irvine back at beginning of July. (Exhibition continues until Monday 26th September)
While looking at the exhibition, Stevie became intrigued by the story of George Wyllie’s five-metre high Berlin Burd sculpture. George sited this gangly creature beside a section of the (four-metre high) Berlin Wall in 1988 just weeks before the wall came down.
George Wyllie made this Burd from stainless steel in Scotland and and transported across Europe to Berlin to look over the Berlin Wall. He worked with local school-children in Berlin and The George Wyllie Foundation has since been in touch with a few of the kids who remember the experience fondly.
At the time, given the political sensitivities surrounding the wall, politicians in Berlin were very cagey about giving George permission for such a project. One of the planning officials said to George at the time: “Ein vogel ist keen stein,” (“a bird is not a stone”).
This appealed to George’s sense of the absurd. Which of course the Burd was. As was the Wall. Despite the Burd not being a stone, George was given permission to place it beside the wall so that it keeked over it.
The George Wyllie Foundation (of which I am a Trustee) has always been a wee bit mystified as to the exact location of the big Berlin Burd. A couple of years ago, when his wee brother Burd found a permanent nest in The Scottish Parliament at Holyrood in Edinburgh, we made some enquiries but our lack of German stymied our attempts to track him down.
Intrigued, Stevie decided to seek out this giant flightless wonder for himself…
Stevie wrote to us: “I’ve just returned from Berlin where I managed to track down the Berlin Burd with the help of a German-speaking friend and some helpful locals.
“I found an article on the Burd on the Whysman education website and sent the link to my friend Amanda as we were heading to Berlin on holiday and thought it might be good to try to track it down.
“Amanda noticed from the picture in the article that it was in the French Quarter and did a bit more research on German websites before we left for Berlin. Once there we went to the area and went walkabout, initially without success.
“Amanda, who is fluent in German, then asked at the information office in a shopping mall whether anyone knew of it. No one did, but we were directed across the road to a small building where a representative of the factor responsible for maintenance of ‘monuments’ had a small office.
“Amanda made enquiries there and after a couple of phone calls we were directed further up the road.
IS IT A BURD…?
“I must say that while I had the notion of finding the Burd it was Amanda who did all the hard work and emailed the factor to advise of our success. It was also Amanda who translated the plaque for me and gave the explanatory notes.”
THE PLAQUE READS:
George Wyllie put up the Berlin Burd on the West Berlin side of the Wall on 1st December 1988 as part of a cultural initiative with children from schools in the Märkische Viertel under close observation by the East German police.On 9th November 2009 the Berlin Burd was finally moved to the former route of the Wall in memory of the Fall of the Wall.
Reinickendorf Youth Arts School Atrium
Explanatory notes:
The Berlin Burd is located on Wilhelmsruherdamm, near numbers 61–63, in the Märkisches Viertel, Reinickendorf, Berlin. It is on the route of the Wall marking the border between West and East Berlin, today between the administrative districts of Reinickendorf and Pankow.
The Märkisches Viertel or Quarter is the name of the large housing estate built in the 60s and 70s on West Berlin’s northeastern fringe.
The Jugendkunstschule Atrium or Youth Arts School is a local council funded institution which offers classes, projects, after school activities and workshops in all areas of the arts for children and youth in the area.
The date 9th November 2009 was the 20th Anniversary of the Fall of the Wall.
The George Wyllie Foundation would like to say a BIG thanks to Stevie and Amanda for all their sterling efforts in tracking down The Berlin Burd and saying hello. It’s very much appreciated!
You can read all about George Wyllie and the many influences which shaped his life and artworks (including the Berlin Burd) in Arrivals and Sailings: The Making of George Wyllie by me (Jan Patience) and Louise Wyllie (Polygon, £25)

Right before Christmas, I had a wonderful chat with the Italian pastry chef Riccardo about baking, gastronomy, and quality over quantity food philosophy.
Navigating past two Turkish kiosks, an abandoned Uzbek restaurant, and a vibrant Argentinian empanada eatery, I finally reached the acclaimed Albatross Bakery on a rainy December afternoon. Culture fusion continued as I could see a fridge full of Italian sausages and cheeses along with organic German eggs from the outskirts of Berlin right beside a display proudly showcasing Panettones and German mulled wine. This imagery of flavours gives a snippet into the multicultural essence of Berlin; through food, you can journey through its history, learn and experience different communities that call this free-spirited city home.
Walking into the snug space of this Kreuzberg gem, the rich aroma of espresso notes hit my nose right away. Good coffee is not the main star here, though very important to accompany the praised Queen B pastry or a phenomenal and totally unexpected crem brulee croissant. Everything I tried was bursting with flavour and I didn’t even get to breads yet.
Pastry sizes are generously big here, and most would be happy about it. My partner had a different opinion, which I contemplated and eventually agreed with. The issue with regular pastry sizes in highly rated and ‘viral’ bakeries is that you want to try bits and pieces of each of them and not get stuffed. Has anyone ever considered mini-bite-sized pastries? The ones you get at the hotel breakfast buffet?!
One of the skilled Italian pastry chefs welcomed me warmly and showed me around as I introduced myself and my obsession with local bakeries. Riccardo proudly said that almost 90% of the produce in the bakery is organic and most come from Germany. Germans are real appreciators of bread and sourcing local ingredients is surely important for the younger generation, especially in a progressive city like Berlin.
Almond Croissant
Almond Croissant is a classic for me. The key is not to oversweeten it and make the almond paste flavour shine. Albatross made it work for my taste. The croissant was soft and not too crunchy on top. Sometimes I feel like bakeries overbake them until the hard biscuit-like texture forms on top, which I am not a fan of. If you feel like almond, marzipan and a soft pleasantly sweet buttery croissant — I’d say you’ve got some of the best in Berlin Almond Croissants here at Albatross Bakery.
Crem Brulee Croissant
I wasn’t the fan of a cronut — a well-known attempt to marry two unrelated in my humble opinion pastries. But it turned out to be surprisingly scrumptious. Not an overly sweet and well-balanced creation. I just love seeing such creative combinations of two fantastic on-its-own desserts It’s an act of courage. I recently saw a combo of cheesecake + baklava and I am still thinking about it. It can go either wrong or oddly good. This was the latter and I would certainly come back for more.
Queen B
This one I saw raving reviews about and had to test it. It was good. Really good. For the crunchy pastry fans especially. Unless you consider it cookie then. The pastry is quite well-baked and not much softness left inside. It was more like a combo of a buttery flaky caramelised cookie and a pastry. It was salty on top with sea salt flakes enhancing the caramel flavour. I loved the combination of flavours and would highly recommend trying it. For my preference, I do enjoy a variety of textures in a pastry and this one had the crunch dominating the entire experience.
Brownie
If you like your brownies fudgy and not spongy, this one is for you. It was like eating a fudge yummy candy. It is accidentally gluten-free as they use a tiny bit of starch instead of flour to attain the gooey texture.
Panettone
I am sure I wasn’t the only one attacked by panettone videos this year. I was curious to understand what is so special about panettone and maybe replace the usual “kučiukai” we eat during Christmas in Lithuania with the proud Italian sweet brioche.
What’s special about panettone?
Panettone is a rich and flavourful sweet brioche usually made from first class flour, egg yolks, lots of butter & raisins. Quality ingredients is the key here, no shortcuts. The one I tested had Sicilian mandarines and extra dark chocolate on top.
Italians also have Pandoro, which is kind of a brother of panettone. It is a bit more plain in flavour, without a filling inside.
For the artisanal panettone, stiff Italian sourdough is usually used, which requires much more skill and time than traditional bread sourdough. The long fermentation process, special skill required and top-quality ingredients are what make a price difference.
The best tip from an Italian pastry chef was to make sure you heat your panettone for a little bit so it becomes more fragrant and soft.
I picked one up and my family ended up with three different panettones this year. It was so soft and fluffy that we ate it easily on its own. I had some recipes in mind on how to use up ‘old’ panettone (french toasting it or whipping up mascarpone as a spread). Safe to say that no ‘old’ panettone was left in our house. And I am already thinking about the flavour I want to try next year, which is a pistachio-filled one.
Albatross Bakery also has a Pistachio Croissant that I didn’t try and a rotating Seasonal Danish that changes every few months depending on the local ingredients.
Have a flaky weekend and a buttery Monday:)

An ex-pat turned local’s favorite photo spots
If you have read any of my articles before, you know I love history. Huge fan. So indulge me as I walk you through a bit of Berlin’s history. Berlin first appears in the history books in the 1200s. Its strategic location along the river Spree allowed it to become a hotspot for traders and mercantile. There was even a sister city, Kölln, nearby, but as Berlin grew, it ended up engulfing the city with it.
The story of Berlin begins around Nikolaiviertel, or Nicolas Quarter. Here the Nikolaikirche dominates the small square surrounded by rebuilt shops and restaurants that give you a feel of how Berlin would have looked before the war.
As Berlin grew it would later become the capital and permanent residence of the Hohenzollern’s, the electoral princes of Brandenburg, in the 1400s. The city would later become the capital city of the Prussian empire and in the 1700s would expand and grow, adding palaces and infrastructure worthy of a capital city.
Things would stay this way until the World Wars. Berlin was destroyed and divided and served as the playground for the world powers after World War II. This split history would also lead to different alternative movements, the Berlin Wall, and different architectural styles. Which leads us to the now — the alternative, “poor but sexy” Berlin that attracts millions each year.
As a photographer and lover of history and architecture, my favorite photo spots revolve around my favorite historical places. But, to keep this interesting, I will not just point out my favorite locations, but where you should go to shoot the best shots. Now there are things that factor in to this, like construction, etc., but these are generally the best locations that I like to shoot from.
Nikolaiviertel — A tragically missed location in most people’s visit to Berlin, the Nikolaiviertel is the historic heart of the city. Don’t make that mistake. It is right by both Museum Island as well as the Rotes Rathaus, so just take an hour here, even plan lunch or dinner. You won’t regret it! Also, if you do a river cruise through here you get a really great view of the quarter from the river.
Berliner Dome — The Berliner Dome is stunning from all angles. Hike to the top for views over the city, and find new angles along the spree. My favorite spot is back by James-Simon Park, but I also love the view from the other bridge, from Marx & Engels Park.
Gendarmenmarkt — The twin churches that surround the theatre is probably the greatest example of Berlin in its prime. Built in the 1700s, this square is the perfect place to wander and explore new angles to shoot. I love the view from the stairs of the church, or if you can stitch a panorama then smack dab in the middle is where you want to be!
Berlin Wall — The Berlin Wall can be seen from all over the city. There is the section by Checkpoint Charlie, as well as the famous East Side Gallery. This is where all of the graffiti is, and next Oberbaumbrücke as well, so you can easily combine those things!
Teufelsberg — Devil’s Mountain, the famous old NSA spy grounds during the cold war, has some of the best graffiti you will find. In the middle area you will find a tractor. Amazing prop to add some depth to your photography.
TV Tower — The iconic Soviet TV Tower stands tall in Berlin and can be seen from almost anywhere. Literally. You can climb it and photograph the city from above, or search for all sorts of different locations to nail the view. There is the top of the Berliner Dome, Hackescher Markt, and even out by Brandenburg Gate. I also love the view from Prenzlauer Allee as you move further back from the tower (as long as you have a zoom lens mind you).
Brandenburg Gate — The iconic Brandenburg Gate will definitely make it on your photo list, and for good reason. If you can, and the weather is good, wake up for sun rise and you can get stunning light coming through. If not, sunset works from the other direction just as well!
Schloss Charlottenburg — The little escape from Berlin provides amazing photo opportunities as well as beautiful parks to stroll around. The photo at the front gate is incredible, but back by the bridge in the gardens there is always some amazing reflections you can get!
Reichstag/Bundestag — the seat of parliament and the German government is really a stunning building. Get tickets in advance to climb the iconic glass dome, or simply walk around it. The view from the river by Marie-Elisabeth-Lüders-Haus is stunning, as are both side angles. Generally the front on picture isn’t my favorite as there is dead grass and generally police boxes stationed there, but you can take one there too if you want! Also, the view from Brandenburg Gate is also really cool!
Oberbaumbrücke — A stunning bridge from the pre-war time, the Oberbaumbrücke is an amazing location to shoot. Try up close, up the roads a little bit, from the s-bahn stop, and then my personal favorite is from the water around Hotel nhow Berlin.
If you made this far I would like to reward you with my map of my locations. Thank you for reading, and what are your favorite locations in Berlin and where do you shoot them from?

One shy tweet promoted the first meetup of Berlin’s Zebras on Eventbrite, but the almost disproportionately large interest in the Zebras Unite movement started by four female US founders proved that the mission has hit a nerve in Germany’s capital. An old colleague of mine, among others, texted that he is thrilled to see Zebras in Berlin, as he was passively following the movement for a while.
Zebras stand for a company model countering the existing startup and venture capital culture. Instead of striving for fast exits and exponential growth at all costs, Zebra companies want to grow sustainably, honor diversity and inclusion, and work both towards profit and benefiting the public (read the manifesto). It’s something we desperately need in a society increasingly overtaken by the centralized services of tech giants bowing to shareholder interests rather than serving the public.
The first meetup of Zebras Unite in Berlin took place on December 4th in Mozilla’s office. After almost 30 registrations, Zebras Berlin had the pleasure to convene a group of 10 who made it through the grey Berlin weather to Kreuzberg.
After a short introduction, the round anonymous faces revealed themselves to be a diverse mix of founders, activists, consultants, and ex-academics experienced in financing their ventures with the help of Kickstarter, micro-investors, or entirely bootstrapping it. All were determined not to lose control of their businesses, but at the same time struggling with navigating the bureaucracy and fundraising landscape. Women founders shared their struggles with bias against women in tech, which led us to discuss the systemic issues behind the horrendous statistics on the diversity in the European startup scene (93% of all funds raised by European VC-backed companies in 2018 went to all-male founding teams).
We discussed how the idea of a Zebra company translates into the German and European reality. Entrepreneur and activist Evgeni Kouris introduced us to a cause he is leading, tailored to the German market and closely aligned with Zebra values: #NewMittelstand.
We wondered how we can encourage the often conservative investors with access to the “old money” in Germany to open up to new kinds of companies. We mentioned the challenge of measuring impact versus profit and the need for innovative investors who “get it” and are willing to take the risk, as well as founders who stand by their values, even under pressure. Because a pressure for exponential impact can be as detrimental as the pressure for exponential growth of profits.
We discussed the role education can and needs to play in this context. We joked we need a “sustainerator” instead of an “accelerator” in the startup ecosystem. Lastly, one of the founders wondered if there is a way to grow your business without taking any external money, which started a discussion about scaling and its challenges.
All in all, we all saw the need to unite in a smart way and raise visibility for the ideas that are already growing in different sectors and communities. Through events, education, meetups and emotional support and skills sharing, Zebras seemed like a great umbrella to talk about a change that is cultural at its core.
We know that once we get people thinking, actions will follow.
We would like to extend an invitation to local founder communities, and investors to talk about what we can do together.

Berlin has an extensive subway network — 10 lines, 170 stations, 151.7 kilometers of rail. The network transports 507 million passengers every year.
In 2014, I photographed all those signs. The end result is one giant poster and a few (not that useful) learnings!
I’m certain not many people have seen every station along the Berlin subway network. Especially if you’re not from here, there really is no reason to go to Hönow, Wittenau or Rudow. Early last year, I decided that my photography project of the year would be to document all the subway station signs of the city. While the project itself might have gotten slightly redundant after a while, the spaces in between, waiting for the next train, walking out to explore a random neighborhood, or chatting with people confused by the bearded, foreign looking dude jumping in and out of the train at every stop, made for a very exciting experience.
Initially, I thought to code a routing algorithm that would calculate the optimal path (too lazy), and to explore the area around every stop (same). In the end, I managed to snap my last photo in the evening of Dec 30th, barely making it in time. And while I wouldn’t mind retaking some photos in the future, this project is done for now. Here are some observations I made along the way, a beauty contest, and a great poster by my friend Michael
A clear pattern arises after riding a few lines from center to end. Barring the shorter lines, and those that only span the city center, younger people and “expats” are prominent in the central third of every route, the second third is full of immigrants, and in the outer , almost only native Germans are anywhere to be seen.
I postponed the U5 trip for as long as possible, and ended up doing it with my flatmate on Dec 30th. The line is fucked up, for lack of a better word. We drove up and down three times because I didn’t feel comfortable stepping out at one particular station (Hellersdorf). The last station on the U5, Hönow, felt like a remnant of a long gone era, grey, lifeless, and fenced off. The new U55 (the so called “Chancellor’s line”, which one day will become part of the U5) is a markedly clean and shiny contrast.
For a lot of people, particularly expats, people in startups and hipsters, the U8 is the lifeline of the city. Apart from a few stops towards the northern end, the signage is relatively bland (or minimalist, this being Berlin).
In the beginning, I assumed that I would have to wait for the next line at every station, which would have taken me ages. Eventually, I established a rhythm wherein I managed to shoot around 8 signs at a time while managing to jump back into the same train.
I avoided taking photos late at night (trains run way less frequently), rush hours (too many people), and ended up shooting most of the lines at around 9pm, and occasionally on a Saturday (trains run less frequently on Sundays too).
I also realized that the best cars to get into are the second from last or first. The stations tend to have more obstructions (kiosks, stairs, etc) towards the middle, and there were always too many people towards the end. The added benefit was that I could still shoot a sign even if there was a train on the opposite track. Barring the weird looks I got from strangers as I hopped in, ran to frame and shoot, and ran back to squeeze in as the doors were closing, this strategy worked perfectly.
In general, the stations in the western part of the city are prettier. Some of the shorter lines (U3, U4) have very intricate, ornate signs that help to mask the distinctly suburban feeling of those lines.
All the above ground stations had the exact same sign (a very functional, sublimely boring one). The abundance of those earned the U1 the title of ugliest line.
Many stations were newly renovated, or under renovation when I photographed them. The general pattern seemed to be the use of modern, minimalist, sans-serif signs.
The longest line in the network, the U7, wins the beauty contest. The stations out west, in particular, are very distinctive.
Enough words. Here are a couple of hi-res posters that Michael helped design — feel free to download, print and use, they’re licensed under Creative Commons by-nc-sa 2.0. I’m happy to share the print versions, or even the original photos (if you have a cool idea that you want to use them for), get in touch @ramz

I spoke with Paul Gurner, owner of the St George’s Bookshop, at Wörther Straße 27 in Prenzlauer Berg. Paul, who had no previous experience in the bookstore business, has been running one of the most successful English bookshops in Berlin since 2003 and is planning to open a larger, second location in the Schöneberg neighborhood in 2017. Paul’s answers to how and why St. George’s came into being might be surprising, as is his attitude to Amazon and other competition from the digital domain. Paul’s responses have been edited.
SK: Have you run a bookstore before? What experience did you bring to the bookselling enterprise?
Wow (he laughs), no one asked whether or not we had experience. We have run businesses before, in England, a couple of businesses, and we were looking for a new project.
You get people coming up from the market [on nearby Kollwitz Straße] and they will come in here and you will ask, are you here ’cause of the market? And they will say, No, we are here ’cause of you.
SK: Where in England?
I grew up in Cambridge, and the business was actually based out of Berkshire, the last one I had. It was furniture.
SK: Ah, so you had a furniture business, this was a furniture business and then you turned it into a bookstore.
Indeed. The shop was empty before we came in here.
SK: Why Berlin?
In 2000, I followed a girlfriend over to Berlin, and she left me stranded here; she moved on to Switzerland or southern Germany, and I stayed. It was a good introduction to the city, although we were in Brandenburg.
SK: So you were looking for a new business, but why an English-language bookshop in a German-speaking country? What made you think, okay that’s what I should do?
We had a lot of books from a business we had invested in. We were going to do some markets and off load them as quickly as possible. But in the end, we decided, I was here anyway, storage here was cheaper, ship ’em across here, have a go.
SK: How many books are we talking?
We had about 20 of these Chesterfield sofas, and 10,000 books. It was ridiculous, actually.
SK: You are not a bibliophile then? You are not crazy about writers and writing…
The bookshop worked cause it’s a business, and we treat it as such. I don’t use it as an excuse to sit around and read; I use it as a business.
SK: How did you come upon 10,000 books?
We — me and my brother — invested into a business that didn’t do too well, a bookshop, and the only thing we could get out of in the end was not our money, but the books. They were well selected, and I think we sold most of those books.
It’s all curated through the customers’ needs. Over the years you see what people want, you see the publishers that sell, you see the authors. There is no doubt that the philosophy is chosen by customers’ orders, but also by the staff.
What was the bookstore landscape like when you first started the shop in 2003?
This was an area where a lot of Americans were coming in, from Charlottenburg, and still quite rough around the edges. It was quite obvious that there should have been a bookshop here.
There were no English bookshops?
There was one in Friedrichshain and we didn’t want to go too close to them. Prenzlauer Berg. It seems a bit obvious, why isn’t anyone there? So we jumped on it as quickly as we could. We got things together and we just opened up, rather naively, but in the end you don’t need a qualification to do it, you don’t need permission to do it, you just do it.
Where do you go to get your books now?
We ship a thousand books across every month from England, used stock. There’s no set place where I do my buying: warehouses that are spread all over the place. I avoid London…over the years you have your set routes, you can find bookshops where you do deals with people. Generally, we get phone calls from people closing shops, downsizing, going online. From a selection of 10,000 to 20,000 books you get a thousand books, you cherry pick them.
Who are you cherry picking, who are you looking for?
From Camus to Ishiguro…Ballard, Nabokov, anyone really, you just got to remember 10,000 names.
At one point you called it a curated collection, can you talk more about that? Curated by whom?
Yeah, it sounds wanky, I know. It’s all curated through the customers’ needs. Over the years you see what people want, you see the publishers that sell, you see the authors. There is no doubt that the philosophy is chosen by customers’ orders, but also by the staff.
In these ten plus years, you have built up your knowledge about books. How many years did it take for the bookstore to take off?
We were really busy from year three and we have kept that. We have a large turn over. This is the first time I have been alone all day.
I think people are slowly reconnecting with browsing. You will have people coming in here with their younger teenage kids and just browse. There was a young mother in here with her 16-year old daughter and they seemed to be having fun, genuine fun looking through the books together.
Are bookstores still thriving in Berlin, and if so, how do they survive in this age of Amazon and internet shopping when they are shutting down elsewhere?
There are more opening up, but there are quite a few closing. Last year we saw two bookshops close that have been there 30 plus years.
So it’s changing here as well?
Exactly. I suppose it’s a bit like clearing out. Bookshops that don’t work close. You got to keep your game up. There was one here in Mitte, four or five years ago, not too far from here, and they closed as well. It must have been an operator error because the customer base is down there. And then another one closed last year. Fair Exchange. They been there donkeys years. They were doing German [books] at the front, English at the back. Again they blamed Amazon…but you just can’t blame Amazon. It’s too easy. Concentrate on your own thing. You never know, I could be ten years down the line and saying the same thing.
So you don’t feel a threat from digital media or Amazon?
Even if everyone in this neighborhood came to us and ordered their books there would be too much work. We don’t advertise, we do our job and people talk about us. It’s worked wonderfully. Amazon do their job and we try to do ours.
I think people are slowly reconnecting with browsing. You will have people coming in here with their younger teenage kids and just browse. There was a young mother in here with her 16-year old daughter and they seemed to be having fun, genuine fun looking through the books together. You can imagine that this is something they might remember. It was actually quite sweet…they sat on the sofa discussing books, and what she’d read and what the daughter might like to read.
Given that 90% of your stock is used, do you cultivate relationships with writers? You said you don’t necessarily have the time or space to do readings.
We don’t get approached that often for readings. People know that we just don’t have the space — if we move everything we can fit about forty people sitting down. We still do poetry readings. It was nice when we first started out…it did make us the customer base…it’s what we would do with the bigger shop in Schöneberg, the shop we are looking to buy, it’s one big room about 90–100 square meters that naturally lends itself to readings.
It’s a bit of a family. I know half the people by sight, probably 20% by name, but purely because my memory with names is terrible. I do wonder about the people who used to be customers, people who have just disappeared off the face of…
Who are your main customers?
You have seen the people who were in here. They were expats, I guess. Expats, not necessarily native English, but I’d say non-German 70/30 during the week, and during the weekend it probably levels out to 50–50, where’s there’s 50% German, maybe growing.
What are the intersections between the German speakers and the Anglophones?
I think the Germans are very slowly realizing that they don’t have to go to these big bookshops to get their books, they don’t have to rely on that kind of traditional way of buying books: they can come to us and we can order the books in and they are considerably cheaper. Amazon is not the cheapest route especially in Germany…
How is the price structure determined in Germany? I know that prices are fixed for books published in Germany, but what about books published in the UK, in the US, elsewhere?
People charge whatever they want.
So there is no regulation on those?
No. We choose to match or beat Amazon prices on 90% of our books, there’s 10% on which we can’t.
I know you don’t have the space for cultivating relationships with writers, but can you talk about cultivating relationships with readers. Do you have neighborhood customers…
It’s a bit of a family. I know half the people by sight, probably 20% by name, but purely because my memory with names is terrible. I do wonder about the people who used to be customers, people who have just disappeared off the face of…
Prenzlauer Berg?
No, our customer base is Berlin, it really isn’t only Prenzlauer Berg. It’s much wider reaching than that. You get people coming up from the market [on nearby Kollwitz Straße] and they will come in here and you will ask, are you here ‘cause of the market? And they will say, No, we are here ‘cause of you.

(continued from here)
I still have “soullessness” as a topic to discuss in this Berlin write-up, but bear with me: we all left the Berlinale bubble to come home to, yes, the infamous coronavirus, news of which had been trickling during the event’s ten days but only really started gushing on its final days.
Because of that, and looking back at this year’s selection, I feel (am I the only one?) a tendency to look at a programme that many considered a “rebirth” of the festival’s posture as a sort of “last hurrah”. Not necessarily for the Berlinale itself, more for the whole concept of the film festival in the 21st century. With other important festivals or film series being cancelled worldwide — New Directors/New Films, South by Southwest, CPH:DOX, Oberhausen, and others — Berlin seemed to have squeezed by before the pandemic lockdown. Does what happened just after the festival colour the way I look back at it? I’m not sure. For all intents and purposes, this was a very intense ten days filled with much ado about nothing — the urban renovation of the Potsdamer Platz area that left festivalgoers short of food options at its heart, the shuttering last December of the Sony Center Cinestar multiplex that deprived the event from…

I’ve spent the last few days in Berlin and I’ve become the person I never thought I’d become.
I now ride e-scooters.
I want to clarify that I have always been one of those people who hates those things. Visit any big city, and they’re literally everywhere. If an e-scooter isn’t hammering past you on the pavement, it’s either clogging up the road in front of your car or strewn across the path after coming into contact with a reveller the night before.
However, in Berlin, those instances are, as one might expect, few and far between. The rentable e-transport scene in Germany’s capital is efficient, and reliable, and it just works.
It also got me thinking about the iPhone. Again.
I’m not one to hold back on my opinion of the iPhone. It is, without question, one of the most impressive pieces of tech I use and rely on every day. It makes running my business easier, it makes taking photos of literally anything a joy, and instances of it letting me down are so infrequent I genuinely can’t remember the last time I had to restart it.

At 65, Mushtaq is full of energy. He listens to audiobooks while painting his next masterpiece, trades the city for a lake or forest at noon, laughs with his entire body and if needed, climbs up the roof of a four story building and breaks into his own apartment through the skylight of a lofty ceiling.
My eyes widened when my host welcomed me into his house. His apartment was packed with works of art. I was thrilled to find out he’s a painter — a real life incarnation of what I wanted to become as a kid. We plunged into an hour long conversation before I even went to see my room.
Our connection grew stronger when Mushtaq mentioned his distant past in Bombay. All the way from my home in Bucharest to his doorstep in Berlin I had been listening to, and absorbed by, Shantaram–a captivating novel taking place in Bombay.
As if the coincidence wasn’t enough, he then says that he not only read the book but even made a painting about it. What? An amazing painting about the book I paused listening to when he greeted me. My short stay at his place was on to a good start.
I came to Berlin to search for a place here. Why Berlin? The question everybody asks. My answer is an even shorter question: Why not? As much as Berlin has to offer, I came here simply to be somewhere else. And so my quest to live abroad begins, until the new place no longer feels “abroad”. What follows after, I’m as curious to find out as anybody asking.
Berlin really does have a lot to offer. Searching for apartments, I mapped at least five neighborhoods by foot. Like a good movie trailer, I caught many glimpses of interesting places–streets, buildings and parks unattached to a story yet, which I’m sure will return to me later as part of a cohesive picture.
For now, I’ll be roaming in Berlin.
This is my first attempt to write a travel journal. Like my trips, it has no clear direction, but I have a good feeling about it and I’m curious to see it unfold. Posts will be brief, disconnected and flooded with photos. My story might feel distant if we haven’t met, but you–just by reading it–are part of it and you’re welcome to say hello.

The streets of Berlin are bristling with art and graffiti. Being new in town I decided to buy some pens and leave my mark.
I’ve always enjoyed those terse epigrams scrawled across bathroom walls so I chose some quotes from great writers and set out on a bar tour across town.
The bars of Neukölln are dark and grimy dens or creativity — the perfect place for poignant art. At each stop I would order a beer, find a toilet, and start writing.
Update
Found something I’d written hastily as someone’s profile image on Grindr; made me laugh. A friend also spotted one on Instagram. Nice to know people appreciate your work!

I was in Berlin, Germany, on May 8th; the 80th anniversary of the day that German forces surrendered unconditionally to the Allies, marking the end of WW2 in Europe. This day is sometimes referred to as “VE Day” (Victory in Europe Day). What a fitting place to be for this momentous occasion.
I have been in Berlin twice before. My first visit, in the summer of 1963 when I was 15 years old, was as part of a “teen tour” of Europe. Asleep in a Berlin hotel, I was awakened by gunfire. The construction of the Berlin Wall (at first, a barbed wire fence) began in August 1961 and in the years following, many people were shot as they tried to escape from East into West Berlin.
My second visit was 24 years ago, as part of a small group from the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, visiting historic sites in Eastern Europe that included memorials, museums, and several concentration camps. Sachsenhausen, one such camp near Berlin, is in the village of Oranienburg. It began as a slave labor camp for “political prisoners” with many subcamps. Still visible are barracks and the ruins of buildings in which remain the remnants of a gas chamber, medical experimentation areas, torture and killing areas, and several crematoria. Prisoners were treated inhumanely, inadequately fed, and openly killed. If you are reading this article, you probably know the list of who would be considered enemies of the state. A partial list includes those against the Reich whether they were Christian, Protestant, Jewish, Coptic, Roma, Communists, Gays, and anyone who was perceived to be mentally or physically disabled. This camp, not unlike others, was not on the outskirts of town. It was in the town. An alleyway separates the town from the gates to the camp with the words “Arbeit Macht Frei” (Works Sets You Free) welded into the gate. This place was not hidden. Quite the contrary, it was wide open to view and more importantly to odor. With several crematoria where bodies were burned, the smell and the ash wafted over the town, falling onto people’s rose gardens as well as onto the town residents themselves.
But I digress. Twenty four years ago, when I visited this camp, there was a person with us who, as a young man, had been a prisoner in Sachsenhausen. Somehow, miraculously, he survived. A Christian man, he had been a journalist, soon to be married, but that did not happen. It was a privilege to see the camp through his eyes, and listen as he recounted his experiences, some of which he had thought he buried along with his fellow inmates.
This was a sacred place whose stories were told to keep alive the memory of those who perished and those who survived. For decades after the war ended, “Never Again” was repeated to ensure that this kind of unleashed hatred and vitriol, resulting in these sorts of inhuman actions, would never happen again. And most of us in the world were confident that nothing like this could ever happen again!
This visit was different.
First, I am different. I am 24 years older. What I try to convince myself of is “unbelievable.” I need to believe.
Second, the world is different. Hatred, vitriol, and cruelty have become normalized. The vile antisemitic tropes that were used to degrade and denigrate people are not only ripe, but they are blossoming. Regrettably, in many places, they are in full bloom. This kind of hate flourishes on the dark web, and in the full light of day. Repulsive speech and actions have become acceptable. Throughout the world we see the rise of political parties with slogans reminiscent of a world which we thought could never be resurrected. And not only is it resurrected, but these parties have also gained representation in congresses and parliaments in the same countries where brave citizens sacrificed and fought against this to make the world safe for all.
Third, the camp is not the same. Shockingly, there are some people who visit the camp, stand next to the crematory ruins, on the rim of the entrance of the first experiment for a gas chamber, beside the remains of a barracks, who say: “this did not happen.” When you tell a lie often enough, people tend to believe it. That’s what happened prior to and during World War II. And in many parts of our world, it is happening now.
I am at a time in my life when more people than not ask me “When are you going to retire?” Here’s my response. Not only am I not going to retire, I am also committing to rededicate myself to engaging in education programs and social justice issues concerning basic human rights related to antisemitism and anti-LGBTQ hatred. All in, in my “golden years” I will not stand by and silently witness the normalization of hatred.
I write this article with both a heavy and a hopeful heart. When I say things are unbelievable, I reinforce in my own mind that I shouldn’t believe them. I am awake to the reality and the knowledge that I must believe what I see, hear, and witness. When I believe it, I will be able to address it in ways that, hopefully, will change where we are, and where we can go as a civil society.
We can choose hate, or we can choose to stand up to hate. We can be silent, or we can call people out when they say or do things that are rooted in prejudice and hate. Each of us can use our voice and our platform for good. We can choose to make excuses for bad behavior, or we can call it out. We can acquaint ourselves with history. We can familiarize ourselves with the consequences when hate is permitted to run amok. We can call out when we see lies presented as truth. And we can challenge people who are fearful or intimidated into saying and behaving in ways that are unacceptable.
When we sit by as people are being dehumanized, referred to as the “other,” we are at the entrance to the gates of Hell. I went through those gates as a tourist. I’ve listened to and read testimonies, seen films and photographs of what Hell looks like. If we consider ourselves members of the human race, we need to take that membership seriously and be aware of what it means to be human. To have hope in the future we need to discover compassion within and speak out against antisemitism and all forms of hate. We cannot excuse the inexcusable and we must believe the unbelievable.
In life’s most challenging moments, how we respond influences both our immediate wellbeing and long-term recovery. Crises arrive uninvited, testing our resilience when we feel most vulnerable. The following tips offer guidance through the turbulence, toward steadier ground.
Remain Calm: When crisis emerges, take a gentle body scan — notice your breathing, pulse, and physical sensations. Do not judge, just observe. Then begin to breathe and focus on your breath. The key is to avoid panic. When we panic, we cannot solve problems effectively. The goal is to think clearly while being aware of what is happening in your body. During this process, pause, take more slow, deep breaths. For some people, repeating prayers that offer solace, doing mindful practice, mindfulness, or engaging playfully with a pet can help.
Assess The Situation: From this centered state notice where you are physically, mentally, and emotionally. Then, identify the elements defining the crisis. What risks exist? What consequences might follow different actions? This assessment doesn’t require perfect information — only honest recognition of what is known and unknown in this moment.
Create Safety: Do what you need to get out of harm’s way. Look around, listen attentively, and notice your surroundings with fresh eyes. Take actions that move you toward greater security, extending this same protective attention to others if they’re with you.
Gather Your Support Circle: Reach out to those whose compassion brings calm — trusted friends, family members, professionals, or others who have walked similar paths. Seek those who offer the support you need rather than imposing what they believe you should want. Throughout the situation, maintain connection with beloved others. Consider engaging in creative activities that redirect mental energy — photography, gardening, music, reading, or writing — offering your mind the opportunity to “reset.”
Communicate with Transparency: Share information others need to hear to assist you, especially during medical emergencies when providers need accurate knowledge of your condition to offer effective care with minimal risk. Honest communication about symptoms, relevant medical history, concerns, and needs, creates the foundation for receiving proper assistance.
Create a Crisis Plan: Consider creating a simple emergency kit kept in your vehicle or near an exit. Maintain accessible records of essential medications, identification, and emergency contacts — both digitally and physically. Identify people who might assist with temporary housing, caregiving, pet-care, or other practical needs that could arise.
Honor Your Fundamental Needs: In crisis, the basics become precious: adequate rest, nourishment, hydration, and moments of quiet. Reflect on what essentials you require and consider how to ensure access to these necessities even during disruption. Tending to these fundamental needs becomes an act of self-compassion during challenging times.
Remember that getting through times of crisis times isn’t about handling everything perfectly. It’s about showing up as best we can, being kind to ourselves, and figuring things out as we go. Sometimes the hardest moments teach us what we’re made of and connect us more deeply to what matters. We might surprise ourselves with what we can handle, even when it feels impossible at first.
I’ve co-authored a book about kindness. I believe deeply in the lasting effects of love. It is in that context that I share my own daily habit. Each morning, I say thank you for another day and ask for an opportunity to make a difference in this world.
To that end, I look for signs of connection to those who came before me — a robin reminds me that my father is near, a butterfly reminds me of my mother. I feel their presence and listen for their guidance. Certain songs transport me to moments in my past, conjuring places, people, and, sometimes, lessons learned.
This daily habit provides continuity to my life. I’m grateful that my journey has been a healthy one so far. Though everything is unpredictable, I express gratitude however I can and move through the world appreciating all the companions I’ve known along the way.

A step-by-step guide through the recently released online Blue Card application
The fact that Berlin’s Immigration Office, a.k.a Ausländerbehörde, is currently totally collapsed is widely known. As time passes by, more and more people apply for a residence permit, blue card, or any other immigration matter, and they have almost Zero digitalized processes, which makes the workload humanly impossible to handle by the workers there. The current backlog was estimated to be processed within the whole year of 2024. And the forecast doesn’t bring any good news about digitalizing the entire immigration process. (What would be the most reasonable thing to be done).That said, when you try to make an appointment to do whatever you need to do there, the system proves to be failed once more, and it’s not operational at all. A piece of brick to be written on would do a better job.
As surprising and ghastly as it can sound to the average German citizen, Berlin LEA has recently released an ONLINE application for Blue Card purposes, that includes IT Specialists as well. (You didn’t read it wrong. Yeah, it’s online, and it’s in Germany).
Before diving into the guide, I just want to highlight my situation with this bureaucracy.
On September/23 I was a victim of a mass lay-off from a company in Berlin, the good old story of the awful Upper Management that brings dozens of immigrants to work at their startup with nothing but a bet on getting money out of it in the future, and when things goes wrong the immigrants pay the price (Less than 5% of the laid-off were Germans or had lived in german for more than 5 years).
For my luck, I got a new Job on October/23 and things were quite good at this point. I didn’t know what was expecting me tho…
I got the information that since I’ve been in Germany for less than 2 years (I arrived on October/22), I needed another approval from the Central Foreigners and Specialist Placement office a.k.a ZAV. This consists of a bureaucratic step where a person with ZERO knowledge of your area of expertise will evaluate if you have or not the qualifications to engage in the new Job that you already have. So, no matter if you pass through a selection process of the company and they evaluate your skills, this government organ must approve it as well. It’s the government shooting its own feet and creating the problems on its own.
That said I got an appointment at the Immigration Office (Every Wednesday between 11 am and 1 pm pretend that you have no other thing to do in your life and just refresh the appointment page every 1 second and you may be lucky to get an appointment). When I went there I was told they needed to send my application to ZAV to get the new approval and only then I could start working.
2 Months have passed, and nothing happened.
At the beginning of December, almost sure that I would need to ask for money on the streets, while I was exploring all possible options on the immigration office website, I found this online tool to apply for a Blue Card.
And they won’t let it easy to be found, on purpose, I believe.
After the last step you pay the 100 Euro fee, and it’s done. After 1 week I got the info that ZAV approved my new Job and I could finally start working.
TLDR: here’s the link: https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/324659/
Just translate the page and click on “Do it online now”
Two things are important to highlight:
1 — Your company must provide you with a letter (PDF) saying that your English level is good enough and that they only speak English at your company. Additionally, they can amend it by saying that you’re qualified enough for the role and have passed through a selection process.
2 — After applying you must call ZAV every day on +49 228 713 131 and make sure that your company can reach out to LEA as well.
When calling ZAV you shall go for option 2 (speak in English) and 1 (ask about work permit). Most of the time a robot speaking in German will just drop your call, so try at 9 am and 12 pm, 1 pm and 2 pm. These are the best times to call.
When speaking with the agent you shall ask about the status of your blue card application informing your last name and birthdate. Once they say it’s approved, you can ask your company to reach out to LEA so they can get a confirmation document saying that you’re allowed to work.
Your blue card in fact will only arrive after several months, but at least you’ll be able to work till then.
I hope that this guide can be useful for other people struggling with Berlin’s Immigration Office and for those who are in a situation similar to the one I was in.

This guide contains a collection of dos and don’ts to make sure you and everyone you’re raving with has a great time while clubbing. Although it’s based on the Berlin club culture, I’d be happy to see this applied everywhere where people are enjoying music together — be it at a club, festival or concert anywhere in the world.
I’ve spent a significant amount of my lifetime on the dance floor, because that’s simply one of the things in life that gives me the most joy. I was lucky enough to get introduced to the Berlin nightlife, festivals and Burns by great friends and experienced ravers, but often enough I meet people who didn’t get a chance for such an introduction. And although I don’t think that too much of advice is needed for yourself to have fun while clubbing in Berlin, I feel like there certainly are some things to keep in mind in order to make sure your fellow ravers are also having a great time.
So basically this is me wanting others to behave the way I consider appropriate, just so that I can keep on enjoying my time raving as much as possible. But that sounds terribly egocentric, so let’s not put it that way…
Figuring out where to go and how to dress can be challenging. There are quite a few guides available for selecting the right club or what to wear to blend in, but let me quickly add some points: The vibe you’ll experience will greatly vary between different clubs — and even between different events at the same club — so try out as much as you can. You’ll eventually find the scene you’ll enjoy the most. And while you generally should adhere to dress codes (e.g. no streetwear), don’t overthink it. The most important thing is that you’re being comfortable. Feel free to express yourself, your fellow ravers won’t judge. The people that do are not the people whose opinion you should care about. Avoid dressing a certain way just because others are doing it, go with your own style.
Although you should pack as light as possible, make sure to bring essentials that you or others may need. You’ll need cash in most clubs unfortunately, and ATMs in or at clubs often come with deposit fees. Don’t underestimate the importance of ear plugs, preventing hearing damage is reasonable in general and in some locations the sound can be unpleasantly loud. Bringing chewing gum, a lighter (even if you don’t smoke) or tampon and pain killer (even if you’re not going to need it) are easy ways to earn some karma points.
If you’re planning to do drugs: Do proper research about the substances that you consider consuming and also check how they interact with each other. The TripSit wiki is a great resource for that. Don’t try out stuff for the first time in a club you’ve never been to before or without people you trust and don’t push your limits. Remember that set and setting are key for psychedelic experiences. If possible, purchase what you need outside of the club, prepare it for consumption and label it properly. Club toilets are not a great place for doing that! Read about safer use guidelines.
If you’re not planning to do drugs: Awesome, chances are you’ll get into ecstasy just by focusing on the music and visual effects anyway! However, I would still recommend reading up on the effects of common party drugs, since quite a few people around you will be high. It will help you understand why people are behaving in certain ways, and empathy is key for having a great time together.
Most people will be joining the queue between 12 am and 3 am and it can stay crowded until the early morning. I personally never understood that and feel it’s much more comfortable to avoid arriving at the prime time.
Perks of arriving early: You get to skip the super long queues and are less likely to be rejected. I get that, for many people, queueing is part of the experience and I’ve met a fair share of my friends randomly while waiting in line. However, I’d rather spend that time chatting in a chill-out area inside, or dancing on the not yet crowded dance floor. Some clubs also have a reduced entry fee or cheaper drinks before midnight.
Alternatively, arriving in the morning can also be great (given you selected a club that isn’t closing): You’ll also avoid the entry queue, and the people that are still there or arriving with you are the really motivated ones. If you got some sleep during the night before, this will also be easier on your sleep schedule for the next day. Unfortunate timing can have you queuing for the coat check together with people that want to leave though.
Whenever you arrive, please don’t skip the queue unless you know someone who’s already in line. Some people make a sport out of it, but it’s simply annoying for everyone else.
Just like at the entry queue, please don’t push to the front. Know what you want to order before being asked. Have money prepared and don’t start looking for cash after your drinks are ready. Give a tip if everything was alright. Leave the bar counter after you paid. Same applies to the coat check.
Chances are that you’ll spend more time queuing for a bathroom stall than for drinks at the bar. And that’s mainly because they’re being used for taking drugs without needing to worry about the security.
If you’re in need for a place to consume stuff, first check if there are other options. Many clubs provide some conveniently separated small areas, these are there for this exact purpose (not to be confused with dark rooms meant for sexual encounters). The club staff won’t disrupt you there. If only bathrooms are available, make sure to minimise the time you spend in the stall and share it with other people that just need it for the same reason.
If you’re actually in need to relieve yourself with some urgency, it’s not unlikely that people will let you take their place in line if you ask nicely. Look out for groups of people that seam like they’ll not use the toilet for its intended purpose. Remember to check if there’s toilet paper in your stall before you need it, since there often is none.
Let loose and dance like no-one is watching. And smile while you’re at it. Having fun is contagious, your motivation will lift the mood of everyone around you. Similarly, if you’re not currently feeling it, don’t stand still right in front of the DJ looking like you’re forced to be there. Maybe go explore the other areas or grab a drink instead.
Dancing is so much more fun if you’re seeing how others are enjoying the music too. The dance floor is not the place to have smalltalk at, or to call the friend you’re supposed to be with, or to check your connection for the way home. Focus on the music and allow others to do the same.
The single most annoying thing for many ravers are other people using their phones (occasionally challenged by rude wasted people). A few clubs will require you to leave your phone at the coat check, most will cover your cameras. And that’s for a reason. Capturing the experience you’re having using a phone camera will likely be underwhelming and it’s degrading the experience that others are having. If you need to message someone, don’t do so in the middle of the dance floor. Your screen will be blinding and distracting for people around you. You and others will have the best time if you manage to not use your phone at all.
This should go without saying, but just be nice. Respect the personal space of others. If you bump into someone, say sorry. If you spill someones drink, go get a new one. If you find something that someone else lost, return it at the bar or coat check. If you see someone that could use help, offer some or go get the awareness team. Treat others the way you would like to be treated. Try finding joy in others having a great time with you, e.g. by doing a random act of kindness to a stranger. Offering water to someone who looks like they might be dehydrated is an always appreciated gesture. Imagine strangers just being friends of friends that you didn’t get introduced to yet. They might actually are!
For some more general guidelines that are worth being aware of, I’d recommend checking out:
If you’ve made it this far, I’m certain you’ll be a great rave companion.See you on the dance floor!

I’ve come to realize just how much our surroundings can immediately influence the way we feel and live. Even with the best intentions, if our environment doesn’t align with the life we’re trying to build, it can slowly drag us in a different direction.
As someone who genuinely values wellness — not just fitness, but a balanced lifestyle — I started feeling really out of place in Berlin, where the culture often revolves around techno, party scenes, kink, smoking, drinking, drug use, and getting by on gig work and state support.
Yes, I said it.
So yeah… I’m counting down the days until I leave Berlin.
I’ve been feeling exhausted — not just physically, but mentally and spiritually too. Lately, my coping mechanism has been traveling, trying to shake off the energy around me. If I can afford the trip, I go.
But then I have to come back, right? And as soon as I do, it all hits me again.
So, I’ve started seriously thinking about ditching Berlin for good. Wild, I know. But, as I’m not exactly rolling in money, and as dreamy as it sounds to just chase sunsets and sip cocktails by the beach, reality’s got other plans. Like, you know… needing an actual job. Minor detail.
But you’re talking to Miss “I Got a Plan” over here. Structured as heck, checklist in hand.
First, things first, I will finish my short-term work contract in Berlin, then find a proper job — ideally one that doesn’t evaporate in six months. Radical idea, I know. And, move! Somewhere. Anywhere. Preferably with fewer existential crises per square meter.
Surprise, surprise — after a six-month-long panic search, most job leads pointed right back to… you guessed it: Berlin (shockingly original) or in that other glittering gem of excitement: Frankfurt am Main. Honestly, I don’t even know what’s worse — Berlin’s militant wokeness or Frankfurt’s charming little drug haven, the Bahnhofsviertel.
Oh, the irony… Am I giving off too much of “Alan is Morissette ’95” vibes if I start singing, “Isn’t it ironic?” Because that feels like the perfect soundtrack.
If you’ve ever felt like you love a place but it just doesn’t love your lifestyle back — trust that feeling. You don’t have to shrink your values to fit.
Seven months of job hunting across Germany’s “livable” expat-friendly medium-sized cities, and the only way out is out of the country. The economy’s going straight down the drain, so jobs are disappearing faster than my patience. Oh, and to add some extra spice, every single role now expects you to be a SQL, Python, and AI specialist.
I asked around with some colleagues and friends who are job hunting too, thinking maybe I’m just unlucky. Turns out, nope, the same story for them. Everyone’s just hanging on to whatever they can, and the ones who actually can do something are waving goodbye and not in a “see you later” way.
So yeah, the options right now? Not great. In Berlin, most jobs are short-term contracts, with only a handful leading to permanent roles. On top of that, tons of German and international companies based in Germany are outsourcing operations to cheaper countries or relocating staff abroad. So basically, if you’re not planning to survive on social welfare, you either have to accept lower pay and live paycheck to paycheck in constant instability or… well, there’s not really a “or” at this point.
I always wanted this blog to be as honest as possible, because life as an immigrant is way more about adapting to constantly changing circumstances. I chose this path, and I’m fully aware of what it means. But… deep down, I still wish I could make it all work without so much stress.
Against The Odds

After living in Berlin for almost six months, it’s time to remedy my failure in writing about its multitude of offerings.
That’s the thing with cities like this, ones spread out over land and history and culture; the sites of early palaces and modern immigration centers. The latest example of gentrification and one of the most well known sites of counterculture movements. A club scene for the leather-clad, but also a site for the wannabe artist and yoga practitioner. It’s just got too much!
Not even a year here will give me a chance to truly sense the song sung by the pulse of this city’s enduring arrhythmia. Instead, I’ll share a few of the spaces that have brought me joy while fall turned to winter and Berlin became the place I call home.
No list of recommendations by a Feldman exists without copious consideration for the locale’s foods. Without an aside on food’s integral place in cultural definition and experience, I’ll recommend a small slice of Berlin’s best culinary experiences.
From April to October, Thai Park street-food market swarms the green space of Preußenpark with delectable, colorful, lustrous-smelling Thai goodies. A cultural event as much as an opportunity for food, grabbing a steaming hot bun and a boba tea, a plate of rolls and a small fruit cake, sitting on the grass to enjoy your scores, Thai Park brings a joyous mix of culture to every demographic in Berlin.
Transported by the sound of Thai spoken at every stall, I used German to order my friends and I steaming vegetable buns, mini pumpkin cake, traditional tea, and noodle dishes. The food was good, the experience was better. Counting down the days until April.
The United State’s lacks a lot of Europe’s most redeeming qualities. And no, not the welfare state or the responsible gun laws, I’m talking about proper Western-Chinese cuisine. I love Chinese food as much as the next coastal Jew, but nothing could prepare me for finding out I’ve been lacking Sichuan noodles my entire life.
In comes Wen Cheng’s, the noodle house of my dreams. Hand-pulled, Sichuan noodles and a low-intensity atmosphere. Just the people of Berlin, and their f*cking delicious noodles.
Split — or don’t — a Gua Bao (Bao Bun) and a classic noodle dish on the sidewalk of Prenzlauer Berg (you can expect a decent line). You won’t think of much else for a while.
Another food I’ll truly never find an equal of elsewhere is, you guessed it, Döner. I like to joke that Döner is one of Germany’s most vital infrastructures, and I have yet to be proven wrong. There’s no one that doesn’t love it. A gift of the Turkish population in Berlin since the 70’s, Döner really is special to the mix of cultures in German cities, and more rural areas alike.
Don’t be mistaken and compare your local Kebab house for the satisfying flavors of Döner sauces, the endless carts of breads that steam as they’re split for filling, or the unmistakable script of most Döner location menus.
My local spot, the roadside Crispy Döner in Charlottenburg, has never done me wrong. Consistently the best 5 Euros one can spend on a given night. I don’t believe the cultural significance and deep satisfaction of a Döner is easily explained. I wish you the best Döner experience when that day comes.
Nestled in a bustling section of Neukölln, neighbored by rows of Middle Eastern sweets shops and Spätis, is Azzam Restaurant; my favorite Middle Eastern restaurant in Berlin.
As low maintenance as it gets, but the staff’s kindness and the sense of community overpowers any “finer” dining experience I’ve had. Azzam, like many businesses that cater to Berlin’s many culturally specific Kiez (neighborhoods), is the embodiment of community and the transportable abilities of food.
Order one or two dishes and you’ll have enough to split between two to three people. If you’re lucky, like my friend and I were, commenting on how good a dish looks will have you walking back to your table with said dish in hand, “a gift for you” from the kind men behind the counter.
Richly flavorful, wonderfully comforting, spiced in a way that makes you forget you’re in Germany — and my favorite — made with an authentic love of a culture I’m newly acquainted with.
Across the street, Azzam Market is a world of its own and while not a restaurant, deserves a visit. A portal to some far away country, or maybe to one that doesn’t exist — a perfectly balanced mixture of Arabic life and culture in Berlin. Grab spices by the kilo from enormous mounds, fresh spreads and Halal meats, local produce, imported specialities, and the most beautifully crafted sweet treats I’ve ever laid eyes on.
YamYam’s Mitte location is packed on an average evening. Rightfully so, as its adorable low tables (or floor-seat options for those with functioning knees), orange atmosphere, and well lettered signage create the most delightful dining aura. More expensive than a hole in the wall, ordering the bean pancake, Bi Bim Bap, traditional Korean sides, tea, and their house made ice cream. really are worth it.
Happy, satiated, and just plain old delicious — YamYam satiated the love for Korean food I discovered when I tried it for the first time. I’m in no rush to find a YamYam rival spot.
If you know me, you’ll have no objection to the distinction between a Cafe and a “food” specific location. Coffee is one thing, but I seek out a cafe for the illusion it brings to my day, the cuteness factor it exudes, and — the baked goods. Maybe to work, maybe to sip coffee, maybe to listen to a podcast, cafes are an entirely different experience, good food is just a positive bonus.
A German “chain”, but a loved one at that. In case you forgot the cinnamon bun intentions, Zeit für Brot brings you back. Translating to “time for bread” in German, this bakery and cafe brings freshly made cinnamon rolls of all kinds, the best cardamom bun I’ve had outside Scandinavia, and loaves upon loaves of fresh German bread. Not to mention other baked goods, sandwiches, and consistently good coffee.
With five (!) locations in the city, I’ve rarely turned down a wonderfully moist, usually enormous, Zimtshnecke for 3 euros.
If you had to model a cafe after me, I’d hope it to look something like The Greens. This cafe, plant-shop hybrid in an alley on the eastern side of the Spree brings the coziest atmosphere possible to an archetypal Berlin day. Warm and full of plants on every surface, The Greens serves great coffee and lunch options, and keeps some spaces laptop-free (which I love despite always coming there with the intentions of productivity).
Its loft feature might be the icing on the cake of this adorably lush space, but nothing beats the rotating selection of plants that accompany you on every visit.
Neukölln’s coziest cafe! The atmosphere in Leuchstoff evokes a neighborly familiarity — welcoming, in progress, and glowingly warm. Chock-full of vintage seats and plywood tables, the main room’s overhanging loft seats customers on a couch only a few feet away from the ceiling. Not for the tall.
Their coffee is some of the best I’ve had in Berlin, and the rich touches of their signature blue grace signs across the cafe, looking wonderfuly quaint in the (rare) winter sunlight. Read a newspaper, work on your laptop, chat with friends on a cramped couch, Leuchstoff makes me yearn for a shorter commute to Neukölln.
Another cozy hit, Cafe Odor makes you feel like you know the owners well after descending its short staircase from street level. Once inside, the Harvard library-esque green lamps, the cozy seats, and the adorable dog perched in the corner place an unrivaled sense of calm over the room.
Along with the best matcha I’ve had in the city, founders Dani and Heo can offer you an assortment of small treats be it rosemary-topped carrot cake, matcha bread, sandwiches. While the two South Korean founders put a sense of distinctly Korean aesthetics into their edible offerings, the cafe’s environment is entirely its own: cozy, sweet, serene.
Whew, consumerism was getting a little worried it would be left out of this list! Worry not, because Berlin’s eclectic, individual, stereotypically grunge, anything-but-German style has to come from somewhere.
Like many cities in Europe — or honestly anywhere except the US — flea markets boast stalls and streets overflowing with treasures of all kinds. Berlin’s flea market scene is astounding, exhausting. Its curated vintage shops offer a refuge from the bustle of markets, but tend to lack their anonymity and charm. Buckle up for bargaining or hum along to the German music agonizingly well dressed teens play in shops.
No household name recognition like its famous counterpart Mauerpark, RAW flea market is its own beast. You could easily spend hours wandering the seemingly endless stalls which mix professional vendors with kids selling their old clothes, the occasional vintage-influencer, and artists. Food is easy to grab too, because you’ll be gone so long hunger is destined to strike.
I’ve snagged a handful of treasures here — some great deals and a few less great, but all trophies of a Sunday activity that makes you feel, well, cool.
Less established than large park fleas, Maybachufer is a street in Kreuzberg along the Spree with a food market that takes place during the weekdays and flea markets on weekends. Another gathering of community where neighborhood residents line the cobblestones with their possessions adjacent to the food stalls and coffee carts.
Nothing beats a 1 Euro bin from a Berliner with copious amounts of tattoos after grabbing a croissant or vegan donut at one of the many and popular nearby cafes.
A blast from the past if I’ve ever seen one, VEB Orange brings East Germany to vivid color with authentic items from the GDR. Clothes, kitchenware, sewing supplies, household items, cards, and almost everything you can think of with color-blocked 70’s patterns is crammed on their shelves. On my favorite street in Berlin, this spot is worth a visit whether you come away with a souvenier or not. The counter-top cat (a real one, not from the GDR) adds to the cuteness of an overly crowded room.
My favorite store in the city, this multi-level art heaven has every creative material I can dream of, and doesn’t help to keep money in my pocket. Walking around with no project on hand is as legitimate as any endeavor, and the adjoining bookshop cafe might extend your visit. Their supplies strike wonder into my heart every time I walk out of the U-Bahn 8 and up their steps.
Just as much of a sight as a shop, the Berlin charity shops of Humana are not few and far between. The one on Frankfurter Tor however, is 5 stories tall. With more floors than you’ll ever need, the shop has got it all.
Alexander Platz’s Humana doesn’t rival in size, but its contents have never let me down — in fact the opposite. While locals frequent Humana, it can be a tad bit pricier than the even more locally-frequented ReSales. Worth a shot if you want to see how much stuff this world really has!
There’s not much to say on Soul & Style except that their 4 locations are full of nicley curated but approachable clothes and accessories. Priced accordingly, you won’t find the same deals as flea markets, but they’re worth a browse if you want cool and unique pieces or have something particular in mind.
I rarely find myself in Berlin’s northern district of Wedding, but one of its truly hidden gems is Bar Henriette. The flat, conjoined walls of the surrounding flats disguise the soft glow from Henriette’s windows as nothing other than a home on a winter night. But when you’re in front of it, the candles emanating from wine bottles and the consistent moody glow draw you immediately in.
Quiet and comfortable, their drinks are affordable, house specials picked with care, and the atmosphere restores years to one’s life that may have been lost in the endurance-sport that is Berlin clubbing. Grab a bottle of wine and you can easily spend hours sinking into their chairs as if it were your own living room.
Cafe by day, bar by night, An Einem Sonntag Im August is well known for good reason. With tiered step-seating, couches, and tables, the interior blends seamlessly from day to night as lights switch off. The cocktails are just as good as the fresh tees and coffee and the bustle all week long does nothing to detract from the intimate feelings wherever you sit. When the weather is warm, outdoor seating and bench swings host you under awnings, giving the best people watching view in Prenzlauer Berg.
Pub culture in Berlin is harder to find than you might think. Real Kneipes are all the better for it. While dive bar culture provides a night of fun in its own right, Shurke’s small space gives you the feel for a Kneipe that I fear may be slipping from Berlin’s landscape.
If there’s no space, move on! But if you find a spot to rest, the air is cloudy, the beer is German, and the energy is classic.
A recent recommendation brought me to Mano unsuccsesfully. Even the slanted hallway with old wooden auditorium seats smashed against the wall was crowded. Next time around we were lucky enough to land a little nook by the window, which required a step up above the lower seating and a pretzel-maneuver to sit comfortably. But the small details in this place from the tree-loft area in the main room to the delicious house cocktails and well worn pillows made this an instant favorite.
There are some aspects of cities that don’t necessarily fill a typical “activity” slot, but end up being the best ways to spend your time. A few of my favorite pastimes, for Sundays when the markets are closed so you can’t (and shouldn’t) do your grocery run; for when it’s raining and cabin fever strikes; or when the weather is grey and something needs to happen.
Airport turned public space, Tempelhofer Feld is my favorite place in Berlin. Rich in history and contemporary activity, Tempelhof information could fill a thesis project.
Go for a run, bike, walk, skate, rollerblade, or wind-sport (yes — an entire green is dedicated to wind sports), and find a community doing the same, usually with music, too! Check out the art mini-golf course or the kids carnival area, read the historical tour plaques, admire the real airplane on display in the center, or walk through the community gardens. Start with a coffee and pastry at a nearby cafe and find a spot to picnic near the bird-breeding grounds, apple tree cultivation, or sheep grazing when it’s the season.
Nothing is so exceptional as this urban oasis, smack dab in the center of Berlin, bordering more than three neighborhoods and connecting a city through recreation.
Off the otherwise unremarkable area of S-Bahnhof Bellevue, Park am Präsidentendreieck is a fantastic place to soak up any rare piece of Berlin sun by the water. Or pick up a paddle at the public ping-pong tables and reignite a competitive fervor only found in Kita playgrounds.
While I continue to note nearly every worthy location I visit in Berlin, I’m haunted by the knowledge that I’ll forever be missing endless experiences in this wide city. Here’s to four more months of exploration!

The spectrum only has two ends. No in between. People hate or love Berlin. The city hosts the most colorful contradictions: Snobby districts, fucked up districts. Start-up career character or totally lost. Techno drug scene, sober yoga class society. Grey in grey or wild nature. Go home with understatement, the city screams. Choose your mix of extremes!
Describing Berlin as a whole is merely feasible. It makes me say ‘anarchy’. Not in a purely chaotic sense. Rather with a tiny sparkle. ✨ I just don’t recognize a concept in Berlin. There is no average reference point. Which is probably the most remarkable thing about the city.
“In Berlin, anti conformance is a default” — my old roomie, who lives there
If you are an outlier in your hometown, you’re gonna feel pretty normal in Berlin. Therefore, outliers are wildly attracted to the city: The city makes non-average the new average. And people are proud of it. “I live in Berlin” is rather a phrase to describe an identity than a residence.
Everything, also the tyniest, most unremarkable part of Berlin seems unique. Even the train sound when arriving at a station was dedicated an anthem to by famous Berlin DJ Paul Kalkbrenner. It’s called Train. As if that would be the most normal thing.
And I love it. 🖤

I’ll be honest, when I first got to Berlin, I was underwhelmed. For years, my friends had told me how much I would love it in the German capital — it’s the gay centre of Europe after all. Perhaps my expectations of rainbow bunting hanging from every balcony and LGBTQ+ museums dominating the streets were set a little too high.
I did find some lesbian history in the obvious places; the recognition of the suffering and slaughter endured by homosexuals in war-time Germany is poignant and moving, and the video memorial in Tiergarten is beautiful. Only, in the so-called gay capital of the continent, I expected to find, well… more. I should have taken the title at face value. While there are lots of events, bars and even sections of parks dedicated to the getting together of gay, cisgender men, the scene for women-loving-women and non-binary people (FLINTA* as it’s known in German) is scarce, under-advertised and according to one server I met in a lesbian-owned cafe, “disappearing fast”. The events that do exist for lesbians are almost exclusively weekly club nights. While fun for dancing, drinking and mixing with other FLINTA folk, these events are, at best, a little dull after your 51st Lesbian Tuesday of the year and at worst, are exclusionary to whole sections of the disabled community. I’ve included the club nights I encountered at the bottom of this post, so feel free to skip ahead if that’s more your scene. But the main purpose of this post is to shine a light on the few FLINTA-focused places I, a disabled lesbian, sought out when visiting Berlin.
Hands down, this is the best place to go if you’re looking for a lesbian crowd, without the partying and alcohol. Run by a British/American lesbian couple, Lonely Hearts Cafe is a fusion of both countries’ breakfast staples. Pancakes and fry-ups sit side-by-side on the menu and they have extensive allergen info readily available for my IBS buddies. Coeliacs can also enjoy food here — they were happy to prepare my order on a separate surface and brought out gluten free toast and vegan butter for me to enjoy with my fry-up.
When I walk in, the place is full of eccentrically-dressed people who (call it gaydar) I immediately assume to be queer. I take a seat along a bench under a neon sign that reads Lonely Hearts and from the back of the room, admire the other quirks this restaurant has to offer. It’s a cosy cafe, which mashes together British and American aesthetics so well, from the black and white letterboard for hot drinks, which looks like it might belong in a chippy, to the hand-drawn sign advertising iced tea. The teaspoons are in Marmite jars, the knives and forks in a large Coleman’s mustard tin, but there’s Tabasco in the condiment container. The red wooden benches have you believing you’re in a 50s American diner until you look at the throw pillows, which place you more in a granny-owned cafe in Surrey. My server, Amy, brings me iced water in a jug and I order a pot of Yorkshire Tea and a Full English. The bandana in her hair screams cottagecore lesbian who abandoned home to run off to a European city and set up a café with her wife... which seems to be exactly what happened. After eating, I use the bathroom. Opening the door is a queer cultural experience in itself. The small room I find myself in is decorated floor-to-ceiling with pictures of Dolly Parton. Even the toilet is Dolly-themed. I have to stop and laugh, take pictures and smile at my reflection in the neon-clad mirror. When I go back out to pay, I spend all my pocket change on merchandise — a t-shirt, mug and sticker set — to remember the queerest café I ever did meet.
It’s impossible to tell what this place is from the outside. The blue canopy is like a red herring for heterosexual people to be lured in, suspecting a green grocer’s and then you see the pink signage, graffiti and rainbow doormat and know they’ve got LGBerlin to a T. Inside, Keller Kreuzberg is full to bursting with art, clothing, cards, tarot decks, books, badges and so much more. I’ve never seen so much merchandise dedicated to LGBTQ+ people in one place. The store does a good job at catering to women as well; the kink section in the basement level has a good range of products for all body types and artwork that bares the same diversity. It’s got a furry pink ceiling which is beside the point but cool. I loved the sex-positive merchandise all around. Though the spiciest stuff remains downstairs, the shop isn’t shy about its stance on sex. My favourite items were a keychain that read, ‘it’s vulva not vagina’ and two naked women in a car painted on a coaster. The only thing I was a little disappointed in was a slight lack of lesbian-specific merchandise in the store, though there was some — I found a hat with the lesbian flag and some prints and cards featuring two women. The main focus was on queer-centered merchandise, which I understand from a business perspective sells better to the masses. But the owner of this shop also agreed with the Lonely Hearts team: the lesbian scene in Berlin is slim pickings. They did give me a tip on a good place to spend some time though, so I headed there next.
Lesbian pal of mine, how many times a day do you think about abandoning your desk job to start a female-focused, bookshop-cum-coffee shop? Five times a day? Nine times a day? Just fifteen minutes from Keller Kreuzberg on foot is She Said bookshop, which specialises in queer, literature written by women. And it’s got a café. They did it folks, they really did it. I spent over an hour wandering around here, picking up books in English and in German — partly to test whether or not I could still remember vocabulary from A-level German. (Spoilers, reader: I could not.) The level of diversity across the shelves is what you want from all bookstores, all written by FLINTA on a wide variety of subjects from fiction to memoir to poetry. I ended up walking away with a bundle of titles I hadn’t heard of before and devoured them on my night train to Brussels the next evening. With its cute café serving sandwiches, cakes and hot drinks, you could easily spend an afternoon here browsing the shelves, consuming coffee and queer literature ’til closing time.
Thanks to the wonderful small business owners I spoke to in the places listed above for these recommendations!
Other Nature — “a queer-feminist, sex-positive, eco-friendly and vegan sex shop” specialising in body-safe sex toys, locally-made kink gear, natural lubes and feminine hygiene products (amongst other wonderful things!)
Siegessäule — an online resource dedicated to queer information, events and guides in Berlin.
Schwules Museum — Berlin’s LGBTQ+ museum and art gallery. I did actually visit this museum but it didn’t make my top three purely because of its size. I paid almost the same entrance fee for this museum as I did for entry to Museum Island, and as far as I could see there was just one, small exhibition room. The exhibition itself was fantastic, full of lesbian artwork which I loved and bought prints of, but it would have been nice to see more! The tea in the cafe, however, was some of the best I’ve ever had. Their website states that admission is free on the first Sunday of the month, so I’d advise taking advantage of this when planning your trip.
I didn’t visit one myself but a lesbian friend of mine who lives in Berlin recommended the Tuesday lesbian night at Möbel Olfe — a bar widely known in Berlin for its gay scene. As far as I’m aware, Tuesday seems to be the night for bars and clubs to lesbi-fy, so bear this in mind if you’re planning a party trip!
Notes:
*Meaning “Frauen, Lesben, Intergeschlechtliche, Nichtbinäre, Trans und Agender”. Or in English, “Women, Lesbians, Intersex, Non-binary, Trans and Agenda”.

Berlin has a complex history that has significantly shaped its urban landscape and development. As the capital of Germany, it has experienced monumental shifts over the centuries—transforming from a Prussian capital into a divided city during the Cold War and now into one of Europe’s most dynamic and modern cities. What makes Berlin so captivating is how its infrastructure and urban planning tell the story of a city constantly rebuilding and reinventing itself.
Berlin’s modern identity is rooted in a unique combination of historical events and urban resilience. Initially, Berlin was a modest settlement along the River Spree, but it gradually became a trade center during the Middle Ages. By the 18th century, Berlin had become the capital of Prussia, a major European power, and it underwent significant development under the rule of Frederick the Great. However, it wasn’t until the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century that Berlin truly began to transform into a major European metropolis. Factories, railroads, and grand boulevards like Unter den Linden were constructed, making Berlin a vital economic and cultural hub.

Berlin is a big city. Of course, compared to Beijing, Tokyo, London, or New York, it is not intimidating at all. But still, by German standard, it is pretty huge.
A friend of mine once told me that Berlin is pretty big because its tourist sites are scattered across the city, and they can be far away from one another. Indeed, no tourist would try to walk from The Brandenburg Gate to East Side Gallery since, according to Google Map, it takes around one hour.
Another friend argued that Berlin is big, and that is why it can host so many gigantic things; big streets (e.g. Straße des 17. Juni and Karl-Marx-Allee), large parks (e.g. Tiergarten and Tempelhofer Feld), huge buildings (e.g. Berliner Fernsehturm and Berliner Schloss), just to name a few.

The happiest hour (two hours) is from 5–7 pm. After dinner, I returned to the bar every evening. Either solo or with my new friends Gabriel or Ria or Michèle. Started with cocktails as you do, mojito, Aperol spritz, gin basil squash. All new taste sensations for me.
I finally managed to fit some touristing into the drinking schedule. It’s my last day. I have to do something! When I’m asked what did you do in Berlin, I can’t say, “I partied, swam naked, made some friends and drank cocktails.” Well, I suppose I can. I have some great memories.
I started at Checkpoint Charlie, the most famous of seven crossing points between East Berlin and West Berlin.
I went looking for the Berlin Bears… these were the only ones I saw in a gift shop. I decided if I couldn’t find a bear, I’d buy…

When you walk into my Friedrichshain apartment, there’s a room labeled “Kinderwagen-Rollstuhle” next to the elevator. On the door, a paper reads:
“Only for strollers. Do not use this room for bikes!”
This was my first inkling that Friedrichshain was a neighborhood for more than hipsters and its club scene.
When I first moved to Berlin in 2019, stroller rooms and family policies were the last thing on my mind. My husband and I moved here to live in a big city, travel across Europe, and start a new adventure. As we stayed longer though, more of our friends started popping out pandemic babies. We soon decided to start our family here as well.
Americans love praising Scandinavian countries' utopian family policies. The NY Times recently touted Finland for giving all new parents the same leave, following Sweden’s example. Bringing up Bebe, which explores the differences between American and French child rearing, has become standard pregnancy reading. Achtung Baby is the German equivalent. I also read these books during pregnancy in my quest to glean child-rearing wisdom.
This post is my version: a personal story about my 22 months of pregnancy, birth, postpartum, and parental leave in Berlin. This isn’t a how-to guide, and I’m not promising to confer any wisdom. But I’d like to show what it’s like to live in a city built with both physical and social infrastructure for families, during one of life’s most tender junctures.
At my first appointment with my Frauenartz (OB/GYN), I received a little book called the Mutterpass (Mother’s pass). All the tests and examinations throughout my pregnancy and birth were recorded in it. Although it may seem archaic to bring a paper booklet with you to every appointment, it actually made a lot of sense in practice. During my pregnancy, I received care from a disparate group of doctors and midwives. Instead of transferring electronic medical records, I simply handed over my Mutterpass at the start of each appointment.
Holistic medicine is more widely accepted in Germany and supported by the medical establishment. Like in the US, I went to routine OB/GYN checkups where I would do a urinanalysis, blood pressure check, weigh-in, periodic blood tests, and consultation at each appointment. I did ultrasounds and genetic testing at predetermined weeks. Unlike the US, I also went to a Hebammenpraxis, a midwife clinic.
One of the downsides I experienced with public health insurance was that my OG/GYN was often overbooked and rushed—sometimes my appointments started one to two hours late. But at the Hebammenpraxis, the midwives took their time. They explained each test in my Mutterpass, making sure I understood each result. They also recommended acupuncture and acupressure for my debilitating first trimester nausea. This was all covered by my public health insurance.
I split the costs of my public health insurance with my employer—I pay around €‎440 per month. This is calculated based on your income level. Health insurance is mandatory for everyone living in Germany. Some people pay for private health insurance if they don’t qualify for public, or want greater control of their providers. See here for more details.
My favorite part of the German medical system is the hebamme, a personal midwife. Hebammen are trained medical professionals that can perform examinations on the mother and the baby. They also guide parents through this huge life transition. In Berlin they work hyper-locally — usually only in one neighborhood. My other mom friends advised me to start looking for a hebamme as soon as my pregnancy was confirmed.
Unfortunately there is a shortage of hebammen in Berlin. To find one, I posted in facebook groups, registered for search websites, visited Hebammenpraxes, and asked friends of friends. Finally, by the end of the first trimester I found my match: Mandy.
Mandy only worked in my zip code, and took a handful of new mothers each month. She visited homes by biking from apartment to apartment — sometimes up to 8–10 homes a day! After our initial meeting at the end of my first trimester, we signed a contract. We didn’t talk for a while, and then around week 35, she came for a few home visits. She checked out my baby room and recommended a few items I might need postpartum. She was also available on call if I thought I was going into labor, and could advise me on when to go to the hospital.
In Berlin, you have a couple of options on where to give birth: a hospital, a Geburtshaus (birthing center), or Hausgeburt (home birth). All options are mostly covered by insurance. In birthing centers, you are attended to by a 1-on-1 midwife in a more “home-like” environment. Doctors are not on-site and there is not the option for epidurals or other drugs. At home, a Beleghebamme (personal birthing midwife) supervises your delivery.
I chose to deliver in a hospital because I wanted the option to have an epidural, and probably because of my American tendencies. I registered at Charité Mitte, a top teaching hospital 20 minutes away, where most doctors and nurses spoke English.
Germans believe that all pregnant women are entitled to not only adequate medical care, but also mental and physical preparations for birth. My public health insurance, Die Techniker, reimbursed me for yoga classes and a Geburtsvorbereitungskurs (birth class). Although most couples take a weekly birth class in their neighborhood, we chose a weekend online course because of COVID. It was also challenging to find one in English.
The German system acknowledges that pregnant mothers not only need a physical break, but also a mental break. They respect the experience of pregnancy and motherhood.
In Germany, your maternal leave starts six weeks before your due date, with the statutory maternity leave, called Mutterschutz. During this time, you receive full pay, and are expected to relax and focus on preparing for the baby. At first I wasn’t sure if I wanted to take that much time off. I felt extreme FOMO — worried that I’d miss out on important moments at work.
However, since I’d be paid the same whether I worked or not, I embraced the German benefits and stopped working. I spent the first few weeks off “nesting” — preparing the baby room, washing and sorting hand-me-down clothes, and stocking our freezer. I also tried to stay active by doing prenatal yoga and going for walks with other moms on leave. One of the benefits of longer maternity leaves is that there is a higher likelihood that your friends are also on leave.
After my due date came and went, I went for daily check-ups and CTG (electronic fetal monitor, EFM) scans at my Frauenartz. Five days after my due date, I had a blood test at the hospital and they decided to have me stay to be induced. While I waited for the induction pills to work, I waited in a separate hospital room in the maternity ward.
German hospitals provide a range of equipment to support vaginal deliveries. Charite’s delivery rooms had specialised equipment such as an exercise ball, birthing stools, ropes attached to the ceiling and walls, and adjustable birthing tables. Some even had a bathtub for water delivery. The midwives embrace moving around and changing positions to help the baby “spin” down the birth canal.
I had the fortune of a quiet delivery ward, which allowed a midwife to accompany me the entire time I was in active labor. Oftentimes in a hospital a midwife splits her time between two or three women. One downside of giving birth in a hospital though is that you may need to change midwives mid-delivery. This happened to me 6 hours in. But in the end, I had a positive experience as I liked the different approach of both midwives. I didn’t see a doctor until the very end, just a few minutes before I delivered my baby boy.
Grant was born after 9 hours of labor.
After birth, I stayed in the hospital for 3 days. This allowed us to have Grant’s U2 appointment at the hospital, which needs to happen between the third and tenth day of life in Germany. Similar to US wellness checkups, Germans have a set of preventive medical check-ups from the first day of birth through adolescence.
We were lucky to get a “family room” after birth, where my husband was able to stay with us in his own bed. We were supported by postpartum midwives 24–7, who were just a button press away. Charite doesn’t have that many family rooms though, so most people need to share a room post delivery. Other families choose to leave the hospital as soon as possible, because their hebamme can also support them at home.
The one downside of staying in the hospital was the German food. This was what I was served for dinner on the first night. Yes, that’s a raw tomato in the corner and a large pickled cucumber in the other.
I had heard the hardest trimester isn’t the 3rd, it’s actually the “4th trimester”, otherwise known as postpartum. I was worried about sleepless nights and how my body would recover. But after reading the book “The First Forty Days,” I learned it could be a magical time if you’re prepared and have a strong support system.
The Germans also have a culture of resting after birth called Wochenbett which literally means “weeks in bed.” The new mother is supposed to stay in bed to recover and focus on skin-on-skin and feeding the new baby.
This is actually quite similar to the Chinese tradition of Zuo Yuezi (坐月子), which literally translates to confinement. During this time, new mothers aren’t supposed to leave the house or touch cold water.
My parents came to Berlin for my Zuo Yuezi, and rented an apartment a block from my apartment. My mom made me warm Chinese soups, didn’t let me touch cold water, and helped take care of Grant. I didn’t leave the house for almost 30 days, which wasn’t that hard for me as it was in the middle of winter.
As I mentioned before, my favorite German benefit is the hebamme. My midwife Mandy came the first day we got home, and visited every day for the first few weeks. Each visit started by weighing Grant, tracking his progress to regaining his birth weight. She also checked and cleaned his umbilical cord stub, and showed us how to bathe him once it fell off.
At the beginning she also supported me in breastfeeding: teaching me different positions, helping wake Grant up mid-feed (his breastfeeding persona was a “dinner dozer” / “rester”), and teaching me how to use the pump (which I only used before my supply came in). This was invaluable, as it prevented common breastfeeding problems like mastitis and nipple pain. If I had any major issues, Mandy could have also referred me to a lactation consultant.
Each day, my husband and I would write down all our questions to review with her. Are his hands too hot or too cold? How should we dress him at night? Should we start vitamin D drops? When will he get over his jetlag? Are we doing tummy time right? Is this a normal amount of spit up? I think she single-handedly prevented us from having postpartum anxiety. :)
She also checked on my health — both physical and mental. She asked about my bleeding, checked my stitches, and examined my abs for diastasis recti. It was such a blessing to get maternal care without having to leave the house with a newborn. Oftentimes, there is so much focus on the baby, not on the mother’s recovery. I didn’t feel this way.
All German employees (people with a German employment contract) are entitled to parental leave. There are two concepts: Elternzeit (parental time off) and Elterngeld (parental allowance / money).
In my circle of friends, most mothers took at least a year off — usually until their child went to Kita. This also lines up with how long women are recommended to breastfeed for, about one year. Babies can start drinking cow’s milk after one year of age. I noticed that most fathers took a few weeks off at the start with the mother, and then some weeks later when the baby is older. Many took it during the summer holiday so the whole family could vacation together.
In a bit of a tangent, I’m going to compare Germany’s policy to Sweden’s. Unlike Sweden’s equality focused policy, Germany doesn’t have a minimum number of days each parent must take. In Sweden, their 90 days of “use-it-or-lose-it” time for fathers incentivizes men to take their full parental leave. Sweden also has an “equality bonus” of 50 kr each per day if you share your parental leave equally. This has led more Swedish men to take more paternal leave than other countries, and even created a “latte pappa” culture.
While I was pregnant, we visited our friends in Sweden with a 1 year old. The couple took the first month off together. The mom then took the next 6 months on her own, and then the father took the next 6 months on his own. Leaving the baby with the father made it easier for my friend to go back to work, and helped them establish a more equal division of household and child rearing. In the US, studies have shown that when a baby arrives, working couples no longer share their housework equally, even when they did before (study). This was a pattern I didn’t want us to fall into.
So what did we do? My husband and I both took the first month off. Then I became the primary caregiver from months 2–10, though my husband took off 6 weeks of vacation throughout that time. He also works from home, and was able to support me during the day when needed. He will become primary caregiver when Grant is 10 months, and plans to take at least 3 months of paternity leave. We chose this split because I wanted to take about one year off of work, and because by the time Grant is 10 months he’ll be breastfeeding less and less dependent on me. I also wanted us to both experience being primary caregiver to develop our own parenting styles and build empathy for each other.
The thing I appreciate the most about this experience, is that I had the privilege of going back to work when I was ready. I took a total of 12 months off — something I never would be able to take, or even thought I’d want, in the US. Some moms are ready to return to work after 3 months, and others at 3 years. I didn’t have to choose between being a “stay-at-home-mom” or a “working mom” when I wasn’t ready. And throughout my leave, even though my day to day was being a full time caregiver, I considered myself a UX designer. This is an important part of my identity.
So what did I do with my time?
Not going back to work allowed me to continue breastfeeding on-demand. I didn’t need to pump, though I used the passive Haaka pump to collect extra milk for bottles.
Women in Berlin breastfeed practically everywhere– restaurants, playground, the Ubahn… No one bats an eye!
Around 6–8 weeks after birth, many German women take a Rückbildungskurs to strengthen their pelvic floor. Pregnancy and childbirth can stress, stretch, and weaken the muscles in your pelvic floor and abdomen, which can cause pain and urinary incontinence. Germans don’t wait for a doctor’s diagnosis. Almost all women sign up for a course after their hebamme clears them. In the class, a physiotherapist walks you through a series of breathing and muscle exercises. This is also covered by health insurance.
This can also be a great way to get out of the house with your baby and meet other new moms in the neighborhood. Unfortunately I was only able to find an English course online.
A few months after birth, a social worker contacted us for a home visit. I had never met a social worker before, and wasn’t sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised though! The woman came with a large folder of flyers: lists of pediatricians, local hospitals, family centers, and kitas (day cares). She reassured us that the local town hall could put us on a waitlist for kita (daycare), if we weren’t able to find a spot ourselves. This is a common concern of parents, as kita spots can be notoriously hard to find in Berlin. She also made sure we how to fill out all of the required German paperwork and navigate the bureaucracy.
As Ali Wong said in Hard Knock Wife, “when you’re a new mom on maternity leave it’s like The Walking Dead. You’ve just gotta hook up with a crew to survive.” Neighborhood family centers saved me, and helped me find my survival crew. All around Friedrichshain there are family centers with programming for kids and their parents. Many have free play times and classes such as “baby massage” and “yoga with baby.”
When Grant was around 4 months old, I started going to a “baby time” every Friday. With a facilitator, we went around sharing how each of our weeks went — recounting what’s changed with the baby, and checking in on how we are each doing. We sang some German songs and did some playful activities. It ended with a lovely breakfast and tea. The whole class was donation based.
Although it was tough for me to always understand what was going on in German, I managed to make one good friend from the group. When the class ended, we started going to drop-in “open play times.” Grant loved playing with all the new toys and structures, and I enjoyed some adult socialization. It can be incredibly lonely and isolating to be caring for your baby at home alone all day.
I’m not going to say much about Kita (daycare), because unfortunately we will be leaving Germany before Grant can go to Kita (at one year of age). The most important fact though is that Kita is free. Yes, daycare is free in Berlin. Well, except for a €23 / month lunch fee.
Parents apply for a Kitagutschein voucher that determines the number of hours you qualify for based on their age and the number of hours the parents work. Most kitas don’t take babies under the age of one though. If you’re curious to learn more, this is a great guide.
What?! You’re leaving Berlin? You might be surprised to learn after describing this seeming family utopia, we’ve decided to return to the US — the only rich country without federally mandated paid parental leave.
We miss our family.I had a really hard time the weeks after my parents left Germany when Grant was three months old. My relationship with my parents, and my in-laws, has completely changed since becoming a parent myself. I call my parents almost every day, and can’t imagine having them only see Grant once or twice a year. I think that one of the best things we can do for Grant, and for our sanity, is to surround him with people that love him — which means moving closer to my family in the Bay Area.
We miss our friends.Although it was hard to make many friends during the pandemic, we managed to make a few good friends in the past three years. However, almost all of them have now moved away as many were also expats, and went onto their next location. We know how important friendship is to our happiness, and how lonely and isolating parenting can be. Back in the bay area we have friends we’ve known for 10–20 years, and many of them are now having kids too. We’re actually planning to co-live with a friend I’ve known since birth!
We’re tired of speaking bad German.We had grand plans to learn at least conversational German when we first moved here. We took a month-long intensive course, and then biweekly classes for the first year. But after a year we only made it to A.2, at best. When I got pregnant, I lacked the energy and motivation to continue. In the area we live in, we’re able to use English in our day-to-day encounters, but when we hit bureaucracy, it is all German. And becoming a parent doubled the amount of bureaucracy we’ve hit. I also couldn’t imagine not being able to speak to Grant’s daycare teachers fluently.
We want to continue working with our American employers, but want family friendly hours.My husband and I continued to work for American companies when we moved to Berlin. He stayed with his previous company, and I started at Google Berlin. This meant we worked somewhat shifted hours, usually 10 am to 7 or 8pm, with a healthy midday break. This is not compatible with a baby’s schedule (3pm kita pickup, 5:30pm dinner, 7pm bedtime). From my experience, most Googlers in leadership positions based in Europe take a break to watch their kids, and then go back online from 8–10pm. This is not the lifestyle we want.
We want to establish a permanent home base.To my husband’s dismay, the idea of moving back to the bay and staying there for the rest of our lives terrifies me. I’m not ready to stop our adventures! But I do agree that we’d like to establish a home base and permanent community. Maybe we’ll move to Taiwan or Singapore in 5 years though :)
I’m extremely thankful for my experience from pregnancy to parental leave in Berlin. I know how lucky we are to be able to move here, have our parents stay with us, and work at well paying jobs. We are extremely privileged to get this new perspective on what having a baby can look like. I’ve had friends in the US who had to fight for time off from their employers or beg their doctors to take their pain seriously to get a PT referral. It would have been hard for me to advocate for myself during this tender and vulnerable time.
I am grateful that Germany welcomed us as a temporary residents (we have EU Blue Cards), and allowed me to qualify and pay for public health insurance. I’ve felt supported by the city and healthcare system, with community spaces and services that I didn’t even know I needed.
After 12 months off, I feel ready to return to work, and step aside to let my husband become the primary caregiver. Love you dear! :)
Thank you Owen and Kalvin for the edits, and Alana Range for the lovely photos.

KREUZBERG, Berlin — At the Berlinische Galerie on Alte Jakobstraße, I rounded the corner to an exhibition room and was taken aback by a large, ape-like creature sprawled across the concrete floor in an installation that I can only term narrative art.
The ape was coated in black, stringy fur that small worker figures were stripping from her back, leaving her torso a bloody mess. Her mouth hung wide open as wooden structures leaned up against her face with other small human figures trying to extract resources from her teeth. Some laborers had even gone to loot her private parts, loading her treasures into overflowing trucks. They were stripping her bare, capitalizing on her death, and destroying her corpse to feed their greed.
On display until Aug. 21, the art installation “The Sweet Certainty of Deliverance from the Darkness that Surrounds Us” portrays the imminent threat the planet faces, with rising temperatures and natural disasters caused by greenhouse gas emissions and unsustainable ways of life and production.
Witnessing this artistic raid on the creature’s body, a feeling of violation crept up in me, confronting me with the reality animals have faced in the race toward industrialization. My feet quickly moved to the next room.
In the middle of that hall, a flower bud-shaped paper-mâché spaceship draws the eyes, luring people to enter. Within it, the faces of animals stared back at me. Surrounding the vessel are large brown leaves, each holding a painting depicting the story of human evolution and collectivism that was set ablaze by mankind.
Apes fall from trees transforming into humans. Together, the apes burn down the forests and trees from where they came. In a last effort to preserve what remains of the land, the animals work together to build the vessel featured in the center of the room, which sends humans into space as animals watch them leave the world they have destroyed.
Leaving the exhibit, I was overcome by guilt and shame.
German and Romanian artists Matthias Boehler and Christian Orendt present their shocking view of the future of civilization, attempting to explain why humans waste resources, burn acres of forests that provide the Earth with oxygen, and produce more gas emissions than ever recorded. The two have worked together since 2008, creating art installations that provoke their viewers into questioning their responsibility and prompting them to change their ways of life by experiencing impactful and ironic mixed media exhibits.
While the storyline is a work of fiction, the work portrays a reality that is eerily familiar. Thoughts of billionaires flying into space and power plant fumes drifting up through the Earth’s atmosphere entered my mind. The exhibit conjured the smell of fires burning and ashy-covered streets in California — now also happening near my home in Queens, New York, where glass shards and Styrofoam litter concrete roads that used to host freshly cut fields of luscious poppies.
Now, walking around the streets of Berlin, I am reminded of how we globally share the challenge of survival. Advertisements for sustainable products surround me. It is easy to be a more eco-conscious guest on Earth in Berlin, where the importance of conservation is posted along the walls of train stations and covers the beams of streetlights.
This is not the case in the United States, where recycling is an afterthought and rarely enforced. It is difficult to find a can to throw out trash along the streets of Manhattan. Walking is not an option in Los Angeles, when there are no sidewalks, forcing me to get behind the wheel.
In Berlin, I am rewarded with a Euro coin every time I return a glass bottle or cup, urging me to reflect on my plastic consumption. When riding the U-Bahn, I am given four options on how to dispose of my trash, prompting me to discover what materials my waste is made of. To beat the summer heat, I can find solace on a former runway at a reimagined Tempelhof airport, surrounded by lush gardens and commuting cyclists. In this city, greenery stretches across historic streets crowded with people enjoying the sunshine, filling me with hope.
Berlin seems to understand the pleasures of living on the Earth and the need to take action now. After walking out of the Berlinische Gallery, I am beginning to as well.

I’d been living in Berlin for almost a year before I managed to write about why I chose to give up my life in Canada to start anew in the German capital. I’d moved here in June 2011 and months later, found myself without words or an ability to share what was a very personal story. I’d typed dozens of drafts but felt none of them ever seemed fit for publishing. I guess I needed more time to realize why I’d really moved here and what exactly it meant to me.
Finally, the day came when I ended the suspense by sharing why I moved to Berlin in the first place.
Some people move to Berlin to be part of the city’s creative community, others to work at a startup, while some come for love, and many simply, for the hedonistic party and clubbing lifestyle.
My story’s much more different. I moved here never having visited the city, completely alone, without a job, and not knowing a word of German.
From the outside looking in, my life in Toronto seemed like a really good one. I was lucky enough to have close friends, an amazing apartment, and a job that paid well. I kept busy by playing sports, taking classes, and going to events and parties. I traveled a few times a year and did awe inspiring things like cruise the Galapagos Islands and hike the Inca Trail in Peru.
What most people didn’t know was that I was deeply unhappy. I loathed my job. I was ashamed I didn’t have a steady boyfriend, never mind a husband or children. I felt guilty for not being able to appreciate what I had. To be honest, I didn’t feel deserving of my good life. I cried each day, regularly had full blown panic attacks, and suffered from unrelenting insomnia. I was tired and drained all of time and even though I didn’t realize it yet, was sinking into a deep depression.
I was in complete denial of my depression for a very long time.
A lot of traumatic things had transpired in the decade leading up to that time of my life:
I’d married an abusive man, only to get divorced a year and half later. It had been devastating, as he’d been unfaithful and never once showed any regret. I’d also been pregnant and when he found out, he pressured me into having an unwanted abortion. When he left, he immediately moved in with his new girlfriend as if our seven years together meant nothing. Our parting was the best thing that ever happened me and my life immediately improved when he left, but I never once took the time to process what damage the relationship had done to my well being.
Just a couple of years later, I found out my father broke his 20+ years of sobriety. Things went downhill pretty fast from there and it got to the point, that every time the phone rang, I would collapse into a panicked state. The phone calls never meant anything good. He was either in the hospital from overdosing, getting picked up by the police for public drunkenness, and once, even arrested for driving under the influence. These events continued for quite a while until one weekend when I went home to visit him and my sister and I found him dead on the kitchen floor. As much as I’d been expecting something like that happen, there isn’t too many things as devastating as finding your father’s decaying body. I’ve never been able to get the image out of my head, or even the smell.
As if his death wasn’t enough, my siblings and I had to take care of my dad’s estate which involved a lot of work and stress. My sister and I ended up taking on the bulk of the responsibilities, a huge burden to say in the least. To make matters worse, no of the kids could agree on anything and what followed, was two years of pointless arguments and disputes. When it was over, one of my sister’s stopped talking to the entire family.
During that time, we also had to care for my elderly grandmother who was dying from Alzheimer’s. She ended up passing away just one year after my dad did. Even though it sounds wild and totally unbelievable, when we arrived at the cemetery for her burial, we discovered that they’d dug up the wrong grave site, my dad’s grave site! Trying to cover up their mistake, the grave diggers had carelessly tossed my dad’s cremated remains into the forest adjacent to the cemetery. My family and I had to comb through piles of dirt to find them and on the day we were supposed to bury my grandmother, we had to rebury my father as well.
So much insanity in such a short time would challenge the best of us, but I kept going by avoiding any and all opportunities to face the enormity of all of those life events by all means possible. I played sports, took classes, went to parties, and threw myself into work — just so I could keep busy and avoid checking myself into a mental hospital.
In 2005, I’d bought a house with the proceeds from my divorce. It was an investment property, as I purposely bought in a developing area so I could sell at a profit later on. Five years later, I did exactly that, leaving with a very handsome amount. Around the time I sold my place, I was also laid off from work and scored a decent settlement package.
It was the perfect chance to take a sabbatical and figure out what I really wanted from life. I could breathe and not worry about things for a while, perhaps finding the happiness that’d always eluded me. I ended up taking nearly two years off of work and spent the time being a lady of leisure, a champion lady of leisure actually. I slept in, got day drunk, watched countless reruns of Golden Girls, took cooking classes, and most importantly traveled. And once I started, I couldn’t stop.
A woman previously obsessed with South America, I finally decided to give Europe a chance. Figuring there was no better place to start than Italy, I ended up having my best vacation ever. It was then I felt free, happy, and joyous for the very first time ever in my life. I lost count of how many times I cried simply because it felt so surreal, to be there in a place I’d always dreamed of visiting and to feel happiness that I still didn’t feel I deserved. The new emotions overwhelmed me, but it became some kind of natural high I started to chase.
Upon arriving home, I ate and drank Italian food and wine at every opportunity, enrolled in language classes, and even vowed that someday I’d move there. I took comfort in dreaming about what life abroad would be like and indulged in silly movies like Under The Tuscan Sun for inspiration.
Not wanting to stay away from my new love for long, I returned to Europe again for Christmas to do a tour through Munich, Prague, Bratislava, Budapest, and Vienna. To be honest, I’d low expectations for the trip and thought there was no way that Italy experience could ever be topped. To my surprise, the Christmas tour turned out to be even better than I ever could’ve imagined. One cold snow filled night, as I walked across the Charles Bridge in Prague, I suddenly just “knew”. I was someday going to make that big move abroad to Europe. Not only did I want to do it, but more importantly, I knew I could do it.
Those trips were pivotal for a few reasons. First, it solidified the fact that I loved the continent. The happiness of that first trip was repeated with the second. Second, I discovered there was more to Europe than Italy and I knew I’d be happy living almost anywhere. I started thinking about Germany, France, and even Spain. Third, I felt a new and very surprising confidence that it was something that I could really do on my own.
The new year arrived and so did a new job in Toronto. The adjustment back into being employed was not gentle and again, I found myself feeling completely and utterly miserable. The honeymoon was over and I wondered what had really changed. Even though I still planned to move, I hadn’t taken any concrete actions to make my dreams a reality. I felt stuck and didn’t know how to move forward.
Then while in Cuba on vacation three months later, I received a call from my landlord announcing that they were putting my flat up for sale and public viewings would start the very next day. At first I was deeply upset with the news but then realized this was the time and a perfect opportunity. I decided right then and there I’d move to Europe. I cancelled my vacation and flew back to Toronto the very next day so I could start the process.
Just a few weeks later, I quit my job, gave my landlord notice, and applied for a working holiday visa in Germany. Without it being approved, I sold all of my possessions, booked a one way flight to Berlin, and secured a holiday apartment in Prenzlauer Berg. I was finally ready to move to Berlin.
After I put the wheels into motion, everything happened really fast. I was so busy taking care of details, I barely had time to think about what I was doing and one day, the enormity of all suddenly hit me. I was ending my way of life as I knew it and had no idea what the future held. I didn’t have any real plans except to try and make my blog successful, get to know Berlin, and see as much of Europe as I could. I knew it was possible (even likely?), I’d fail miserably and would have to come home. I made sure I had enough money to last about six months.
I was scared, exhilarated, and stressed but mostly, excited.
Saying my farewells was the single hardest thing I had to do and it wasn’t without tears. I had to bid adieu to some of the best friends in the world and of course, my family. It finally got to the point during my last week in Toronto where it was all getting to be too much and all I wanted to do was hop on the plane. Time was dragging by much too slowly and I was ready to start my life with a vengeance.
Reactions to my big announcement were mixed. While most expressed their support and wished me well, others weren’t so kind. Some were jealous, worried, and even thought I was crazy (which I now realize I was!).
These were just some of the comments — “Are you experiencing a midlife crisis?”, “You’re so naive. You’ll never succeed at travel writing. It’s not really a profession.”, “You need to grow up.”, “Aren’t you taking the whole Eat, Pray, Love thing a little too far?” “I’d do the same if I didn’t have a mortgage, spouse or children.”
While some of the concern was certainly warranted, the narrow mindedness of some people also shocked me. How can you not be thrilled for someone who wants to embark on a new adventure? I wondered, how couldn’t they see what I saw? The possibilities, the potential, the chance for true happiness.
As expected, everyone asked me why I was moving to Berlin. I’m still asked this question on a regular basis and still find it a hard one to answer.
I can’t really narrow it down to just one reason. My answers varied but went something like this:
It wasn’t at all because I watched this amazing video.
Of course, there are usually more questions:
“Do you have a job in Berlin?” I didn’t have a job when I first arrived.
“Do you speak German?” I didn’t know any German outside of bier, kindergarten, and scheisse but planned to take classes. I quickly become quite good at saying “Mein Deutsch ist nicht so gut.” to get through daily situations.
“Have you ever been to Berlin?” No. Based on the advice of two girls I met in Cuba and a friend that had lived in the city previously, I chose to live in Berlin as opposed to Munich, Hamburg, or Frankfurt.
“Are you moving there for a man?” Nope. Although the idea of dating fashionable, well educated, multilingual men who watched movies with subtitles was definitely appealing.
“Do you hate Toronto?” I didn’t hate Toronto. It was just time for a new beginning. I’ll always consider it home.
Did it work out? Yes, and no. Shortly after my arrival, a fellow newly arrived Berliner remarked to me over late night beers, “I don’t know whether you’re fucking brilliant or fucking crazy, but you certainly have balls.” Now that I look back, I admit that I may have been just that but I harbour absolutely no regrets.
I ended up staying in Berlin for 18 months. While there were plenty of ups and downs, moving to Berlin was one of the best decisions I’d ever made. Unfortunately, those downs caught up with up me with untenable work and relationship situations, so I took the very right decision to go back to Canada to figure things out.
It was also another opportunity to make myself feel grounded myself again and take stock about what I wanted from life. It didn’t take me long to realize that I missed Berlin a lot and I soon began plotting my way back. After two years in Canada, I returned in November 2014 and have been here ever since.
A decade later in 2021, I sometimes still find myself astonished that I’ve been in Berlin for all of this time. I’ll admit that I have moments where the urge to go back to Canada has been strong, most especially at the beginning of the pandemic.
Looking back, I can really see in the years following those traumatic events I discussed above, I took every possible action to avoid confronting my emotions. While I thought travelling around the world and moving to Berlin made me happy, I also realize that this was only furthering my escapist behaviour.
Following my move back here, I fell into bad habits like smoking and drinking, partying, and excessive travel. My happiness was superficial and even though there were plenty of fun-filled moments along the way, my unhappiness and depression only deepened, and as time went by those cracks only became more open and exposed. The depression was always lingering there, just under the surface, ready to bubble up and explode at a moment’s notice.
Then the pandemic came and I hit rock bottom, fast and hard. The lockdown, uncertainty surrounding my job, being so far away from home, and completely alone was just too much. While I’m still not so ready to write about that whole experience, I can say that I was in really, really, really bad shape.
Thanks to support from plenty of cool people who spent time with me on video calls, understanding doctors, a sympathetic employer, and regular therapy, life looks much differently than it did before. I’ve put absolutely everything into bettering my well being. I quit smoking, found a new job, and managed tough events like losing my grandmother and cat in the same week. The panic attacks have stopped (for now), I’m off of antidepressants, I sleep through the night, and wake up many days with a smile on my face. My life is all the better with the recent arrival of a new rescue cat from Poland, who sports such a thick moustache that I named him after Burt Reynolds.
I (cautiously) say that I may be finally be feeling happy. Something I never thought I’d be able to say with any conviction. While I have a lot of work ahead, I’m in a really good place and look forward to building a much healthier and happier life here in Berlin.

While chatting a few years ago about Berlin with a venture capital veteran from the Silicon Valley, he mentioned that he saw Berlin as ‘a city finding itself’. As a recurrent visitor of the city since 1998, I can relate to that statement; I can happily say that by now, this city has developed a character of its own (on the startups’ side).
Berlin is the capital of Germany, and one of the most eventful cities in the world.
It is a city of contrast where history and newness encounter each other on every corner.
A good example is that the city serves as the center for all political decisions in Germany as well as the hub for startups and technology advancement. But before we look at the current state of the city, it is useful to go down memory lane and understand the following:
After World War II (1945) the city was mostly destroyed. Situated at the center of such a dark recent history, the city needed to rebuild itself and was in an awkwardly divided position: West and East Berlin. The West side was controlled by the American, British and French, while the East side was controlled by the Soviet Union. The division was so strong that there was even a physical manifestation of it, the Berlin Wall, which was built in 1961 and only fell in 1989. The city became the capital of the German nation in 1991 and then started its reconstruction process.
Two main factors determined the type of people that lived or moved to the city and would later become critical for the development of the startup ecosystem:
These factors attracted talent to Berlin, creating density over time and increasing its appeal to internationals. In the words of a friend:
“Berlin is not a city where people brag about a 6-course menu at a restaurant, but rather one where people talk about the clubs they frequent.”
That alternativeness in what it means to have “made it” in the city attracts a distinct crowd.
So let’s create a short timeline with some of the main events in this ecosystem building process:
In the early 2000s, there was arguably not much happening in the city in terms of industry. In Germany, a highly decentralized country, every region or “Bundesland” was relatively specialized in terms of a certain type of business: insurance in Munich or energy in Essen. Berlin was mostly known for being the city where the artists and the government were located, but there was no big industry, which made it a fertile ground for people to build from scratch.
The first wave of startups in Berlin dates to the interval between 2007 and 2010. Within that time the city gave birth to startups like studiVZ (social network), Immobilienscout24, Zalando, Idealo, Gate5, and Jamba. Jamba was the second exit from the Samwer brothers who later became the founders of Rocket Internet. Gate5 was sold to Nokia, and the founder, Christophe Maire, would later go on to start Atlantic Labs.
This period saw the rise of venture builders; since these types of companies are not common everywhere, I’ll explain: Venture Builders are companies that focus on launching new businesses from a core team that develops them and supports them with some central functions such as HR and Legal. In short, these are companies whose purpose is to create other “child” companies. While venture builders are now present across the world, there has been a strong concentration in Berlin.
Around 2011, there were two venture builders in the city: Team Europe and Rocket Internet. Team Europe was started by Kolja Hebenstreit, Lukasz Gadowski, and supported the early days of Delivery Hero (Lieferheld back then), Wooga, and Spreadshirt. Rocket Internet was started by the Samwer brothers who had previously founded and successfully exited companies such as Alando and Jamba. There has been plenty written about the Rocket Internet and the Samwer brothers’ story, but I personally recommend reading this version by The Generalist.
While there are mixed opinions on the company and its ethics, no one can deny that they were one of the largest catalyzers to make the Berlin startup hub “happen”. Among the companies that benefited from the Rocket Internet force, we can find some of the most iconic scale ups such as Delivery Hero, HelloFresh, Zalando, Home24, and Westwing.
As time progressed, startups originated not only from venture builders but from other founders entering the scene; some of those stories relate to SoundCloud, Wunderlist, EyeEm, SumUp and Amen. On the venture capital side of things, some VCs started to see an opportunity in Berlin and one of the first ones to establish a presence here was Earlybird, which moved from Hamburg to Berlin in 2013. Berlin started to appear in the international startup scene, so much so that even Ashton Kutcher decided to invest in the city back in 2012.
Several of the companies mentioned before were the bootcamps for much of the talent we see today, and as talent churned from the bigger companies, more ventures got built. At this point in time, most of the companies built in Berlin had a flavor of commerce, consumer and copy-cats. People associated Berlin with power of execution, but not necessarily with innovation.
By 2014, Oliver Samwer, the older brother of the trio, started to professionalize his investing and from that Global Founders Capital was born. It was right around that time that Rocket Internet was considered to have reached its peak success, where many of its ventures such as HelloFresh, GlossyBox, DeliveryHero, and Zalando were present not only in Germany but had also started international expansion.
As Berlin became more recognized as a startup hub and the venture building practices became internationally known, more venture builders started to emerge such as Hitfox (now IONIQ), which expanded into fintech with finleap and later into healthtech as Heartbeat Labs. Many of these venture builders not only built for themselves but also for corporations, and soon enough it became common for several German corporations to establish their innovation practices in Berlin. Examples include Lufthansa Innovation Hub, BCG Digital Ventures, and Körber Digital enabled by consultants such as BCG Digital Ventures.
In 2015 Wunderlist, a startup from entrepreneur Christian Reber and the Wunderkinder crew, was sold to Microsoft for $125 million. While compared to some of the valuations and exits we are seeing in the current VC climate this might seem small, at the time this was a major milestone for the Berlin ecosystem. This made it clear that it was possible to build something out of Berlin and exit to global players.
By 2016, Berlin was well recognized as the second largest startup hub in Europe, only behind London. It is around this period when Rocket Internet stopped incubating more businesses. At an ecosystem level, there were already enough small successes to have attracted more capital to Berlin and many new VCs were founded: Point9, Cherry Ventures, and LaFamiglia.
As aspirations in the city grew, it became increasingly attractive to international funds opening offices in Berlin– properly committing to the city. Some examples of international funds opening offices in Berlin include Creandum, Heartcore, and Speedinvest.
The success stories of previous years have encouraged more people to pursue entrepreneurship as a viable career path. As we look into the future of Berlin, the city has diversified the type of industries it serves into fintech, logistics, mobility, edtech, etc… Furthermore, it is expected that some of the Berlin based unicorns will IPO or be acquired in the coming years, leaving several employees with disposable income to invest or start new things on their own. At the same time, this also means more second-time founders and operators with scale-up experience that will continue the flywheel in the ecosystem.
On the VC side, the proliferance of smaller VCs led to a general sentiment that Berlin has consolidated its spot as one of the leading European hubs, taking on increasingly more ambitious challenges. Two movements that were not discussed in this narrative so far were the governmental initiatives to enhance the startup ecosystem, such as the Adlershof, and the fact that for a while Berlin was considered one of the crypto hubs of Europe.
For now, I believe it is time to bring the story to the current times and identify who the movers and shakers in the ecosystem are:
By now it is no secret that nearly every important fund in the world has at some point invested in a Berlin-based company, however I want to focus our attention on funds that are “headquartered” or “committed” in Berlin.
The first category, “headquartered”, contains funds who were founded or moved their headquarters into the city. The second category, “committed”, contains the funds that have at least one person permanently based in Berlin; hence they have formalized their commitment to the city.
While the city’s stars are and will always be the startups, it is useful to see some of the VCs as the catalysts for innovation happening in the city. Many of those VCs are operators turned investors or individuals who have boldly betted on Berlin being the next innovation center of Europe. By late August, Sifted reported that Berlin startups had already obtained €5.1bn in investment:
As we can see this means that by the time I publish this article, the city is likely to have doubled the investment from 2019, the record year until now.
On the startup side, I don’t think I’d ever finish this article if I were to list all the startups in Berlin. Nonetheless, I want to highlight some of the ones that have successfully put the city on the global map:
I want to finish this article by encouraging everyone to move to, invest in or visit Berlin. Nowadays, there are more factors that contribute to the city continuing to gain the hearts of many, so here are few selling points:
Overall, it has taken a while for Berlin to become the startup capital we know and love. I am bullish on Berlin continuing to attract highly qualified talent and increasingly incubating more European unicorns. Come visit or message me if you have extra stories on the city.

This article is a reflection of my recent journey to Berlin, Germany’s capital to attend a party given by my company. I felt Berlin is warm to newcomers, and it has tons of history from world wars and, homes, people from different backgrounds and nationalities. In a few phrases, what I feel about Berlin:
Berlin is a human rights capital of Germany. It embraces a new inhabitant with both hands and Berlin always has room for someone: a tourist, an expat or a refugee. I find the culture is so open that for millennial, Berlin can be an ideal city to live and work.
Unfortunately, that was not my opinion when I last visited Berlin 6 months back for attending AWS Summit, Berlin. On February 26–27, 2019, I participated in the summit or conference whatever you call it, and didn’t get much time to explore the city and its famous landmarks and attractions. I stayed in Ibis hotel, Postdamer Platz. We book it because it is close to the summit venue, Station Berlin. It was a sheer business trip in the mid of the week.
Station Berlin is one of the old railway stations in Germany that opened in 1875. Later, it is used by the German Postal office as a hub of packages and mails. Now the location is rented for conferences and events.
The whole area is an old city and looks more gloomy in winters. The first impression is the best. After seeing the modern, vibrant southern towns like Munich and Nürnberg, I found Berlin Postdamer Platz as a disappointment.
The Berlin Hauptbahnhof(Central Train Station) makes you think of an alien spaceship in terms of architecture, but when you come out, you find the old Berlin which is not so appealing in winter.
You can see the Station Berlin 3D tour here:

The Berlin Hauptbahnhof(Central Train Station) makes you think of an alien spaceship in terms of architecture. But when you come out, you find the old Berlin which is not so appealing in winter.
I got a chance to go to Berlin again, in the form of a summer party given by my company. My company, Zalando, annually throws a huge party(4000+ attendees) for employees working all over Germany. As part of it, we traveled from Tradebyte office in Ansbach, Bayern to Berlin’s Leipziger Straße by company-provided bus.
The company booked hotel rooms in Motel One, Leipziger straße for 30 plus of us. The plan was to go to the party on that evening, get back to the hotel, rest and travel back on the next day. People can also stay again and explore Berlin in a relaxed way, after-party and come back whenever they wish to return to Ansbach.
It was slightly an overcast condition in Ansbach, in the early morning. I got ready by 6:45 AM and prepared my morning coffee. Then I left straight to the meeting point in Bahnhofstraße for boarding the bus to Berlin. The plan was to start from Ansbach, then detour Nürnberg and pick few employees living there.
Our bus rolled on Autobahn A9(Highway) via Bayreuth swiftly through the landscapes of many meadows where cattle and horses were feeding. Construction works are going on in many places to the highway. For frequent travelers, the bus trip could be annoying as you see a lot of cars zipping next to you and Ferrari and supercars are quite common. Trucks should take the last lane of a six-lane road.
The most eye-pleasing stint in the journey is the sight of gigantic windmills on A9. They rotate slowly and sometimes with moderate speeds when the wind is high.
You also spot beautiful meadows and green pastures right next to the road. The soil type varies as we travel from south to east.
My friend and I played a small guessing game on the autobahn. It is to see the number-plate of trucks pass by and guess the city/town/municipality of the vehicle registered in Germany. Like for example, Ansbach registration is AN XX-YYY. Below is a number plate from Wolfsburg, Germany home of Volkswagen. The blue color “D” is Deutschland(Germany) with an EU flag in the background.
We saw trucks from European union, and also from other countries like Great Britain and Switzerland who has different number-plate. I came to know that when you enter into a different Schengen state, you have to pay a toll. But within Germany, for using autobahns(fast-driving roads), you pay no fee.
We stopped near a gas station in midway because our driver has to take rest for 45 minutes. In Germany, driving laws are strict and transparent. A driver should compulsorily for halt 45 minutes after driving straight for 8 hours. We had our lunch at around 11:45 AM.
The bus equips an in-house bathroom and a fridge. The ride was comfortable, and 5–6 hours journey didn’t exhaust us at all. Now, after the break, we headed towards Berlin. Our bus driver, on some occasions, announced the exciting facts about the regions like “Ahoy! Now we are entering into East Germany” etc.
Near Leipzig, we spotted from the bus a cargo airport of some private company. My friend told me that the planes halted there are Russian by observing their body paints. I wondered what Russian planes are doing there. But I later recollected that the same region was under the soviets until 1990.
Finally, at 2:45 PM, we entered into the outskirts of Berlin and soon into the city. The bus went through the Ernst-Reuter-Platz into the famous Tiergarten(Botanical gardens).
Since we are pouring in a lot of German words, here are some of the common words you see as a tourist and what they mean in English:
Nouns:
der Platz — the Square
die Straße — the Street
die Stadt — the City/Town
der Markt — the Market
die Garten — the Garden
die kirche — the Church
der Bahnhof — the Train Station
Adjectives:
Haupt — Central/Main (adj.)
Alt — Old
You can attach adjectives + nouns to form new words. Like:
Hauptplatz — Main square
Hauptgarten — Central garden
Hauptbahnhof — Central station
Altstadt — Old Town
Tiergarten is home for hundreds of huge trees in the heart of the Berlin city. There are many squares in the garden. Our bus passed by the famous Siegessäule(victory column) that is a remarkable piece of architecture which lifts the spirit of Berlin. The Prussian empire constructed it in 1873 as a memorial for its victory against the Danish forces. People in our bus stuck their noses to the window to see this marvelous figure.
After crossing a few traffic signals, we saw the Soviet war memorial, which is a statue remembered for the legacy of soviet soldiers in the Berlin city.
We then passed through the famous Brandenburg Tor(gate) from the west side of the city. FYI: The gate entrance faces East Berlin.
We will talk later more about this de-facto mascot of Berlin. Our bus took a right turn here onto Ebertstraße and faced few more traffic signals. Finally we reached hotel in Leipzigerstraße around 3:15 PM.
Within half an hour, everyone checked-in to Motel One. Many seem to be exhausted from the trip and want to have a nap before going to the party that starts at 6:00 PM and goes until 3:00 AM. But I have a different plan in my mind. I washed my face, locked my room 3:45 PM, and left the hotel for exploring the Berlin city. I have time until 5:30 PM when the bus starts from the hotel to the party venue.
I then checked the nearby attractions in Google and started walking towards a few of them. There are Germans, Chinese, Balkans, Turks, and tourists from many other nations walking in the streets. The good thing about my hotel location is every major attraction in Berlin is walk-able and under 2 KM distance. The only thing I am running against hard is the time.
People filled the Cafes and open restaurants who are enjoying the weekend atmosphere. I first took Friedrichstraße from Liepzigerstraße and walked onto Taubenstraße to reach Gendarmenmarkt. It is a square that has a concert hall and two churches Deutsche Kirche und französische Kirche (German church and French church). The architecture of all three is mind-boggling. I didn’t enter into them, but the vast square with cheering families, lovely couples, and, senior citizens made a lively atmosphere.
I then walked past the French church onto Markgrafenstraße and other streets just watching the architecture of buildings and observing people around. I also went to a few parks nearby where parents are playing with their kids and, few are biking. I sat there for sometimes and started to the next attraction, Berlin Gallery, which is 1.4 KM from that point.
While I am walking to the attraction, I received a call from my colleague saying office bus is ready to leave to the party venue and all are waiting for me at the hotel. Oh my god! I stared at my watch and found it was 5:30 PM already. Then I dumped my plan of going to Berlin gallery and walked back to Leipzigerstraße where my bus was standing on the road to take off. I didn’t even get time to change my clothes, and I jumped onto the bus coach, and it left after 7 minutes delay, curse me.
Berlin’s Tempelhofer Feld (Tempelhof airfield) hosts our party, which is an old airport where military airlines/cargo planes used to operate at the time of World War 2. Now it is a park, and like Station Berlin, the runway area is rented for parties and events to generate revenue. This place is famous for a cold war time event called “Berlin blockade and airlift.”
As a quick fact of history in the times of cold war from 1948–49, soviet occupied East Germany and cut down the entry for allies into west Berlin to provide the food supplies to its citizens. East Germany, which is under communist rule, surrounds West Berlin.
There is no other option for the US and its western allies(France, UK, Canada, New Zealand, etc.) than to fly supplies from West Germany to West Berlin. Tempelhofer Feld is used by Allied powers to receive the food supplies and then distribute them. It went for a year. I am lucky enough to stand on the same grounds where a lot of dramatic events took place 70 years back.

The party was great. I can see thousands everywhere, met many new folks. For Ex: I met a Spanish guy named Alex, who come from Palam de Mallorca island of Spain. He told me that Germans are the majority of tourists to his island because it was once a German territory. He said he is currently learning German and likes the job he does in Berlin.
As our conversation progressed, I told him when I think about Spain, Rafael Nadal comes to my mind. To my surprise, he said to me that Nadal too lives in Mallorca and Nadal’s home is just 5 KM from away from his. Wow! How often do you hear that from a stranger? Like “Do you know? Sachin Tendulkar lives two blocks away from me”.
My colleagues and I played many games like fußball, Table Tennis, Basketball at the party. We spent almost four hours playing, eating, networking, dancing, and enjoying the music and environment.
At night, people had a high time with drinks and danced to playing songs by a DJ. My friend and I decided to say goodbye to our colleagues at the party around 10:00 PM and planned to go out for sightseeing Berlin after dusk. Hurray! This time, I don’t have to go alone.
Now comes the exciting part! One of the friends and I took U-Bahn(Underground rail) from Tempelhof station to Hallesches Tor and planned to walk from there to Checkpoint Charlie. We don’t want to go till Französische straße, which is close to our hotel because we want to wander more on foot.
My friend is a history buff, and I was lucky that he is an unofficial tour guide for me. Apart from his mother tongue Turkmen, he speaks Russian, German, and also, Turkish. He was there in Berlin before, but he wants to explore the places again.
When we got out from Hallesches Tor station, we saw a water channel, a tributary of the Strengbach river right under the station. There is a small steamer boat drifting in the waters. It is like having a stream under the underground rail. In the station, you also find the historical pictures of the station lines damaged in WWII.
Then we walked around Mehringplatz, a circular residential square and steeped into Friedrichstraße. On the way, we have seen many buildings with graffiti and messages like “Make Art not War.” Many houses were silent and seemed like there is no activity at 11:00 PM.
Initially, I thought there were off to bed, but I came to know that Berlin people love nightlife and most of them will be hanging around bars and nightclubs along with friends drinking beer and eating sausages.
In the same street, we have reached a famous tourist spot called Checkpoint Charlie. It is an immigration checkpoint between East Berlin and West Berlin. East Berlin and West Berlin are divided by Berlin wall until 1990. The only road which you can take to cross the border is through this checkpoint. Here you have to prove who you are, show the permissions.
Before the Berlin wall was built in 1961, many people fled from East Germany to West Germany, which irked Soviet to construct a wall. Checkpoint Charlie is a very crucial point where sometimes soviet and the USA used to deploy tankers to show their power. I felt thrilled that the things from my history books are right in front of my eyes.
While we are at Checkpoint Charlie, a lovely young couple who are riding an e-scooter approached us and asked for help with directions. Their phones were dead, and they were confused about the location of their hotel. They are heading to Invalidenstraße. They noted the directions from Google maps on my phone and bade us goodbye.
From the Checkpoint Charlie, we headed towards Brandeburg Tor(gate) by taking the famous Wilhelmstraße. It was named after Friedrich Wilhelm I, a legendary Prussian king. Many government offices lie in this street, which gave it the name ”Government District.” It is one of the prominent streets in Germany before and even now. This street also has a museum that has Soviet TV Sets, landline phones etc.
We also walked past the Jew cemetery memorial, which is constructed by the German government and US embassy where you can see a bear idol, which is similar to the Statue of Liberty. Berlin’s coat of arms has a bear, so bears are very popular in Brandenburg, Berlin. Now comes the famous Brandeburg Tor(gate). We have reached the gate at around 11:45 PM. It was empty from tourists. It has a chariot on top with goddess Victoria riding it.
I stood at the East Germany side in front of the Brandenburg gate. Behind the gate is the Tiergarten where my bus took a right. East Germany entirely closed this gate in the communist regime. WWII conflicts destroyed the gate partially but then after restored.
I thought I have the whole night to explore this beautiful Berlin city and there were few to almost no tourists in the main attractions. Right next to the gate, I found there are US, France, and Russian consulate generals. My friend told me that every powerful nation tries to get the closest consulate near the Brandenburg gate. As I told you, he is my unofficial guide(chuckling)
From the gate, I can see a building that has round glass, Dom. I learned it is Bundestag(German Parliament office) in Platz der Republik(Republic square). They closed it already, so couldn’t explore it. I heard that people could attend the sessions but have to register online upfront.
www.bundestag.de
By then I felt exhausted because of the long bus journey, afternoon walk, party games, and two and half hours long walk again. We started walking back to our hotel via Charlottenstraße, where we once again went past Gendarmenmarkt, and I had an opportunity to glance at the famous Humboldt University of Berlin.
The specialty of this university is it has won 50 Nobel prizes till now and has great alumni: Sociologists like Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Physicists like Max Planck and Heinrich Hertz. The legendary Albert Einstein taught at this university from 1915–1928. I also collected few invitation cards those spread on a sitting bench as souvenirs for myself.
With all the good memories, we reached our hotel at 1:20 AM. I dropped myself on the bed after changing clothes. I slept soundly until 7:30 AM next morning, had my breakfast at the hotel and traveled back to Ansbach with my colleagues.
That ends my Berlin visit!
Now you know why Berlin completely changed my earlier impressions! Because it offered so much in very less time which I can cherish for my lifetime!

Should you visit Berlin? Absolutely not, as these five points prove. Not only will you have to endure a city where everyone seems to have no responsibilities and only want to party, your trip will then ruin the rest of your life when looking back at the very few things Berlin does well. Read on for some important warnings on why you shouldn’t bother visiting Berlin…
Clubbing in Berlin is like nothing else I’ve experienced. From the ridiculous door policies and marathon opening times to the endless techno, you’ll find that the nightlife in Germany’s capital is very unusual. But after just one night of being indoctrinated into the Berlin way of doing things, you’ll realise that they just do it better.
In Berlin clubs, it’s frowned upon to take photos — in some, photography is banned. But why would you want to take photos of your mates in the club anyway? Just enjoy the moment, your life shouldn’t be about showing off to your Instagram followers. Who cares if you got into Berghain, anyway??
You also won’t find any mirrors in the club toilets, either. Or anywhere else for that matter. But if you’re actually there to have a good time, does it even matter what you look like?
Next is the music. No one loves techno quite as much as Berliners do. Last time I went to Ipse in east Berlin, the crowd cheered after each DJ finished their set. Moments later, the next DJ would come on and play what sounds like the exact same track, only with a slightly different snare drum sample.
SEE ALSO: 4 things you’ll learn about clubbing in Berlin
And if you’re not into the hypnotic, monotonous music, you’re not getting in, because the bouncers will quiz you on who’s playing.
However, after clubbing in Berlin, you’ll realise that clubs elsewhere are full of posers who are just there to be seen, pretending to have fun. Does anyone even have fun in clubs outside of Berlin? Most likely, they’re not. In Berlin, they’re actually there because they love the music.
And that’s how it should be. Why go to a club with ludicrous drinks prices to pretend you’re something you’re not and live a lifestyle you don’t lead, just to impress a load of other people who’re in exact same boat as you. You might be sitting in the VIP booth, but truth is after tonight you’ll be back on your zero hours contract job or skipping your media studies lecture.
At least in Berlin, clubbers are honest. When you get home, clubbing will be ruined for you as you’ll realise just how futile and pathetic it is anywhere else.
Berlin is probably one of the cheapest major cities in the world. Want a latte at the train station? It’s yours for the princely sum of €1. Want a kebab? That’s €3.50. In fact, the only thing that’s overpriced is entry to the TV Tower.
Trust me, in just a few days you’ll get used to the low prices (unless you head over to Poland or Hungary next!) and when you get home, if you’re from the UK, the USA, or elsewhere in western or northern Europe, things will suddenly seem so expensive.
On a night out in east Berlin, you could have a beer for under €2. That would cost you around £5 in London. We even picked up 0.5l bottles of beer at a convenience store for €0.60. Sixty cents. That’s insanely cheap!
Nothing ever happened in Berlin. It might be the capital of Germany, but Germany only became a country in 1871. Even the USA has 100 years on that, while England was unified in the 10th century and has been a country ever since.
Plus, Berlin was almost totally destroyed in 1945. And nothing really happened after that…
Of course in reality, Berlin was one of the major flash points in the Cold War. Take the Berlin Crisis in 1961, where US and Soviet tanks had a standoff for 16 hours, 50 meters apart, with live ammunition. Chilling stuff.
Or the Berlin Wall, and the numerous escape attempts that led to hundreds of East Germans tragically dying at the hands of the border guards, as well as the fascinating stories of how a handful of people got away with it through their audacious escape attempts. You can learn about these at the Berlin Wall Museum at Checkpoint Charlie.
And who can forget the former German Democratic Republic? If you’ve been watching Deutschland 83, you’ll already know about the East German Communist state. Find out what life was like behind the iron curtain in the DDR museum in Berlin Mitte. Though it was one of the more successful communist states, you’ll learn that freedom was severely restricted, and find out how the population coped by listening to communist music, watching steroid-fuelled sports, and going on nudist beach holidays (yes, really).
Berlin is known for it’s chilled freewheeling spirit, that’s much less intense than other large cities like London or Paris. You’ll find the people here are really down to earth and relaxed. In the summer months, many people sit out drinking at beach bars on the banks of the river Spree, or take a dip in the Badeschiff.
They’re not uptight about when clubs close like in other cities — parties from Friday night are known to stay open until Monday morning. No matter what time of day or day of the week, you’ll see people relaxing and having fun, partly down to the rise of flexi-time working hours in the city.
SEE ALSO: What in the world is travel hacking?
The city is also home to around 20,000 artists, drawn to the city thanks to cheap rents and tons of studio space. Similarly, Berlin is a hotspot for tech startups, meaning there’s lots of hipsters to meet in the multitude of quirky, independent bars.
After you leave, you’ll miss the constant party scene, particularly if you’re going back to the daily grind of the rat race back home.
Bologna has bolognese, Tokyo has sushi, and Berlin has… doner kebabs?
But these aren’t the standard greasy kebabs you’d pick up at 3 am after stumbling out of a grimy provincial Essex nightclub. The döner im brot is ubiquitous across Berlin, and absolutely delicious, served with salad, and both garlic and herb and hot sauce. The grilled bread that these kebabs are served in makes all the difference, rather than the dry pitta you’d get served in the UK. While you can pick up a doner anywhere, you can find the best in the city here.
Let’s also not forget the famous curry wurst, made from a steamed, then fried pork sausage, served with a ketchup based sauce topped with curry powder, and a side of fries.
The humble curry wurst owes its existence to World War Two. The dish was invented by Herta Heuwer in Charlottenburg, west Berlin, in 1949. Having acquired curry powder, ketchup and Worcestershire sauce from the occupying British troops, serving up the first curry wursts to the construction workers rebuilding the city.
Today, Berliners can’t get enough, guzzling 70 million of them each year.
So yes, food in Berlin really is the wurst (sorry)

International journalism students report from Berlin, the heart of Europe.

By Carly Kay
The familiar rumble of plastic suitcase wheels against cobblestoned streets was suddenly drowned out by the pulse of techno music and a cacophony of languages as I finally dragged my luggage over the threshold of Generator Hostel in Berlin Mitte.
The words “You are crazy my child. You must go to Berlin” and “Make love not war” were boldly printed upon cabinet doors that displayed a photo of the now-iconic kiss between former East German president Erich Honecker and former Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, painted on a piece of the Berlin Wall known as the East Side Gallery.
Within an instant, this dimly lit corner of the hostel lobby seemed to reinforce Berlin’s international reputation for chaos and creativity. After spending months researching the famously reunified city, I was prepared to enter in real life the picturesque vision of history-laced eccentricity that had vividly taken shape in my mind.
Yet, instead of being met by hordes of passionate young people, as I had imagined from the comforts of Santa Barbara, I encountered silent unblinking stares and direct, unapologetic words. Known for embracing freedom, the city exists at the same time in a culture that rigidly abides by unspoken rules.
Soon after I boarded a bus from Tegel airport, it became apparent that the local passengers had very little tolerance for visitors who unknowingly violated these mutually-recognized social agreements.
Taking in my new surroundings, I was suddenly ripped from my tranquil, contemplative state when the sound of loud banging against glass filled the air.
“My wife! My wife! Please, someone stop the bus. My wife is out there,” shouted a flustered man with two daughters in tow.
Despite the panic in the man’s voice, the bus driver continued to pull out of the station. I watched in disbelief as the nearly full bus watched the situation unfold without the slightest inclination to help the man left on the sidewalk.
After a few seconds of the traveler’s incessant pleading, a man inside the bus rolled his eyes and reluctantly yelled something in German to the bus driver, apparently driven more by annoyance than altruism.
Berliners and travelers alike glued their eyes to the confused family as they attempted to reconvene and reevaluate the transit system in the doorway of the bus. As I gaped at the family, people around me began to shift uncomfortably in their seats and a palpable frustration settled over the crowd.
Growing impatient with the family’s indecision, the same German man who spoke to the bus driver began aggressively making shoo-ing gestures towards the door.
“Out, Out,” he shouted bluntly to the family. “A different bus for you. Out.”
The confused family finally stepped off the bus to discuss travel logistics elsewhere.
As the engine revved, the bus driver’s voice came over the intercom. Unfamiliar syllables and guttural noises drifted over my head and provoked an outbreak of laughter from the locals around me.
I did not understand what the bus driver said, but could only imagine it had something to do with the visitor’s inability to understand the social expectations for proper bus etiquette. My suspicion was confirmed during our orientation when I heard stories of bus drivers denying rides to passengers if they were waiting just off to the side of designated stops.
These small codes and standards seemed to contradict the glorified free-spirited energy that I strongly associated with Berlin. The city fosters a sense of radical self-expression. But at the same time, its occupants are afforded a certain level of responsibility, to respect mutually-understood social values.
A bit unsure of our new temporary home, I considered how to navigate such a complex system of both rigidity and independence. The system both welcomes daring innovations with open arms, while it exiles particular deviations from the norm with sharp rebukes.
So, despite my apprehension, I confidently dragged my suitcase through the hostel lobby, ready to engage with a convoluted labyrinth of social norms that co-exist in the city that has an explosive sense of self-identity. I guess you could call me a ‘crazy child.’ I had truly arrived in Berlin.
UCSB journalism students are now reporting daily in Berlin for feature articles which will be published here in July. Meanwhile, they are blogging from the city about their travel and journalism experiences.

Edit: After posting this, I got a lot of responses from people who also attended the Berlin Opera Academy and had something to say. I’ve asked for their permission to share their stories. You can find them at the bottom of this article.
On the first day of BOA 2022, during the general assembly, the head of the program gave us a rousing speech. It really was very good — you could see people eyes lighting up, and I felt my own face glow with anticipation.
However, he said one thing that made me a little suspicious. ‘Be positive,’ he told us. ‘Have a positive mindset. Don’t grumble or complain. Make something out of it.’
Of course, I completely agree with the benefits of a positive mindset. There’s a lot of whining and complaining in any world, and we’d all be better off without it. But at the same time, this sounded defensive to me — as if he knew there were things that weren’t right, and hoped to not get too much pushback.
As it turned out, the BOA program, for all its merits, has a few drawbacks that I think people should be aware of before signing up.
But let’s start on that positive note.
BOA is a great initiative and Berlin is a great city. The teachers that they attract are often amazing and will give you valuable feedback. They will often give you their honest opinion, and because you’re seeing lots of different people in a short amount of time, you will start to notice which comments keep popping up. I, for example, heard that I was moving around rather aimlessly from three different teachers. That’s when you know it should be the first priority on your list of things to fix.
This is a great opportunity that might be worth paying for, especially if you’ve never done it before (I hadn’t).
You’ll get to actually do a whole opera and you will be guided by professional conductors and directors. I got extremely lucky: my opera (Suor Angelica) was directed by Susan Stone. She displayed a kind of professionalism that I really learned a lot from over the span of four weeks. She was kind and open, but not overly familiar. She was ridiculously smart, had very original ideas for the piece which the executed with meticulous precision, and held us and herself to a very high standard. It was one of the most inspiring things that month.
You might make some new friends, and you’ll be able to see how you measure up to others. This will be both encouraging and discouraging. Personally, I learned that, repertoire-wise, I was way better prepared than almost anyone else there, which was lovely. But I also learned that my interpretations suffered because I wasn’t intentional enough in my on-stage movement. This was painful to realise, but it was very important as it allowed me to work on it.
During the first two weeks, I got into exactly zero masterclasses. That’s right. The booking system where you are supposed to make your own appointments was deeply flawed. It basically meant that whoever had the fastest internet connection could get multiple masterclasses every day, while others went weeks without getting a masterclass. When the students of BOA 2022 complained, there were “warnings” issued to those who over-booked. But by then, many people had fallen behind in a way that could not be fixed. When I finally got my first masterclass in week three, I let the teacher know how happy I was to finally have snagged a spot. The teacher said: ‘Are you serious? I’m seeing some people for the fourth time today.’After that, I took it upon myself to help distribute classes fairly by snagging masterclasses I’d already been to and contact people that hadn’t worked with that teacher yet, to give them my spots. I even contacted some teachers separately and paid them for private lessons at their homes, because BOA wouldn’t have them back for more classes. The people at BOA had no solution for this problem, other that to issue warnings and block people who had had too many masterclasses — but as this only happened halfway into the program, most people were not able to make up for their lost time. This meant that some people got way more than their money’s worth from BOA, while others really did not.
This was one of the factors that resulted in the over-booked masterclasses. While I was there, they were staging three or four operas at the same time, all with three separate casts. This meant an absurd number of singers, all fighting over the same finite resources. It also means that everyone’s attention is spread very thin. The maestro has to work with two other people singing the same role as you, and they’re also working on the other productions. In my case, our director was working with four casts simultaneously — two for Suor Angelica and two for Gianni Schicchi — while the conductor was working on every production that was going on at that moment (do the math: 4 operas x 3 casts per opera). Whelp.
The Berlin Opera Academy also accepts people with little to no experience (who then eat up all the time with the conductor because they haven’t studied or cannot sing their parts). I knew all my parts by heart when I got there. My “time with the conductor” was five minutes in a huge rehearsal, after which he said ‘Great, thank you’ and moved on to the two other people singing the same part.
Let me be clear: there were people at BOA 2022 who said: ‘It wasn’t like this last time.’ I think I caught the program at an especially bad time. I came during the busiest month, and halfway into the production, the entire costume and set department quit because of unsafe working conditions and the fact that BOA had not delivered on their promises to them (which BOA admitted). They tried to salvage the situation, but in the end many productions had to scramble to get any kind of costumes together.
This is a relatively minor issue, but the venue where the operas were staged was a letdown. The ‘changing rooms’ were a gigantic, completely dark garage-like space that was open to the elements. When it rained, there was water everywhere. The hall is very oddly designed and is clearly better suited to an art exposition than music. The orchestra sat to the right of the performers, while there were a couple of chairs herded together in the far corner for a tiny audience. I felt a bit embarrassed that I had invited my family to come see the production.
If you’re looking for that glamorous opera feeling, this is not the right program. Considering sticker price is almost €5000, I would have expected more.
Well… that depends. For me, it was worth the money, but mostly because I hadn’t done anything like this before, I got a partial scholarship and because I was willing to pay teachers separately for extra classes. I learned a lot and had lots of fun experiences. But I don’t think I would ever go there again, and I would not pay the full price to go there.
After I published this article, I got lots of comments from fellow students. Some of them were generous enough to let me share their opinions here.
I’d have mentioned the amount of commuting you have to do between rehearsals and classes/coachings. But overall, I think it’s too generous to BOA, to be honest. The thing is a scam. I felt so bad for the kids who paid €5000 to be triple cast as the third genie or something. And members of staff sexually propositioned people on the course after they’d finished their final show. I’ve told so many people not to do it.- Anonymous
Honestly, I think you covered everything very well — the only thing I would maybe add was that we weren’t really in “Berlin” we were very much on the outskirts of the city and had to take public transit for like 45 mins to each location, which made it hard to be able to participate in everything, to be honest.- Charlotte Forknall
I think what we received as participants in the programme was completely unacceptable. If I hadn’t received scholarship from BOA and from another source, I would probably be fighting to get a refund. I’ve done other summer programmes before and this was easily the worst, and cannot even be compared because the standard is so low. If anyone were to ask me about BOA, I would without hesitation tell them it’s a scam. - Anonymous
1000% agree with everything you said. The only reason I do it, is it’s the cheapest conducting program that includes opera. - Anonymous
I totally agree with each and every word. We as singers are so desperate to sing and do our job, that sometimes we don’t ask ourselves questions like: ‘Did I pay too much and get too little?’ This whole industry is telling us to be happy and grateful, and not to advocate for ourselves. But I think it’s important to not only be positive. Especially if you’re a woman and you’re a bit angry, people call you a bitch. But it’s not a bitchy quality, it’s a human quality to protect yourself and stay with the truth. I think it’s really important to speak about, if we want this business work for everybody, and not just for money.- Katsia Kaya

The P-51 Mustang is one of the most recognizable aircraft in military aviation history, and the story of “Berlin Express” illustrates just how far the Mustang’s legacy reaches.
The warbird’s story begins with American World War II aviator William B. “Bill” Overstreet who hailed from Clifton Forge, Virginia. After enlisting following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Overstreet trained with the U.S. Army Air Corps and was eventually deployed at Raydon Airfield in England. There he joined a squadron of the Eighth Air Force flying Republic P-47 Thunderbolts from RAF Leiston. As the AAF transition to the newer Mustang, Overstreet got his first opportunity to pilot a P-51 on January 30, 1944.
Overstreet named his first P-51, which he received in February 1944 “Southern Belle.” However, the aircraft was lost while being flown in combat by a different pilot a couple of weeks later, causing him to rethink the name. At the time, his squadron was assigned to bomber escort missions with the 357th fighter group regularly flying sorties to Germany, and thus the “Berlin Express” was born. All his subsequent planes went by the same moniker.
The “Berlin Express” P-51B Mustang achieved legendary status during an epic World War II dogfight in Paris in 1944, when Overstreet flew the aircraft under the Eiffel Tower in hot pursuit of a German fighter. Overstreet eventually downed the German Messerschmitt Bf 109G and eluded heavy enemy fire while escaping the battle with the “Berlin Express” intact. This victory was later immortalized by Len Krenzler in a painting of the “Berlin Express’” Eiffel Tower victory.
“Our man Bill was like Daredevil, the man without fear. Between flying so low and dodging enemy fire, he still shot a few bursts of his guns and hit the 109’s engine. In a last-ditch effort, the 109 flew under the Eiffel Tower hoping Overstreet would avoid it — NOPE!” recalled Brian Burnett II, Tour Guide at National Museum of the U.S. Air Force. “Bill followed him under the tower, and as the 109 pulled up, Bill sent him back down in flames. Afterwards, Bill went down to the river and followed it, barely above water level. Under the cover of the structures on either side, he made his way out of the city and back to base,” continued Burnett.
Today, the restored Mustang “Berlin Express” is based on the remains of the P-51B 43–24837. This Mustang flew with the 9th Air Force’s 363rd Fighter Group out of RAF Staplehurst in Kent, England. It crashed in Beckley on June 10, 1944, after the pilot was forced to bail out during a training exercise. Sporting a “Malcolm Hood” canopy and wearing the markings for “Berlin Express,” its paint scheme models the 357th Fighter Group Mustang that Overstreet made famous.
The modern day “Berlin Express” also made a historic transatlantic flight from the U.S. to England with U.S. Air Force Heritage Flight alumnus Lee Lauderback in the cockpit, following the same route it took in 1942 as part of the military troop buildup in the United Kingdom during WWII. The four-day, 5,470-mile journey began June 28, 2017, in Texas and culminated with its landing at Duxford Airfield in England on July 4.
Nearly 80 years after its original landmark moment, the “Berlin Express” will take to the skies with the Horsemen Flight Team in honor of the Italian Air Force’s centennial celebrations in Rome from June 16–18.
Dan Friedkin, who owns “Berlin Express,” will fly the historic aircraft and perform in the Pratica di Mare Air Show on the right wing alongside his longtime Horsemen Flight Teammates Jim Beasley, Jr. and Ed Shipley.
“The ‘Berlin Express’ is an iconic aircraft that symbolizes a defining period in the history of aerial combat,” said Dan Friedkin, chairman and CEO of The Friedkin Group, Horsemen Flight Team member and AS Roma football club president and owner. “It’s an honor to fly in the Pratica di Mare Air Show as we pay homage to the brave men and women who have shaped the course of military aviation. We’re excited to offer people around the world the chance to celebrate Aeronautica Militare’s memorable history and look forward to flying our routine for the first time in Rome, a city that holds a special place in my heart.”

My (non-definitive) list, based on my own experiences in Berlin.
1 Get your photos done at a Photoautomat
Once in Berlin, you’ll notice there are photobooths (photoautomats) all over the city. Unlike your boring new photobooths, they give you a retro-looking strip of four black and white photos.
It’s just one of those fun things to do with your mates to ensure you have a memento of your visit — get a few so you have one each! I’ve only used three of the various photobooths — and I shall warn you now, the one down the road from Checkpoint Charlie on Friedrichstraße is rubbish. Don’t use that one. Two of our friends, my fiance and I attempted to get several — hilares — photos using this device and each time one of us came out with no facial features. The one on Torstraße (near Rosa-Luxemburg Platz station) is much better, as is the one in Eberswalder Straße.
2 Get matching tattoos
Yeah, you can do this anywhere. But it’s always more fun if you do it on holiday and especially somewhere as fun and arty as Berlin. The good thing about getting a spontaneous tattoo here is that tattoo health and safety standards are pretty good. They only use needles once, rather than sterilising and using again. This does mean that it can cost quite a bit more, but when it comes to a needle in your body for a permanent drawing, I’d certainly rather pay for a bit of extra safety.
That said, there are your expensive options, and your cheap options — like anywhere. If you want an alternative experience then I’d definitely recommend a visit to White Trash, just down the road from Badeschiff (also very cool), in the South East. White Trash is a fast food restaurant with an in-house tattoo parlour called No Pain, No Brain. It’s worth visiting for the atmosphere and “fuck you fries” alone. My friend and I visited there wanting a tattoo to be told of the prices, near 60–80EUR each I think (don’t quote me) as they had to charge an hourly price for each due to their strict rules on needles. We only wanted a tiny wrist tattoo, so after attempting to haggle and losing, decided to stick with the food and find somewhere else.
So, the cheap option. This was no easy task. We headed back to my then home of Prenzlauer Berg and Googled for tattoo parlours, in the hope that with less reputation and hype, we’d find cheaper prices. After locating a few, walking to them and finding them closed for the day, we eventually found a little walk-in parlour near Rosenthaler Platz. Quite the experience. The receptionist, with her mean face and tattooed-on eyebrows grunted 40EUR each for our small tattoos, and we figured that was the best we were going to get. We sat in the waiting room, in line, watching the tattooist working, with mixed feelings of excitement and “are we making a huge mistake?” — nevertheless, it seemed like a pretty safe place, and after seeing a few customers walk away pleased with their tattoos, we decided to stick with it. The tattooist was a tiny man with receding but long hair, a crop top, ripped flares and huge boots. He was actually ace. After a few alterations, we were happy with our matching wrist tats.
3 Go on an alternative walking tour
You will notice various walking tours of the city that are run by several different companies. Quite a few of them are free. If it’s your first visit and you want a guide for all the must-sees, I would recommend a basic history walking tour. If you’re interested in the more alternative, underground side of Berlin, there is an alternative walking tour you can do. I wrote a review of the tour a few months back if you’d like more details, but essentially it is a tour of some of Berlin’s famous street art, a visit to some pretty cool areas including the cultural hot-pot Kreuzberg and my favourite little back-alley near Otto Weidt’s old workshop (that is all I will say!), as well as some interesting alternative history. If you’re interested, check details here.
4 Visit Yaam and the East Side Gallery
Yaam sits on the banks of the River Spree, and is an outdoor beach and bar (as well as so much more). Unfortunately, also on the banks of the River Spree is the Media Spree Project — which is selling off the space to large corporations. Yaam has already been moved once and now resides in a new location, but it might not be long before it’s moved again, so please do go before you miss it.
Round the corner from Yaam is the famous East Side Gallery. This is the longest stretch of the original wall, covered top-to-toe in art. If you walk on the inner (bare) side, it really gives you as near-as-possible a sense of the enclosing feeling of The Wall. There is some amazing art, some you’ll recognise, some new, but it is definitely worth visiting.
5 Eat, drink and be merry at Augustiner’s
This place. While I was living there, it was a firm favourite with my fiance and I. We took his family when they were visiting who loved it too. It is a Bavarian-style restaurant and bar located within the Gendanemmarkt, and it’s pretty huge. Filled with barrels, amazing Bavarian decor and staff in traditional German attire — if you’re looking for somewhere central with great German food, this is the place. Sure, there are probably less touristy places that are more traditional but this was our go-to place and I can’t recommend it enough. It was especially lovely at Christmastime, as you can imagine. I can highly recommend the knuckle of pork!
6 Go clubbing
My days of clubbing are kind of, well, over. However. I do appreciate that if you want clubbing, Berlin is the place. If you want a “proper” club, Watergate is highly recommended by a friend of mine. There is a club near Kottbusser Tor station called Ritter Butzke which has multiple rooms accessible via an outdoor courtyard, that I would highly recommend for a night out. When we where there, there was a clubnight, an alternative night held in a room decorated like something out of an alternative Alice in Wonderland, and a chilled out art show (it was Berlin Art Week). If you’re feeling lucky, you can also attempt to get into the mighty Berghain, (probably) only for the experience of being turned away by the scary-looking bouncer, Sven. If you want something a bit smaller, there are some ace little places in Kreuzberg, such as Madame Claud’s, where everything is upside-down. Kreuzberg is an excellent place to begin, if only because that’s where Bowie and Iggy used to hang out. Although, my friends and I went to SO36, the bar they frequented, all excited only to find a Salsa night. We left. I’d highly recommend having a walk around and discovering places for yourself in this district — you’ll never know what you may find. Just be aware that nights out start pretty late in Berlin, so don’t go to a club too early.
7 Go shopping
There is SO much shopping to be done in Berlin — for every taste. Premium brands are seemingly everywhere here, as well as little boutiques and your highstreet chains such as Urban Outfitters. If you’re looking for premium brands and a generally high end shopping experience, check out KaDeWe. It is an impressive department store that I’d liken to Selfridges or Harrods. It houses make up and beauty, women’s and men’s fashion and accessories, home products, and a lovely cafe bar which sits behind the gorgeous huge rounded windows. Once you’re done there (if you ever are), take a walk nearby down the Ku’Damm, a large street modeled on the Champs Elysees in Paris, adorned with shops of all kinds.
If you want high end independent boutiques as well as few high street favourites, check out the area around Rosenthaler Straße in Mitte, it’s not far from AlexanderPlatz. You can get the U-bahn to Rosa-Luxemburg Platz, walk left and work your way down.
8 Take in the history
I couldn’t write a to do list for Berlin without mentioning history. I am a history buff, and Germany’s — particularly Berlin’s — history fascinates me. I find it magical that a city exposed to such horror, chaos and darkness now has one of the happiest vibes. If you want to cover off the must-sees, I would start at the Brandenburg Gate. Beware of any fake soldiers trying to grab the attention of tourists, I’ve been captured before. Also watch out for Predator and Darth Vader who sometimes make an appearance — though what that has to do with Germany’s history I’ll never know.
From there, ahead of you is Unter Den Linden, the famous tree-lined street that the Nazi’s marched down on their way to the Reichstag, to the right, which is also worth a visit if not just to see the outside of the magnificent structure. If you want to go inside the glass dome, which gives you a 360 view of Berlin along with a headset guide that goes through Berlin’s vast history as you walk up and down the spiral, you have to book. You can do so online very easily but make sure you take your passport along with you as there’s a security check before you go in — it is still a government building, after all.
Walk to the left and you’ll see the Holocaust Memorial, or, Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. It’s an astounding structure and I would highly recommend you visit it, and walk through in silence. Too many people seem to find the “hide-and-seek” element amusing and it always bugs me. There are other memorials around the city for homosexuals and gypsies also murdered by the Nazi’s during the Second World War, it’s important that they are all remembered so visit if you can.
I’d also recommend visiting Checkpoint Charlie, named so not because of a man named Charlie, but simply phonetically, the third checkpoint. It’s a famous checkpoint with a recreation of the original view — and hidden somewhere in the street is a very interesting museum which details everything you’d need to know about The Wall, including the division of Germany and some individual stories of strength.
If you have time, further out is the Olympic Stadium of 1936, well worth seeing as an example of Nazi architecture. If you enjoy veering off the normal path, there are other things further out you can visit, such as Haus am Wannsee Konferenz, now a Holocaust museum, that was once home to the planning of the Final Solution.
I could go on, but as I said, if you’re a first timer, go on a walking tour — it’ll ensure you get some things checked off the list. It takes a few visits to see everything.
9 Watch Karaoke at Mauer Park
If you have a spare Sunday, visit Mauer Park. This is a large park in the East. On Sundays, it is home to a fleamarket, which is raved about — to be honest, my fiance and I went and were pretty disappointed. It appeared to us like a bit of a tat-market, with echoes of a once-awesome, grab memorabilia for a bargain vibe. Of course, that is what happens — it starts with some ace old items from the GDR, and a smaller audience looking for genuine items and then everyone talks about it and over a few years, tat makes an appearance.
Anyway — also featuring on a Sunday at the park is Karaoke. You can sit outside, bask in the sun and watch people sing or take part yourself. I’m sure I don’t need to describe the concept of karaoke to you, but just imagine that, outside, with lots of other people, in Berlin.
10 Play Ping Pong
A light-hearted one to finish. Just down the road from Eberswalder Straße station is Dr Pong. This is an industrial-style, small (and a bit grotty) bar featuring, you guessed it, a Ping Pong table. You purchase a bat with your drink, wait for a game to start, and get involved. The players walk round the table, batting the ball on their turn, or losing, until two players remain. Then everyone watches and cheers while the two battle it out and one is victorious. Then it all starts again. Of course, there are some who take it very seriously, but ignore them and just have fun. Every time I tried I was out on my first go, one time hitting another sorry player in the face with the ball (by accident!).

But what exactly is Pictoplasma? Similar to the question posed in “The Matrix,” I found myself needing to discover the answer for myself. Let me explain: In 2004, I bought the first Pictoplasma character book in a bookstore in Switzerland and was completely captivated. I also visited their very informative website at the time and gathered that it was a meeting for character designers. Since that day, I wanted to attend Pictoplasma myself. However, it took me 20 years to finally make it. So in May 2024, I attended the conference in Berlin. On the first day, I felt a bit overwhelmed, not because of what was offered, but due to the organization. Everyone had to wait patiently until they could register. I felt a bit lost, but around 3:30 PM, things finally got started. I went to the registration and then directly to the first exhibitions by the artists who would be giving talks in the coming days. I saw some of the works and took them in. Then I wandered around the venue for a while.
The next day, the conference truly kicked off. According to the program, some highly renowned artists from the scene had gathered in Berlin. I attended talks by Joe Bennett, a young designer and animator from the USA. He recently made waves with his series “Scavenger Reign” on HBOMax, a sci-fi series that looks like it could have come from the mind of the artist Moebius. He has been working on this series for over seven years, and it will be available on Netflix in the coming months. His other works for Adult Swim and Fox also stand out, characterized by a quirky but endearing sense of humor.
Additionally, the artist duo “Los Calladitos” really impressed me. Their stunning murals depicting a fantastical world centered around the preservation of light captivated me. They work on their pieces with incredible care and creativity. They also showed some animations from their own film, which brought even more life to their characters and world. Unfortunately, I missed a talk by Peter The Roman, an artist known for experimenting with AI in his 3D worlds. However, I saw some of his works in the exhibitions spread across various locations in Berlin. Overall, 20 artists participated, giving talks and workshops.
But what sets Pictoplasma apart? It’s not merely a stage for artists; it’s also one of the largest communities in the realm of character art and animation. The “Artist Talks” provided profound insights into the world of artists: their methodologies, how they develop ideas and strategies, and how they publish, sell, and make a living from their art. It’s a platform for exchange and collaboration, bringing creatives from diverse backgrounds together. Moreover, the conference reflects the zeitgeist of 2024. In a world dominated by AI, Pictoplasma artists emphasize the importance of emotion and craftsmanship. It became evident that while AI is a valuable tool for ideation, the execution of most artists’ works remains in human hands. This realization, which I suspected before Pictoplasma, was confirmed and reinforced during the event. Indeed, the use of AI elevates the significance of handmade art. Consider, for instance, the wooden figures crafted by artist Parn “Ani” Aniwat, who carves more than 30 charming characters each month. Or reflect on Los Calladitos, who seamlessly transfer their unique style from the vast walls of their murals to their animated films. Even the ceramic lamps crafted by Portuguese artist and entrepreneur Ana Seixas demonstrate how handmade artworks garner special relevance and appreciation. Ultimately, one desires to touch the art that inundates our digital world.
All the days at Pictoplasma were incredibly lively and full of inspiration. One of the most interesting talks was by Philip Hunt, a creative director at AKA Studios from the UK. He shared his experiences and insights about design and art, particularly regarding the film industry and the challenges of adapting a children’s book like “Here We Are” by Oliver Jeffers into a film. He discussed the extensive thought and effort required to translate beautifully drawn 2D characters into a 3D medium. After many ideas and experiments, he and his team successfully turned the book into a beautiful film, which can be admired on Apple TV. By chance, I met Philip on Sunday, the last day of Pictoplasma, at a small flea market in Berlin. I approached him because I didn’t get the chance to talk to him at the event. We had a pleasant conversation about the industry, covering topics like advertising, films, and other media. He asked me how I found Pictoplasma, and I told him that initially, I didn’t know what to expect or what I would take away from it. He responded that each year, he takes away inspiration and a reminder of why he continues his work. He loves attending Pictoplasma, getting inspired by other artists, and gaining a perspective beyond commercial work. He also shared that he attended the first Pictoplasma 20 years ago and didn’t know what it was about back then either. Now, he teaches workshops and helps lead the Pictoplasma Academy. It was a very enjoyable conversation. So, what makes Pictoplasma so special? It’s the chance to see designers and artists doing something different from just working on commercial projects. This is something I can definitely take away from it. I was deeply moved by the following artist talks. One of them was by the artist Parn “Ani” Aniwat. Out of necessity, he began carving small figures out of wood. Now, he makes 30 pieces a month — small, cute characters that he sells to collectors and exhibitors. It has become his business. He gave us a glimpse into his workday, which runs from 9 to 5, after which he spends time with his family, sketches ideas, and watches Netflix. The same goes for the Portuguese artist and entrepreneur Ana Seixas. During the pandemic, she started working with pottery and created clay lamp characters that sold faster in her shop than she could make them.
Of course, even at a conference focused on hand-drawn, painted, or crafted characters, the topic of artificial intelligence can’t be avoided. Some artists use AI as a tool to support their ideas. However, despite the technology and digital capabilities that AI offers, traditional craftsmanship remains one of the most important aspects. While no one insists that art must be created by hand, most artists still find themselves holding a pencil or an Apple Pencil. One of the most memorable statements about AI came from Philip Hunt. A young designer from the audience asked him whether she should focus more on AI. He responded that she should focus on drawing, as AI will inevitably come. But drawing with a pencil would always convey ideas better (or something along those lines; I’m not certain of the exact wording). Another artist, possibly Christopher Rutledge, mentioned that AI is a useful tool but compared it to mastering image databases or programs like Photoshop or After Effects. Artists have shown that they engage with AI, but in the end, it’s their ideas and visions that they bring to life. For the past few months, I’ve felt that we are returning to an era of “handmade” artistry, especially in art, film, and design. With the overproduction of AI-generated images and texts, which now look and read quite well, the personal touch is often missing. A good example is animator Joe Taylor, who makes his style unmistakable with hand-drawn loops that resemble flat designs from claymation. He showcased a commercial clip for the ProCreate app, which he both drew and animated using their software.
Aside from the talks, there were workshops, exhibitions, and parties. Unfortunately, I couldn’t attend all the talks or everything that was offered. Given that Berlin is a very large city and the event organizers thought it would be a good idea to use various locations across the city, it wasn’t easy to be everywhere. There was also an AR scavenger hunt called Character Hunt, where participants had to travel around Berlin using the Adobe Aero app to view the characters. Great ideas, but too little time to experience everything. Attending Pictoplasma was a fascinating journey into the realm of art, characters, and animation. It was far more than I could have ever imagined back then. For me, it was a significant source of inspiration for my work as a designer. Here, I could discover new perspectives and gain a wealth of inspiration.
The most captivating talk was also the last one of Pictoplasma. It was by Mila Useche from Colombia. She is an artist and filmmaker who had a tough journey. She had to fight hard in the working world, including working for a game company where she worked up to 15 hours a day. She then became a freelancer, working for studios like Disney, Warner Brothers, Nickelodeon, and Netflix. She also worked on her own concepts and film ideas. One of these is currently being realized in a German-Colombian co-production.
Recently, there has been a crisis in many animation studios in the USA, with widespread layoffs and job cuts. Adding to this were the aftermath of the pandemic and the surge of companies eager to use AI. Mila needed to find a way out, so she began sharing her hand-drawn images on Instagram, reaching many people who celebrated her art. She now lives in Japan, where she produces her art and characters. That was Pictoplasma 2024. A few days in another world, a world full of inspiration, art, characters, and animated films. Just a different kind of matrix.

We mark the birth on May 11, 1888–132 years ago today — of the Russian-born American songwriter Irving Berlin (1888–1989). Berlin wrote the words and music to over 1500 songs across a 60-plus year career. He is an American institution, whose life was, according to his obituary in the New York Times, “a classic rags-to-riches story that he never forgot could have happened only in America.” Having emigrated from his native Russian Empire at the age of five, Berlin grew up dirt poor in Manhattan’s Lower East Side. Nevertheless, he was a legend by the age of 23. All told, he wrote the scores for 20 Broadway musicals and 15 Hollywood movie musicals. His songs were nominated for eight Academy Awards. (His one Oscar win came in 1943, for the song White Christmas. Bing Crosby’s recording has sold upwards of 100 million copies, and remains the best-selling single of all time).
A word. I have been writing these Music History Monday posts since Monday, September 5, 2016. Over the years, these posts have run between 1500 and 2000 words; a few shorter and a very few longer. (I figure if you can’t tell a good story in 2000 words, you shouldn’t be telling it at all. For our reference, Op-Ed columns in the New York Times run between 400 and 1200 words, with 650 words considered the “sweet spot”.)
But for the first time in these Music History Monday posts, I am not going to exercise my usual editorial restraint regarding word count; Irving Berlin and his songs are just too important and, I believe, presently underappreciated to short-sell them. So here is what we’re going to do. Today’s Music History Monday post (which runs over 2600 words), will discuss the nature of Irving Berlin’s songs; their importance to the twentieth century American experience; and Berlin’s early life up to the publication of his first song, Marie from Sunny Italy in 1907. Tomorrow’s Dr. Bob Prescribes post, which will appear at Patreon.com/RobertGreenbergMusic, will pick up Berlin’s biography in 1907 and take it through 1911, when he created the song that made him a legend: Alexander’s Ragtime Band. From there we’ll discuss his amazing, truly singular output, paying particular attention to his skills as a lyricist. (No offense intended to the great Robert Zimmerman — a.k.a. Bob Dylan — but if any American songwriter deserves to win a Nobel Prize in literature, it is Irving Berlin.) Tomorrow’s Dr. Bob Prescribes post will conclude with three recommended CDs, discs that I believe best demonstrate the singular range and substance of Irving Berlin’s songs, a recommended biography, and links to couple of excellent online videos.
(I know, I know: Patreon is a subscription site which, heaven forbid, costs $2, or $5, or $10 or more per month — depending upon your largesse — to subscribe to. But I am presently posting on Patreon 4 to 5 times a week, and these subscription $’s are providing me with the time and financial wherewithal to be able to create vlogs and blogs, including Music History Monday. So please consider subscribing!)
I will happily admit that when it comes to Irving Berlin, there are personal issues involved. Berlin the person and his songs were a constant presence in my life growing up, one of the five killer bees that shaped my musical consciousness: Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, the Beatles, and Berlin (and, I will also admit, one killer “G”: Gershwin). The events of Berlin’s early life mirror those of my own family; his family emigrated from what today is Belarus as did both sides of mine; he grew up in the same neighborhood as my grandparents; my paternal grandfather Sidney Greenberg (1891–1973) — three years younger than Berlin — claimed to have known the young Berlin personally and to have seen him perform many times.
From the youngest age (very likely pre-natal, even), Berlin’s songs were drummed into my head. My maternal grandmother (Sidney’s wife, Bessie, 1894–1971), was a New York Institute of Musical Art/Juilliard trained pianist who, having decided that my father (Alvin Greenberg, 1925–2017) was going to be “the next Paderewski”, tortured him with piano lessons and a 4-hour a day practice regimen throughout his childhood. (I used the word “torture” because that’s the word my father used in describing his childhood routine.) He did indeed become a very good piano player, but (wisely) never took it seriously as a career path and when he left the Navy after World War Two, he went into business.
But this doesn’t mean that my father stopped playing the piano. Parties at our house inevitably devolved into sing-a-longs with my father at the piano, and pretty much every night after dinner he’d sit down and play. Sometimes it was music composed by dead Germans and Austrians, but far more often it was songs from the so-called “Great American Songbook”: the popular American songs of Tin Pan Alley and Broadway and movie musicals. The songs of George and Ira Gershwin, Cole Porter, Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II, Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, and Irving Berlin.
To my ears, Berlin’s songs always stood apart from the others. They don’t generally exhibit the slick, jazz-inspired veneer of Gershwin’s and Rodgers (and Hart’s) songs; or the sophisticated, urban shtick of Porter’s and Kern’s songs; or the compositional virtuosity of any of the above.
(Regarding compositionally virtuosity: Berlin never learned to read or write music. He hired a succession of “musical secretaries” to notate his songs, which he sang to them while accompanying himself on the piano. And regarding Berlin’s piano playing: he was self-taught and able to play in only one key: F-sharp. Early on he acquired a so-called transposing piano that by pulling a lever sounded in different keys despite the fact that he was still playing in F-sharp. Berlin demonstrates his piano to Dinah Shore and Tony Martin in the linked video:)
What sets Berlin’s songs apart is their incredible directness and naturalness: like the songs of Stephen Foster, like folk songs, like religious hymns, Berlin’s songs seem always to have existed, so perfectly matched are their words and music, so unaffected and clear are their expressive content. No small part of this is due to the fact that Berlin, unlike any of the other great Tin Pan Alley songwriters, came to writing songs as a singer and not as a piano player. As a singer, he always preferred to use the most direct, most “singable” melodies he could create, and words he could find. As a songwriter, he never valued literary “flash” at the expense of clarity, and as such, his songs have a colloquial, “every person” sensibility, giving them an almost universal appeal. This is why, for example, Berlin’s song Blue Skies, which was written in 1926 for a Broadway musical called Betsy, could be recorded by Willie Nelson more than fifty years later to become the #1 country music hit of 1978.
Berlin’s great contemporaries were of a single mind when it came to him and his songs. George Gershwin (1898–1937) called Berlin “the greatest American song composer, America’s Franz Schubert.” Cole Porter (1891–1964) took things a step further, calling Berlin “the greatest songwriter of all time.” Jerome Kern (1885–1945) was once asked to “place” Berlin within the larger panorama of American music. His response: “Irving Berlin has no ‘place’ in American music — Irving Berlin IS American music.”
The America composer, educator, and author Douglas Stuart Moore (1893–1969) acknowledged Berlin as something much more than just a “songwriter”, setting him beside Stephen Foster, Walt Whitman, and Carl Sandburg as “a great American minstrel [someone who has] caught and immortalized in his songs what we say, what we think about, and what we believe.”
He was born Israel Isidore Beilin on May 11, 1888, the youngest of eight children born to Lena Lipkin (1850–1922) and Moses Beilin (1848–1901). The family came from a shtetl named Tolochin in today’s Belorus, although documents say that Berlin was born in Tyumen, Siberia, some 1600 miles east of Moscow. His father was an itinerant cantor, which probably explains the family’s temporary presence in Siberia.
At the time of Berlin’s birth, the Russian Empire was a particularly unfriendly place for Jews. The assassination of Tsar Alexander II in St. Petersburg on March 13, 1881 triggered a devastating series of restrictive laws and pogroms against Russia’s Jewish population, despite the fact that that population had virtually nothing to do with the Tsar’s assassination. (What else is new? When in doubt, despots blame/scapegoat those least able to defend themselves.)
Due to these pogroms, my great-grandparents left their shtetl outside of Pinsk in today’s Belarus circa 1886 and made their way to New York City. Some seven years later, Moses Beilin likewise found it necessary to uproot his family. Irving Berlin told to his first biographer Alexander Woollcott that his earliest memory, according to Woollcott, “was of lying with the rest of the family beside a road, wrapped in a blanket, watching as his home and village were burned in a pogrom.”
The family trudged across Europe, boarded the S.S. Rhynland in Antwerp, and sailed for the presumably gold-paved streets of America. After a journey of 11 days, the Rhynland sailed into New York Harbor and past the Statue of Liberty, inscribed on the base of which are Emma Lazarus’ still magnificent, still gut-wrenching, awe-inspiring, and weep-inducing words:
Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me.
After passing through the newly opened immigration facility on Ellis Island (where the family name was respelled as “Baline”), the family took the ferry to Manhattan. Berlin remembered:
“We spoke only Yiddish and were conspicuous in our ‘Jew clothes’”.
The family settled in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, which the Nobel Prize winning author Rudyard Kipling described as being “worse than the slums of Bombay.”
After a brief stay in a cellar on Monroe Street, the Baline family occupied a three-room tenement at 330 Cherry Street, which is where young “Izzy” grew up.
Berlin’s father Moses couldn’t find work as a cantor, so he took a job at a Kosher meat market and gave Hebrew lessons on the side. His mother worked as a midwife; his brother in a sweatshop, and his sisters rolled cigars. Berlin himself hawked newspapers in the Bowery, all the while singing songs he heard coming out of the saloons and restaurants that lined the busy streets. He had a clear, clean singing voice and he liked to make up new words as he sang, and soon enough people began tossing coins at him. So began his career as a professional musician!
When Moses Baline died in 1901, the 13-year-old Izzy left school for good and became an itinerant street singer. Over time, he learned that his audiences preferred song lyrics that described simple, every-day sentiments set to direct and memorable melodies.
At the age of 16 (or thereabout), Berlin was hired to be a “singing stooge” for $5.00 a week at Tony Pastor’s Music Hall at Union Square. (Explains Berlin biographer Philip Furia, “when a performer sang a song from the stage, the “stooge”, planted in the back of the audience, would rise and, as if spontaneously carried away by the song’s beauty, lead the audience in chorus after chorus.” It was thanks to such stooges that audience members would not leave a theater without having bought the sheet music for the songs they just sang, thus guaranteeing that the song would “circulate.”)
It was at Tony Pastor’s that the variety show entertainment known as “vaudeville” was born. Berlin worked there as a stooge for a “family act” called “The Three Keatons”. The Keatons all sang; additionally, “Pa” told jokes, “Ma” played the saxophone, and young “Buster” Keaton did acrobatics, the likes of which would help make him one of the most popular comedians of the silent film era.
In 1906, at the age of 18, Berlin got the job he considered, at the time, to be his dream job: that of a singing waiter at the Pelham Café at #12 Pell Street in Manhattan’s Chinatown. He was paid $7 a week plus tips. When the house piano player, “Professor” Mike “Nick” Nicholson struck up a tune, it was Berlin’s job to sing along. A fellow employee named Jubal Sweet remembered Berlin in action:
“Like it was yesterday. I remember Oiving Berlin. Looked like a meal or two wouldn’t hurt him. Wasn’t strong and didn’t look like he could get away with a nickel or a dime that one of the other guys claimed. Now a singing waiter couldn’t be stooping over every time a coin hit the floor. Spoil the song like — see? No, he’d keep moving around easy, singing all the time, every time a nickel would drop he’d put his toe on it and kick it or nurse it to a certain spot. When he was done he had all the jack in a pile, see? Oiviung got to be pretty good at it. He had a neat flip of the ankle. Like you’d brush a speck offa table with your fingers.”
In 1907, Berlin wrote his first song in collaboration with the Pelham Café’s house pianist Nick Nicholson. Titled Marie from Sunny Italy, it is a stereotypical genre song, typical of its time. Nowhere in Berlin’s lyric are the vernacular phrases that will later give his songs such a powerful sense of the contemporary. Instead, the lyric leans like a drunken sailor on a lamppost on the tritest clichés: “the little birds” are “sweetly humming”, “the Summer moon is beaming” and “the little stars are gleaming.”
Nevertheless, the song found a publisher and was released on May 8, 1907, three days before Berlin’s 19th birthday. The song was a commercial loser and sold but a few copies; Berlin earned all of 37 cents in royalties. (However, we would observe that the song’s commercial failure make it a collector’s dream, the Holy Grail of sheet music collecting, a copy of which in decent condition will probably sell in the upper-five figures.) Flop that it was, Marie from Sunny Italy did indeed serve two excellent purposes. First, as an examination of the cover reveals, it names its lyricist not as “I. (as in Irving) Baline” but rather, as “I. Berlin.” For decades it was rumored that this was a printing error that once made, Berlin decided to stick with. But in fact, Berlin told his first biographer Alexander Woollcott that his friends in the Bowery had already Anglicized his name to “Berlin” in everyday conversation. The other most excellent purpose served by Marie from Sunny Italy is that having seen his name in print Berlin was hooked on songwriting.
We pick up the story in tomorrow’s Dr. Bob Prescribes post, on Patreon. Until then, we wish you, our dear Oiving, the happiest of birthdays!

After 19 months of closure, Berghain’s doors have opened once more. You don’t need to be a techno Viking to know of its existence. In fact, since 2016 the building — an imposing former power plant — has been classified as a cultural institution. As a newbie to Berlin, I’ve yet to try breaching the seemingly impenetrable doors of the ‘World Capital of Techno’ but maybe you have? How was it? If not, fear not.
Recently I came across this trainer created by sansho. the studio which helps you get in the mood — replacing the aforementioned fear (No? Just me?) with a feel of the place instead. Inside, it’s known to be a temple of decadence and hedonism where no rules apply and all things arise. But first, outside, you must bide your time to even stand a chance. You must be dressed appropriately, act accordingly, and be someone that’ll add to the club’s overall atmosphere. This is a place where you start clubbing on Friday and carry on until Monday morning, so, when it comes to the screening process, it’s taken seriously. Without further ado, skip the queue and test your nerve by answering 3 questions.
Alas, I wasn’t so lucky. Next time, eh?
Test your nerve — Try Enter Berghain

Fancy taking on a fast, flat World Major Marathon where world records are made? Here’s what you can expect if you’re thinking about running the Berlin Marathon!
The Berlin Marathon is one of the six Abbott World Major Marathons and is the fastest of them all. With only 285ft (87m) of elevation gain it’s not surprising Eliud Kipchoge ran world records here in 2018 and 2021, clocking a massive 2:01:09 at the latter.
So if you’re thinking about taking on a race that’s renowned for producing PBs, here’s what you can expect from running the Berlin Marathon.
Berlin Marathon sends lots of comms, but many were only in German. Yes, yes, I know it’s a race in Germany, but I’d signed up in English, selected my communication preference as ‘English’ so I didn’t understand why I was getting emails in German.
The pre-race programme was terrible — one of those useless digital e-books that was impossible to flip through a single page when using a mobile phone. And as the first half was in German (again, no issues with that) and second half in English, it was almost impossible to easily find the details you were looking for. Even a pdf would’ve been a big improvement on this, but for anyone with digital accessibility needs it would’ve been virtually impossible to find any information.
It was disappointing.
The Berlin Marathon Expo took place at Tempelhof Airport to the south of the city, an easy ride there on the U-bahn (which was free to ride for marathon runners during the whole time the Expo was open and on race day).
I arrived about 08:00 so I could take part in the Generali Berlin Marathon Shakeout Run. It was free to enter and anyone could attend, so if you were with family or friends (and they were happy running about 6k!) everyone could run (althought from 2023, the shakeout run has moved back to its usual spot at the Olympic Stadium, starting at 09:30).
It was very relaxed, I’d highly recommend taking part.
The Expo itself was inside several old airport hangars. It had quite an old-skool, Cold War-era vibe to it, which just added to the atmosphere of running in Berlin.
To enter, I had to show my race card (I’d added mine to my iPhone so it was quick and easy) and photographic ID, then they heat-sealed a wrist band to my wrist. I was told I needed to keep this on until after the race, but very frankly after the Expo, no-one asked for it — my race bib was enough. That said, I wouldn’t tamper with it, just in case… even though I had to cut mine off as there was no way it’d come loose by itself!
Race bib pickup was at the very back of the Expo and once there was quick and easy. If you’d bought a finisher’s t-shirt, you had to pick that up at another counter, where you had to go outside, join a queue, then come back inside the hangar. It again was quick, but not very intuitive.
Adidas had loads of official gear for sale, so if you liked the Berlin Marathon merchandise you could load up before you left.
My family had come with me to Berlin so I’d signed the kids up to do the kids’ races taking place on the Saturday. The first was the Bambini Run for my 5 year-old, which also took place at Tempelhof.
It was pretty congested getting the kids to the start line and they didn’t allow parents through for our age category (parents could accompany the 0–2 year olds and 3–4 year olds, but not the 5–6 year olds onwards). I was a concerned my Little Girl would freak out being by herself — especially as most of the announcements were only in German — but she was fine, the marshals were great at herding the kids around and she finished with a beaming smile on her face!
Her run was only about 500m, but it was enough so she felt like she had taken part.
On the Saturday afternoon, there was a Mini-Marathon for older kids, starting at Potsdamer Platz. There was very little information about it online — and nothing in English — so I’d emailed the organisers and asked how I could sign up my son and they were very quick to get back to me with a link and a code.
Apparently the Mini-Marathon — which covers the last 4.195km of the main Berlin Marathon route — is a big schools event, with around 10,000 schoolchildren from all over Germany participating. We had a bit of a nightmare trying to pickup my son’s race bib as apparently pickup at the Expo had ended on the Thursday and when we got there on Saturday, no-one at SCC (the event organiser) knew what was happening. We eventually found the bib pickup area but it was closed down.
So we headed to the start line in Potsdamer Platz and asked SCC there, and got Little Man’s bib in about 60 seconds — very easy! Although by this point they only had large finisher’s t-shirts left, so he’s got a good few years to grow into it!
He absolutely loved the race, it was by far the largest he’d participated in and he even got to run through the Brandenburg Gate before I did!
Collecting him afterwards was hugely stressful, however. There was no clear signage on where to go — all the parents headed into the Berlin Marathon finisher’s area but the actual end of the Mini-Marathon was further down the road. There were also two exits, so we were freaking out a bit as we didn’t anticipate that so had no idea where Little Man would emerge. I took one exit and my wife took the other, and thankfully I found him pretty quickly.
So from his perspective, the Mini-Marathon was awesome… I’m so happy he enjoyed it but as a parent it was a massive stress from start to finish.
On Marathon Day itself, getting to the start line of the Berlin Marathon was one of the easiest experiences I’ve ever had.
No need to get up in the middle of the night to catch a ferry to Staten Island like you do when running the New York Marathon, or jumping on a bus from pretty much the finish line to the start if you run the Athens Authentic Marathon or Boston Marathon.
Berlin Marathon starts in Tiergarten near the Reichstag and travel by U-bahn and S-bahn is free, with the trains run every few minutes.
There’s not much there at the start village of the Berlin Marathon.
I only recall massive queues for toilets (until the men discovered they had outdoor urinals). There were also many bag drop areas, which you could walk up to and drop-off without queuing.
Before entering my corral, I found a small piece of ground to run some warm-up loops, then saw a team mate from my running club so we headed into the corrals together.
There are no toilets in the corrals, but there are more toilets and urinals just before you enter. And if you’re tempted to go in the bushes you’ll be out of luck — literally everywhere was fenced off, so it was either go in the toilets/ urinals or not at all.
Berlin Marathon is a loop, starting and finishing in Tiergarten in the city centre.
You start in the park just beyond the Reichstag parliament building and head west past Victory Monument before turning right and looping round Tiergarten and into Mitte.
There are a couple of small bridges over the Spree but you’ll barely feel them. The first ‘uphill’ segment is around Mile 4, with an elevation gain of +25ft (7.6m). There’s another +22ft (6.7m) segment in Mile 6, then the course is virtually flat until Mile 19 when there’s a -26ft (7.9m) segment and another downhill -24ft (7.3m) segment in Mile 21.
So bottom line is, you’re not really going to feel any of the elevation gain, but there are a couple of nice (but short!) downhill sections later in the race.
The Berlin Marathon begins to draw to a close running through Potsdamer Platz, where the crowds become thronging again. Support is great along the entire marathon course, and even though for 90% of the race it’s thin, the crowd gives off a welcoming vibe.
Lots of families were out supporting, with dozens of kids looking for high-fives, which was really motivating. Berlin Marathon also prints your name on your bib, and even though my name is difficult for non-English speakers to pronounce I had more personal shout-outs running the Berlin Marathon than any other race. You really feel a close connection with the crowd.
The final stretch of the Berlin Marathon has you running through the famous Brandenburg Gate and past the Reichstag to the finish line. But as the Brandenburg Gate is still a good 400m from the finish line, it’s prudent to hold off that sprint finish until you get a little closer!
Water and aid stations are plentiful along the course, the first set are at the 5k mark and then every 2.5k afterwards. Just watch out for the brown liquid — it’s cold, sweet tea, so not to everyone’s liking!
Eliud Kipchoge may have ran a new world record that day, but I knew I wasn’t going to PB at the Berlin Marathon.
I’d had a terrible training block over the summer with two consecutive injuries that put me out for five weeks, then two weeks before the Berlin Marathon I caught COVID-19.
I also had to think about running the Chicago Marathon two weeks later, so for me the Berlin Marathon was going to be an exercise in discipline.
I decided to try to run negative splits for the first time at this distance, running the first 20 miles between 7:20 and 7:40 min/ mile, then seeing what I could give for the last 10k.
I managed to clock my first 5 miles at an average pace of 7:35 mins/ mile, then upped it to 7:20 mins/ mile up to Mile 20. I felt surprisingly good at this point, so cracked on to average 6:50 mins/ mile for the last 10k, with a sprint finish peaking at 4:59 mins/ mile at the end.
Without any hills or other notable terrain to contend with — unlike the monster hill in the middle of the Athens Authentic Marathon or the ups and downs of the New York Marathon over the many bridges — Berlin Marathon lets you focus on what pace you’d like to run to achieve your goal.
I can see why it’s so fast!
The Chicago Marathon may be flatter, but Chicago suffers from poor GPS coverage through The Loop, which makes it hard to know exactly how fast you’re going at the start and the halfway point, plus all those 90-degree bends mean you slow down at every corner.
Berlin Marathon, on the other hand, just flows, and bar one sharp turn just before Mile 3 when the two lanes of runners merge, the rest was easy going.
Post-race was excellent!
There was a massive positive vibe as Kipchoge had just ran a new world record, then the sun started to peep out. It had been a comfortable 12C (54F) for the race, so the timing (for me at least) was perfect.
You get your medal pretty much right after you finish, then water and a few other bits and pieces. It’s about a 1km walk to the end of the finish area, where it’s extremely important NOT to miss the Erdinger tents giving out their Alkoholfrei beer!
I headed to the grassed area in front of the Reichstag and sat on my poncho, drinking in the sun and my ice cold beer. I could’ve stayed there much longer, but besides the Erdinger tents there wasn’t much else going on. So after half an hour to chill, I headed back to the U-bahn station and my hotel for a well-earned bath.
I really, really enjoyed running the Berlin Marathon.
Even though the organisation wasn’t always been plain sailing up until race day, the Berlin Marathon itself was superb.
The atmosphere was relaxed, the support had a real warmth to it and the course lets you concentrate on your race.
One thing I will say about the Berlin Marathon is that it’s hard to notice anything specific about many of the areas you run through as they all kinda blend into one. Sure, the downtown area around Potsdamer Platz had a unique vibe to it, but bar the final mile through the Brandenburg Gate I had no idea where in the city I was at any given time. For sure that’s mostly on me for not being very familiar with Berlin, but I didn’t have the same issues when running the New York Marathon or running the Chicago Marathon, where it’s very clear when you move from one borough or neighbourhood to another.
This isn’t really a criticism, just an observation, and it certainly hasn’t put me off wanting to run the Berlin Marathon again.
As one of the six Abbott World Major Marathons, Berlin Marathon always sells out every year. So if you’re thinking about entering, you’ll need to be fast!
Odds through the lottery are decent — I got in on my first attempt — and it opens right after the race finishes, so one year ahead. Time qualifiers need to meet a pretty tough standard — a sub-2:45 for men aged 44 and under and a sub-3:00 for women in the same age bracket.
But if you’re looking for a marathon PB on a fast, flat course with amazing support, give running the Berlin Marathon a go!

Berlin is the proposed upgrade on the Ethereum 1.0 chain, subsequent to Muir Glacier. As per its specification, it is expected to be activated on the Ropsten testnet on Mar 10, 2021 at block# 9_812_189, and mainnet on April 14, 2021 at block# 12_244_000. Refer to the Ethereum Berlin upgrade announcement for details. The exact date is subject to change due to variable block times and timezones.
A lot of progress has been made in the 15 months since the last network upgrade. Ethereum clients are ready with four new proposals to improve the performance of the network and also prepare it for future upgrades.
A little different from earlier Ethereum network upgrades, this upgrade is no longer tracked in a Meta EIP. Berlin Network Upgrade Specification and progress about upcoming upgrades can be followed on eth1.0-specs repo.
The Berlin upgrade introduces the following EIPs to the Ethereum network:
The ModExp Gas Cost proposal is repricing a previous EIP, EIP-198: Big integer modular exponentiation which originally introduced a precompile for modular exponentiation. EIP-198 is a function in particular for modular exponentiation which introduces a wide variety of cryptographic algorithms to allow RSA signature verification. EIP-2565 is lowering the gas costs of the proposal to bring them in line with the cost of executing other operations. Watch the wonderful overview of the proposal with some interesting charts for gas pricing on PEEPanEIP-2565 with Kelly Olson.
This proposal introduces a new transaction type that is an envelope to enable easier support for multiple transaction types.
When Ethereum first reached the mainnet there was only one transaction type with fields ‘To’ (where the transaction is going) & ‘Data’ (to include any data you want to include on the transaction). Ethereum clients act in lockstep and they have to make sure they make the exact same changes at the exact same time. So, if the ‘To’ field is 0 then all the clients do need to interpret ‘Data’ field as a contract deployment and execute in a certain way.
Over a period of time, the need for transaction type evolved. It was first observed in EIP-155 — Simple replay attack protection. But, instead of introducing a new transaction type back then, it was mutually agreed upon by the clients to interpret the field differently. The hard fork Spurious Dragon, in which EIP-155 was included, was a consensus change hard fork because all the clients needed to agree on an interpretation of the field. EIP-2718 will not help get rid of complexities with EIP-155, but will prevent introducing any more complexity in the future, and makes it easier to introduce new transaction types, such as EIP-1559 style transactions. Understand the proposal in-depth on PEEPanEIP-2718 with Micah Zoltu.
This proposal increases the gas cost for SLOAD, *CALL, BALANCE, EXT* and SELFDESTRUCT when used for the first time in a transaction. For example, it significantly increases the gas cost of functions of the CALL family from 700 to 2600 and the SLOAD family 800 to 2100. However, it charges a high amount only once for each address or storage slot. This means apart from the first call, any number of following calls in the transaction will cost only 100 gas.
The rationale for raising these gas costs is mitigating the largest remaining DoS attack vector in Ethereum. It is also a stepping stone towards bounding witness sizes in the context of stateless Ethereum. Currently, witness sizes needed for the Merkle proof are just far bigger than they would be reasonably needed to verify a particular block and Ethereum is looking for some kind of guarantee for maximum size. Though EIP-2929 does not solve all the problems but does move towards that. One other side benefit is that calls to precompile will become much cheaper. It removes the cost of an extra premium of 700 gas in accessing the precompile.
The main idea behind this proposal is to fix the breaking changes to existing contracts and mitigate some of the gas cost increases that will occur due to the introduction of EIP-2929. The proposal will add a transaction type that contains an access list (a list of addresses and storage keys) that the transaction plans to access. By specifying an access list, transactions are easier for clients to process and the gas costs can therefore be safely lowered.
Follow PEEPanEIP-2929 & EIP-2930 with Vitalik B. & Martin S. for detailed explanation and benefits for the Ethereum chain.
For those curious cats of the community who are wondering about the interval between the upgrades, we’ve got a lot to unpack.
Muir Glacier was a single proposal upgrade which was the requirement of the network at the time to push the Ice Age feature on the chain. Because we couldn’t have waited to deploy the upgrade with any other proposal, it was deployed on the main network in Jan 2020.
To design a better network upgrade process, volunteers from the Ethereum community including EIP editors, EIP authors, client developers, ECH & other community members came together and formed the EIP Improvement Process (EIPIP) group. The Ethereum Cat Herders also conducted an Ethereum critical installation survey to understand the state of client diversity in Ethereum.
In the meantime, client developers continued working on different proposals to improve performance, security, and carving path for future upgrades. Making the best out of the development time that was there in absence of frequent upgrades, you can expect more new features to be added in the subsequent upgrade “London”, which may not be very far off.
Having said that, there is always room for improvement. Your feedback is important to us for continuous improvement in the upgrade process.

(Edit: If you are using Besu on public Ethereum networks, you must upgrade to 21.1.2. This release contains the activation blocks for Berlin across all supported testnets and the Ethereum mainnet.)
Thanks to all the developers, client teams, EIP authors, EIP editors, and community members joining us on the journey of this Ethereum network upgrade. See you on the other side of the upgrade!!

One of my favorite hobbies is collecting inspirations of art and design I come across while browsing the internet. Thanks to those new “save” features in apps like Pinterest or Instagram, I’m able to build little digital art museums for myself. I have thousands of “saved” pictures, from vintage photography to exotic art collage. One day I caught myself amused by the simple, elegant, extremely creative logo of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.
Whatever your career is, imagine yourself designing an orchestra logotype. First, you’d take a look at previous creations: mostly elegant curve-shaped designs with ornamental details or typographies. In color patterns, you’d see a majority of red, black and white, sometimes blue or green.
Second, you’d might brainstorm general aspects of orchestras. I’ll help: Tradition. Old Style. Chic. Elegant. Perfection. Beauty. Cult. Deep emotions. Beethoven. The frequency of sound wave. Instruments. Symphonies. The treble clef. The air-drawn lines of a baton.
The ordinary “elegant curve-shaped designs” illustrates these round elements of an orchestra. Music is not “straight”. Emotions are not “straight”. What about the color pattern? They are clearly trying to call attention, communicate passion (red tones) in a classic and elegant way (black, white tones) with notes of respectfulness or loyalty (blue, green tones).
The access to a huge source of inspiration enables the creation of my little digital museums, but it also harms uniqueness. You can create something beautiful and well constructed, but it’s easy to fall into ordinary. You can find many “how-to-do-a-beautiful-orchestra-logo-in-10-steps”, but the real challenge is to be creative and unique and still carry the message you are trying to transmit.
Well, here is why the Berlin Philharmonic logotype owned it:
This overlapped series of pentagon forms (straight lines), instead of illustrating common aspects of an orchestra, communicates the masterful architectural work of Hans Scharoun (1832–1972) for the orchestra’s concert hall, previously all fan or shoebox shaped.
The chosen yellow, a color that’s uncommon for this market, grabs attention, transmits creativity, motivation, optimism, and warmth. That conveys the Berlin Philharmonic is a modern, vivid, joyful orchestra but also warm — musically and emotionally deep.
There is also an easter egg: The overlapped pentagons clearly but not perfectly represent the floor plan of the concert hall. These overlapped pentagons suggest, besides all, a circular movement:
Yes. Circular. Do I have to say more? The logotype merges, in an exquisite way, an architectural uniqueness that characterizes the Berlin Philharmonic, without forgetting the musicality, elegancy, and round elements that surrounds an orchestra. All of those represented, with not a single curve.
“Good design is obvious. Great design is transparent.”
— Joe Sparano

“The strength of career success lies in the power of networking.” - Omotola E.O.
I shared in my previous post about my speaking engagement in Berlin at FOSS Backstage, where I spoke on Contributors’ Engagement and Monetization Opportunities.
In this series, I’ll share some of the new connections I made on this trip, particularly at the FOSS Backstage event.
This is my first international trip outside of Africa. I got the feeling you get when you go to a different country and meet people from different cultures. The good thing is I was already looking forward to connecting, learning new cultures, and having a good time.
I did! I met some cool folks from different organizations and career paths. One thing that brought us together is our love for open source.
Among many other connections I made at this conference, meeting with Outreachy mentors was one of my highlights.
I met with Antonin Delpeuch, an Open Refine community mentor, and Jarek Potiuk, an OpenStack community mentor.
We discussed their experience as an Outreachy mentor, how the program has benefited their projects, and them as a mentor. It’s good to hear them talk about what excites them about Outreachy applicants and interns and how the program has enhanced their projects.
After the conference, I had a good dinner with Antonin Delpeuch, and we talked more about the future of open source and outreach programs. We also shared individual goals, our steps, and what we see in open source.
It was such a great privilege to not only meet with other open source advocates who are interested in what the Outreachy program does but to learn more about how open source experts and the community can get involved, the benefit of the program to mentors, and the steps and requirements to participate in the program.
I was able to preach the gospel of Outreachy to these fantastic folks and build and strengthen their knowledge about the program and relationship. Looking forward to further connecting with them and having them support diversity in tech through the Outreachy program.
Until the next and final series, I will share my experience exploring the great Berlin. Mach’s gut (Welle)!

You might expect a 91-year-old to have plenty of leisure hours. Not Francis Kilduff. The WWII veteran is so busy putting the final touches on his latest docudrama and hobnobbing at the USO headquarters, he barely made it to the theater. Though he managed to carve some time out of his weekend to enjoy a pre-performance meal at the Geffen Playhouse, he’s hurriedly slicing into his beef and hoping he doesn’t miss curtain.
It’s the Sunday night before Veteran’s Day, and Geffen has invited military vets not only to take in the final dress rehearsal of Hershey Felder as Irving Berlin, but also to enjoy a catered dinner buffet. Partnering with the Gary Sinise Foundation (Sinise and Randall Arney, Geffen’s Artistic Director, are pals from their days working together at Chicago’s Steppenwolf Theatre), the Geffen celebrates veterans by hosting these special veterans nights for every Gil Cates Theater subscription production. As a proud partner of Blue Star Theatres, the Geffen Playhouse also offers veterans free tickets to season productions year-round.
But tonight is extra special. For most of these vets, Irving Berlin composed the soundtracks to their lives.
Seated at the table with Kilduff is Alan Bertik, an affable vet who was on a Navy destroyer in the Korean War (“It was 30 below,” he says, chuckling). He and his wife used to usher at the Geffen. They saw Felder perform one New Year’s Eve, but he’s especially excited about this show for the simple reason that he knows most of the music. Of course, everyone knows the biggies: “White Christmas,” “There’s No Business Like Show Business,” “Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning.” Still, Berlin’s catalog is so expansive — he wrote at least 1,500 songs — there are many that history has forgotten. Yet the men and women who fell in love, broke up and fell in love again remember them fondly.
“Of course I’m excited!” Kilduff chimes in. “That’s my era.”
Hershey Felder has crafted one-man shows based on Gershwin, Chopin, Beethoven and Bernstein, creating experiences that are half concerto, half stage play. In fact, they’re so unique he’s become quite famous not only in Southern California, with many premieres at the Geffen, plus performances at Pasadena Playhouse, Laguna Playhouse, San Diego Rep and the Old Globe, but also across the nation and world. (You can read more about his work in a recent American Theatre magazine article that is also re-published as the program note for the show.)
For Hershey Felder as Irving Berlin, Felder recounts Berlin’s life story by weaving memories into songs. During the peformance, Felder plays one of Berlin’s most famous songs, “God Bless America,” and invites the audience to sing along. As voices surged with pride during the dress rehearsal, there were more than a few eyes filled with tears. The one constant in Berlin’s life — from being an immigrant baby to a “singing waiter” to Fred Astaire’s best bud to a lonely recluse — was that he found comfort in music. Berlin may be America’s most famous composer, but to that end, he’s not so different than the rest of us.

This year, I was able to finally cross off a major dream of mine: visiting Europe for the first time! It was a dream come true to visit Germany and Italy, but Berlin in particular caught my attention in unexpected ways. I had the chance to stay with a close friend in Wilmersdorf, a neighborhood that offered me a fresh outlook on living in Berlin away from the tourist attractions. I spent 12 days learning about the city’s interesting history, lively markets, thriving food culture, and quirky retail spots from my travel companion and the kind Berliners I met along the way.
I was so affected by this experience that I was motivated to write this guide. In order for anyone considering a trip to Berlin to experience the history, culture, and distinct charm of this incredible city as I did.
Since the tours, I’ve realized that the reason Germans sometimes come out as aloof or uncaring might be directly related to their past. Deep wounds from World War II’s loss and the terror of Nazi Germany persist to this day. Through memorials, museums, and the Stolpersteine — brass “stumbling stones” commemorating Holocaust victims — Germany confronts its past head-on, admitting its collective guilt. It’s simple to see how this emotional burden, which hasn’t been resolved, might be inherited and cause a reserved, occasionally disconnected mannerism.
Berlin is well-known for its lively flea markets, each of which offers a distinctive blend of local culture, art, antiques, and vintage finds. These are a few of the more well-known ones:
Kreuzberg’s Markthalle Neun transforms into a street food paradise on Thursday nights that you won’t want to miss. I had the opportunity to try a variety of international cuisines while exploring the ancient hall, including fresh oysters, Venezuelan arepas, and Korean dumplings. It was more than just cuisine because of the vibrant ambiance, which was full of wonderful scents and welcoming sellers. It’s a must-see if you’re in Berlin on a Thursday!
I got the opportunity to go to Hosek Contemporary, a unique art and music venue situated on a Spree River boat. It was a bizarre experience to listen to experimental music there; the live sound, artwork, and soft boat swaying created a unique experience. This location is a must-see in Berlin’s art scene if you’re looking for something immersive and different.
For those interested in avant-garde music culture, other venues such as Sophiensaele, Quiet Cue, Radialsystem V, and Berghain are also worth seeing.

A hundred years ago, Berlin was among the biggest cities in the world as its population rapidly grew from 2 to 4,5 million. Just imagine the demand for new housing at that time! Eventually, the city became a testing ground for architectors’ creativity and social experiments.
Passionate about the ideas of affordable mass housing, modernists were trying to make utopia come true — create cheap, standard, and, if possible, lovely houses. Not to mention, it was also a time of the Nazi’s rise to power. Nowadays, pretty small apartments and compact blocks are concealed by colored plaster, original door patterns, and manicured lawns. I’m sure that living in these houses may feel totally different from the careless meditation of a passerby. We are privileged to observe modernist estates from a distance of decades and draw our own conclusions.
This piece should have started with a bird’s-eye view of the horseshoe-shaped building, but let’s leave it to the birds. City explorers like you and me, not aided by drones or helicopters, see this site differently. When I came, the frost was gleaming on the grass in shadows, and the sun shone gently through a gap between “horseshoe” edges.
The Horseshoe Colony is a complex of townhouses and 3-story blocks of flats, and the central one — as you might have guessed — is curved like a horseshoe. A humble memorial stone at the pond tells this estate was designed by Bruno Taut and built between 1925 and 1933.
I was lucky enough to visit the Horseshoe Colony twice, at dawn and dusk, although it took me an hour to reach Britz, a part of the Neukölln district. As I left the metro, sunlit rosy-and-tartare houses with fiery doors popped up. At first, I was walking past them pretty fast, not realizing they were also part of the architectural ensemble — not just the shaped block.
I didn’t expect such a burst of color either because the whole modernist architecture (and Bauhaus in particular) had always seemed minimalistic and monochrome to me before.
Although this estate appeared as affordable housing for rapidly growing Berlin, it was designed with privacy in mind, thus feeling neither fully urban nor entirely rural. In this densely populated area, you’ll notice a lot of hedged yards with lovely arbors, swings, braziers, beds of flowers, and other attributes of carefree leisure.
The Horseshoe Colony doesn’t look luxurious; however, it gives space for individuality and embodies a passion for detail. I spotted a dozen door variations. My favorite ones are the black-framed ones with colorful rectangles in the middle. You can hardly find the same building color and door pattern combination twice.
But let’s turn back to the horseshoe building for a while. What amazed me the most about it was the optical effect of using sky-blue paint. Loggias look like holes in the building, and you can pretend to see the sky through them. As a result, this pretty massive building doesn’t feel overwhelming.
I noticed something about color that would also be relevant to other housing estates in this article. So, color is probably, the cheapest way to convey style, whereas columns or sculptures require a lot of work and material. It’s remarkable how modernists used the power of color, creating affordable yet original housing.
And the icing on the cake — a crimson wall, which turned out to be just the opposite side of those tartare houses I mentioned at the beginning. The setting sun cast its light on the wall, and the windows and balcony frames got lilac. After all this, I did realize why this settlement gained its status as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
I left the Horseshoe Colony after sunset. Black silhouettes emerged from the gloom but didn’t obstruct the sky view. If you stand on the stairs between the horseshoe edges, you’ll see magnificent scenery — the sun sets behind the building, people switch on the lamps, and this light reflects on the surface of the inner pond.
You can easily spot the White City from afar. Its white minimalist geometry stands out among yellowish houses nearby, and the five-story corner towers, like guardians, stand on both sides of the street, Aroser Allee. This housing estate in the district of Reinickendorf was built in 1928–1931 and turned out to be the last modernist quarter of the Weimar era.
The key role in the White City design belongs to Otto Rudolf Salvisberg. The central structure of this ensemble is like a sea resort hotel hovering above the street. I hate when parked cars spoil the picture, so I squatted in the middle of the boulevard and shot through a hole in the hedge, thus “hiding” the vehicles behind the bushes.
And how can an authentic German building be without a clock on its top?
Look! Another clock on the opposite side of the same building. I adore how classical modernist architects could create a style with the simplest geometric shapes: squares, circles, and rectangles. Although all the buildings generally look uniform, they have numerous unique parts — like these clocks.
Now, the doors. Doors are where modernist architects burst into various color combinations and rectangle compositions. Bright red and blue doors look incredibly vivid on the white facades.
Not to mention gorgeous blue windows along the staircase, an eye-catching stripe of volume on a flat facade.
A couple of paragraphs above, I mentioned so-called “towers,” higher parts of the corner buildings. So, I found five of them: two large towers on both sides of Aroser Allee and three narrow ones at the corner of Emmentaler Straße and Genfer Straße. They create a distinctive border with other buildings and hold the borders of this settlement.
I had visited the White City before chestnuts and poplars started blooming and one more time after trees went green. In spring, there is a short period when the sun is bright enough to make the walls sparkle, but the trees, still leafless, don’t obstruct the view. I was happy to enjoy this contrast between glaring facades and black trunks.
My final unexpected observation was red and blue bands underneath the roofs. On the one side of the street — blue; on the other side — red. Pre-war architects used to leave numerous unobvious details, aesthetic gifts for an attentive urban wanderer. By the way, White City also is UNESCO-protected and part of the Berlin modernism heritage.
Call me old-fashioned, but the number of floors in a residential building should be a one-digit number. For example, five. It seems compact enough and doesn’t turn a house into an ugly “anthill” similar to Soviet-time quarters in East Berlin. I decided to check the Carl Legien Settlement late in the evening, just before sunset.
This housing estate is located a 5-minute walk from the station Prenzlauer Berg in a district of the same name. Like many buildings displayed in this article, it appeared between 1928 and 1930 and was designed by Bruno Taut and Franz Hillinger.
Carl Legien estate is more uniform than, for instance, Horseshoe Colony, but belongs to UNESCO World Heritage, too. Its buildings don’t have varying characteristics like doors or facade colors. What fascinated me the most was the pinkish tint of the walls and, of course, red, yellow, and blue frames. Gazing at them, I immediately recalled paintings by Piet Mondrian.
And again, we observe the same simplicity and minimal expressive means — no columns, no sculptures, no molding. Rounded balconies and loggias are all facing the inner yard, and I guess it must create a feeling of privacy and own space for the dwellers.
Not many buildings in Berlin have bare brick facades. Brick is typical for factories and warehouses, but most residential estates are plastered and painted in pastel colors. However, the UNESCO World Heritage complex at Shiller Park stands out; the exposed concrete grid of balconies and ochre walls immediately drew my attention. It was designed by our good old friend Bruno Taut and constructed in 1924–1930.
I noticed a bright green car on the street between the historic houses and decided to look closer. Like the settlement itself, the car turned out to be also vintage. Citroën 2CV was a popular economy vehicle in the 1950s, and it fitted in here so well. The phrase on the car, “I fly bleifrei,” is a pun. In German, “bleifrei” means “lead-free” or “unleaded” (without added tetraethyl lead), which is a characteristic of petrol or paint. This motto and a cute duck mascot made me smile.
I noticed the streets where this estate stood were named after English cities — Bristolstraße, Dubliner Straße, Oxforer Straße, and Windsorer Straße. Later I understood why — in Google Maps, this area was called the English Quarter. Except for the car and street names, there were some other beautiful details, like a white doily in one of the windows.
The way how I instantly spot historically significant buildings in Berlin is by well-preserved wooden doors and windows. Look at these bold red frames. If the door is original, not a later replacement, the paint must have been scratched off and carefully repainted a dozen times. Paint sagging and overshooting on the glass look so heartwarming and naive when you can visualize the story behind it.
At the end of that walk, I was thinking about the balconies, which were half-glazed and half-opened. Large windows with white “skeletons” created the impression of porches. Maybe this is why so many local dwellers have beds of flowers, sun umbrellas, and chairs on their balconies. It’s a blessing when your home has a special place to meditate, sipping coffee to the sounds of birds’ songs.
It’s getting more challenging to impress you with Berlin modernism, but I’ll try. The ace up my sleeve is this lovely settlement on the southeastern outskirts of Berlin. It was built a bit earlier than most estates introduced here, in 1913–1916, and the design belongs to — surprise! — Bruno Taut.
While walking and taking pictures, I felt uncomfortable — like an obnoxious intruder or a guy chewing popcorn and slurping beer at the museum. Fortunately, there is little chance you disturb someone at 6 a.m. on Saturday because people (except for me though) prefer to bask in bed a bit longer. But my weird pleasure is to stay one-on-one with architecture and avoid city dwellers casting suspicious glances at me.
This settlement is probably the richest in styles and colors and feels specially designed for vacationing. Not surprisingly, it’s called “Gartenstadt” (garden city) in German and belongs to UNESCO World Heritage.
All the buildings have two or three floors, bright wooden shutters, and terraces. Even though most houses are arranged in blocks, they don’t feel like dull clones.
On some doors, I saw eye-shaped stickers with a silhouette of a thief and a phrase in German, “Neighbours are watching.” I don’t know about you, folks, but to me, this is a typical village security system when people notice more than any video surveillance from highly urbanized districts.
So far, the “garden city” was primarily painted in warm colors: orange, red, and yellow; however, it has a winter-cold section, too. If I happened to choose my favorite building here, I’d choose this stunning blue villa. The tree, in the shade of which it stands, seems to be at least a century old, planted at the times of settlement construction.
Sorry, I cannot overcome a desire to show you the lovely doors of Falkenberg once again in detail. See how carefully a trellis (this white frame for supporting climbing plants) is covered with a sheet of glass. Residents’ needs might have changed over time, but they didn’t spoil the initial design with a massive overhang. And the red door below, besides being amazingly beautiful, has a sticker I’ve already told you about.
Did you think there was just one blue house in the garden city of Falkenberg? Here is another one. You can compare how differently the same tone looks in the sun and after the sunset. In the light, it is glossy, and in the gloom, it gets matte and soft like a gouache drawing.
It was pretty late when I headed back to the station, yet I couldn’t miss an opportunity to take one more picture. What a combination of a cold-blue sky and pavement and orange-warm lights and a bush.
I’m not overwhelming you with historical facts from Wikipedia, so you should have some energy left to cope with the last chapter. This so-called “Waldsiedlung” (forest settlement) is located in one of the most picturesque districts of Berlin, Zehlendorf. You cannot take a single photo here without capturing at least one pine.
All the previous modernist settlements were located 5–10 minutes from the nearest train stations, but this one surrounds the station with an unusual name, “Uncle Tom’s Hut.” These beautiful 2–3-story blocks of flats and townhouses were finished between 1926 and 1931. Could it happen without Bruno Taut? Of course, no, folks. And Taut was accompanied by fellow architects Hugo Häring and Otto Rudolf Salvisber, whom I mentioned many times in this and previous articles.
Onkel Toms Hütte, unfortunately, hasn’t been (yet?) honored with the status of UNESCO World Heritage and remains the only settlement in this article without this status. However, it doesn’t mean city authorities neglect its preservation. All the buildings look well-maintained and don’t have noticeable stains on their bright facades.
In childhood, my granny dressed me in not-so-new grey and brown stuff because she knew I’d be dirty by the end of the day. A residential building is something people “use” very often, and why the hell do you make it so bright? I admire the courage of architects who cared about the dwellers’ moods, too. It is much more pleasant to live in a place that also pleases your eyes than just a practical and robust apartment!
My poor German skills, though, were sufficient to interpret gorgeous letters on the building below. It must have been a hairdresser’s workplace, but now it looks unoccupied by any business.
The shadows were growing higher and getting longer. Time to return home and view all the photos taken that day…

It’s been 5 months since we moved to Berlin; I’m still astonished we pulled it off as a family. Here are some things we did and learned along the way:
That’s it. I don’t mean to sound cheeky but it’s actually completely doable and only seems daunting in principle. Once you’re executing, you’re operating a checklist, it becomes all about unwavering project management. The biggest deal breaker for us was the school and it worked out rather well.
I’ve got a ton of early impressions and can only spew them out in random order:

Right before Christmas, I had a wonderful chat with the Italian pastry chef Riccardo about baking, gastronomy, and quality over quantity food philosophy.
Navigating past two Turkish kiosks, an abandoned Uzbek restaurant, and a vibrant Argentinian empanada eatery, I finally reached the acclaimed Albatross Bakery on a rainy December afternoon. Culture fusion continued as I could see a fridge full of Italian sausages and cheeses along with organic German eggs from the outskirts of Berlin right beside a display proudly showcasing Panettones and German mulled wine. This imagery of flavours gives a snippet into the multicultural essence of Berlin; through food, you can journey through its history, learn and experience different communities that call this free-spirited city home.
Walking into the snug space of this Kreuzberg gem, the rich aroma of espresso notes hit my nose right away. Good coffee is not the main star here, though very important to accompany the praised Queen B pastry or a phenomenal and totally unexpected crem brulee croissant. Everything I tried was bursting with flavour and I didn’t even get to breads yet.
Pastry sizes are generously big here, and most would be happy about it. My partner had a different opinion, which I contemplated and eventually agreed with. The issue with regular pastry sizes in highly rated and ‘viral’ bakeries is that you want to try bits and pieces of each of them and not get stuffed. Has anyone ever considered mini-bite-sized pastries? The ones you get at the hotel breakfast buffet?!
One of the skilled Italian pastry chefs welcomed me warmly and showed me around as I introduced myself and my obsession with local bakeries. Riccardo proudly said that almost 90% of the produce in the bakery is organic and most come from Germany. Germans are real appreciators of bread and sourcing local ingredients is surely important for the younger generation, especially in a progressive city like Berlin.
Almond Croissant
Almond Croissant is a classic for me. The key is not to oversweeten it and make the almond paste flavour shine. Albatross made it work for my taste. The croissant was soft and not too crunchy on top. Sometimes I feel like bakeries overbake them until the hard biscuit-like texture forms on top, which I am not a fan of. If you feel like almond, marzipan and a soft pleasantly sweet buttery croissant — I’d say you’ve got some of the best in Berlin Almond Croissants here at Albatross Bakery.
Crem Brulee Croissant
I wasn’t the fan of a cronut — a well-known attempt to marry two unrelated in my humble opinion pastries. But it turned out to be surprisingly scrumptious. Not an overly sweet and well-balanced creation. I just love seeing such creative combinations of two fantastic on-its-own desserts It’s an act of courage. I recently saw a combo of cheesecake + baklava and I am still thinking about it. It can go either wrong or oddly good. This was the latter and I would certainly come back for more.
Queen B
This one I saw raving reviews about and had to test it. It was good. Really good. For the crunchy pastry fans especially. Unless you consider it cookie then. The pastry is quite well-baked and not much softness left inside. It was more like a combo of a buttery flaky caramelised cookie and a pastry. It was salty on top with sea salt flakes enhancing the caramel flavour. I loved the combination of flavours and would highly recommend trying it. For my preference, I do enjoy a variety of textures in a pastry and this one had the crunch dominating the entire experience.
Brownie
If you like your brownies fudgy and not spongy, this one is for you. It was like eating a fudge yummy candy. It is accidentally gluten-free as they use a tiny bit of starch instead of flour to attain the gooey texture.
Panettone
I am sure I wasn’t the only one attacked by panettone videos this year. I was curious to understand what is so special about panettone and maybe replace the usual “kučiukai” we eat during Christmas in Lithuania with the proud Italian sweet brioche.
What’s special about panettone?
Panettone is a rich and flavourful sweet brioche usually made from first class flour, egg yolks, lots of butter & raisins. Quality ingredients is the key here, no shortcuts. The one I tested had Sicilian mandarines and extra dark chocolate on top.
Italians also have Pandoro, which is kind of a brother of panettone. It is a bit more plain in flavour, without a filling inside.
For the artisanal panettone, stiff Italian sourdough is usually used, which requires much more skill and time than traditional bread sourdough. The long fermentation process, special skill required and top-quality ingredients are what make a price difference.
The best tip from an Italian pastry chef was to make sure you heat your panettone for a little bit so it becomes more fragrant and soft.
I picked one up and my family ended up with three different panettones this year. It was so soft and fluffy that we ate it easily on its own. I had some recipes in mind on how to use up ‘old’ panettone (french toasting it or whipping up mascarpone as a spread). Safe to say that no ‘old’ panettone was left in our house. And I am already thinking about the flavour I want to try next year, which is a pistachio-filled one.
Albatross Bakery also has a Pistachio Croissant that I didn’t try and a rotating Seasonal Danish that changes every few months depending on the local ingredients.
Have a flaky weekend and a buttery Monday:)

I was in Berlin, Germany, on May 8th; the 80th anniversary of the day that German forces surrendered unconditionally to the Allies, marking the end of WW2 in Europe. This day is sometimes referred to as “VE Day” (Victory in Europe Day). What a fitting place to be for this momentous occasion.
I have been in Berlin twice before. My first visit, in the summer of 1963 when I was 15 years old, was as part of a “teen tour” of Europe. Asleep in a Berlin hotel, I was awakened by gunfire. The construction of the Berlin Wall (at first, a barbed wire fence) began in August 1961 and in the years following, many people were shot as they tried to escape from East into West Berlin.
My second visit was 24 years ago, as part of a small group from the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, visiting historic sites in Eastern Europe that included memorials, museums, and several concentration camps. Sachsenhausen, one such camp near Berlin, is in the village of Oranienburg. It began as a slave labor camp for “political prisoners” with many subcamps. Still visible are barracks and the ruins of buildings in which remain the remnants of a gas chamber, medical experimentation areas, torture and killing areas, and several crematoria. Prisoners were treated inhumanely, inadequately fed, and openly killed. If you are reading this article, you probably know the list of who would be considered enemies of the state. A partial list includes those against the Reich whether they were Christian, Protestant, Jewish, Coptic, Roma, Communists, Gays, and anyone who was perceived to be mentally or physically disabled. This camp, not unlike others, was not on the outskirts of town. It was in the town. An alleyway separates the town from the gates to the camp with the words “Arbeit Macht Frei” (Works Sets You Free) welded into the gate. This place was not hidden. Quite the contrary, it was wide open to view and more importantly to odor. With several crematoria where bodies were burned, the smell and the ash wafted over the town, falling onto people’s rose gardens as well as onto the town residents themselves.
But I digress. Twenty four years ago, when I visited this camp, there was a person with us who, as a young man, had been a prisoner in Sachsenhausen. Somehow, miraculously, he survived. A Christian man, he had been a journalist, soon to be married, but that did not happen. It was a privilege to see the camp through his eyes, and listen as he recounted his experiences, some of which he had thought he buried along with his fellow inmates.
This was a sacred place whose stories were told to keep alive the memory of those who perished and those who survived. For decades after the war ended, “Never Again” was repeated to ensure that this kind of unleashed hatred and vitriol, resulting in these sorts of inhuman actions, would never happen again. And most of us in the world were confident that nothing like this could ever happen again!
This visit was different.
First, I am different. I am 24 years older. What I try to convince myself of is “unbelievable.” I need to believe.
Second, the world is different. Hatred, vitriol, and cruelty have become normalized. The vile antisemitic tropes that were used to degrade and denigrate people are not only ripe, but they are blossoming. Regrettably, in many places, they are in full bloom. This kind of hate flourishes on the dark web, and in the full light of day. Repulsive speech and actions have become acceptable. Throughout the world we see the rise of political parties with slogans reminiscent of a world which we thought could never be resurrected. And not only is it resurrected, but these parties have also gained representation in congresses and parliaments in the same countries where brave citizens sacrificed and fought against this to make the world safe for all.
Third, the camp is not the same. Shockingly, there are some people who visit the camp, stand next to the crematory ruins, on the rim of the entrance of the first experiment for a gas chamber, beside the remains of a barracks, who say: “this did not happen.” When you tell a lie often enough, people tend to believe it. That’s what happened prior to and during World War II. And in many parts of our world, it is happening now.
I am at a time in my life when more people than not ask me “When are you going to retire?” Here’s my response. Not only am I not going to retire, I am also committing to rededicate myself to engaging in education programs and social justice issues concerning basic human rights related to antisemitism and anti-LGBTQ hatred. All in, in my “golden years” I will not stand by and silently witness the normalization of hatred.
I write this article with both a heavy and a hopeful heart. When I say things are unbelievable, I reinforce in my own mind that I shouldn’t believe them. I am awake to the reality and the knowledge that I must believe what I see, hear, and witness. When I believe it, I will be able to address it in ways that, hopefully, will change where we are, and where we can go as a civil society.
We can choose hate, or we can choose to stand up to hate. We can be silent, or we can call people out when they say or do things that are rooted in prejudice and hate. Each of us can use our voice and our platform for good. We can choose to make excuses for bad behavior, or we can call it out. We can acquaint ourselves with history. We can familiarize ourselves with the consequences when hate is permitted to run amok. We can call out when we see lies presented as truth. And we can challenge people who are fearful or intimidated into saying and behaving in ways that are unacceptable.
When we sit by as people are being dehumanized, referred to as the “other,” we are at the entrance to the gates of Hell. I went through those gates as a tourist. I’ve listened to and read testimonies, seen films and photographs of what Hell looks like. If we consider ourselves members of the human race, we need to take that membership seriously and be aware of what it means to be human. To have hope in the future we need to discover compassion within and speak out against antisemitism and all forms of hate. We cannot excuse the inexcusable and we must believe the unbelievable.
In life’s most challenging moments, how we respond influences both our immediate wellbeing and long-term recovery. Crises arrive uninvited, testing our resilience when we feel most vulnerable. The following tips offer guidance through the turbulence, toward steadier ground.
Remain Calm: When crisis emerges, take a gentle body scan — notice your breathing, pulse, and physical sensations. Do not judge, just observe. Then begin to breathe and focus on your breath. The key is to avoid panic. When we panic, we cannot solve problems effectively. The goal is to think clearly while being aware of what is happening in your body. During this process, pause, take more slow, deep breaths. For some people, repeating prayers that offer solace, doing mindful practice, mindfulness, or engaging playfully with a pet can help.
Assess The Situation: From this centered state notice where you are physically, mentally, and emotionally. Then, identify the elements defining the crisis. What risks exist? What consequences might follow different actions? This assessment doesn’t require perfect information — only honest recognition of what is known and unknown in this moment.
Create Safety: Do what you need to get out of harm’s way. Look around, listen attentively, and notice your surroundings with fresh eyes. Take actions that move you toward greater security, extending this same protective attention to others if they’re with you.
Gather Your Support Circle: Reach out to those whose compassion brings calm — trusted friends, family members, professionals, or others who have walked similar paths. Seek those who offer the support you need rather than imposing what they believe you should want. Throughout the situation, maintain connection with beloved others. Consider engaging in creative activities that redirect mental energy — photography, gardening, music, reading, or writing — offering your mind the opportunity to “reset.”
Communicate with Transparency: Share information others need to hear to assist you, especially during medical emergencies when providers need accurate knowledge of your condition to offer effective care with minimal risk. Honest communication about symptoms, relevant medical history, concerns, and needs, creates the foundation for receiving proper assistance.
Create a Crisis Plan: Consider creating a simple emergency kit kept in your vehicle or near an exit. Maintain accessible records of essential medications, identification, and emergency contacts — both digitally and physically. Identify people who might assist with temporary housing, caregiving, pet-care, or other practical needs that could arise.
Honor Your Fundamental Needs: In crisis, the basics become precious: adequate rest, nourishment, hydration, and moments of quiet. Reflect on what essentials you require and consider how to ensure access to these necessities even during disruption. Tending to these fundamental needs becomes an act of self-compassion during challenging times.
Remember that getting through times of crisis times isn’t about handling everything perfectly. It’s about showing up as best we can, being kind to ourselves, and figuring things out as we go. Sometimes the hardest moments teach us what we’re made of and connect us more deeply to what matters. We might surprise ourselves with what we can handle, even when it feels impossible at first.
I’ve co-authored a book about kindness. I believe deeply in the lasting effects of love. It is in that context that I share my own daily habit. Each morning, I say thank you for another day and ask for an opportunity to make a difference in this world.
To that end, I look for signs of connection to those who came before me — a robin reminds me that my father is near, a butterfly reminds me of my mother. I feel their presence and listen for their guidance. Certain songs transport me to moments in my past, conjuring places, people, and, sometimes, lessons learned.
This daily habit provides continuity to my life. I’m grateful that my journey has been a healthy one so far. Though everything is unpredictable, I express gratitude however I can and move through the world appreciating all the companions I’ve known along the way.

How the Most Famous Street Food in Berlin Arrived From England (and the U.S. and India),https://destinationeatdrink.medium.com/how-the-most-famous-street-food-in-berlin-arrived-from-england-and-the-u-s-and-india-a2796571f7c2,"Sign up

Currywurst is available on practically every block in Berlin. But, this seemingly quintessential German food only dates to the Allied occupation of the city.
With a name like Currywurst, you’d think this was a traditional German dish. But, it’s not. Unlike other Wursts, (Bratwurst, Knackwurst, Liverwurst) Currywurst is a recent addition to the cuisine of Germany.
After World War II, Germany lay in ruins. Berlin was divvied up into sections, occupied by the victorious Russian, American, French, and British armies.
Herta Heuwer, a local Berliner, was selling food from a kiosk in West Berlin to the hungry construction workers who were rebuilding the city. She noticed the British soldiers carrying around items like curry powder and Worcestershire sauce. Curry powder’s popularity, of course, came from the British occupation of India.
American soldiers were partial to ketchup (an American invention) as a condiment.
So, Ms. Heuwer began experimenting. She hit upon the idea of mixing ketchup, Curry powder, and Worcestershire sauce which she used to top sausages. She called her sauce Chillip and the product took off!
Today, it seems like there are Currywurst stands on every block in Berlin. An order of Currywurst and fries is cheap, fast, and filling, so you’ll see lines of hungry office workers at Currywurst stands all over Berlin during lunch hour. And, drunken revelers will get their fix after the bars and clubs close. In fact, Currywurst is so popular that a plaque was placed at the corner of Kant and Kaiser Friedrich Streets to commemorate where Herta Heuwer’s food stall was located decades ago.
If you want to try Currywurst for yourself, it’s not hard to find. My favorite place is Curry at the Wall. It’s a few blocks from Checkpoint Charlie and the vegetarian Currywurst is terrific.
Curry 61 is also very good, but their main attraction is the hilarious and kitschy mural featuring Cold War era politicians. Ten kilometers south of the Berlin’s center is Krasselt’s Imbiss, where you’ll get an excellent Currywurst topped with homemade sauce (a secret recipe!). Since the location is away from the tourist areas of Berlin, you’ll be dining with locals. Still, expect lines, especially at lunchtime.

Everyone I know who visited Berlin came back saying the same thing:
“Berlin is a magical city.”
They weren’t lying. It’s hard to capture the essence of this place with just a few words, but there’s something really special happening here. Every block is teeming with energy and creativity. Walls are plastered with interesting graffiti and residential balconies are bursting with floral arrangements. Sidewalks are wide enough to accommodate outdoor seating for cafes and restaurants, pedestrians, and bikes all at once, and the streets are bustling with people at all hours.
The cultural atmosphere feels leisurely and less profit-driven, and people seem to be actively enjoying living and working in their city. There’s a sense of civic harmony here I haven’t experienced anywhere else. Most importantly, beer is suuuper cheap, sometimes cheaper than bottled water. It’s also legal to drink in public which makes it tempting to buy a drink for the road (any road). I was afraid I’d bankrupt myself on booze if I stayed any longer.
My German experience began before my plane touched down. The stewardesses on my flight were dressed like beer maidens and handing out free schnitzel and brews for Oktoberfest. A yodeling contest was held at the front of the plane moments later. I arrived in Berlin around 10pm and took a train to my hostel.
I spent the first half of the week touring the city together with some floor-mates from the U.K. We wandered Berlin’s deceptively large streets and hopping on and off public transportation (which had a pretty high learning curve) to visit public squares, churches, and landmarks. Luckily for me, my hostel-mates had a local friend who showed us some fantastic spots, like a rooftop bar called the Klunker Kranich that sat atop a seven-story parking structure and overlooked the city. The most memorable was a mind-blowing place night club called Sisyphos. Here’s my journal entry if you’ve got some time to kill.
On the days I wandered by myself, I joined random walking tours, ate at an African food collective that helped re-integrate refugees into Germany, and went to a bar where all the furniture was upside-down and attached to the ceiling. I visited the Holocaust Memorial at sundown and walked in silence between the large concrete blocks, thinking about the United States and the path we’re headed towards if we don’t remain proactive and vigilant of our bubbling fascism.
I walked around Templehoff Regional Park, an abandoned airfield with old hangars and dilapidated planes. It was a bit surreal seeing kids riding bikes and flying kites on airstrips where bombers used to take off. I strolled through Tiergarten, Berlin’s central park, on my last day. It was raining on and off, but when the sun finally came through, the trees shimmered like verdant jewels.
On my last night, I met up with five other travelers through the Couchsurfing app and we drank late into the morning, (which made for a very rough trek to the bus station a few hours later).
One week doesn’t feel like enough time to do Berlin justice, but I guess that gives me a reason to come back. I’ve got the rest of the world ahead of me and it felt like the right time to get going. I still feel a bit timid whenever I enter a new hostel or restaurant, especially when I can’t speak the language, but I’m slowing getting more comfortable with the discomfort. Getting by in a multi-cultural city like Berlin wasn’t too difficult, but I know the language barrier will only become more challenging as I travel east. At least I’ve got time to ease myself into it. My phone has been an invaluable companion, allowing me to book tickets and hostels in the same sitting and save maps for offline use. I purchased my first international SIM card today, but all of the instructions are in German. So I’ll have to figure that out at some point.
I’m writing you from a hostel in Dresden now, where I’ll be staying for at least the next few days. I’m waking up early tomorrow to visit one of Germany’s national parks. I’ve been craving some nature after being immersed in such rich urban environments for the past few days.
Thanks for taking the time to read this. I’ll be trying to post weekly, so shoot me a message if there’s something in these you’d like to hear/see more or less of in the future. Any feedback is deeply appreciated.
Until next time!

It’s not simply a restaurant, it’s an experience. You’ll find it in Sweden’s agricultural heartland, about an hour from Copenhagen’s airport. Daniel Berlin Krog, a dining experience worthy of 2 Michelin stars.
To call it a restaurant doesn’t do justice to the careful preparation and exquisite presentation of locally sourced ingredients in the hands of a team who respect the palate’s power to delight, nurture, comfort and celebrate.
Paired with 5 wines hailing from France, Germany, and Spain — from dry whites to a sweeter varietal that foreshadowed the close of the meal — the lunch tasting menu was a taste bud explosion.
I was lucky enough to enjoy the experience on a brilliant autumn afternoon. Read this and you’ll be planning a visit, I promise.
Nestled in the hamlet of Skåne-Tranås, in an unassuming farmhouse with an ample farm garden in the back, luncheon guests are greeted with a glass of champagne to start. Because, well, why not.

One day I found myself on a flight to Berlin, Germany. Berlin didn’t even rank within the top ten places to visit on my list but I had to go for work, so why not enjoy this obligatory adventure? I had heard that Berlin was moody and grungy, like the emo child of Europe except it’s not “just a phase”. I was prepared to be met with a lot of punk rock and broody, techno vibes but (as is custom when traveling) I discovered the unexpected.
I landed in the mid evening in Berlin and my colleagues and I were starving and excited to sample Berlin cuisine. Three of us were American and were humbly disappointed that many restaurants nearby were already closed — how inconvenient! It’s usually good to be humbled like this as an American abroad, it definitely enriches one’s character. We did manage to find — what else —but a McDonalds. At this moment, I was less than dazzled by Berlin’s seemingly inaccessible evening meal options but figured it could only get better from here.
In the days that followed, I found Berlin to be a fascinating albeit (at times) icy, bustling city of natives, expats and tourists with cool modern buildings and large boulevards. While the overtone of German austerity, order and efficiency was undeniable, there were surprising pockets of whimsy mixed in here and there.
My personal favorite site was the Brandenburg Gate. A stunning piece of architecture with a lot of history and easily one of the most recognizable landmarks of Berlin.
I also visited Checkpoint Charlie, which was historically the Berlin Wall crossing point. This was a quirky museum overflowing with objects large and small, significant to a major turning point in German history. Not too far from the Brandenburg Gate was the beautiful, lush state park called the Tiergarten. Dense with trees, I would describe the Tiergarten as “Central Park with European elegance” — definitely another favorite location.
While Berlin certainly had highlights of grunge, some parts were charming and even rather quirky with fun thrift stores, local farmer’s markets and the unexpected hipster-style cafe.
Before traveling to Berlin, I was looking forward to sampling famous local fare (currywurst and sauerkraut of course) but Berlin also had much to offer in terms of international cuisine, with a lot of Turkish influences. I made it a priority to sample at least one döner kebab (something I would describe as a cross between shawarma and a sub sandwich) and it did not disappoint. To date, one of the best breakfasts of my life (avocado toast, covered in sautéed mushrooms over thick, fresh bread) was at a highly aesthetic cafe called Kaffee Karamell Berlin. And when I finally got my fork into some local sauerkraut, I knew that I was ruined for any canned, store-bought variety…forever. At the end of my trip I discovered that Berlin was certainly more complex than I had originally imagined. Quirky, grungy, cool, refined, steeped in history yet unapologetically modern, a bit edgy with it’s soft sides as well. Snag your ticket to Berlin and see for yourself!

I’ve been fascinated by the subway all my life. Maybe it’s the fact that there’s nothing outside the windows; that when sitting in a subway carriage one has no other choice than to focus on the other passengers – how they look, what they’re doing, what they’re reading – or, god forbid, oneself.
There’s also that unique feeling of descending into the bowels of a city and being propelled from one brightly-lit station to the next through dark, mysterious tunnels.
In Berlin, there is the additional sensation of stepping out of the present and directly into subterranean history, since the city’s U-Bahn and S-Bahn were both complicit in transporting border traffic between West Germany and the GDR.
The fact that the city was divided along apparently randomly-drawn borders meant that some of the U-Bahn lines from West Berlin actually travelled beneath East Berlin, though passengers were not able to leave the train until it reached West Berlin again. The stations those trains passed soon became known as ‘ghost stations’ amongst Berliners – dimly lit stops where armed East German border guards would peer at passengers through slits in bricked up huts.
Due to the geography of the boroughs of Wedding in the West and Mitte in the East, the U6 had, after the U8, the second highest number of ghost stations, namely the five stations from Schwartzkopfstraße to Stadtmitte. On a cold March day in a still snow-covered Berlin, I decided to ride the U6 to Friedrichstrasse. I wanted to get a feel for what the underground city may have looked and felt like during those Cold War days, and to simulate a journey from West to East, if only in my head.
I start right at the beginning of the U6, at Alt-Tegel, which opened as ‘Tegel’ station in 1958 as part of a northern extension of the U6, which had existed since 1923 as the North-South Line between Seestrasse and Tempelhof. In 1992, the station was renamed Alt-Tegel (Old Tegel). As it’s the end of the line, it comprises eight exits, and is an important feeder in summer for people visiting the nearby Tegeler See to explore its pleasure boats and beaches.
On this cold, winter day though, the area reminds me of the small, boring town in West Germany I grew up in: all 1980s plastic and concrete with sharp edges, a Commerzbank, and a C&A next to a café full of huddled, grey-haired pensioners.
GDR U-Bahn and S-Bahn. West Berlin does not exist on this map.
Borsigwerke, Holzhauser Straße, Otisstraße and Scharnweberstraße are the next stops on the line, and also part of the 1958-extension.
Due to the very high water table, the track was raised onto an embankment, meaning passengers can view the quintessential urban scenery: business parks, small estates, grey and brown houses from the 80s.
The only excitement for me is at Scharnweberstrasse, where one can see glimpses of the planes rolling along the runway of Tegel Airport.
Speaking of planes: Kurt-Schumacher-Platz must be the best place in Berlin for plane spotting. There’s something genuinely appealing about standing at the bus stop near the kebab stands and Chinese restaurants and watching the planes roar just 50 metres over your hand on their final approach to Tegel airport.
The locals, long used to the noise and the sight of planes with the landing gear extended, continue strolling and feeding the pidgeons without blinking. For visitors like me, it’s hard not to imagine the plane careening into the bus stop rather than the runway behind it.
From Kurt-Schumacher-Platz, the U-Bahn runs underground again, traveling through “wild” Wedding (formerly in the French occupation sector) along Afrikanische Straße (with the nearby Centre Culturel Français and its very own Eiffel Tower replica), Rehberge (the best stop to explore the Siedlung Schillerpark, a modernist housing estate and UNESCO World Heritage site), Seestraße and Leopoldplatz — a.k.a. the heart of Wedding, with its Brutalist town hall, Schinkel-designed church — and to Reinickendorfer Straße, the former ‘last stop in Berlin West’.
From 1961 on, when the wall was erected, trains from Reinickendorfer Strasse did not stop until Friedrichstrasse.The line was then called the C-line, and its trains would pass under the border and through Schwartzkopfstraße then Stadion der Weltjugend, Naturkundenmuseum then Nordbahnhof and Oranienburger Tor at a snail’s pace.
All the station exits were bricked up, and armed border guards or police patrolled the platforms vigilantly. There was barbed wire beneath the platform edge to prevent fugitives from crawling along the tracks, and even the emergency exists were blocked: the only way to leave when a train broke down was to walk along the tracks to the nearest western station.
On the surface, all references to these stations were removed; the GDR did not want to remind its citizens that there were trains rumbling in and out of the capitalist West right beneath their feet.
Naturkundemuseum, decorated in cheerful yellows. Image by Kate Seabrook.
Today, nothing reminds passengers that these stations, now cheerfully painted in yellows and greens, had once been in another country – except maybe a vaguely claustrophobic atmosphere.
The stations seem smaller and more crowded than the ones further up the line, but that could admittedly be my imagination. The atmosphere doesn’t seem to affect the school classes alighting at Naturkundemuseum, nor the noisy group of Spanish tourists entering the carriage at Oranienburger Tor for the short hop to Friedrichstrasse.
Bahnhof Friedrichstrasse is one of the most important stations in Berlin history. Different to the other GDR ghost stations, it was transformed from a former central station for subway, commuter and regional trains into a major border crossing, and became a bottleneck where people from the capitalist west and from the workers’ and peasants’ state passed each other unseen.
The station’s facilities and the underground station were only accessible for passengers from the western sectors transferring here. West Berlin citizens could also avail of the border crossing and enter the GDR here, after passing through a labyrinthine maze of tunnels and walkways designed to prevent any direct contact with GDR-citizens.
East Berliners, on the other hand, could not enter the U- or S- Bahn – the only way to leave the GDR was to get on a long-distance train to West Germany. To do so, GDR citizens had to pass through the so-called ”Tränenpalast,” the palace of tears, a building on the square north of the station erected in 1962. The expression is derived from the tearful goodbyes that took place in front of the building, where family members with travel permits had to say farewell to their relatives.
After the fall of the wall, the blue glass pavilion of Friedrichstrasse became a cultural center for concerts and readings, and was eventually turned into the Tränenpalast museum in 2006, enabling visitors to relive the experience of officially crossing from the GDR to West Berlin.

Almost three-quarters of a century ago, the German Army had been pushed back to Berlin. Six years of war culminated in fierce fighting through the streets of Berlin. Adolf Hitler claimed his Third Reich would last for a thousand years, yet by the end of the battle his army was depleted, and his right-hand men had begun to abandon him.
The battle, which was predominantly between German and Soviet Union soldiers, was the last stand of the Nazi regime. Yet the swift advancement of the Allies on both the Eastern and Western Front meant that by the time the Battle of Berlin began, the war was coming to a gradual and bloody end.
A battle which resulted in Germany’s surrender came at a significant human cost. Over three-quarters of a million people, soldiers and civilians were either killed or wounded. Society within Berlin was almost destroyed. Destruction of the city began on the 19th April 1945. The Soviet Union began shelling the city in preparation for the tank and infantry assault. Six days later, led by General Zhukov, the first Russian soldiers broke through to the Berlin suburbs. Day by day, more and more of outer-Berlin fell into Soviet hands.
The counter-attack which was desperately needed by the Germans came from the 12th army, commanded by General Wenck, on April 27th. Yet the sheer number of Soviet soldiers, the lack of resources at Wenck’s disposal and tactical bombing from the Royal Air Force to delay the German reinforcements ultimately made sure that the counter-attack had no real impact. Wenck was halted and the Soviet forces were just 15 miles from the centre of the city. By early May, the Third Reich and everything which Nazism stood for was on the brink of total collapse.
In the meantime, Hitler was deep in his bunker underneath the streets where his people were being slaughtered by an invading force. One of his final acts as German leader was to send members of the Hitler youth out onto the bombed-out streets of Berlin. Many of these would fall during the dying days of the Third Reich.
The people who had followed him, often so loyally, for many years had been left to die by Hitler at the hands of the Soviet Union. When British and American troops made their way into the city from the west, Berlin was surrounded by the Allied forces. The Reichstag lay in ruins, as did the Nazi regime.
It had taken the Allies almost five years to regain a foothold in continental Europe, with Britain and France suffering greatly in the process. Millions of lives were lost in the struggle to crush fascism and the slaughter had been taken to the streets of a city previously considered impregnable by Allied command.
Berliners were, like at the end of the First World War, left with their governments in ruin. Thousands of people lay dead in Berlin, over a million were without power and clean water, yet for many, the worst was yet to come. Although the Second World War was over, the fear an all-new type of warfare was beginning to grip the continent.

Twenty five years ago this week, TV images flashed on screen of people singing and dancing atop the Berlin Wall.
It seemed almost impossible. I gulped, smiled and felt all tingly.
The fall of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9, 1989, was emotional and personal for me. Years earlier, I had lived on the free side of the divided city at the height of the Cold War as an American military high school student. Were our neighbors trapped in the East now free after nearly three decades of Soviet control?
To stem the flow of East Berliners who wanted to escape, a jagged 27-mile wall cut the city into two halves, and 100 miles of barbed wire encircled the back half of West Berlin, making it an island city. But as American military dependents, we enjoyed a good life and freedom in a cosmopolitan half protected by American, British and French soldiers.
Those in East Berlin experienced a daily existence that was dreary and drab behind a 13-foot-tall concrete barrier. Although all roads in West Berlin ended at the wall, we couldn’t help but see the oppression on the other side. “This wall is an illusion,” read graffiti painted on the free side. “You stand like a scab, an unhealing wound,” were scrawled words I still remember today.
With my father’s U.S. Air Force status we were allowed to venture into the East. We occasionally drove through the famous Checkpoint Charlie border crossing in our gigantic1962 Pontiac Star Chief. During day trips, we would purchase camera gear, crystal glassware and wall clocks in shops intended for visiting communist dignitaries.
We avoided the regular markets with no fresh fruit, and shoe stores with only one size, style and color.
On one outing my family returned to our car to find people standing by the trunk, which was large enough to hold three people. They asked us to take them over to the West.
My father just shook his head “no” and told us to get in the car. He had heard of other GI’s who had smuggled East Berliners back to the West and were caught by the American military police. U.S. officials would immediately transfer those soldiers who risked an international incident. They would be sent from West Berlin (a plum assignment) to a desolate outpost in South Korea as punishment the next day, or so the rumor went.
On my 16th birthday, my father took me over to the East for dinner at the Moscow Haus, a high-end restaurant frequented by communist officials. Within minutes, a man in a Russian uniform joined us at the table. In decent English, he asked about the stripes on my father’s uniform and what they meant.
I remember great awkwardness and a racing heartbeat as the soldier continued to sit with us as we remained silent. Finally the Soviet officer returned to his own table. Who was he? Where did he come from? Could we have disappeared that night, deep in the heart of East Berlin?
Another time we tried to buy a motorcycle in a showroom full of choices, or so we thought. The clerk pulled a big book from behind the counter and asked us to write in our name and address. “Three years,” he told us. “What about these in the store?” we asked. No, those were just for display, he said. We would need to get on a list and wait, so we declined.
While the Soviet east sat basically untouched and neglected for 28 years, the fall of the Wall led to massive, but slow, renovations.
The former districts of East Berlin today are festive places, full of upscale townhouses, offbeat art galleries and ethnic restaurants. Playhouses host performances that rival those of New York and Las Vegas, and American celebrities like Matt Damon and Tom Cruise turn up weekly for vacations or movie premieres.
The former swath that cut through the center of city has provided prime real estate for development again, especially along the Spree River. The city’s subway systems are united and provide seamless and efficient transportation for Berlin’s 3.5 million people.
Everything happens on a grand scale, whether it’s a massive fireworks display at the Brandenburg Gate on New Year’s Eve or the opening of Europe’s largest train station days before the 2006 World Cup soccer tournament began. The main government building, Der Reichstag, is a contrast of visions — with old style below and a futurist glass dome above that allows visitors to peer into the legislative chamber below.
By guiding University of Florida student journalists the past 10 years on study-abroad trips, I have been privileged to help tell the story of a reborn Berlin. Armed with digital cameras, voice recorders and laptops, UF students have spent two weeks every May since 2005 reporting on a cross-section of Berliners. From the city where I discovered my interest in photojournalism, we document some of the people and places that exemplify Berlin’s ongoing spirit of freedom. It’s a subtle revelation as the students come to understand the significance of what they are seeing and feeling.
Many return to Florida saying they’ve been changed; they have felt the underlying spirit of survival, transformation, creativity and openness. Most are surprised and enthralled that the city lives up its reputation of “anything goes.” Some students feel more patriotic after learning and seeing first-hand how American forces kept the city alive following World War II. Some say they want to return to Berlin and open a coffee shop – or work for the Fat Tire Bike Tour company. Most have heard the expression first-hand from Berliners that “you can be who you want to be in Berlin.”
All remember Dr. Pong — a virtually unmarked club where the only entertainment is a single ping-pong table and loud music. Holding a beverage in one hand and a paddle in the other, up to 30 partiers circle the table in a counter-clockwise motion, enjoying a group game that shrinks in size as players miss and have to sit out. After the final two players battle for the championship, the winner bangs the table three times with his paddle, and everyone starts up again. It’s a happy mix – a free-for-all of ages, styles, religions and politics.
Dr. Pong is only a hole-in-the-wall pub, a relic in the former East. It’s poorly lit, has unadorned concrete walls and is full of choking smoke. Yet it speaks volumes about the edginess of Berlin, the acceptance of others and the freedom that the united city now enjoys.
Twenty-five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Germany’s capital continues to reinvent itself, balancing between an historic past and an optimistic future to remain one of the world’s leading cities. I’m proud to be a part of that transformation every year.

By Annie Mark-Westfall
My column is due in two days, and I am staring into a panicked abyss. To inspire myself, I take a brisk walk while my husband puts the kids to bed. As I set out, I narrate and write in my head, badly. I get stuck on whether the word “brisk” is meant to describe the pace or the biting cold, and roll my eyes. For the duration of the walk, I will wrestle my thoughts, alternately trying to focus and to let my mind empty itself. Think. Don’t think. Think.
It gives me flashbacks to being a middle-schooler at a mall in middle America, standing in front of a large display of those 3-D hidden image posters. Those posters were the fake news of the 1990s, I am sure of it. My friends always claimed to see a floating sailboat, while I stood there dumbly.
“Just focus on one spot. Do you see it?”
“No, no! Don’t focus on anything, just let your vision get blurry. Do you see it now?”
My thoughts return to the present, where I am walking quickly in the freezing cold of January in Berlin, musing now on the cliché “waste not, want not.” For a year, I have been rolling this concept over in my head, wondering at the direction of causation. How a refrigerator full of leftovers does seem to reduce my appetite. Just don’t think, Annie.
I pause at the site of Albert Einstein’s old apartment building. It was destroyed in the war. In Berlin, we say “the war” the way New Yorkers say “the city” — as if there is only one. An etched sign marks the location. Berlin does not light its streets the way US cities do, and my neighborhood is particularly residential, so the sign is barely visible. We bring all our visitors here, so I know that it details, both in German and English, how Einstein used to host famous and talented guests. How they would spend evenings discussing the secrets of the universe and other urgent and important matters. Here, he wrote his theory of relativity. THINK, Annie!
The numbness is setting in. I forget how cold Berlin is, and should have worn a longer coat. It was almost 60 degrees when we were back in Ohio for the holidays. A friend who attends the climate negotiations texted me from Katowice, Poland in December, “We are all f*cked. Learn survival skills and move to higher ground.” Don’t think about that.
On the move again, I return to another friend’s idea to relaunch a Berlin salon, reminiscent of the ones run by Jewish women starting from the late 18thcentury. I am desperate for her to do this, and to include me. I think about my living room: its warmth from the radiator, inviting Persian rugs, and soft floor lamps. Our 12-foot ceilings and stained-glass windows. I am a Jewish woman. Can I make this happen? I chasten myself to sit back and stop it. It was not my idea. And my living room is not my own. It has French doors that connect to the kids’ room, and is perpetually strewn with baby dolls, mateless socks, child-size kitchen supplies.
Approaching home now, I recall how earlier in the evening, my 3-year-old asked, “How do you say ‘salad’ in Polish?” I vow that 2019 will be a year of delighting at these questions, rather than a sighed, “I don’t know, baby, eat your dinner.” Think.
I grab my computer and thaw out on the couch. I go online and am both relieved and dismayed to read that my column from last January similarly noted this soul-level exhaustion and lack of inspiration. Think, dammit!
Next to me on the couch is the latest unopened letter from Grandma Bea, her familiar cursive handwriting shaky across the envelope. I adore these letters and their everyday non-news. The essence of her character leaps off the page even as she claims she has nothing to write. This letter once again recounts her delight from a deer’s visit to her backyard bird feeder a few weeks ago. The event has found its way into three letters over the weeks, along with a detailed weather report. “My freezer is full and my fridge is stocked, so let it snow!” Grandma Bea knows how to warm a soul, even from across an ocean.
To start my year, I read When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi, the terminally ill brain surgeon on a quest for the meaning of life. His memoir intersperses quotes from literature and facts from neuroscience, and left me bereft when I turned the last page at the solitary hour of 2:00 am. Thinking now about Dr. Kalanithi’s calling as a doctor, and Grandma Bea’s notes on substituting gluten-free flour in her famous banana cake recipe, my breath catches at their hyper-focused sense of purpose.
Last summer, while I was still on maternity leave, I met up with a friend from college who was passing through Berlin. We sat in a café together, and as I shushed my baby, I hungrily asked questions about her life as a writer, feeling pangs of jealousy. Although I have meticulously crafted my dream life here in Berlin, I admittedly had hoped writing would play more of a role in my life than it currently does.
The conversation turned to one of her award-winning essays, on the topic of whales and something else brilliant and divergent like prison reform. The combination came to her after a professor urged her to return to a subject that she was “passionate about as a child.”
As I sit on my couch now, eight months later, trying again to conjure something that inspired me as a child, I hear the baby cry in the next room, followed by my husband’s voice, urgent, patient, frustrated, calm. I google “3-D image posters” and try to focus.

BERLIN — Berlin is gritty and urbane, where techno music throbs against the graffitied walls of sex clubs and drag bars. The city is known for being progressive and tolerant — but hop on the S-Bahn to one of the last stations in the East and you’ve entered Marzahn.
This is the other Berlin.
Marzahn is tucked in the northeast corner of Berlin, a working class industrial region, dotted with high-rise flats dating from the Communist era. Far-right politics find fertile ground here. After the Berlin Wall fell, Marzahn became a hub for skinheads and swastikas in the 1990s, an area rife with nationalism and populism.
Today, Marzahn is a stronghold of the country’s most successful nationalist party, the Alternative for Germany or AfD. The party embraces a platform of familiar right-wing causes — anti-immigration, isolationism, anti-LGBTQ, anti-vaccine, antisemitism and climate change denial — which are part of the American political landscape as well. Like former U.S. President Donald Trump, some in the AfD have grudging admiration for Russian leader Vladimir Putin. They oppose supplying arms to Ukraine to defend itself against Moscow’s recent invasion.
Although AfD support slipped in the most recent elections last year, its formerly fringe politics are moving deeper into the mainstream —in Germany as abroad.
Jorn Geissler, treasurer of the Marzahn branch, is keen to explain himself and his views to American readers. He invited me into his office, projecting a voice that exuded his buoyant demeanor as he walked me through the local city hall. This German nationalist wore a pair of gray khakis and greeted me with vanilla wafers and black coffee.
“You are now leaving the politically correct sector,” reads a mousepad on a desk in the AfD Marzahn office. This is a party that trades inclusive policy and progress on human rights — or political correctness — for nationalist and anti-immigrant sentiment.
Of course, speaking to an American journalist, Geissler presented the polished rendition of the far-right faction, meticulously packaged as socially acceptable. Geissler wanted to make this remarkably clear.
“I’m not a Nazi and I’m not a racist,” said Geissler. “We hear so much about fascists and Nazis in Germany, in Berlin, in Marzahn, but I’ve never seen a Nazi.”
The AfD party was founded in 2013 by mainstream Christian Democrats, who wished to abolish the euro as Germany’s currency. It adopted a clear anti-immigration platform amid the influx of Muslim refugees in 2015, when the party’s popularity rose.
Supporters are primarily from the former Communist eastern part of the country, where the political divide today reflects a split along the former Iron Curtain. During the AfD’s peak in the 2017 election, only 11.1% of western German voters cast a vote for the AfD as compared to 22.5% in the eastern states, according to tracking carried out by the German publication FOCUS.
Right wing parties have made strong inroads in the former East Germany, a phenomenon attributed to high unemployment and loss of identity after the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989, what Germans call the Wende, which means ‘Turn.’
“The whole East lost its political orientation in 1989,” Geissler said. “The former parties collapsed and all people in East Germany had to orient in a new way because we had no strong connection with the existing parties.”
Upon its creation in 2013, the AfD did not meet the five percent threshold to elect members to the German parliament. Very quickly, however, party support skyrocketed due to its feisty social conservative politics and its opposition to an influx of asylum seekers from the Middle East and Africa.
In Marzahn, support in 2021 hovered around 16%, maintaining the right-leaning reputation of the neighborhood. In the 2017 national election, 20.6% of Marzahn voters chose the AfD in the first round of voting, the party’s peak year.
Geissler, a construction engineer, joined the far-right party in 2014, attracted to its nationalist stance against the euro. He came to appreciate the party’s disruptive politics, seeing it as the German counterpart to Trumpism.
“We are not controlled by the system,’’ he said.
Even as a young man, growing up in the Germany Democratic Republic, or East Germany, Geissler was the rebellious type, dissatisfied with the living conditions maintained by the ruling Communists.
The same goes for Jeannette Auricht, 62, a member of the Berlin Senate who as a child danced around her room to Michael Jackson and Earth, Wind & Fire on the radio. In all areas of Berlin, TV and radio channels were left unrestricted which also gave her and other East Berliners access to the American Forces Network, a U.S. Army-run radio channel that contributed to her rising angst over lack of freedoms in the East.
Auricht was arrested in her teen years for demonstrating against the Berlin Wall. Now, she represents the AfD in Berlin and says she has “learned to read between the lines” in German politics, meaning she has a long-standing mistrust of government.
As she pledges to hold onto her center-right stance, not all of her party co-members do the same, instead drifting further right.
The alternative ideology of the party has attracted many extremist members, prompting the German courts in March 2021 uphold the government-declared designation of the AfD as a “suspicious entity,” which makes it legal to monitor groups who may be engaging in anti-constitutional activities.
Germany’s attempt to put the AfD under surveillance for extremism does not phase Auricht, who said she does not fear wiretapping because she has nothing to hide.
“I’m not planning a revolution,” she said. “Criticizing the government is a job you have to do and that is nothing against the country or the democratic ways.”
Within the party, leaders try to push out extremists by researching whether they have a racist or fascist history, Geissler said. However, German laws make it difficult to remove members from their parties and this proactive measure was only implemented a couple years into AfD’s existence, he said.
So, extremists do still exist here. And while the party is currently split between center-right and far-right directions, the far-right fringe casts a dark shadow on the reputation of the party.
In late 2020, former AfD party official Christian Lueth was recorded saying that to allow more migrants into Germany would be better for the party because it would attract more membership. As for the immigrants, he said, they can “shoot them all afterwards.”
“Or gas them, whichever you like. I don’t care either way,” the Lueth was quoted as saying.
Geissler said that other political parties in the governing coalition fight against the AfD because of some outspoken extremists, and he also blames the media for misrepresenting the party, due to what he considers a journalistic lean to the left.
He also points out that most party officials are beginners in the political scene.
“AfD members are mostly newbies,” Geissler said. “Most people have no political experience compared to other political parties. And you have to go a long way to get to the top.”
The fringe is gaining ground not only in Germany but in other parts of Europe, where voters in countries like Hungary and Poland are also continuing to accept the far-right in their political mainstream. Despite the AfD’s drop in votes in Germany’s most recent parliamentary election, the nationalist movement is gaining traction among the general public.
“Far-right groups are starting to share straight-out white supremacist ideas that used to be unacceptable in ‘mainstream’ politics,” said Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the U.S.-based Global Project Against Hate and Extremism.
The AfD’s social platform places it far into the political edges with its subversive ideology on human rights, she says, adding that its populist platform reflects the shifting political climate in Germany.
“There is a hard move to the right built mostly on anti-immigrant positions, a simultaneous collapse of the left, and a scramble at the center to keep the fringe out,” Beirich said.
Far-right anti-immigration sentiment is the most obvious example of social conservatism that has the potential to turn dangerous — as it has on a few other occasions in the three decades since German reunification. The AfD platform pushes for strictly regulated borders, especially for Muslim migrants who “don’t take up German culture,” said Marzahn party treasurer Geissler.
He says there is a stronger opposition to Muslim refugees than to Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian invasion because the new arrivals are of European descent and share Christian principles and other cultural norms.
“Migrants from Islamic countries are completely different from European countries like Ukraine,” Geissler said. “The culture is more similar, such as how to speak to women, and the family culture.”
The AfD is vocal about its anti-immigrant stance, but its antisemitism is more hidden. It does not support certain inclusive laws and regulations, such as those governing circumcision and animal slaughter rituals — some of which affect both Muslims and Jews, said Sigmount Koenigsberg, Commissioner Against Antisemitism at the Jewish Community of Berlin.
“The AfD is pretending to be pro-Jewish and pro-Israel,” Koenigsberg said. “It’s a fig leaf to hide their anti-Muslim sentiment. The far right parties are all antisemitic and that is clear.”
In July, the state of Brandenburg, outside Berlin, voted to amend its constitution to include stronger language banning discrimination against Jews, and specifically naming the Sinti and Roma diaspora for protection, codifying a commitment to fight antisemitism and antigypsyism.
The AfD was the only party to vote against it.
Beirich, of the global anti-hate project says the AfD’s populist rhetoric is now part of a global fabric, and she cites parallels between the German AfD and the American Republican Party.
“There’s a lot of political science work that’s been done about where the Republican party sits now and AfD is one of the parties that they most compare our GOP to nowadays,” Beirich said. “So it just shows how far the Republicans have moved to the right.”
She said the GOP and AfD dovetail most on their anti-immigrant positioning, seeking to deny benefits to migrants and cut back on numbers.
But while abortion laws are politically charged in the United States , especially after the Supreme Court reversed the Roe v. Wade right to abortion, the German right has maintained a more ambiguous stance.
“Every woman should make their own decision about their body,” said Auricht, who represents the AfD in Berlin. “With vaccinations too, you cannot say ‘my body my choice’ and then not hold that same principle with receiving the vaccine.”
Gun rights and regulation is also a hot topic for polarized America, and the AfD spokespeople cannot understand the American obsession with guns.
While the far-right narratives are similar worldwide — anti-lockdown fervor, dangerous conspiracy theories, and opposition to gay rights, just to name a few — the U.S. might be in more danger of veering into reactionary politics than Europe is, say analysts.
“There are some parallels with a hard shift to the right and openness by regular conservatives, especially here in the United States, to white supremacy and street movements,” American anti-extremism activist Beirich said. “I think the situation actually is worse here in the United States than it is in Germany.”
Because of Germany’s Nazi past, democracy is better protected by a state that is highly concerned with anti-democratic movements and hate speech, she said.
Beirich points out that far-right wing parties tend to be opportunistic, attaching themselves to crises such as the pandemic to keep their numbers up. If there is another social or economic crisis tomorrow, she said, party support would likely reflect the country’s circumstances.
“They are going to rise and fall in various ways depending on the mood of the country,” Beirich said. “The fringe is not disappearing like they did in previous eras. They seem to have a foothold now and are surviving.”
So the AfD may have lost some ground electorally, but its ideas have seeped into mainstream politics, strengthening the broader array of rightist parties.
Annemarie Schmidt, 74, a retired teacher from Marzahn who identifies herself as left-leaning, admits that she shares the AfD’s concerns over refugees, over rising housing and energy costs and the financial burdens of the war in Ukraine.
Schmidt thinks the climate is ripe for the AfD to do well in the future.
“Poor people here get nothing and the refugees get a lot, so the state makes it difficult for everyone to get along,” Schmidt said. “Though the AfD is taking advantage of these problems, they could be right on this topic. I wouldn’t vote for them, but during the next election the AfD will be very strong.”

Last summer I went to Berlin and it was beautiful. Despite the heat wave that had been sweeping across Europe when visiting, it didn’t ruin the experience — even if we were sweating.
After taking an overnight train on Friday, I woke and started my early day in Berlin on Saturday. I had planned the day out so that I would see most of Berlin in my limited time (I had to leave by Sunday night) and it was successful, hitting most of the main spots. However, there is some things I missed, so if you want a more in-depth experience I’d recommend staying longer. Berlin is not a smaller European city like Copenhagen, but a huge area a Manhattan-style feel at points.
Here is how I saw Berlin in about 48 hours:
Right off the train stop you will be able to walk towards Brandenburg gate and the Reichstag (German Parliament building).

I travel the world exploring high tech low life places. Most of these places are in Asia, but what about Europe? Wikipedia Cyberpunk page mentioned Sony Center in Berlin as an example of cyberpunk-influenced cityscape. Modern incarnations of cyberpunk are exact focus of this blog, so we’re going to Germany!
First place we’ll visit is Potsdamer Platz in Berlin’s central borough called Mitte.
This place is awesome and looks more like Manhattan than a German city.
Being a kid in late 90s I loved a TV show called “Total Recall 2070”. It was loosely based on Philip K. Dick works. Plots of most episodes are quite cheesy, but its futuristic atmosphere was so damn dark and sinister! And you know what? Potsdamer Platz looks and feels exactly like Total Recall 2070.
As I know, no cyberpunk books or movies are based in Berlin, but they definitely should!
Berlin is worth visiting just for Potsdamer Platz, but let’s proceed to the Sony Center, which is nearby.
It is easy to approach Sony Center from Potsdamer Platz, just go where all the neon lights are.
This area consists mostly of shopping malls, offices, restaurants. But who cares? For me it looks exactly like William Gibson’s 80s vision of the future.
Large shining dome reminds me of Highlander 2 movie. By the way, the movie was very much high tech and low life.
Offices on the sides of Sony Center looks super futuristic even without glowing neon lights.
The area of Sony Center and nearby office buildings is quite crowded and noisy. Walk couple of minutes westward and suddenly the streets become empty.
Approaching Tiergarten, Berlin’s central park. It is completely empty at 8pm.
Going to Unter den Linden street, which passes Mitte horizontally. Westernmost part of the street is a place of famous Brandenburg Gate and different government building.
But let’s go east, where Berlin looks more hi tech and noire.
Probably low life is not what you’ll find here, but central Berlin still has its dark vibe at night with techno clubs and dark cold streets.
Mitte reminds me both Manhattan and Moscow, but feels darker than each of them.
Speaking of Moscow, we’re approaching Alexanderplatz which looks a lot like large soviet city, rather than Western Europe.
Which is quite obvious, since this district was a part of Eastern Germany.
When it is foggy, Alexanderplatz feels like a vampire movie.
Visiting Berlin is definitely a good idea for dark future fans. Other districts look less dark, but still interesting to explore. Berlin is easy to reach via major airlines (sometimes with connection in Frankfurt or Munich) and its relatively cheap, comparing to other Western Europe capital cities.

This is the Fernsehturm Berlin, the TV tower. Built in the late ’60s, at 1206 feet it is the tallest structure in Germany and third tallest in Europe.
During the Cold War, there were two independent Germanies:
Berlin was entirely within East Germany but was divided into sectors, the US, French, British, and Soviet. Westerners were limited in going to Berlin in the first place, but getting to East Berlin was a major hassle.
There were three roads from West Germany to Berlin, and they were carefully monitored. None of my friends even considered trying that drive. There was also a rail service from Frankfurt to Berlin, the Berlin Duty Train. Like the three highways, carefully planning and getting the required approvals was essential for the train.
However, I did get to East Berlin for a couple of days in 1981. Co-worker Bill (of the Vienna trip fame) and I got a military hop from our base in West Germany to Berlin. Melinda, one of our friends, had just been transferred there as a protocol officer. Clever of us to have a friend in that business, wasn’t it? She had arranged rooms for us in the huge hotel at Tempelhof airport.
Because the city was still occupied, you couldn’t just go into East Berlin and wander around. We had to wear our military uniforms so you know how much we stood out among the locals.
My first thought when we started sightseeing was how stern all the people looked. Not that they disliked us, but like they were not enjoying life there. We saw lots of rubble still there from the war years. Guess I’d have expected more repair work to have been done by then, 1981.
Checkpoint Charlie was and is still known as a major symbol of the Cold War so we wanted to see it. It was the only approved checkpoint, walking or driving, for foreigners and military personnel. (Sorry, my picture isn’t too good; couldn’t Photoshop it enough.)
This is me, in uniform, at the Brandenburg Gate in the Soviet zone. People and vehicles could use it freely until August 1961 when the Berlin Wall was built. The Wall enclosed the entire city, passing right by the west side of the gate. President Ronald Reagan gave his famous ‘Tear down this wall’ speech near the Gate in June 1987. As you may remember, the Wall was ended in December 1989.
Thanks again to Melinda; we got a tour of West Berlin, the Wall, and even into East Berlin just a bit. She’d arranged a helicopter tour for a visiting US Air Force general. You know biggies often get special treatment and opportunities.
Since the General’s aide was the only other passenger, Melinda asked the General to take two visiting USAF officers. He kindly agreed. I’d been in a helicopter before, even saw the Tucson home of a mafioso kingpin from one! This trip was unique, a matter of international law, I guess. Flying over the Wall into the Soviet Zone was a huge no-no. But the crew said they did it regularly, just a brief crossover, to maintain US rights!
Is this cheating? It’s me at the Berlin Wall from the good guy side, on a different trip.
Now, about that TV tower…
Like the Brandenburg Gate, it is one of the most prominent symbols of Berlin. When the sun shines (as it does once in a while in Germany) it reflects on the tower’s dome in the shape of a Greek cross, a symbol against the East German removal of crosses from churches during the Cold War!

My first days in Berlin were terrible. The apartment I agreed to rent based only on photographs was too cold: Spartan in its hyper-masculine functionality. It would not warm up. It also became clear that I could not get by on English alone despite Berlin’s reputation as a cosmopolitan hub. I bought cream cheese when I wanted yoghurt, and had to use sign language in the grocery store, bakery, and flower shop. Buying tickets for the subway was not easy either. I walked around in an alienating landscape in which most of the signage was incomprehensible, newspapers made no sense, and I required GoogleTranslate to use the washing machine. It was unsettling to be able to discern the letters, but not the words. I realized that German acquisition, even basic German, was necessary if I wanted to interact with people outside the Anglophone expat cocoon, and if I wanted a more meaningful connection to my new home.
Fortunately, I am good with languages. That talent paired with a six-week language course and being unabashed about speaking terrible German has made a difference. Now I can talk to the butcher, the baker, and the Siemens washer. The other thing that has made a difference is my decision to get to know this city through its bookstores. I resolved to visit a different bookstore each weekend, and from there to launch my explorations of the neighborhood in which the store stood. This would get me out of my (cold) apartment, and into Germany’s capital, get me walking, looking at buildings, and discovering food, shops, and public spaces.
How happy I am with my choice, because Berlin is thick with bookstores. I won’t bore you with statistics, just my anecdotal experience coming from New York via Los Angeles. Brentwood, my old neighborhood in La-La Land, is thick with movie stars, and nail salons. There’s no lack of storefronts offering manicures and pedicures and juice cleanses, but there was not a single bookstore within walking distance (or even easy driving distance) of my apartment on Sunset Boulevard. Contrast that with at least ten bookstores within a ten minute walk of my current apartment in Berlin’s Prenzlauer Berg, and several just steps away. Even Morningside Heights, my Manhattan neighborhood, can boast of only Book Culture (formerly Labyrinth Books), the wonderful, intellectual heavyweight on 113th Street, and its sister store on Broadway and 116th Street, across from Columbia University’s gates.
But it’s not only Berlin’s high per capita of bookshops that I wish to extol, it is also their variety, specificity, and idiosyncrasy. You find the usual suspects of course, like bookshops devoted to children’s books or used books or art books, but I have also found bookshops aimed at naturalists; crime fiction aficionados; cookbook enthusiasts; travel nuts; theater buffs; sci-fi fiends; visual design freaks; and expat Anglos. There are so many others still waiting to be discovered. Let’s take a short walk from the Wasserturm,
the 19th century brick water tower that anchors my part of Prenzlauer Berg, to see what I mean.
Walking north on pretty, cobblestoned Ryke Straße, past the synagogue and its security detail, will take us to the intersection with Wörther Straße. A right on Wörther leads to St. George’s Bookshop, a purveyor of second-hand English books since 2003, and a left finds us in front of Georg Büchner Buchladen and its enticing window display. From Wörther Straße, walk north on Kollwitz Straße and its popular cafes and restaurants and cross Danziger to Senefelder; continue north until you get to the intersection of Senefelder and Raumer Straße and Buch Reigen. Their beautiful children’s books (yes, in German) have been tempting me since I moved into the quarter. Then walk west on Raumer to Helmholtzplatz, a lovely square where, on Sundays, neighborhood folks sell clothes, books, and toys. Then a quick right on Duncker Straße and a left on Letter Straße, following the tree-lined square, until you reach Buchbox! and its outdoor racks with postcards and wooden toys. From there, take Lychener Straße north and turn left on Stargarder Straße to find the Buchhandlung Moby Dick. If instead we had walked east and south from the Wasserturm we would encounter about one block east at the corner of Knaack Straße and Prenzlauer Allee the Mowgwa Antiquariat, a used bookstore with a small English section. Continuing south on Prenzlauer Allee and then going east on Heinrich Roller Straße takes us to the Einar and Bert Theaterbuchhandlung, a sweet corner where, on the right day, you can enjoy your tea and book in a sunny spot overlooking Leise Park.
Admittedly, Prenzlauer Berg, which was formerly in East Berlin, has changed dramatically since the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989: the once dilapidated apartment buildings are festooned with refurbished balconies and terracotta ornamentation, and their marble floors, tile work, and stained glass windows gleam. Coffee shops, yoga studios, organic food joints, and chic boutiques welcome both the local gentry and tourists.
Yet the bookstore is flourishing, when it has all but disappeared in comparable neighborhoods in American cities. In Berlin, the bookstore thrives even in less affluent and more demographically diverse neighborhoods. Two such are Kreuzberg and Neukölln, where a range of booksellers coexist with mosques, döner kebab shops, and Middle Eastern food marts.
What is it about this city? How do the book and the spaces in which it can be held, beheld, smelled, heard and, dare I say it, tasted, continue? Is it rent control? Is it state support? Is it Berlin’s vaunted independent artistic sensibility, emblematized by repeated references to body art and body piercings? Is it Berlin’s exceptional character, its special air, and its sexiness, as in Berlin ist arm, aber sexy? Translation: Berlin is poor but sexy.
Whatever it is, I have been seduced. I have fallen for this city’s intellect, its understated style — or is it studied shabbiness? — and the opportunities it presents to engage with the physicality of the book in a variety of spaces — sleekly modernist, cheerfully colorful, musty and cavelike, or hiply furnished in typical Berlin style with wooden pallets and mid-century modern. The sheer somatic pleasure of letting the eye wander, having it alight on a book, picking it up, feeling its heft, the pliability or resistance of its binding, turning its pages, noticing their typecasting, the sprawl of lines or their compact containment in stanzas, getting a waft of age or crisp newness, finding an inscription, a coffee smear, a tear, underlined text, or marginalia in a brisk hand.
I think it’s telling that the German word for bookstore is Buchhandlung, a compound of the words buch and handlung, the word retaining, unlike the English, the tactility of the operation, and the implication and involvement of the hand, and of the entire body in the act of engaging the book.
Editor’s Note: Tomorrow, we feature Subhashini Kaligotla’s interview with St George’s Bookshop bookstore owner Paul Gurner.

My feeling about Berlin is still very conflicted. The city is full of culture, history and character, and yet, I can’t say that I love it. This surprises me given how many friends have only raved about Berlin. I fully expected to be a Berlin-lover, too. A week before we move onto our next stop, I still feel like we have so much to see. And we do. Even in 3.5 weeks, we haven’t ventured anywhere near all the nooks and crannies we know are worth seeing. One more weekend to make the most of! On the list: Mauerpark, the Pergamon or DDR Museum, graffiti tours, underworld visits, and other recommended bars and haunts.
One thing we have had the privilege of living through is the most recent German elections. I say “living through” lightly as we didn’t vote and honestly didn’t experience much fuss around the city other than some people demonstrating in front of Brandenburg Gate when we biked past it a couple of weeks ago. (Going to go by again this weekend to see what’s brewing now.) As you may know, Angela Merkel won another tenure as Chancellor of Germany but the relatively new far-right party of AfD (Alternative for Germany) garnered a whopping 12.6% of votes, making it Germany’s third largest party and marking the first time in 60 years that a far-right party has entered Parliament.
I won’t make this an in-depth political post, so I’ll pause here to recommend some reading if you’re interested in finding out more about how the AfD came about and some of the tactics it used to make its historical entry into the Bundestag (parliament).
What strikes me is that just last week, I was talking about how Germany’s efforts to remember its history and specifically its mistakes throughout history felt omnipresent throughout Berlin. I mentioned how the country makes a point to honor the victims of its past rather than their perpetrators. And then I read about how the AfD is rebelling against this practice, calling it weak and encouraging Germany to “take a more positive attitude towards its history.”
I had thought this attitude was quite positive already… How many countries are so open about their mistakes and actually make (sometimes unpopular) political decisions that demonstrate it has learned from them? Seeing Germany step up as the European country to accept the most refugees in need of a home at the peak of the refugee crisis in 2015 was a powerful moment for me. My family suffered first-hand from the Holocaust — 3 of my grandparents were in Auschwitz and lost their entire families. I never want any race or religion to suffer the same kind of persecution the Holocaust embodied. It’s not just the Holocaust — genocides in Rwanda and Armenia and Apartheid in South Africa are other recent examples of racism we in hindsight condemn and critique. The American Civil War and fight against slavery may have been over 150 years ago, but we still witness undeniable expressions of racism and rejection in the United States today.
That history is cyclical should not stand as an excuse to let it repeat itself. As I live through the repercussions of the Brexit vote, read about exaggerated travel bans and unsanctioned white nationalist/neo-nazi rallies, watch outspoken discriminating politicians slowly but surely claim more power in the Netherlands, France, Austria, now Germany under the guise of ‘nationalism’ and ‘identity’… I’m terrified kids one or two generations from now will be learning about these events as catalysts towards a larger global conflict I don’t even want to put a name on.
What does nationalism even mean today?
When talking about diversity in Germany with a couple of friends recently, they matter-of-factly stated that for example Russians and Turks are a central part of today’s Germany. You can’t imagine Berlin without kebab stands at every corner, they justly remarked.
The makeup of a country changes over time and what may have been a “pure” (debatable) population centuries ago is now mixed and enriched. To be nationalistic can mean to embrace this growth and diversity, rather than long for a past that alienates new- and otherness. With open economical borders, refugees escaping war-torn areas, broadening spirits and more informed, less fearful constituents, I would hope that European countries (and North American, and Middle Eastern…) choose to welcome and even promote this now globalized reality. Of course, there will always be people clamoring for “the good old days” and yes, some of the old days do have value and a country’s identity and history should also be preserved. I just hope we can work together to find a balance that doesn’t conflate identity with discrimination, and sadly the advancement of the AfD and the shift in its policy since its creation represent an upsetting setback.
I acknowledge this post is by no means a complete political commentary that compares both sides of the argument. It represents a few thoughts and concerns that have been weighing on my mind, and I welcome any comments or feedback to continue the discussion.
In the meantime, I’ll leave you with some of my favorite recent campaigns for acceptance and diversity before I resume my explorations of Berlin:

While moving to Berlin was a dream come true and I could go on about all of the things I love about this hedonistic city, it came with its share of adjustments.
Some were easier to acclimate to as I quickly picked up a new way of doing things. Other things I still struggle with, even after a year of living here.
But at the end of the day, it’s all a part of the adventure. Anyone who picks up their life and moves abroad naturally craves change, newness, and a lifestyle shift. However, despite all of the best intentions and a can-do attitude, some things take longer than others to get used to.
— Want to know the flip side? Check out 20 Things I Love About Living in Berlin — From an American Expat for all the magical and exciting things I love about life in Berlin. —
Over the past year, I’ve noted what I’ve found to be frustrating, confusing, or a royal pain in the ass. Keep reading to learn about the harder, more challenging things for Americans moving to Berlin.
Finding a place to live where you can register your address (or Anmeldung in German) is by far the most challenging experience internationals face early on when moving to Berlin. As one of the most populous cities in Europe with the best nightlife in the world, not to mention the culture, history, and booming startup scene, it’s no wonder people from all over the world flock to Berlin’s gates.
Rent prices have skyrocketed in cities across the world, and it’s no different in Berlin. While it’s more affordable than Paris, London, or Amsterdam, it’s not as cheap as it once was either.
For example, I live in Neukölln where rent used to be extremely low since it was once a risky neighborhood to live in. That is no longer the case. Today, Neukölln’s known for eclectic bars, hipster cafes, music venues, green spaces, and some of the best street food Berlin has to offer. No matter what district you wind up in, finding a suitable place to live can be tricky.
Here are some tips that may help your search:
Just remember, when it comes to finding a flat, it becomes a lot easier once you’ve arrived and have feet on the ground. So, if you’re dealing with the madness of finding a place, getting rejected, and losing sleep over securing a spot before you arrive — take a breath and know it will work out once you get here.
2. Germany’s Cash Culture
The phrase “cash is king” takes on a whole different meaning in Germany. Paying with cash is mandatory at many bars, restaurants, shops, and even doctor’s offices in Berlin. If your purchase is a small one, you almost always have to pay with cash. I once got yelled at by a bartender in Friedrichshain when I didn’t have the cash to pay my tab, muttering “In Germany, we use cash.”
This is not the case in the U.S. or any other country I’ve visited in Europe. As one of the most prosperous and wealthy countries in the E.U., it’s surprising that card payments are frequently not accepted. I’m used to it now and always have some amount of cash on me, but it took time before this felt normal.
3. The Bureaucracy
Similar to my previous point, Germany is still lagging in the digitalization department. All important documents are sent by post. Video calls and emails to get legitimate documents are nonexistent. You have to physically visit the administrative and governmental buildings for anything official.
As a result, the system is backed up and it often takes months before you can schedule an appointment with any official administration. While the system is slowly becoming digitalized, it’s a slow process that was exacerbated at the height of the pandemic.
For example, when you’re registering your address or interviewing for a resident permit, it may take months before you can schedule your appointment. The slots fill up so fast, and you have to wait patiently on your computer, hitting the refresh button repeatedly every morning to see if anything opens up. It’s a major headache, but eventually, you begrudgingly accept that that’s just the way it is. You have to play the game.
4. Everyday Items That Are Only Available at the Pharmacy
Buying rubbing alcohol, skin care, flu medicine, or melatonin can all be bought at any drug store in the States. In Berlin, you have to go to the pharmacy (or Apotheke) for all of these things. This can be frustrating when working around limited hours of operation and dealing with the anxiety about speaking German, or trying to, before asking if the pharmacist speaks English.
Luckily, there are apps, like MAYD, that you can use to order from the pharmacy online and avoid this process altogether if you plan ahead.
5. Hours of Operation Aren’t Always Reliable
You know when you need to visit a store after work so you look up the opening hours on Google beforehand to plan your day? You expect it to be open when you get there before closing time, right? Well, depending on the shop, that doesn’t always go as planned in Berlin.
If the shop is slow and nobody’s walked through the door for a while as the end of the day approaches, shops won’t hesitate to close earlier. This has happened to me on multiple occasions when visiting a copy shop, photo studio, butcher, or bakery. Similar to my point about the lag in digitalization, online hours of operation are more of a suggestion than a rule for many small businesses across Berlin.
6. Learning German is Challenging When Everyone Speaks English
Perhaps a blessing and a curse, most people speak English in Berlin. You can actually get away with never learning German and only speaking English if you really want to. Sure, this helps during the initial transition moving from the U.S. to Berlin. But now, after living here for over a year, the improvement in my German language skills hasn’t grown much.
Whenever I try to practice and communicate in German, most people usually recognize that it’s not my native tongue and switch to English. Yes, this is helpful at times, but all in all, you have to work harder to learn the language than you would have to in a smaller city in Germany.
7. Winter Nights Begin at 3:00 PM
Coming from Florida, a state known for its sunshine and tropical climate, getting used to the winter season was a major adjustment — especially during my first winter. After Daylight Saving Time, it gets dark by 4:30 PM and gradually increases to 3:00 by mid-December. The winters are long, cold, windy, and grey. As a result, seasonal depression affects many people and vitamin D deficiency can easily become a problem.
To combat the dreary winter season, consider investing in a sunlight lamp that emits artificial sunshine. I just got one and it’s already making a huge difference. Now that it’s my second winter here, I’m much more mentally prepared. I already know I’m going to be inside more often, and I try to use this time for working on my goals and projects — like practicing my German.
Thankfully, summers in Berlin are incredible and make the winter season worth waiting out. Just hang on until then and you’ll understand why people rough it through the winter.
8. Understanding the Metric System
If you grow up in the U.S., you use the Imperial System for measurements and the Fahrenheit scale for temperature. Except for a handful of other countries, that’s not the case for the rest of the world where the Metric Scale and Celsius degrees are standard.
I remember the first time I tried to bake a pumpkin pie around Thanksgiving because I was feeling homesick. It took forever as I converted quantities for every ingredient from my mom’s recipe while using a measuring cup with few details. Needless to say, my pie didn’t come out splendidly. It didn’t take long before I got proper measuring utensils that converted cups, ounces, and teaspoons to grams, liters, and milliliters.
It helped to change my phone settings to Celsius degrees early on. While I had to look up the Fahrenheit conversions for a long time, it started making sense after a couple of months. Figuring out the differences becomes second nature with time.
9. Grocery Shopping
Shopping at the grocery store can be a bit intimidating the first time in Germany for several reasons, particularly the lighting speed that cashiers scan your items at the check-out line.
The hardest thing for me was grocery shopping in general translating all the ingredients from German to English. I’d often wander around my local Rewe, Aldi, or Nahkauf for hours before finding everything I needed. In retrospect, it’s probably easier to shop online in the beginning.
On the bright side, it’s good practice to familiarize yourself with the German terms for garlic, cinnamon, vegetables, potatoes, and more early on if you plan on making this country home for a time.
10. Doing Laundry Using a Drying Rack
Flats in Berlin don’t come with dryer machines. Instead, you dry your laundry using a drying rack. I made a mess of things my first time or two hanging my clothes that left noticeable indents and wrinkles. Thankfully, my flatmate was able to correct my technique to avoid this problem in the future. It’s simple once you figure it out. That first time or two, though, was something new.
The other aspect is understanding the German settings on the washer machine. I used the scan image feature on my Google Translate app in the beginning. After that, I could figure out the setting by just going off the time limit, temperature, and spin speed.
Even typing this makes me feel extremely privileged to have always had a dryer. Nonetheless, nobody wants to ruin their clothes doing laundry, and this was still something I had to get used to during the first few weeks of life in another country.
I hope this provides some perspective for anyone searching for a realistic view of some difficulties you may encounter when moving to Berlin or another European country from the U.S.
In comparison, my list of “challenges” is much shorter than the list of things that I love about Berlin. Some of the adjustments, like not having air conditioning or learning your shoe size in European measurements, are so trivial in contrast to all of the experiences and growth I’ve enjoyed since moving abroad. If given the opportunity, I’d make the same decision to move abroad a hundred times over — no questions asked.

Thinking of making Berlin your new home?
Take these things into account for a smoother move.
A “Wahlberlinerin” (Berlin citizen by choice) explains.
Visiting my hometown in Groningen, the Netherlands feels like a breath of fresh air, as if I’m walking through a village. Most pedestrians on the street greet me with a smile and a nod.
It doesn’t work like that in Berlin.
You ignore one another. Some neighbors who accepted my packages in the past and certainly know who I am ignore me in any other setting.
It’s no different when walking on the street. No one greets you, you greet no one. If you do, expect frowns, very confused, or even scared looks.
The temperatures drop to or below zero during the winter months. People get moody, sulky, and the city turns bleak.
The only good thing about Berlin winters from the perspective of a Dutch person: it doesn’t rain…

By John Glab
Berlin is internationally famous for its techno clubs and my visits to Tresor and Berghain upheld the stereotypes: dark spaces with intense flashing light shows, blurred by the occasional smoke screen. Loud, heavy, four-on-the-floor industrial techno rattles the concrete structure of the buildings, as well as the bones of those either dancing in ecstasy or swaying as they try to not to fall over from exhaustion.
But just because the techno scene now lives above ground doesn’t mean the rest of Berlin’s music scene does.
Hidden across the city are many punk and DIY venues that offer a space for a community of musicians to create their own art. In my time in Berlin, I’ve looked at posters taped to walls and light poles, searched names online, and asked around for some places to see a show.
Køpi, a squatting development in Kreuzberg, has a couple spaces for live music performances. I entered through a gate, obscured from street view by some vegetation. Behind it was a courtyard area flanked by the building’s two short wings. Its cracked, concrete facade was well adorned with colorful graffiti murals of contorted human figures, stencil art, and the common message of “kein foto,” no photography allowed.
German Punk Time meant I waited well over an hour for the show to start. In that time, I played a game of pick-up basketball with a few of the people who lived there, trying to avoid splashing in the puddles in the courtyard’s potholes. At Køpi, the line between public and private living spaces feels non-existent.
Koma F, the performance area at Køpi, was down a flight of stairs in a basement. Old bricks, rounded from age, formed arched ceilings in what felt like a former storage space. A crowd of around 30 people — who were well beyond their 20s — fit the punk cliché, dressed in black vests with studs and large boots.
The two bands that played, Shell-Shocked from Berlin and Disturbance from Rotterdam in the Netherlands, both reflected this vintage aesthetic in their music. Shell-Shocked had quick tremolo pickings that droned over blasting d-beats. The band’s vocalist stumbled around the front of the stage, leaning back while screaming into the mic, looking as if he was trying to swallow a sword.
Disturbance was much more straight forward, playing into the punk sentiment of less-is-more. They had a definite Oi! punk sound with frequent gang vocals sung over more classic stylings of simple rock-and-roll songs, but played faster and noisier. This affinity for the past makes sense as Disturbance has been a band since 1995. Perhaps you can critique them for never evolving, or holding onto the past too hard even from the beginning, but they were still entertaining enough for the people who came to see them.
The other venue I went to was OGH, located somewhere in the sprawling southern neighborhood of Neukölln. The entrance was tucked in an alleyway. Beyond the door, a stairwell splotched with graffiti and posters led up to the fourth floor of the warehouse space. There, the stage stood at the front of what looked like a former office area. In the backhalf of the space, people sat and talked between sets at a bar and lounge area. Large windows lined the entire wall of the venue, where many people looked out over the alleyway at surrounding apartment blocks.
The show at OGH followed a more post-punk garage sound, without the aggressiveness of hardcore. The bands were Dackelkontakt from Potsdam, Fantuzzi in Berlin, and Teo Wise, an Italian living in Leipzig. About 50 people filled the space. Dackelkontakt went first, sitting behind a small synth array set on a repurposed ironing board. They played fast, peppy, synthpunk tracks with a bit of added whimsy from the little squeals of a theremin. Often songs would pause for brief spoken word parts, traded off between members, including at the climax of their set when two of the band members quickly and aggravatedly talked over each other for about 30 seconds before falling into the last riff.
At the end, Teo Wise performed his light but robust punk tracks. Together with the other members of his band, they mastered the balance of playing locked-in and succinct while effecting a sprawling free spirit that gave the music so much livid personality. Wise’s set moved the audience into an ecstatic dance, with shoes slipping across a sweat slicked concrete floor.Most enthralling was that everyone danced together. There were no imposed boundaries as people whirled around each other, one person making contact with another’s psyche, before turning to the next, until there was a point of connection between everyone in the room. Theboundaries of the individual became invisible.
After the set, people lingered in the fourth-floor warehouse loft for well over an hour. They were simply talking, making new acquaintances, and building on the commonalities they had found during the performance. Whether it be two people just passing through the city, or someone finding a new community, these moments define life and cannot be manufactured. In Berlin, they can still be found in DIY spaces — if you just know where to look.

Note: Most of these are around Prenzlauer Berg/Mitte because I would be the last person to travel across the city for a workout.
I was born without a single athletic bone in my body, and I was okay with it until I moved to Germany. Why do Germans love Sport machen so much?! I began to feel the FOMO shortly after moving here. I tried going to the gym and also doing YouTube workouts- but turns out I am bad at consistency unless there is a later cancellation fee on the horizon. Luckily, the company I work at presented me with a discounted Urban Sports Club membership and so I was able to also mache Sport and discover my favourite studios/workout classes.
If you are a party person (I am not), you’ve definitely heard of Club Athleten’s CLUB BOXING classes. These are a mix of boxing and HIIT workouts, paired with a techno soundtrack and super groovy studios. But if you’re looking to build your booty, ASS ASS ASS is my favourite class at Club Athleten. They’ve got a bunch of workouts to choose from, and regardless of which on you choose, it’ll feel like a party!
If you’re on that clean girl or pilates girlie vibe, then a barre class is exactly what you need. Barre is mixture of pilates, yoga, ballet and strength training and will definitely leave the studio feeling the burn. Feel the Barre has some of the most attentive instructors who will make sure you’ve got the correct form. My favourite class is the BarreSIGNATURE- this gives you a taster of all of the classes they offer, that focus on different areas (core, strength, cardio, etc).
BEAT81 is another Berlin classic and I think it’s for the people that love an extreme workout (or maybe I am just that unfit). BEAT81 will push you to new lengths when it comes to cardio and strength training, as well as indoor cycling. What makes it more fun is the heartrate trackers you wear during the workouts, and you can track your progress on a screen. My favourite class at BEAT81 was the Strength class- which they describe as low on cardio but it still killed me (in the best way).
Despite having grown up in India, I was never someone who did yoga, except when I was forced to at school. However, because I grew up in India and have experienced real yoga, I am a snob when it comes to yoga instructors. To my delight, Yogic Escape offers that exact authentic Yoga experience. It is Indian owned, and all the instructors I’ve had so far have been great. I cannot recommend the Yoga for Beginners class enough. The class size is quite small so your form will be corrected and you will be pushed, but you will leave feeling lighter and stronger.
Yeah Studio offers a range of Pilates, Barre and Yoga classes, as well as teacher trainings. I love the Barre45 class by Tanja, and the Yobarre class too. Both classes use various props to elevate your workout and all the instructors are super motivating. There’s always a friendly community feeling as well.
Every week when I walk into Rocycle, I feel boujee and part of something exclusive- so you best believe I never skip a Rocycle class. Rocycle, on paper is a spin class but in reality is so much more. Not only does it incorporate some ab exercises and weights (all while on the bike), it is a great way to put away all your screens and forget about everything on the outside for 45 mins. A dark room, loud music, choreohraphy and a motivating instructor is really a great combination for a fun and effective workout.
Ride and Rocycle have the same concept and I would say they are equally good. The bonus with Ride is that you can book a class based on the type of music you like working out to. The closest studio to me is also smaller than the Rocycle one and it feels like the employees and regulars know each other well which is super cute.
Boaré is another one of my local studios that offers a variety of Pilates, Yoga, and Meditation classes. I enjoy their Pilates selection, as everyone class I have taken has left my legs SHAKING. I also tried a Sound Healing here and it left feeling ever so relaxed.
If the clean girl aesthetic was a studio, then this would be it. I have only taken classes at the Prenzlauer Berg studio, but all of their studios look equally beautiful. Hale.Now offers a range of Yoga, Pilates, Barre, Meditation and Sound Healing classes. I live for their Pilates Sculpt class (which literally books out instantly on Urban Sports). Their signature class is called Female Strength and it’s next on my list to try out.

(Author’s note: A German version of this article was published in Berlin’s “Der Tagesspiegel” newspaper on March 15, 2025)
It didn’t matter if the neighbors looked on disapprovingly. The New Year had arrived, and spring began with a large fire that we, as children, would jump over for what felt like hours to leave behind the evil spirits of the past year. The scent of saffron rice and grilled fish. The loud music surrounded us and the families of my father’s Persian friends who visited each other, greeting with kisses and embraces. Whenever I remember the Persian New Year celebrations I experienced in West Berlin during the 1980s, I’m filled with a warm, hopeful feeling. Back then, I didn’t understand how much more this festival must have meant during that time, amid a terrible war between Iraq and Iran that lasted nearly a decade and resulted in half a million casualties. A celebration amid a German society that was still firmly convinced it was not yet open to immigrants and what they could contribute. For my dad and his friends, the celebration was a piece of home helping them feel more at home in a foreign land.
Only years later did I learn how widespread the tradition of this New Year’s festival is. According to UNESCO, “It has been celebrated by more than 300 million people for over 3,000 years in the Balkan Peninsula, the Black Sea region, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Middle East.” The festival’s observance traces back to the Zoroastrian ancestors of today’s Iranian people. Since 2009, the UN has even included Nouruz in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
When I would return to my Berlin school on Mondays after the festival, there was no mention of the Persian New Year. Only Christmas, Easter, and New Year’s Eve existed. Once, in 12th grade, our English teacher asked about our backgrounds and our parents. I remember it clearly because it was such an unusual experience. She wanted to know if we, as children of immigrants, felt any particular conflict. The only thing I felt were the glances of my classmates, which led me to give an evasive answer. The meaning and power of the New Year’s festival thus remained hidden from her and the rest of the teachers and students.
For example, the story of Kaveh the Blacksmith, who plays an important role in Ferdowsi’s famous Book of Kings. According to legend, Kaveh led an Iranian uprising against a cruel, child-devouring dragon king. This symbolism of resistance against oppression has led authoritarian governments to attempt to ban the festival over the years repeatedly. However, the most important meaning of the festival is the awakening of nature to new life in spring, the victory of light over darkness, and of knowledge over ignorance.
When I speak with my friends in Berlin every weekend, it becomes increasingly clear to me how important it is to celebrate the Persian New Year and remember its message, especially this year. For weeks, I’ve been hearing much about the challenges originating in Moscow and here in Washington, D.C., and the increasingly difficult political and economic situation for Germany and Europe. Even during the pandemic, I didn’t perceive this much fear and uncertainty about the situation.
Next week, I will tell the children at my daughter’s elementary school in Washington, D.C. about the Persian New Year. There are some children there who are directly affected by their parents’ dismissals by the Trump administration. There are flyers preparing for the possible removal of children of illegal immigrants at the school. The teacher invited me at my daughter’s request, who had so enjoyed the presentation of the Indian Festival of Lights, Diwali, in the fall by a mother of Indian descent. I will tell them about the great New Year’s festival and its message that we will celebrate with friends and neighbors. With a fire that many in the city will jump over to rid themselves of the evil spirits of the past year. And about how for me, the festival is also a piece of memory of Berlin and a home that I gladly share with all who currently need more confidence and community.

Germany is the 4th largest economy in the world as of this writing. Berlin is the capital of Germany. After the Brexit, Berlin became the biggest tech center in Europe. 1000s of new opportunities are created daily for tech-related jobs here in Berlin. From Meta and Amazon, there are a lot of tech companies out there here.
Software engineering in Germany is mostly driven by new technologies and practices. Generally, companies don’t have many QA engineers, so the quality of the output solely lies on the engineer who builds it. As per my understanding, the most popular programming languages are Java, JavaScript, and Go, and knowing Kotlin, Scala, or typescript on top of these might help.
German is the main language in Germany, but as Berlin is a multicultural city you can get by with English just fine. Berlin has a welcoming atmosphere and the community here is open and inclusive. Berlin has a rich history which you can spend time with. There are a lot of parks you can take an evening stroll. Veganism is high and nigh. Berlin is a hotspot food scene & partying hard (Really, they have 36-hour-long parties). It is nice for families as well because healthcare and education are free
As I can see, there are two ways for you to get hired and move to Berlin.
Tech companies in Berlin offer generous relocation packages. These packages can be varied from one-time lump-sum payments to fully assisted relocation support with a relocation agent. These relocation packages are made to ease the pressure on moving to a new country. In most scenarios companies are willing to relocate the entire family. For reference, I have seen relocation budgets vary from 2.500 euros to 10.000 euros
Another important factor to consider is the salary. For Visa reasons, you should at least get paid 56.400 euros per annum. More on this later.
If you are in tech and if you’re planning a move to Berlin (or any other German city such as Munich or Cologne), the following can be helpful in securing an interview.
Clean up your Linkedin profile
Linkedin is going to be the medium for you to make the first contact with your future employer in Germany. Make sure you have cleaned up your Linkedin and that it is up to date. Add the necessary skills you have to your LinkedIn Skills section. Get your skills endorsed to help the LinkedIn algorithm to present you as a candidate to recruiters.Have a look at the following LinkedIn accounts. None of them are perfect but they can be good pointers.https://www.linkedin.com/in/dinanjana-gunaratne-800573a8https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathiesha-maddage-48710096/
Take skill quizzes
These are not necessary but they are sure to be a fun experience. This is what LinkedIn has to say about it.
“It’s not mandatory for you to take the assessment. However, taking the assessment will help you stand out by showcasing that you have the desired skills of an ideal candidate, as well as increase your chances of getting noticed by other recruiters.”
Follow companies
Follow German tech companies on LinkedIn. You will be automatically notified if they post any job postings on LinkedIn
Build your connections
Building connections is necessary on LinkedIn. Add recruiters and HR people from companies you like for better reachability.
Make yourself “open to work”
In your profile, you have the option to make yourself open to working. LinkedIn says if you make yourself available it will try to make it invisible to the current company you’re employed. You can edit your job preferences from there. It will look like following
By now your LinkedIn profile is good to go. As mentioned earlier there are 2 ways for you to apply for a job. But at this point in time, LinkedIn lacks filtering job opportunities with relocation support (Correct me if I am wrong). The only way to get around it is to go through the entire job posting to see if they give relocation support. That is where recruiters come in.Since they are reaching out to you instead of the other way around, you’re bound to get a good deal. Technical recruiters may apply for one or multiple companies on your behalf. Be prepared, some technical recruiters may ask a few technical questions.
Now it comes to your CV.
Your CV shouldn’t exceed 2 pages. When making your CV follow the general guidelines. When describing the projects you did, use the XYZ format. It says you achieved X which is measured by Y by applying Z. An example of this would be “Reduced production incidents by 50% QoQ by analyzing 10 root causes out of 30 production incidents in Q3. More information on this can be found below”https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/google-recruiters-say-these-5-resume-tips-including-x-y-z-formula-will-improve-your-odds-of-getting-hired-at-google.htmlIt is important to spend some time improving your CV. After all, your CV is the one that does the talking.
By this point, you’re ready to make first contact with potential employers. If you haven’t received any messages from recruiters yet it is time for you to make the first move.
At this point, you have 2 options1. Reach out to connections who are working in companies in Berlin2. Directly applying from the careers pages of companies
Both options are good, but sometimes your application gets prioritized if it comes through as an internal referral. And for you, don’t be shy to reach out to a friend or a connection, as an internal referral most of the time pays the referrer for the successful referral.
This has already gone longer than I expected, so I will stop from here and will do a follow-up writing on addressing how interviews are performed here and about the Visa process. As a parting gift, I will add a list of companies that provide relocation support for tech jobs as per my knowledge.
See you on Part-2 :)

At first, just like any city, Berlin is full of strange faces and smells, the traffic sounds like most city noise, the streets full of tempting offers, doorways that lead into dark passages and cellars, and the next corner with its posted signs suggesting that you walk this way, or that way to discover a new experience, can make you feel as if a good weekend stay is ahead of you. But when your friend, whom you came to visit, takes you by the hand and leads you away from the shops, and into the real Berlin city, you may just, if lucky, begin to feel the magic of a city that holds secrets and temptations that have been the cause of some many a nomad to stop and become a villager, to settle and give up wandering through the world.
A visit to the hot spots of town where you can drink, dance, and meet all sorts in one night, becomes an introduction to a city that clearly offers everything for any taste.
To see the malls and the boulevards of Berlin that connect the present with the past. The old streets that…

The Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG) — Berlin’s citywide public transportation system — boasts an sprawling web of trains running with cold, calculated efficiency. A moment’s tardiness leaves your arms struggling to stretch the closing doors. A Google search reveals a link to its website, which bears the slogan: “Because we love you.”
Evidently, this love only applies to the native and the lucky. As with any bureaucratic bunch, alas, the company’s true love remains the almighty Rulebook. German culture in general reveres tradition, so the guidelines of their businesses prove tighter to squeeze through than their departing train doors.
When I arrived in Berlin after 16 restless hours of international travel, I scoured the BVG ticket dispenser for the student option. I was desperate to end the day, but both I and my travel organizers had done our research. The website listed the 61 Euro “Ausbildung” (“education”) ticket as the one for students and nowhere did it state any specification beyond possessing a student card, so I bought the ticket and left.
A week passed. I grew infatuated with Berlin, its cosmopolitanism broadening my perspective on what a big city could be. Worried that if I didn’t lower my gaze from the high rises to my laptop I might miss my deadlines, I ventured off to the nearest U-Bahn station, aiming to write at a local café.
I boarded a U-Bahn remarkably devoid of people. Over that last week alone, I’d shared more physical intimacy with fellow train-riders than in many long-term friendships, so any room to breathe was precious.
The second a BVG officer boarded, however, all air left the train car. A heavyset, bald man, clearly born for this role, he bore a black vest thicker than any soldier’s. Beneath this riot gear he wore a black T-shirt, with the skull logo of Marvel Comics character The Punisher imprinted on its sleeve.
I was sure that I had no reason for concern. As the train left the station, he whipped out his scanner, demanding that all passengers present their tickets. A few good citizens later, he reached me, scanned my ticket, and stared me down.
“Let me see your student ID,” he said. I obliged. Staring at the UC Santa Barbara logo, he remarked: “This is not the ticket.” Confused, I emphasized that I was indeed a student studying here. Shaking his head, he replied: “You will get off with me.” As he turned to continue scanning, I made nervous eye contact with The Punisher’s skull.
Stepping off, I found my pitiful German akin to a fist in a gunfight. He claimed my ticket was solely “for job education” and set me an appointment to pay it the next day. Having conveniently reached my stop, I hobbled off, defeated, to the coffee shop.
The next day, I trekked over to the BVG headquarters for my appointment, with Vanessa — my trip-appointed German translator and true hero — by my side. The front of the building, complete with LGBTQ+ rainbow colors displayed, seemed inviting enough. Quickly, however, we were directed to a crude little crevice in the building’s back corner.
A bouncer-type at the BVG customer office bellowed orders from the front door. We sat together, awaiting our turn. I expressed confidence in our success.
Okay, you absolutely shouldn’t judge a book by its cover. But when I tell you my confidence melted the second I saw the man behind the counter, please let me off this one time. His eyes teemed with dissatisfaction. Mercy was not in this man’s vocabulary — nor was any English. Funny how this was the only place in Berlin I’ve been where no one has spoken English.
Vanessa fought valiantly, but it was a losing battle. The facts of the story — I am a student studying in Berlin and I had bought a ticket at the student ticket price — meant nothing to this man. “You wouldn’t go to Thailand and use your student ID to buy a ticket there,” he repeated. I am neither sure why that’s something I wouldn’t do, nor what his focus on Thailand was about. But we were chipping away at stone.
“You cannot buy this ticket as a foreigner,” he said. We emphasized that nowhere did the website specify this. “Go online and write a complaint,” he responded.
Vanessa looked at me sympathetically. I sighed, knowing the war was lost, and paid the fine. The 60 Euros aside, I felt robbed of the wide-eyed earnestness I’d brought in my suitcase. There was something potent in that initial Berlin buzz, the excitement of believing this new place might be better than back home. But now I felt disillusioned.
Make no mistake, I’m still loving my time in Berlin. You could spend weeks peeling back this city’s layers — the boundless events and different cultures it hosts — and still never find the end. Any place this large and bustling needs a public transit system, so one must deal with the BVG. Still, I wanted to issue this warning, just in case The Punisher tries to track you down.
Go online and write a complaint, huh?
Fine, man. Here it is, for the entire world to read.

This is drawn from my recent bestselling book on heroes (cue Bowie) who dug escape tunnels under the Wall, The Tunnels: Escapes Under the Berlin Wall and the Historic Films the JFK White House Tried to Kill. Part of Bruce’s performance, and remarks, via link below. I would attend an epic Springsteen concert in Berlin almost 30 years later.
https://youtu.be/WBIcfPBVxxQ
On this date in 1961 the Berlin Wall started rising overnight (first as mere barbed wire) dividing East and West for almost three decades. The fall of the Berlin Wall, 28 long and deadly years later, has been attributed to lots of things, from Mikhail Gorbachev’s reforms and Ronald Reagan’s famous plea to the ineptitude of the Politburo and the collective courage of the East German protesters. But there’s little doubt that David Bowie and Bruce Springsteen did their own — if small — part.
When Bowie died several years ago, the German Foreign Office noted as much in a memorial tweet: “Good-bye, David Bowie. You are now among #Heroes. Thank you for helping to bring down the #wall.” For Springsteen’s role, you can read the 2013 book Rocking the Wall: Bruce Springsteen — The Berlin Concert That Changed the World. But Springsteen’s memoir, Born to Run, offers his full account of that epic concert for the first time.
Many Americans are surprised to learn that our rock stars were even allowed to play in East Germany while the wall, constructed in 1961, remained in place. But Communist Party leaders, noting the tremendous buildup of anger and tension among their young people during the Gorbachev “glasnost” era, decided to provide a safety valve of sorts by allowing major rock concerts starting in 1987. Tens of thousands of East German kids were already flocking to the wall to listen as Bowie and others played just on the other side — and there had been clashes between the music-starved youth and East German police.
Bowie’s June 1987 performance was remarkable on several levels. The stage was set up in West Berlin, very close to the wall, with the old Reichstag building as a backdrop. Unlike most Western performers, he had a fitting song for the occasion: “Heroes,” written a few years earlier and purportedly inspired by Bowie’s time living in Berlin. The line about standing by the wall while “the guns shot above our heads” may refer to dramatic attempts by East Germans to escape the East — which happens to be the subject of my book, The Tunnels: Escapes Under the Berlin Wall and the Historic Films the JFK White House Tried to Kill. (You can watch part of Bowie’s performance that day below.)
https://youtu.be/FdykmbbaZI8
And here, from a 2003 interview, is how he described it:
It was one of the most emotional performances I’ve ever done. I was in tears…And there were thousands on the other side that had come close to the wall. So it was like a double concert where the wall was the division. And we would hear them cheering and singing along from the other side. God, even now I get choked up. When we did “Heroes” it really felt anthemic, almost like a prayer. However well we do it these days, it’s almost like walking through it compared to that night, because it meant so much more. That’s the town where it was written, and that’s the particular situation that it was written about.
By then, Bob Dylan had been invited by a youth arm of the Communist Party to play in Treptower Park in the East on September 17, 1987, along with touring mates Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and Roger McGuinn. Protests were building against the regime and the wall, and East German officials hoped to defuse tensions with a few signs of openness.
The Stasi didn’t seem too worried that Dylan, then in a down period in his career, would prove to be a rabble-rouser.
Naturally, the Stasi (East Germany’s notorious secret police) were on top of it. Their six-page preview was filed at their headquarters under “Robert Zimmerman, No. HA XX 17578.” It mainly covered logistics and security — no secret bugging of Dylan, apparently — and the dispersal of 81,000 tickets, with at least one-third going to party officials and their pals. The Stasi didn’t seem too worried that Dylan, then in a down period in his career, would prove to be a rabble-rouser, as he was merely “an old master of rock” with no particular “resonance” with the youth of the day. The crowd, they predicted, would be mostly middle-aged and older. Dylan would act in a “disciplined” way and not cause undo “emotions.”
In the end, the gig played out pretty much as the Stasi had anticipated. By most accounts, Dylan — whose lyrical work just earned him the 2016 Nobel Prize for literature — gave a rather lackluster performance (his norm for the time), consisting of a couple of Christian tunes mixed in with hits like “Blowin’ in the Wind,” “Rainy Day Women” and “Like a Rolling Stone.” He reportedly did not speak a single word from the stage.
This was not the case with Springsteen, who arrived in East Berlin 10 months later to play his biggest concert ever. More than 200,000 showed up, twice what Dylan had attracted. Springsteen opened, pointedly, with “Badlands,” but the indisputable highlight was his cover of “Chimes of Freedom,” a Dylan tune that Dylan himself had overlooked. The show, which in typical Springsteen style lasted nearly four hours, was beamed to millions of East Germans via state television. Many middle-aged Germans I interviewed for my book fondly recalled attending the performance or watching it on TV. “It was a nail in the coffin for East Germany,” one fan told the Guardian years later.
In Born to Run, Springsteen recounts a previous visit to East Berlin with bandmate Steve Van Zandt. “You could feel the boot,” he recalls. The wall, in Springsteen’s view, seemed almost “pornographic.” The experience helped shock the then-apolitical Van Zandt into decades of activism. “The power of the wall that split the world in two, its blunt, ugly, mesmerizing realness, couldn’t be underestimated,” Springsteen writes. “It was an offense to humanity.”
When Springsteen returned to East Berlin for his epic 1988 show, as I note in my own book, he unhappily discovered that the state was billing it as a “concert for the Sandinistas,” the pro-Communist Nicaraguans. So he delivered an impassioned speech. His German was grade-school level, but he got the point across: “I’m not here for any government. I’ve come to play rock and roll for you in the hope that one day all the barriers will be torn down.” East German officials backstage had somehow learned about Bruce’s original statement, which included the explosive word “walls,” and Springsteen’s manager, Jon Landau, had convinced him at the last minute to change it to “barriers.” But after finishing his statement, Springsteen quickly launched into “Chimes of Freedom,” which includes the key reference: “while the walls were tightening.” (See video up top which includes his remarks, then the song.)
The next day, he and the band “partied” at the East Berlin consulate, Springsteen writes, before heading back to the West to play a show for a mere 17,000 people — which “felt a lot less dramatic than what we’d just experienced.” Referring to the “stakes” of rock and roll, he writes, “The higher they’re pushed, the deeper and more thrilling the moment becomes. In East Germany in 1988, the center of the table was loaded down with a winner-take-all bounty that would explode into the liberating destruction of the Berlin Wall by the people.”
German historian Gerd Dietrich would later tell Rocking the Wall author Erik Kirschbaum, “Springsteen’s concert and speech certainly contributed in a large sense to the events leading up to the fall of the wall. It made people more eager for more and more change,” he said. “Springsteen aroused a greater interest in the West. It showed people how locked up they really were.”
As Springsteen himself would later put it, “Once in a while you play a place, you play a show that ends up staying inside of you, living with you for the rest of your life. East Berlin in 1988 was certainly one of them.”

So I’m really interested in the climate tech space and especially how AI/ML can be applied to help make the world sustainable.
In particular I found the Climate Change AI (CCAI) paper has a great taxonomy to start thinking about areas AI/ML applies to the climate tech world. However it does not offer a lot of on-the-ground examples of real startups working in the space. I was also unable to find a really satisfactory list anywhere online so I decided to make my own:
The current mapping is built an underlying dataset I built and have published publicly below. It’s an aggregation of the following sources: (Dealroom, Climate-KIC’s alumni page, PwC’s report on state of Climate Tech 2020, Angel List jobs board, this article from Tech Founders, this one from EU-Startups, and this one from MTC, as well as some conversations from the Work on Climate Slack and my own personal knowledge.
This is by no means an exhaustive mapping, but I do think it is currently the most comprehensive list for Berlin. However if there are any companies I’ve missed and you think should be added, I’d be really happy to hear from you.
As mentioned above, the CCAI paper has a great taxonomy which I used to start thinking about areas AI/ML applies to the climate tech world:
I did the categorization manually for both domain and subdomain, as the number of companies was still relatively small and I was interested in researching each organization individually.
I also added an additional boolean field ‘AI/ML’ in the data for companies who specifically mentioned using Machine Learning in their venture.
The climate tech space in Berlin is growing fast and it's exciting to see so many new companies and founders joining the space.
I hope to maintain and update this market map as the space grows and hopefully to expand to other areas in the EU (see, London). I’d also like to run some analysis on the dataset as it grows to understand some of the key trends emerging in this space.
In the meantime, feel free to reach out if you have any questions or comments.

This post is describing the best photography spots in Berlin. Most importantly these are not touristy places but the best for fine art and portrait photography. I do not mention such places as Brandenburger Tor or East-Side Gallery because it’s an author’s blog and I don’t try to make another copy-paste post about some landmarks of Berlin. I also work as a portrait photographer in Berlin and tried them out myself. If you search for unusual and interesting places to take pictures — this is the right place!
Hopefully, there are quite some photography lovers in Berlin who are also using Medium.
I will always update this list with the best photography spots in Berlin when I find new ones.
If you are coming from outside this platform and would like to read my articles for free you can also subscribe to my blog here
These are only my opinion on which locations are working well, but, of course, the photographer defines how the pictures will look like and not the locations.
I would say of course there’s no perfect place for photography, each photography project requires a different atmosphere, but yet some areas have a lot to offer while others are more generic. This post will be for mid-range pictures and photographers who prefer lenses between 35–70mm. It’s best to use prime lenses for learning photography. I would…

At 65, Mushtaq is full of energy. He listens to audiobooks while painting his next masterpiece, trades the city for a lake or forest at noon, laughs with his entire body and if needed, climbs up the roof of a four story building and breaks into his own apartment through the skylight of a lofty ceiling.
My eyes widened when my host welcomed me into his house. His apartment was packed with works of art. I was thrilled to find out he’s a painter — a real life incarnation of what I wanted to become as a kid. We plunged into an hour long conversation before I even went to see my room.
Our connection grew stronger when Mushtaq mentioned his distant past in Bombay. All the way from my home in Bucharest to his doorstep in Berlin I had been listening to, and absorbed by, Shantaram–a captivating novel taking place in Bombay.
As if the coincidence wasn’t enough, he then says that he not only read the book but even made a painting about it. What? An amazing painting about the book I paused listening to when he greeted me. My short stay at his place was on to a good start.
I came to Berlin to search for a place here. Why Berlin? The question everybody asks. My answer is an even shorter question: Why not? As much as Berlin has to offer, I came here simply to be somewhere else. And so my quest to live abroad begins, until the new place no longer feels “abroad”. What follows after, I’m as curious to find out as anybody asking.
Berlin really does have a lot to offer. Searching for apartments, I mapped at least five neighborhoods by foot. Like a good movie trailer, I caught many glimpses of interesting places–streets, buildings and parks unattached to a story yet, which I’m sure will return to me later as part of a cohesive picture.
For now, I’ll be roaming in Berlin.
This is my first attempt to write a travel journal. Like my trips, it has no clear direction, but I have a good feeling about it and I’m curious to see it unfold. Posts will be brief, disconnected and flooded with photos. My story might feel distant if we haven’t met, but you–just by reading it–are part of it and you’re welcome to say hello.

Coming June, we’ll have completed two years in Berlin. And let me tell you this: Berlin is not the easiest city to love at first. There, I’ve said it upfront.
When I first moved to Berlin, I didn’t get it. I had moved from Luxembourg, a rich-people’s rich country with rich-looking houses and squeaky-clean streets. Even the air there tasted rich. Compared to that, Berlin felt… rough around the edges. Littered roads, worn-out buildings, and unsmiling faces with austere eyes. A month in, and I was less than dazzled by the city. Nothing quite felt quaint, classic European about it — not the homes, not the streets, not the people, nothing. And this was when we lived in the allegedly prettier, greener, cleaner part of the city. For a while, I sulked like a brat refusing to eat lunch because they didn’t like what was served. But after a few months of indifference, boredom made me curious about what all the fuss was about Berlin being ‘so cool, so amazing, such a vibe’. And, boy, was I surprised!
Cut to a year later:
The more I wandered through Berlin’s history, art and subcultures, the more I read about its history, the more I witnessed its evidence pulsing at every turn (and underground), the more I submitted to its quirks and contradictions, the more the city grew on me.
This is, however, not a list of the historical and cultural milestones of the city, Google’s got that covered. This is about a weirdly funny realisation that crept up on me as I went about befriending the city.
The realisation? Berlin is a Scorpio, through and through: intense, magnetic, often misunderstood.
If I had to describe Berlin in five words, they’d be: Wall. Underground. Non-conformist. Creative. Transforming — each, a reflection of Scorpio’s soul.
Here’s why I think so.
The Berlin we know today rose from the ashes of Cold War destruction; the city quite literally rebuilt itself from ruins. Much like the Scorpio’s strength that lies in its unwavering resilience in the face of adversities to emerge victorious, Berlin’s greatest triumph is its inspiring story of resurrection. That Scorpio-spirit of reinvention pulses through daily life and subcultures: fashion that is not luxury but lived-in-cool; vintage, thrifting, and second-hand culture; abandoned spaces and empty lots upscaled into clubs, flea markets, event hubs, galleries, community gardens, and other breathing ecosystems, all without erasing their past. The city’s reinvention, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the city’s diverse subcultures mirror the Scorpio lifecycle: death, rebirth, and transformation.
This rebirth was not a one-shot event; it was a slow-burning movement that simmered through the 1970s and 80s in the abandoned factories and shunned industrial underbelly of the city. During these decades of secret underground rebellion against the Soviets emerged a palpable flood of creativity — punk, techno, dark comedy, graffiti, alternative museums — all forms of raw, unapologetic expression.
Unlike many other underground subcultures that eventually succumbed to the mainstream, Berlin has fiercely protected its exclusive, elusive and effervescent aura — a classic Scorpio move. The city is not trying to be seen. The city is not trying to impress. It chooses what to reveal, channeling mystery, secrecy, and that unmistakable magnetic pull of a Scorpio.
This night crawler lurks in plain sight, unleashing its passion and poison after the dark — much like the city’s nightlife and club culture. You know what they say about a Scorpio? Even when they’re incognito, you feel them. Same with Berlin.
If underground is one definition of Berlin, unconventional is the other. A city where weird is normal and kinky is loved, where vanilla is boring and edgy is celebrated, Berlin openly embraces what others may turn away from: the grey skies, the black moods, and even their dark history. Here, fashion is not the classic European chic; here, fashion has no rules and no boundaries. Sexy or minimalistic, both are welcome with zero judgement. In fact, goth is Berlin’s gospel and black, a no-nonsense dress code that the city loyalists swear by.
In essence, if counter-culture had a face, Berlin would be the poster child. This non-conformist vibe, however, is not a sign of smugness or arrogance. In fact, the city is not trying to please, it is simply comfortable being its honest self. Unapologetically unpretentious, often misunderstood — that’s Berlin. That’s Scorpio.
An interesting fact: beneath a Scorpio’s calm exterior is relentless desire for personal transformation and self-discovery — much like Berlin’s pulsating creative industry that is home to several cultural entrepreneurs, international artists, and media and entertainment companies. The city boasts a creative diversity few others can match. In Berlin, even when you’re alone, you’re never truly lonely. It blooms and booms with a plethora of passions: from pottery to poetry, hiking to pilates, stand-up comedy to gender fluidity, fetish and BDSM to role-play, drag to queer cabaret. There’s something for everyone here. Berlin knows no bounds when it comes to exploring emotional needs, a spirit that resonates deeply with the passionate and emotionally intense Scorpio.
Today, a part of the Berlin Wall remain, standing proud as a symbol of courage, creativity, and hope. Despite the unification of ideologies between East and West, a beautiful contradiction continues to exist in Berlin. Here, punk, goth, and kink co-exist with healing and mindfulness practices like yoga and breath-work, dance collectives, and gong baths. Here, edgy street culture blends with literature and intellectualism (you could literally meet a tattooed person in a hoodie in a bar and later learn that they’re working on a PhD). Berlin is as much about pride parades, climate protests, and anti-fascist graffiti, as it is about Prinzessinnengarten and community gardening workshops focused on rebuilding and nurturing. This is a city that supports radical, divergent fluidity, yet at same time converges like a moody monotonous canvas of black fashion and grey skies.
And finally, as journalist Emily Schultheis puts it: “Germans are increasingly debating how to balance their country’s collective responsibility for the past with a sense of national pride in the country’s achievements and culture.”
The contradictions — fiercely private vs. burning the dance floor, deeply emotional vs. capable of profound detachment, outwardly calm vs. fervent on the inside, constantly transforming and reinventing — all are quintessential Scorpio traits that Berlin embodies.
So, yes, Berlin may not have been the easiest city for me to love at first. The poignant history and lyrical culture aside, it comes with challenges that can feel monumentally frustrating in everyday life. Unless you are into — or open to exploring — the niche, alternative universe Berlin offers, you may not really get to taste the spicy flavour that makes Berlin uniquely Berlin. And without its one-of-a-kind charm, the city might feel like something you’ve already experienced elsewhere in Europe.
For me, the key to falling for Berlin was staying open, just like you would with a Scorpio: peeling back its layers of the unexpected, while also discovering everything else that makes it special — the food, the history, the warm summers, the lake-side picnics, the beautiful libraries, the green spaces, the inclusivity, the hundreds of fun things to do — all of which more than make up for some of the things I may never get to experience.
To me, this city is not all about fairytales; it is a dark romance. And that’s okay. Because Berlin is also a city with undeniably unique character. It is not classically beautiful, but it owns its scars. It does not always feel warm and welcoming, but it lets you be whoever you want with absolute acceptance. And once you learn to enjoy its many shades, it keeps you captivated.
The thing is, falling in love — and staying in love — with the complex, contradictory, beautiful chaos of a Scorpio takes time, patience, understanding, and a whole lot of emotional investment. And it’s absolutely worth it. Just like Berlin.

It is the spring of 2003, midway through my first year in graduate school, and my friend Nathan had earlier that day acquired a used vinyl copy of David Bowie’s Station to Station from Amoeba Music. Some months later, we are driving down Sunset Boulevard listening to the song “Negativland” from Neu!’s 1972 debut album. Again, an ominous quasi-industrial noise, something like a jackhammer, leads off the track. Again, a muffled guitar squeals in the background, defiantly on its own trip as Michael Rother’s plodding baseline and Klaus Dinger’s motorik-beat propel the song forward. Again I explain, “This is the sound of postmodernism. . .”
Julian Knox, David Bowie and Romanticism, pp. 117–118
Bowie’s Berlin period is both famous and misunderstood. Well before the end of 1976 Bowie’s cocaine addiction had led him in and out of psychosis, dropped him to 90 lbs. on a diet of peppers and milk, and pushed him to the point of death. He knew he had to leave the United States and its easy availability of drugs just to save his life. In late 1976, he and his wife Angie moved to Switzerland, where they purchased a house. The couple was largely estranged by this point, alternating their time spent in the house rather than living together, and Bowie eventually moved to Berlin to share an apartment with Iggy Pop, whose career was floundering after the breakup of the Stooges.
Check out the iTunes playlist for David Bowie and Romanticism.
Bowie’s work after moving to Europe included co-writing and producing two albums for Iggy, both in 1977: The Idiot (recorded in Switzerland, final mixing in Berlin) and Lust for Life (Berlin). These albums most famously produced the songs “China Girl,” a later hit for David Bowie rerecorded for the album Let’s Dance (1983), and “Lust for Life,” Pop’s signature song. Bowie wrote music and Pop lyrics on both songs. Bowie then teamed up with Tony Visconti as producer and Brian Eno as collaborator on the albums Low (1977) and “Heroes” (1977).
Bowie wrapped up his work at the Hansa studio in Berlin with the soundtrack for his performance of Brecht’s Baal (1981). Lodger (1979), typically mentioned as the last of Bowie’s Berlin Trilogy, and the last album on which he collaborated with Brian Eno until 1995’s 1. Outside, was recorded in Switzerland and New York, not Berlin.
Watch “Station to Station” live on YouTube.
Julian Knox’s “Too Late to be Late Again: David Bowie, the Late 1970s, and Romanticism,” chapter 6 of David Bowie and Romanticism, explores the arrival of the “European canon” in Bowie’s music from Station to Station through the Berlin Trilogy to Scary Monsters against the background of German electronica, German Romanticism, Byron, and Coleridge — and his own personal life and growth.
Bowie’s Romanticism in this chapter is described as “a philosophy of artistic creation as self-disclosure, not through purportedly unfiltered, unmediated ‘sincerity,’ but rather through permutation and flux. . . [which] lies at the heart of a major strand of Romantic aesthetics, articulated by Coleridge in his appraisal of Shakespeare-as-Proteus: ‘to become by the power of Imagination another thing–Proteus, a river, a lion, yet still the God felt to be there’” (p. 122). Read more in David Bowie and Romanticism. Pick up a copy in The Bookstore or ask your local, college, or university library to order it.
Julian Knox is Assistant Professor of English at Georgia College & State University, where he teaches Romanticism, the eighteenth century, and Victorian literature, and where he coordinates the M.A. Program in Literature.

(In Search of George Wyllie’s Berlin Burd)
Last month, as one of the minders at The George Wyllie Foundation social media (For The Burds) I received an interesting late night message from Stevie Neil. Stevie is a member of the of the Ayrshire Ukulele Clan.
As a homage to George Wyllie’s favourite instrument, Stevie and the Clan played on the opening night of the George Wyllie Paper Boat exhibition at the Scottish Maritime Museum, Irvine back at beginning of July. (Exhibition continues until Monday 26th September)
While looking at the exhibition, Stevie became intrigued by the story of George Wyllie’s five-metre high Berlin Burd sculpture. George sited this gangly creature beside a section of the (four-metre high) Berlin Wall in 1988 just weeks before the wall came down.
George Wyllie made this Burd from stainless steel in Scotland and and transported across Europe to Berlin to look over the Berlin Wall. He worked with local school-children in Berlin and The George Wyllie Foundation has since been in touch with a few of the kids who remember the experience fondly.
At the time, given the political sensitivities surrounding the wall, politicians in Berlin were very cagey about giving George permission for such a project. One of the planning officials said to George at the time: “Ein vogel ist keen stein,” (“a bird is not a stone”).
This appealed to George’s sense of the absurd. Which of course the Burd was. As was the Wall. Despite the Burd not being a stone, George was given permission to place it beside the wall so that it keeked over it.
The George Wyllie Foundation (of which I am a Trustee) has always been a wee bit mystified as to the exact location of the big Berlin Burd. A couple of years ago, when his wee brother Burd found a permanent nest in The Scottish Parliament at Holyrood in Edinburgh, we made some enquiries but our lack of German stymied our attempts to track him down.
Intrigued, Stevie decided to seek out this giant flightless wonder for himself…
Stevie wrote to us: “I’ve just returned from Berlin where I managed to track down the Berlin Burd with the help of a German-speaking friend and some helpful locals.
“I found an article on the Burd on the Whysman education website and sent the link to my friend Amanda as we were heading to Berlin on holiday and thought it might be good to try to track it down.
“Amanda noticed from the picture in the article that it was in the French Quarter and did a bit more research on German websites before we left for Berlin. Once there we went to the area and went walkabout, initially without success.
“Amanda, who is fluent in German, then asked at the information office in a shopping mall whether anyone knew of it. No one did, but we were directed across the road to a small building where a representative of the factor responsible for maintenance of ‘monuments’ had a small office.
“Amanda made enquiries there and after a couple of phone calls we were directed further up the road.
IS IT A BURD…?
“I must say that while I had the notion of finding the Burd it was Amanda who did all the hard work and emailed the factor to advise of our success. It was also Amanda who translated the plaque for me and gave the explanatory notes.”
THE PLAQUE READS:
George Wyllie put up the Berlin Burd on the West Berlin side of the Wall on 1st December 1988 as part of a cultural initiative with children from schools in the Märkische Viertel under close observation by the East German police.On 9th November 2009 the Berlin Burd was finally moved to the former route of the Wall in memory of the Fall of the Wall.
Reinickendorf Youth Arts School Atrium
Explanatory notes:
The Berlin Burd is located on Wilhelmsruherdamm, near numbers 61–63, in the Märkisches Viertel, Reinickendorf, Berlin. It is on the route of the Wall marking the border between West and East Berlin, today between the administrative districts of Reinickendorf and Pankow.
The Märkisches Viertel or Quarter is the name of the large housing estate built in the 60s and 70s on West Berlin’s northeastern fringe.
The Jugendkunstschule Atrium or Youth Arts School is a local council funded institution which offers classes, projects, after school activities and workshops in all areas of the arts for children and youth in the area.
The date 9th November 2009 was the 20th Anniversary of the Fall of the Wall.
The George Wyllie Foundation would like to say a BIG thanks to Stevie and Amanda for all their sterling efforts in tracking down The Berlin Burd and saying hello. It’s very much appreciated!
You can read all about George Wyllie and the many influences which shaped his life and artworks (including the Berlin Burd) in Arrivals and Sailings: The Making of George Wyllie by me (Jan Patience) and Louise Wyllie (Polygon, £25)

Rich history… these are the first words that come to mind when I think about Berlin. I was so interested in how much history is on display from this city in everyday spaces and museums. I loved how the city did not try to hide events of the holocaust or World War II but rather seeks to put it fully on display to make sure that folks never forget the horrendous events and make sure that it never happens again.
Learning about the Berlin Wall and being able to see and touch it in person was a very chilling experience. I could not truly grapple with how recent these events were and how life varied dramatically from then to now.
During our time in Berlin we did a lot of different tours and museums but one guided tour we had was particularly memorable for because of the detail we received. We saw a memorial that included time stamps of how some events unfolded on the day that the Berlin Wall fell. Understanding what that experience must have been like for some many East Germans was truly special. I am grateful to have learned more about what life was like during the Cold War at the DDR museum. The DDR museum showed a bit more about the ways in which life in east Germany was actually happening, from domestic life, cars, to military, we learned so much.
Lastly, our time in the Bundestag was memorable. Being able to watch the debate was interesting. Although I wish my German was better so I’d be able to fully comprehend the conversation, I still got a lot out of seeing democracy in action. I was left feeling more interested in how German politics compares to US Politics in terms of efficiency and polarization. I think there are actually a lot of similarities when thinking about the rise of Germany’s Far right party, the AfD, and some political factions in the US.
Although, I was sad to see the trip end so soon, I’m really glad that our last stop was in Berlin. Berlin to me encompassed the crux of it all in Germany. It had the culture, the rich history, the walkability, and so much more. I will cherish the memories made on this program and all the knowledge that I gained learning about sustainability.

Official publication channel of Berlin’s ZebrasUnite chapter

One shy tweet promoted the first meetup of Berlin’s Zebras on Eventbrite, but the almost disproportionately large interest in the Zebras Unite movement started by four female US founders proved that the mission has hit a nerve in Germany’s capital. An old colleague of mine, among others, texted that he is thrilled to see Zebras in Berlin, as he was passively following the movement for a while.
Zebras stand for a company model countering the existing startup and venture capital culture. Instead of striving for fast exits and exponential growth at all costs, Zebra companies want to grow sustainably, honor diversity and inclusion, and work both towards profit and benefiting the public (read the manifesto). It’s something we desperately need in a society increasingly overtaken by the centralized services of tech giants bowing to shareholder interests rather than serving the public.
The first meetup of Zebras Unite in Berlin took place on December 4th in Mozilla’s office. After almost 30 registrations, Zebras Berlin had the pleasure to convene a group of 10 who made it through the grey Berlin weather to Kreuzberg.
After a short introduction, the round anonymous faces revealed themselves to be a diverse mix of founders, activists, consultants, and ex-academics experienced in financing their ventures with the help of Kickstarter, micro-investors, or entirely bootstrapping it. All were determined not to lose control of their businesses, but at the same time struggling with navigating the bureaucracy and fundraising landscape. Women founders shared their struggles with bias against women in tech, which led us to discuss the systemic issues behind the horrendous statistics on the diversity in the European startup scene (93% of all funds raised by European VC-backed companies in 2018 went to all-male founding teams).
We discussed how the idea of a Zebra company translates into the German and European reality. Entrepreneur and activist Evgeni Kouris introduced us to a cause he is leading, tailored to the German market and closely aligned with Zebra values: #NewMittelstand.
We wondered how we can encourage the often conservative investors with access to the “old money” in Germany to open up to new kinds of companies. We mentioned the challenge of measuring impact versus profit and the need for innovative investors who “get it” and are willing to take the risk, as well as founders who stand by their values, even under pressure. Because a pressure for exponential impact can be as detrimental as the pressure for exponential growth of profits.
We discussed the role education can and needs to play in this context. We joked we need a “sustainerator” instead of an “accelerator” in the startup ecosystem. Lastly, one of the founders wondered if there is a way to grow your business without taking any external money, which started a discussion about scaling and its challenges.
All in all, we all saw the need to unite in a smart way and raise visibility for the ideas that are already growing in different sectors and communities. Through events, education, meetups and emotional support and skills sharing, Zebras seemed like a great umbrella to talk about a change that is cultural at its core.
We know that once we get people thinking, actions will follow.
We would like to extend an invitation to local founder communities, and investors to talk about what we can do together.

I spoke with Paul Gurner, owner of the St George’s Bookshop, at Wörther Straße 27 in Prenzlauer Berg. Paul, who had no previous experience in the bookstore business, has been running one of the most successful English bookshops in Berlin since 2003 and is planning to open a larger, second location in the Schöneberg neighborhood in 2017. Paul’s answers to how and why St. George’s came into being might be surprising, as is his attitude to Amazon and other competition from the digital domain. Paul’s responses have been edited.
SK: Have you run a bookstore before? What experience did you bring to the bookselling enterprise?
Wow (he laughs), no one asked whether or not we had experience. We have run businesses before, in England, a couple of businesses, and we were looking for a new project.
You get people coming up from the market [on nearby Kollwitz Straße] and they will come in here and you will ask, are you here ’cause of the market? And they will say, No, we are here ’cause of you.
SK: Where in England?
I grew up in Cambridge, and the business was actually based out of Berkshire, the last one I had. It was furniture.
SK: Ah, so you had a furniture business, this was a furniture business and then you turned it into a bookstore.
Indeed. The shop was empty before we came in here.
SK: Why Berlin?
In 2000, I followed a girlfriend over to Berlin, and she left me stranded here; she moved on to Switzerland or southern Germany, and I stayed. It was a good introduction to the city, although we were in Brandenburg.
SK: So you were looking for a new business, but why an English-language bookshop in a German-speaking country? What made you think, okay that’s what I should do?
We had a lot of books from a business we had invested in. We were going to do some markets and off load them as quickly as possible. But in the end, we decided, I was here anyway, storage here was cheaper, ship ’em across here, have a go.
SK: How many books are we talking?
We had about 20 of these Chesterfield sofas, and 10,000 books. It was ridiculous, actually.
SK: You are not a bibliophile then? You are not crazy about writers and writing…
The bookshop worked cause it’s a business, and we treat it as such. I don’t use it as an excuse to sit around and read; I use it as a business.
SK: How did you come upon 10,000 books?
We — me and my brother — invested into a business that didn’t do too well, a bookshop, and the only thing we could get out of in the end was not our money, but the books. They were well selected, and I think we sold most of those books.
It’s all curated through the customers’ needs. Over the years you see what people want, you see the publishers that sell, you see the authors. There is no doubt that the philosophy is chosen by customers’ orders, but also by the staff.
What was the bookstore landscape like when you first started the shop in 2003?
This was an area where a lot of Americans were coming in, from Charlottenburg, and still quite rough around the edges. It was quite obvious that there should have been a bookshop here.
There were no English bookshops?
There was one in Friedrichshain and we didn’t want to go too close to them. Prenzlauer Berg. It seems a bit obvious, why isn’t anyone there? So we jumped on it as quickly as we could. We got things together and we just opened up, rather naively, but in the end you don’t need a qualification to do it, you don’t need permission to do it, you just do it.
Where do you go to get your books now?
We ship a thousand books across every month from England, used stock. There’s no set place where I do my buying: warehouses that are spread all over the place. I avoid London…over the years you have your set routes, you can find bookshops where you do deals with people. Generally, we get phone calls from people closing shops, downsizing, going online. From a selection of 10,000 to 20,000 books you get a thousand books, you cherry pick them.
Who are you cherry picking, who are you looking for?
From Camus to Ishiguro…Ballard, Nabokov, anyone really, you just got to remember 10,000 names.
At one point you called it a curated collection, can you talk more about that? Curated by whom?
Yeah, it sounds wanky, I know. It’s all curated through the customers’ needs. Over the years you see what people want, you see the publishers that sell, you see the authors. There is no doubt that the philosophy is chosen by customers’ orders, but also by the staff.
In these ten plus years, you have built up your knowledge about books. How many years did it take for the bookstore to take off?
We were really busy from year three and we have kept that. We have a large turn over. This is the first time I have been alone all day.
I think people are slowly reconnecting with browsing. You will have people coming in here with their younger teenage kids and just browse. There was a young mother in here with her 16-year old daughter and they seemed to be having fun, genuine fun looking through the books together.
Are bookstores still thriving in Berlin, and if so, how do they survive in this age of Amazon and internet shopping when they are shutting down elsewhere?
There are more opening up, but there are quite a few closing. Last year we saw two bookshops close that have been there 30 plus years.
So it’s changing here as well?
Exactly. I suppose it’s a bit like clearing out. Bookshops that don’t work close. You got to keep your game up. There was one here in Mitte, four or five years ago, not too far from here, and they closed as well. It must have been an operator error because the customer base is down there. And then another one closed last year. Fair Exchange. They been there donkeys years. They were doing German [books] at the front, English at the back. Again they blamed Amazon…but you just can’t blame Amazon. It’s too easy. Concentrate on your own thing. You never know, I could be ten years down the line and saying the same thing.
So you don’t feel a threat from digital media or Amazon?
Even if everyone in this neighborhood came to us and ordered their books there would be too much work. We don’t advertise, we do our job and people talk about us. It’s worked wonderfully. Amazon do their job and we try to do ours.
I think people are slowly reconnecting with browsing. You will have people coming in here with their younger teenage kids and just browse. There was a young mother in here with her 16-year old daughter and they seemed to be having fun, genuine fun looking through the books together. You can imagine that this is something they might remember. It was actually quite sweet…they sat on the sofa discussing books, and what she’d read and what the daughter might like to read.
Given that 90% of your stock is used, do you cultivate relationships with writers? You said you don’t necessarily have the time or space to do readings.
We don’t get approached that often for readings. People know that we just don’t have the space — if we move everything we can fit about forty people sitting down. We still do poetry readings. It was nice when we first started out…it did make us the customer base…it’s what we would do with the bigger shop in Schöneberg, the shop we are looking to buy, it’s one big room about 90–100 square meters that naturally lends itself to readings.
It’s a bit of a family. I know half the people by sight, probably 20% by name, but purely because my memory with names is terrible. I do wonder about the people who used to be customers, people who have just disappeared off the face of…
Who are your main customers?
You have seen the people who were in here. They were expats, I guess. Expats, not necessarily native English, but I’d say non-German 70/30 during the week, and during the weekend it probably levels out to 50–50, where’s there’s 50% German, maybe growing.
What are the intersections between the German speakers and the Anglophones?
I think the Germans are very slowly realizing that they don’t have to go to these big bookshops to get their books, they don’t have to rely on that kind of traditional way of buying books: they can come to us and we can order the books in and they are considerably cheaper. Amazon is not the cheapest route especially in Germany…
How is the price structure determined in Germany? I know that prices are fixed for books published in Germany, but what about books published in the UK, in the US, elsewhere?
People charge whatever they want.
So there is no regulation on those?
No. We choose to match or beat Amazon prices on 90% of our books, there’s 10% on which we can’t.
I know you don’t have the space for cultivating relationships with writers, but can you talk about cultivating relationships with readers. Do you have neighborhood customers…
It’s a bit of a family. I know half the people by sight, probably 20% by name, but purely because my memory with names is terrible. I do wonder about the people who used to be customers, people who have just disappeared off the face of…
Prenzlauer Berg?
No, our customer base is Berlin, it really isn’t only Prenzlauer Berg. It’s much wider reaching than that. You get people coming up from the market [on nearby Kollwitz Straße] and they will come in here and you will ask, are you here ‘cause of the market? And they will say, No, we are here ‘cause of you.

When you walk into my Friedrichshain apartment, there’s a room labeled “Kinderwagen-Rollstuhle” next to the elevator. On the door, a paper reads:
“Only for strollers. Do not use this room for bikes!”
This was my first inkling that Friedrichshain was a neighborhood for more than hipsters and its club scene.
When I first moved to Berlin in 2019, stroller rooms and family policies were the last thing on my mind. My husband and I moved here to live in a big city, travel across Europe, and start a new adventure. As we stayed longer though, more of our friends started popping out pandemic babies. We soon decided to start our family here as well.
Americans love praising Scandinavian countries' utopian family policies. The NY Times recently touted Finland for giving all new parents the same leave, following Sweden’s example. Bringing up Bebe, which explores the differences between American and French child rearing, has become standard pregnancy reading. Achtung Baby is the German equivalent. I also read these books during pregnancy in my quest to glean child-rearing wisdom.
This post is my version: a personal story about my 22 months of pregnancy, birth, postpartum, and parental leave in Berlin. This isn’t a how-to guide, and I’m not promising to confer any wisdom. But I’d like to show what it’s like to live in a city built with both physical and social infrastructure for families, during one of life’s most tender junctures.
At my first appointment with my Frauenartz (OB/GYN), I received a little book called the Mutterpass (Mother’s pass). All the tests and examinations throughout my pregnancy and birth were recorded in it. Although it may seem archaic to bring a paper booklet with you to every appointment, it actually made a lot of sense in practice. During my pregnancy, I received care from a disparate group of doctors and midwives. Instead of transferring electronic medical records, I simply handed over my Mutterpass at the start of each appointment.
Holistic medicine is more widely accepted in Germany and supported by the medical establishment. Like in the US, I went to routine OB/GYN checkups where I would do a urinanalysis, blood pressure check, weigh-in, periodic blood tests, and consultation at each appointment. I did ultrasounds and genetic testing at predetermined weeks. Unlike the US, I also went to a Hebammenpraxis, a midwife clinic.
One of the downsides I experienced with public health insurance was that my OG/GYN was often overbooked and rushed—sometimes my appointments started one to two hours late. But at the Hebammenpraxis, the midwives took their time. They explained each test in my Mutterpass, making sure I understood each result. They also recommended acupuncture and acupressure for my debilitating first trimester nausea. This was all covered by my public health insurance.
I split the costs of my public health insurance with my employer—I pay around €‎440 per month. This is calculated based on your income level. Health insurance is mandatory for everyone living in Germany. Some people pay for private health insurance if they don’t qualify for public, or want greater control of their providers. See here for more details.
My favorite part of the German medical system is the hebamme, a personal midwife. Hebammen are trained medical professionals that can perform examinations on the mother and the baby. They also guide parents through this huge life transition. In Berlin they work hyper-locally — usually only in one neighborhood. My other mom friends advised me to start looking for a hebamme as soon as my pregnancy was confirmed.
Unfortunately there is a shortage of hebammen in Berlin. To find one, I posted in facebook groups, registered for search websites, visited Hebammenpraxes, and asked friends of friends. Finally, by the end of the first trimester I found my match: Mandy.
Mandy only worked in my zip code, and took a handful of new mothers each month. She visited homes by biking from apartment to apartment — sometimes up to 8–10 homes a day! After our initial meeting at the end of my first trimester, we signed a contract. We didn’t talk for a while, and then around week 35, she came for a few home visits. She checked out my baby room and recommended a few items I might need postpartum. She was also available on call if I thought I was going into labor, and could advise me on when to go to the hospital.
In Berlin, you have a couple of options on where to give birth: a hospital, a Geburtshaus (birthing center), or Hausgeburt (home birth). All options are mostly covered by insurance. In birthing centers, you are attended to by a 1-on-1 midwife in a more “home-like” environment. Doctors are not on-site and there is not the option for epidurals or other drugs. At home, a Beleghebamme (personal birthing midwife) supervises your delivery.
I chose to deliver in a hospital because I wanted the option to have an epidural, and probably because of my American tendencies. I registered at Charité Mitte, a top teaching hospital 20 minutes away, where most doctors and nurses spoke English.
Germans believe that all pregnant women are entitled to not only adequate medical care, but also mental and physical preparations for birth. My public health insurance, Die Techniker, reimbursed me for yoga classes and a Geburtsvorbereitungskurs (birth class). Although most couples take a weekly birth class in their neighborhood, we chose a weekend online course because of COVID. It was also challenging to find one in English.
The German system acknowledges that pregnant mothers not only need a physical break, but also a mental break. They respect the experience of pregnancy and motherhood.
In Germany, your maternal leave starts six weeks before your due date, with the statutory maternity leave, called Mutterschutz. During this time, you receive full pay, and are expected to relax and focus on preparing for the baby. At first I wasn’t sure if I wanted to take that much time off. I felt extreme FOMO — worried that I’d miss out on important moments at work.
However, since I’d be paid the same whether I worked or not, I embraced the German benefits and stopped working. I spent the first few weeks off “nesting” — preparing the baby room, washing and sorting hand-me-down clothes, and stocking our freezer. I also tried to stay active by doing prenatal yoga and going for walks with other moms on leave. One of the benefits of longer maternity leaves is that there is a higher likelihood that your friends are also on leave.
After my due date came and went, I went for daily check-ups and CTG (electronic fetal monitor, EFM) scans at my Frauenartz. Five days after my due date, I had a blood test at the hospital and they decided to have me stay to be induced. While I waited for the induction pills to work, I waited in a separate hospital room in the maternity ward.
German hospitals provide a range of equipment to support vaginal deliveries. Charite’s delivery rooms had specialised equipment such as an exercise ball, birthing stools, ropes attached to the ceiling and walls, and adjustable birthing tables. Some even had a bathtub for water delivery. The midwives embrace moving around and changing positions to help the baby “spin” down the birth canal.
I had the fortune of a quiet delivery ward, which allowed a midwife to accompany me the entire time I was in active labor. Oftentimes in a hospital a midwife splits her time between two or three women. One downside of giving birth in a hospital though is that you may need to change midwives mid-delivery. This happened to me 6 hours in. But in the end, I had a positive experience as I liked the different approach of both midwives. I didn’t see a doctor until the very end, just a few minutes before I delivered my baby boy.
Grant was born after 9 hours of labor.
After birth, I stayed in the hospital for 3 days. This allowed us to have Grant’s U2 appointment at the hospital, which needs to happen between the third and tenth day of life in Germany. Similar to US wellness checkups, Germans have a set of preventive medical check-ups from the first day of birth through adolescence.
We were lucky to get a “family room” after birth, where my husband was able to stay with us in his own bed. We were supported by postpartum midwives 24–7, who were just a button press away. Charite doesn’t have that many family rooms though, so most people need to share a room post delivery. Other families choose to leave the hospital as soon as possible, because their hebamme can also support them at home.
The one downside of staying in the hospital was the German food. This was what I was served for dinner on the first night. Yes, that’s a raw tomato in the corner and a large pickled cucumber in the other.
I had heard the hardest trimester isn’t the 3rd, it’s actually the “4th trimester”, otherwise known as postpartum. I was worried about sleepless nights and how my body would recover. But after reading the book “The First Forty Days,” I learned it could be a magical time if you’re prepared and have a strong support system.
The Germans also have a culture of resting after birth called Wochenbett which literally means “weeks in bed.” The new mother is supposed to stay in bed to recover and focus on skin-on-skin and feeding the new baby.
This is actually quite similar to the Chinese tradition of Zuo Yuezi (坐月子), which literally translates to confinement. During this time, new mothers aren’t supposed to leave the house or touch cold water.
My parents came to Berlin for my Zuo Yuezi, and rented an apartment a block from my apartment. My mom made me warm Chinese soups, didn’t let me touch cold water, and helped take care of Grant. I didn’t leave the house for almost 30 days, which wasn’t that hard for me as it was in the middle of winter.
As I mentioned before, my favorite German benefit is the hebamme. My midwife Mandy came the first day we got home, and visited every day for the first few weeks. Each visit started by weighing Grant, tracking his progress to regaining his birth weight. She also checked and cleaned his umbilical cord stub, and showed us how to bathe him once it fell off.
At the beginning she also supported me in breastfeeding: teaching me different positions, helping wake Grant up mid-feed (his breastfeeding persona was a “dinner dozer” / “rester”), and teaching me how to use the pump (which I only used before my supply came in). This was invaluable, as it prevented common breastfeeding problems like mastitis and nipple pain. If I had any major issues, Mandy could have also referred me to a lactation consultant.
Each day, my husband and I would write down all our questions to review with her. Are his hands too hot or too cold? How should we dress him at night? Should we start vitamin D drops? When will he get over his jetlag? Are we doing tummy time right? Is this a normal amount of spit up? I think she single-handedly prevented us from having postpartum anxiety. :)
She also checked on my health — both physical and mental. She asked about my bleeding, checked my stitches, and examined my abs for diastasis recti. It was such a blessing to get maternal care without having to leave the house with a newborn. Oftentimes, there is so much focus on the baby, not on the mother’s recovery. I didn’t feel this way.
All German employees (people with a German employment contract) are entitled to parental leave. There are two concepts: Elternzeit (parental time off) and Elterngeld (parental allowance / money).
In my circle of friends, most mothers took at least a year off — usually until their child went to Kita. This also lines up with how long women are recommended to breastfeed for, about one year. Babies can start drinking cow’s milk after one year of age. I noticed that most fathers took a few weeks off at the start with the mother, and then some weeks later when the baby is older. Many took it during the summer holiday so the whole family could vacation together.
In a bit of a tangent, I’m going to compare Germany’s policy to Sweden’s. Unlike Sweden’s equality focused policy, Germany doesn’t have a minimum number of days each parent must take. In Sweden, their 90 days of “use-it-or-lose-it” time for fathers incentivizes men to take their full parental leave. Sweden also has an “equality bonus” of 50 kr each per day if you share your parental leave equally. This has led more Swedish men to take more paternal leave than other countries, and even created a “latte pappa” culture.
While I was pregnant, we visited our friends in Sweden with a 1 year old. The couple took the first month off together. The mom then took the next 6 months on her own, and then the father took the next 6 months on his own. Leaving the baby with the father made it easier for my friend to go back to work, and helped them establish a more equal division of household and child rearing. In the US, studies have shown that when a baby arrives, working couples no longer share their housework equally, even when they did before (study). This was a pattern I didn’t want us to fall into.
So what did we do? My husband and I both took the first month off. Then I became the primary caregiver from months 2–10, though my husband took off 6 weeks of vacation throughout that time. He also works from home, and was able to support me during the day when needed. He will become primary caregiver when Grant is 10 months, and plans to take at least 3 months of paternity leave. We chose this split because I wanted to take about one year off of work, and because by the time Grant is 10 months he’ll be breastfeeding less and less dependent on me. I also wanted us to both experience being primary caregiver to develop our own parenting styles and build empathy for each other.
The thing I appreciate the most about this experience, is that I had the privilege of going back to work when I was ready. I took a total of 12 months off — something I never would be able to take, or even thought I’d want, in the US. Some moms are ready to return to work after 3 months, and others at 3 years. I didn’t have to choose between being a “stay-at-home-mom” or a “working mom” when I wasn’t ready. And throughout my leave, even though my day to day was being a full time caregiver, I considered myself a UX designer. This is an important part of my identity.
So what did I do with my time?
Not going back to work allowed me to continue breastfeeding on-demand. I didn’t need to pump, though I used the passive Haaka pump to collect extra milk for bottles.
Women in Berlin breastfeed practically everywhere– restaurants, playground, the Ubahn… No one bats an eye!
Around 6–8 weeks after birth, many German women take a Rückbildungskurs to strengthen their pelvic floor. Pregnancy and childbirth can stress, stretch, and weaken the muscles in your pelvic floor and abdomen, which can cause pain and urinary incontinence. Germans don’t wait for a doctor’s diagnosis. Almost all women sign up for a course after their hebamme clears them. In the class, a physiotherapist walks you through a series of breathing and muscle exercises. This is also covered by health insurance.
This can also be a great way to get out of the house with your baby and meet other new moms in the neighborhood. Unfortunately I was only able to find an English course online.
A few months after birth, a social worker contacted us for a home visit. I had never met a social worker before, and wasn’t sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised though! The woman came with a large folder of flyers: lists of pediatricians, local hospitals, family centers, and kitas (day cares). She reassured us that the local town hall could put us on a waitlist for kita (daycare), if we weren’t able to find a spot ourselves. This is a common concern of parents, as kita spots can be notoriously hard to find in Berlin. She also made sure we how to fill out all of the required German paperwork and navigate the bureaucracy.
As Ali Wong said in Hard Knock Wife, “when you’re a new mom on maternity leave it’s like The Walking Dead. You’ve just gotta hook up with a crew to survive.” Neighborhood family centers saved me, and helped me find my survival crew. All around Friedrichshain there are family centers with programming for kids and their parents. Many have free play times and classes such as “baby massage” and “yoga with baby.”
When Grant was around 4 months old, I started going to a “baby time” every Friday. With a facilitator, we went around sharing how each of our weeks went — recounting what’s changed with the baby, and checking in on how we are each doing. We sang some German songs and did some playful activities. It ended with a lovely breakfast and tea. The whole class was donation based.
Although it was tough for me to always understand what was going on in German, I managed to make one good friend from the group. When the class ended, we started going to drop-in “open play times.” Grant loved playing with all the new toys and structures, and I enjoyed some adult socialization. It can be incredibly lonely and isolating to be caring for your baby at home alone all day.
I’m not going to say much about Kita (daycare), because unfortunately we will be leaving Germany before Grant can go to Kita (at one year of age). The most important fact though is that Kita is free. Yes, daycare is free in Berlin. Well, except for a €23 / month lunch fee.
Parents apply for a Kitagutschein voucher that determines the number of hours you qualify for based on their age and the number of hours the parents work. Most kitas don’t take babies under the age of one though. If you’re curious to learn more, this is a great guide.
What?! You’re leaving Berlin? You might be surprised to learn after describing this seeming family utopia, we’ve decided to return to the US — the only rich country without federally mandated paid parental leave.
We miss our family.I had a really hard time the weeks after my parents left Germany when Grant was three months old. My relationship with my parents, and my in-laws, has completely changed since becoming a parent myself. I call my parents almost every day, and can’t imagine having them only see Grant once or twice a year. I think that one of the best things we can do for Grant, and for our sanity, is to surround him with people that love him — which means moving closer to my family in the Bay Area.
We miss our friends.Although it was hard to make many friends during the pandemic, we managed to make a few good friends in the past three years. However, almost all of them have now moved away as many were also expats, and went onto their next location. We know how important friendship is to our happiness, and how lonely and isolating parenting can be. Back in the bay area we have friends we’ve known for 10–20 years, and many of them are now having kids too. We’re actually planning to co-live with a friend I’ve known since birth!
We’re tired of speaking bad German.We had grand plans to learn at least conversational German when we first moved here. We took a month-long intensive course, and then biweekly classes for the first year. But after a year we only made it to A.2, at best. When I got pregnant, I lacked the energy and motivation to continue. In the area we live in, we’re able to use English in our day-to-day encounters, but when we hit bureaucracy, it is all German. And becoming a parent doubled the amount of bureaucracy we’ve hit. I also couldn’t imagine not being able to speak to Grant’s daycare teachers fluently.
We want to continue working with our American employers, but want family friendly hours.My husband and I continued to work for American companies when we moved to Berlin. He stayed with his previous company, and I started at Google Berlin. This meant we worked somewhat shifted hours, usually 10 am to 7 or 8pm, with a healthy midday break. This is not compatible with a baby’s schedule (3pm kita pickup, 5:30pm dinner, 7pm bedtime). From my experience, most Googlers in leadership positions based in Europe take a break to watch their kids, and then go back online from 8–10pm. This is not the lifestyle we want.
We want to establish a permanent home base.To my husband’s dismay, the idea of moving back to the bay and staying there for the rest of our lives terrifies me. I’m not ready to stop our adventures! But I do agree that we’d like to establish a home base and permanent community. Maybe we’ll move to Taiwan or Singapore in 5 years though :)
I’m extremely thankful for my experience from pregnancy to parental leave in Berlin. I know how lucky we are to be able to move here, have our parents stay with us, and work at well paying jobs. We are extremely privileged to get this new perspective on what having a baby can look like. I’ve had friends in the US who had to fight for time off from their employers or beg their doctors to take their pain seriously to get a PT referral. It would have been hard for me to advocate for myself during this tender and vulnerable time.
I am grateful that Germany welcomed us as a temporary residents (we have EU Blue Cards), and allowed me to qualify and pay for public health insurance. I’ve felt supported by the city and healthcare system, with community spaces and services that I didn’t even know I needed.
After 12 months off, I feel ready to return to work, and step aside to let my husband become the primary caregiver. Love you dear! :)
Thank you Owen and Kalvin for the edits, and Alana Range for the lovely photos.

The happiest hour (two hours) is from 5–7 pm. After dinner, I returned to the bar every evening. Either solo or with my new friends Gabriel or Ria or Michèle. Started with cocktails as you do, mojito, Aperol spritz, gin basil squash. All new taste sensations for me.
I finally managed to fit some touristing into the drinking schedule. It’s my last day. I have to do something! When I’m asked what did you do in Berlin, I can’t say, “I partied, swam naked, made some friends and drank cocktails.” Well, I suppose I can. I have some great memories.
I started at Checkpoint Charlie, the most famous of seven crossing points between East Berlin and West Berlin.
I went looking for the Berlin Bears… these were the only ones I saw in a gift shop. I decided if I couldn’t find a bear, I’d buy…

Should you visit Berlin? Absolutely not, as these five points prove. Not only will you have to endure a city where everyone seems to have no responsibilities and only want to party, your trip will then ruin the rest of your life when looking back at the very few things Berlin does well. Read on for some important warnings on why you shouldn’t bother visiting Berlin…
Clubbing in Berlin is like nothing else I’ve experienced. From the ridiculous door policies and marathon opening times to the endless techno, you’ll find that the nightlife in Germany’s capital is very unusual. But after just one night of being indoctrinated into the Berlin way of doing things, you’ll realise that they just do it better.
In Berlin clubs, it’s frowned upon to take photos — in some, photography is banned. But why would you want to take photos of your mates in the club anyway? Just enjoy the moment, your life shouldn’t be about showing off to your Instagram followers. Who cares if you got into Berghain, anyway??
You also won’t find any mirrors in the club toilets, either. Or anywhere else for that matter. But if you’re actually there to have a good time, does it even matter what you look like?
Next is the music. No one loves techno quite as much as Berliners do. Last time I went to Ipse in east Berlin, the crowd cheered after each DJ finished their set. Moments later, the next DJ would come on and play what sounds like the exact same track, only with a slightly different snare drum sample.
SEE ALSO: 4 things you’ll learn about clubbing in Berlin
And if you’re not into the hypnotic, monotonous music, you’re not getting in, because the bouncers will quiz you on who’s playing.
However, after clubbing in Berlin, you’ll realise that clubs elsewhere are full of posers who are just there to be seen, pretending to have fun. Does anyone even have fun in clubs outside of Berlin? Most likely, they’re not. In Berlin, they’re actually there because they love the music.
And that’s how it should be. Why go to a club with ludicrous drinks prices to pretend you’re something you’re not and live a lifestyle you don’t lead, just to impress a load of other people who’re in exact same boat as you. You might be sitting in the VIP booth, but truth is after tonight you’ll be back on your zero hours contract job or skipping your media studies lecture.
At least in Berlin, clubbers are honest. When you get home, clubbing will be ruined for you as you’ll realise just how futile and pathetic it is anywhere else.
Berlin is probably one of the cheapest major cities in the world. Want a latte at the train station? It’s yours for the princely sum of €1. Want a kebab? That’s €3.50. In fact, the only thing that’s overpriced is entry to the TV Tower.
Trust me, in just a few days you’ll get used to the low prices (unless you head over to Poland or Hungary next!) and when you get home, if you’re from the UK, the USA, or elsewhere in western or northern Europe, things will suddenly seem so expensive.
On a night out in east Berlin, you could have a beer for under €2. That would cost you around £5 in London. We even picked up 0.5l bottles of beer at a convenience store for €0.60. Sixty cents. That’s insanely cheap!
Nothing ever happened in Berlin. It might be the capital of Germany, but Germany only became a country in 1871. Even the USA has 100 years on that, while England was unified in the 10th century and has been a country ever since.
Plus, Berlin was almost totally destroyed in 1945. And nothing really happened after that…
Of course in reality, Berlin was one of the major flash points in the Cold War. Take the Berlin Crisis in 1961, where US and Soviet tanks had a standoff for 16 hours, 50 meters apart, with live ammunition. Chilling stuff.
Or the Berlin Wall, and the numerous escape attempts that led to hundreds of East Germans tragically dying at the hands of the border guards, as well as the fascinating stories of how a handful of people got away with it through their audacious escape attempts. You can learn about these at the Berlin Wall Museum at Checkpoint Charlie.
And who can forget the former German Democratic Republic? If you’ve been watching Deutschland 83, you’ll already know about the East German Communist state. Find out what life was like behind the iron curtain in the DDR museum in Berlin Mitte. Though it was one of the more successful communist states, you’ll learn that freedom was severely restricted, and find out how the population coped by listening to communist music, watching steroid-fuelled sports, and going on nudist beach holidays (yes, really).
Berlin is known for it’s chilled freewheeling spirit, that’s much less intense than other large cities like London or Paris. You’ll find the people here are really down to earth and relaxed. In the summer months, many people sit out drinking at beach bars on the banks of the river Spree, or take a dip in the Badeschiff.
They’re not uptight about when clubs close like in other cities — parties from Friday night are known to stay open until Monday morning. No matter what time of day or day of the week, you’ll see people relaxing and having fun, partly down to the rise of flexi-time working hours in the city.
SEE ALSO: What in the world is travel hacking?
The city is also home to around 20,000 artists, drawn to the city thanks to cheap rents and tons of studio space. Similarly, Berlin is a hotspot for tech startups, meaning there’s lots of hipsters to meet in the multitude of quirky, independent bars.
After you leave, you’ll miss the constant party scene, particularly if you’re going back to the daily grind of the rat race back home.
Bologna has bolognese, Tokyo has sushi, and Berlin has… doner kebabs?
But these aren’t the standard greasy kebabs you’d pick up at 3 am after stumbling out of a grimy provincial Essex nightclub. The döner im brot is ubiquitous across Berlin, and absolutely delicious, served with salad, and both garlic and herb and hot sauce. The grilled bread that these kebabs are served in makes all the difference, rather than the dry pitta you’d get served in the UK. While you can pick up a doner anywhere, you can find the best in the city here.
Let’s also not forget the famous curry wurst, made from a steamed, then fried pork sausage, served with a ketchup based sauce topped with curry powder, and a side of fries.
The humble curry wurst owes its existence to World War Two. The dish was invented by Herta Heuwer in Charlottenburg, west Berlin, in 1949. Having acquired curry powder, ketchup and Worcestershire sauce from the occupying British troops, serving up the first curry wursts to the construction workers rebuilding the city.
Today, Berliners can’t get enough, guzzling 70 million of them each year.
So yes, food in Berlin really is the wurst (sorry)

Edit: After posting this, I got a lot of responses from people who also attended the Berlin Opera Academy and had something to say. I’ve asked for their permission to share their stories. You can find them at the bottom of this article.
On the first day of BOA 2022, during the general assembly, the head of the program gave us a rousing speech. It really was very good — you could see people eyes lighting up, and I felt my own face glow with anticipation.
However, he said one thing that made me a little suspicious. ‘Be positive,’ he told us. ‘Have a positive mindset. Don’t grumble or complain. Make something out of it.’
Of course, I completely agree with the benefits of a positive mindset. There’s a lot of whining and complaining in any world, and we’d all be better off without it. But at the same time, this sounded defensive to me — as if he knew there were things that weren’t right, and hoped to not get too much pushback.
As it turned out, the BOA program, for all its merits, has a few drawbacks that I think people should be aware of before signing up.
But let’s start on that positive note.
BOA is a great initiative and Berlin is a great city. The teachers that they attract are often amazing and will give you valuable feedback. They will often give you their honest opinion, and because you’re seeing lots of different people in a short amount of time, you will start to notice which comments keep popping up. I, for example, heard that I was moving around rather aimlessly from three different teachers. That’s when you know it should be the first priority on your list of things to fix.
This is a great opportunity that might be worth paying for, especially if you’ve never done it before (I hadn’t).
You’ll get to actually do a whole opera and you will be guided by professional conductors and directors. I got extremely lucky: my opera (Suor Angelica) was directed by Susan Stone. She displayed a kind of professionalism that I really learned a lot from over the span of four weeks. She was kind and open, but not overly familiar. She was ridiculously smart, had very original ideas for the piece which the executed with meticulous precision, and held us and herself to a very high standard. It was one of the most inspiring things that month.
You might make some new friends, and you’ll be able to see how you measure up to others. This will be both encouraging and discouraging. Personally, I learned that, repertoire-wise, I was way better prepared than almost anyone else there, which was lovely. But I also learned that my interpretations suffered because I wasn’t intentional enough in my on-stage movement. This was painful to realise, but it was very important as it allowed me to work on it.
During the first two weeks, I got into exactly zero masterclasses. That’s right. The booking system where you are supposed to make your own appointments was deeply flawed. It basically meant that whoever had the fastest internet connection could get multiple masterclasses every day, while others went weeks without getting a masterclass. When the students of BOA 2022 complained, there were “warnings” issued to those who over-booked. But by then, many people had fallen behind in a way that could not be fixed. When I finally got my first masterclass in week three, I let the teacher know how happy I was to finally have snagged a spot. The teacher said: ‘Are you serious? I’m seeing some people for the fourth time today.’After that, I took it upon myself to help distribute classes fairly by snagging masterclasses I’d already been to and contact people that hadn’t worked with that teacher yet, to give them my spots. I even contacted some teachers separately and paid them for private lessons at their homes, because BOA wouldn’t have them back for more classes. The people at BOA had no solution for this problem, other that to issue warnings and block people who had had too many masterclasses — but as this only happened halfway into the program, most people were not able to make up for their lost time. This meant that some people got way more than their money’s worth from BOA, while others really did not.
This was one of the factors that resulted in the over-booked masterclasses. While I was there, they were staging three or four operas at the same time, all with three separate casts. This meant an absurd number of singers, all fighting over the same finite resources. It also means that everyone’s attention is spread very thin. The maestro has to work with two other people singing the same role as you, and they’re also working on the other productions. In my case, our director was working with four casts simultaneously — two for Suor Angelica and two for Gianni Schicchi — while the conductor was working on every production that was going on at that moment (do the math: 4 operas x 3 casts per opera). Whelp.
The Berlin Opera Academy also accepts people with little to no experience (who then eat up all the time with the conductor because they haven’t studied or cannot sing their parts). I knew all my parts by heart when I got there. My “time with the conductor” was five minutes in a huge rehearsal, after which he said ‘Great, thank you’ and moved on to the two other people singing the same part.
Let me be clear: there were people at BOA 2022 who said: ‘It wasn’t like this last time.’ I think I caught the program at an especially bad time. I came during the busiest month, and halfway into the production, the entire costume and set department quit because of unsafe working conditions and the fact that BOA had not delivered on their promises to them (which BOA admitted). They tried to salvage the situation, but in the end many productions had to scramble to get any kind of costumes together.
This is a relatively minor issue, but the venue where the operas were staged was a letdown. The ‘changing rooms’ were a gigantic, completely dark garage-like space that was open to the elements. When it rained, there was water everywhere. The hall is very oddly designed and is clearly better suited to an art exposition than music. The orchestra sat to the right of the performers, while there were a couple of chairs herded together in the far corner for a tiny audience. I felt a bit embarrassed that I had invited my family to come see the production.
If you’re looking for that glamorous opera feeling, this is not the right program. Considering sticker price is almost €5000, I would have expected more.
Well… that depends. For me, it was worth the money, but mostly because I hadn’t done anything like this before, I got a partial scholarship and because I was willing to pay teachers separately for extra classes. I learned a lot and had lots of fun experiences. But I don’t think I would ever go there again, and I would not pay the full price to go there.
After I published this article, I got lots of comments from fellow students. Some of them were generous enough to let me share their opinions here.
I’d have mentioned the amount of commuting you have to do between rehearsals and classes/coachings. But overall, I think it’s too generous to BOA, to be honest. The thing is a scam. I felt so bad for the kids who paid €5000 to be triple cast as the third genie or something. And members of staff sexually propositioned people on the course after they’d finished their final show. I’ve told so many people not to do it.- Anonymous
Honestly, I think you covered everything very well — the only thing I would maybe add was that we weren’t really in “Berlin” we were very much on the outskirts of the city and had to take public transit for like 45 mins to each location, which made it hard to be able to participate in everything, to be honest.- Charlotte Forknall
I think what we received as participants in the programme was completely unacceptable. If I hadn’t received scholarship from BOA and from another source, I would probably be fighting to get a refund. I’ve done other summer programmes before and this was easily the worst, and cannot even be compared because the standard is so low. If anyone were to ask me about BOA, I would without hesitation tell them it’s a scam. - Anonymous
1000% agree with everything you said. The only reason I do it, is it’s the cheapest conducting program that includes opera. - Anonymous
I totally agree with each and every word. We as singers are so desperate to sing and do our job, that sometimes we don’t ask ourselves questions like: ‘Did I pay too much and get too little?’ This whole industry is telling us to be happy and grateful, and not to advocate for ourselves. But I think it’s important to not only be positive. Especially if you’re a woman and you’re a bit angry, people call you a bitch. But it’s not a bitchy quality, it’s a human quality to protect yourself and stay with the truth. I think it’s really important to speak about, if we want this business work for everybody, and not just for money.- Katsia Kaya

The P-51 Mustang is one of the most recognizable aircraft in military aviation history, and the story of “Berlin Express” illustrates just how far the Mustang’s legacy reaches.
The warbird’s story begins with American World War II aviator William B. “Bill” Overstreet who hailed from Clifton Forge, Virginia. After enlisting following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Overstreet trained with the U.S. Army Air Corps and was eventually deployed at Raydon Airfield in England. There he joined a squadron of the Eighth Air Force flying Republic P-47 Thunderbolts from RAF Leiston. As the AAF transition to the newer Mustang, Overstreet got his first opportunity to pilot a P-51 on January 30, 1944.
Overstreet named his first P-51, which he received in February 1944 “Southern Belle.” However, the aircraft was lost while being flown in combat by a different pilot a couple of weeks later, causing him to rethink the name. At the time, his squadron was assigned to bomber escort missions with the 357th fighter group regularly flying sorties to Germany, and thus the “Berlin Express” was born. All his subsequent planes went by the same moniker.
The “Berlin Express” P-51B Mustang achieved legendary status during an epic World War II dogfight in Paris in 1944, when Overstreet flew the aircraft under the Eiffel Tower in hot pursuit of a German fighter. Overstreet eventually downed the German Messerschmitt Bf 109G and eluded heavy enemy fire while escaping the battle with the “Berlin Express” intact. This victory was later immortalized by Len Krenzler in a painting of the “Berlin Express’” Eiffel Tower victory.
“Our man Bill was like Daredevil, the man without fear. Between flying so low and dodging enemy fire, he still shot a few bursts of his guns and hit the 109’s engine. In a last-ditch effort, the 109 flew under the Eiffel Tower hoping Overstreet would avoid it — NOPE!” recalled Brian Burnett II, Tour Guide at National Museum of the U.S. Air Force. “Bill followed him under the tower, and as the 109 pulled up, Bill sent him back down in flames. Afterwards, Bill went down to the river and followed it, barely above water level. Under the cover of the structures on either side, he made his way out of the city and back to base,” continued Burnett.
Today, the restored Mustang “Berlin Express” is based on the remains of the P-51B 43–24837. This Mustang flew with the 9th Air Force’s 363rd Fighter Group out of RAF Staplehurst in Kent, England. It crashed in Beckley on June 10, 1944, after the pilot was forced to bail out during a training exercise. Sporting a “Malcolm Hood” canopy and wearing the markings for “Berlin Express,” its paint scheme models the 357th Fighter Group Mustang that Overstreet made famous.
The modern day “Berlin Express” also made a historic transatlantic flight from the U.S. to England with U.S. Air Force Heritage Flight alumnus Lee Lauderback in the cockpit, following the same route it took in 1942 as part of the military troop buildup in the United Kingdom during WWII. The four-day, 5,470-mile journey began June 28, 2017, in Texas and culminated with its landing at Duxford Airfield in England on July 4.
Nearly 80 years after its original landmark moment, the “Berlin Express” will take to the skies with the Horsemen Flight Team in honor of the Italian Air Force’s centennial celebrations in Rome from June 16–18.
Dan Friedkin, who owns “Berlin Express,” will fly the historic aircraft and perform in the Pratica di Mare Air Show on the right wing alongside his longtime Horsemen Flight Teammates Jim Beasley, Jr. and Ed Shipley.
“The ‘Berlin Express’ is an iconic aircraft that symbolizes a defining period in the history of aerial combat,” said Dan Friedkin, chairman and CEO of The Friedkin Group, Horsemen Flight Team member and AS Roma football club president and owner. “It’s an honor to fly in the Pratica di Mare Air Show as we pay homage to the brave men and women who have shaped the course of military aviation. We’re excited to offer people around the world the chance to celebrate Aeronautica Militare’s memorable history and look forward to flying our routine for the first time in Rome, a city that holds a special place in my heart.”

But what exactly is Pictoplasma? Similar to the question posed in “The Matrix,” I found myself needing to discover the answer for myself. Let me explain: In 2004, I bought the first Pictoplasma character book in a bookstore in Switzerland and was completely captivated. I also visited their very informative website at the time and gathered that it was a meeting for character designers. Since that day, I wanted to attend Pictoplasma myself. However, it took me 20 years to finally make it. So in May 2024, I attended the conference in Berlin. On the first day, I felt a bit overwhelmed, not because of what was offered, but due to the organization. Everyone had to wait patiently until they could register. I felt a bit lost, but around 3:30 PM, things finally got started. I went to the registration and then directly to the first exhibitions by the artists who would be giving talks in the coming days. I saw some of the works and took them in. Then I wandered around the venue for a while.
The next day, the conference truly kicked off. According to the program, some highly renowned artists from the scene had gathered in Berlin. I attended talks by Joe Bennett, a young designer and animator from the USA. He recently made waves with his series “Scavenger Reign” on HBOMax, a sci-fi series that looks like it could have come from the mind of the artist Moebius. He has been working on this series for over seven years, and it will be available on Netflix in the coming months. His other works for Adult Swim and Fox also stand out, characterized by a quirky but endearing sense of humor.
Additionally, the artist duo “Los Calladitos” really impressed me. Their stunning murals depicting a fantastical world centered around the preservation of light captivated me. They work on their pieces with incredible care and creativity. They also showed some animations from their own film, which brought even more life to their characters and world. Unfortunately, I missed a talk by Peter The Roman, an artist known for experimenting with AI in his 3D worlds. However, I saw some of his works in the exhibitions spread across various locations in Berlin. Overall, 20 artists participated, giving talks and workshops.
But what sets Pictoplasma apart? It’s not merely a stage for artists; it’s also one of the largest communities in the realm of character art and animation. The “Artist Talks” provided profound insights into the world of artists: their methodologies, how they develop ideas and strategies, and how they publish, sell, and make a living from their art. It’s a platform for exchange and collaboration, bringing creatives from diverse backgrounds together. Moreover, the conference reflects the zeitgeist of 2024. In a world dominated by AI, Pictoplasma artists emphasize the importance of emotion and craftsmanship. It became evident that while AI is a valuable tool for ideation, the execution of most artists’ works remains in human hands. This realization, which I suspected before Pictoplasma, was confirmed and reinforced during the event. Indeed, the use of AI elevates the significance of handmade art. Consider, for instance, the wooden figures crafted by artist Parn “Ani” Aniwat, who carves more than 30 charming characters each month. Or reflect on Los Calladitos, who seamlessly transfer their unique style from the vast walls of their murals to their animated films. Even the ceramic lamps crafted by Portuguese artist and entrepreneur Ana Seixas demonstrate how handmade artworks garner special relevance and appreciation. Ultimately, one desires to touch the art that inundates our digital world.
All the days at Pictoplasma were incredibly lively and full of inspiration. One of the most interesting talks was by Philip Hunt, a creative director at AKA Studios from the UK. He shared his experiences and insights about design and art, particularly regarding the film industry and the challenges of adapting a children’s book like “Here We Are” by Oliver Jeffers into a film. He discussed the extensive thought and effort required to translate beautifully drawn 2D characters into a 3D medium. After many ideas and experiments, he and his team successfully turned the book into a beautiful film, which can be admired on Apple TV. By chance, I met Philip on Sunday, the last day of Pictoplasma, at a small flea market in Berlin. I approached him because I didn’t get the chance to talk to him at the event. We had a pleasant conversation about the industry, covering topics like advertising, films, and other media. He asked me how I found Pictoplasma, and I told him that initially, I didn’t know what to expect or what I would take away from it. He responded that each year, he takes away inspiration and a reminder of why he continues his work. He loves attending Pictoplasma, getting inspired by other artists, and gaining a perspective beyond commercial work. He also shared that he attended the first Pictoplasma 20 years ago and didn’t know what it was about back then either. Now, he teaches workshops and helps lead the Pictoplasma Academy. It was a very enjoyable conversation. So, what makes Pictoplasma so special? It’s the chance to see designers and artists doing something different from just working on commercial projects. This is something I can definitely take away from it. I was deeply moved by the following artist talks. One of them was by the artist Parn “Ani” Aniwat. Out of necessity, he began carving small figures out of wood. Now, he makes 30 pieces a month — small, cute characters that he sells to collectors and exhibitors. It has become his business. He gave us a glimpse into his workday, which runs from 9 to 5, after which he spends time with his family, sketches ideas, and watches Netflix. The same goes for the Portuguese artist and entrepreneur Ana Seixas. During the pandemic, she started working with pottery and created clay lamp characters that sold faster in her shop than she could make them.
Of course, even at a conference focused on hand-drawn, painted, or crafted characters, the topic of artificial intelligence can’t be avoided. Some artists use AI as a tool to support their ideas. However, despite the technology and digital capabilities that AI offers, traditional craftsmanship remains one of the most important aspects. While no one insists that art must be created by hand, most artists still find themselves holding a pencil or an Apple Pencil. One of the most memorable statements about AI came from Philip Hunt. A young designer from the audience asked him whether she should focus more on AI. He responded that she should focus on drawing, as AI will inevitably come. But drawing with a pencil would always convey ideas better (or something along those lines; I’m not certain of the exact wording). Another artist, possibly Christopher Rutledge, mentioned that AI is a useful tool but compared it to mastering image databases or programs like Photoshop or After Effects. Artists have shown that they engage with AI, but in the end, it’s their ideas and visions that they bring to life. For the past few months, I’ve felt that we are returning to an era of “handmade” artistry, especially in art, film, and design. With the overproduction of AI-generated images and texts, which now look and read quite well, the personal touch is often missing. A good example is animator Joe Taylor, who makes his style unmistakable with hand-drawn loops that resemble flat designs from claymation. He showcased a commercial clip for the ProCreate app, which he both drew and animated using their software.
Aside from the talks, there were workshops, exhibitions, and parties. Unfortunately, I couldn’t attend all the talks or everything that was offered. Given that Berlin is a very large city and the event organizers thought it would be a good idea to use various locations across the city, it wasn’t easy to be everywhere. There was also an AR scavenger hunt called Character Hunt, where participants had to travel around Berlin using the Adobe Aero app to view the characters. Great ideas, but too little time to experience everything. Attending Pictoplasma was a fascinating journey into the realm of art, characters, and animation. It was far more than I could have ever imagined back then. For me, it was a significant source of inspiration for my work as a designer. Here, I could discover new perspectives and gain a wealth of inspiration.
The most captivating talk was also the last one of Pictoplasma. It was by Mila Useche from Colombia. She is an artist and filmmaker who had a tough journey. She had to fight hard in the working world, including working for a game company where she worked up to 15 hours a day. She then became a freelancer, working for studios like Disney, Warner Brothers, Nickelodeon, and Netflix. She also worked on her own concepts and film ideas. One of these is currently being realized in a German-Colombian co-production.
Recently, there has been a crisis in many animation studios in the USA, with widespread layoffs and job cuts. Adding to this were the aftermath of the pandemic and the surge of companies eager to use AI. Mila needed to find a way out, so she began sharing her hand-drawn images on Instagram, reaching many people who celebrated her art. She now lives in Japan, where she produces her art and characters. That was Pictoplasma 2024. A few days in another world, a world full of inspiration, art, characters, and animated films. Just a different kind of matrix.

Fancy taking on a fast, flat World Major Marathon where world records are made? Here’s what you can expect if you’re thinking about running the Berlin Marathon!
The Berlin Marathon is one of the six Abbott World Major Marathons and is the fastest of them all. With only 285ft (87m) of elevation gain it’s not surprising Eliud Kipchoge ran world records here in 2018 and 2021, clocking a massive 2:01:09 at the latter.
So if you’re thinking about taking on a race that’s renowned for producing PBs, here’s what you can expect from running the Berlin Marathon.
Berlin Marathon sends lots of comms, but many were only in German. Yes, yes, I know it’s a race in Germany, but I’d signed up in English, selected my communication preference as ‘English’ so I didn’t understand why I was getting emails in German.
The pre-race programme was terrible — one of those useless digital e-books that was impossible to flip through a single page when using a mobile phone. And as the first half was in German (again, no issues with that) and second half in English, it was almost impossible to easily find the details you were looking for. Even a pdf would’ve been a big improvement on this, but for anyone with digital accessibility needs it would’ve been virtually impossible to find any information.
It was disappointing.
The Berlin Marathon Expo took place at Tempelhof Airport to the south of the city, an easy ride there on the U-bahn (which was free to ride for marathon runners during the whole time the Expo was open and on race day).
I arrived about 08:00 so I could take part in the Generali Berlin Marathon Shakeout Run. It was free to enter and anyone could attend, so if you were with family or friends (and they were happy running about 6k!) everyone could run (althought from 2023, the shakeout run has moved back to its usual spot at the Olympic Stadium, starting at 09:30).
It was very relaxed, I’d highly recommend taking part.
The Expo itself was inside several old airport hangars. It had quite an old-skool, Cold War-era vibe to it, which just added to the atmosphere of running in Berlin.
To enter, I had to show my race card (I’d added mine to my iPhone so it was quick and easy) and photographic ID, then they heat-sealed a wrist band to my wrist. I was told I needed to keep this on until after the race, but very frankly after the Expo, no-one asked for it — my race bib was enough. That said, I wouldn’t tamper with it, just in case… even though I had to cut mine off as there was no way it’d come loose by itself!
Race bib pickup was at the very back of the Expo and once there was quick and easy. If you’d bought a finisher’s t-shirt, you had to pick that up at another counter, where you had to go outside, join a queue, then come back inside the hangar. It again was quick, but not very intuitive.
Adidas had loads of official gear for sale, so if you liked the Berlin Marathon merchandise you could load up before you left.
My family had come with me to Berlin so I’d signed the kids up to do the kids’ races taking place on the Saturday. The first was the Bambini Run for my 5 year-old, which also took place at Tempelhof.
It was pretty congested getting the kids to the start line and they didn’t allow parents through for our age category (parents could accompany the 0–2 year olds and 3–4 year olds, but not the 5–6 year olds onwards). I was a concerned my Little Girl would freak out being by herself — especially as most of the announcements were only in German — but she was fine, the marshals were great at herding the kids around and she finished with a beaming smile on her face!
Her run was only about 500m, but it was enough so she felt like she had taken part.
On the Saturday afternoon, there was a Mini-Marathon for older kids, starting at Potsdamer Platz. There was very little information about it online — and nothing in English — so I’d emailed the organisers and asked how I could sign up my son and they were very quick to get back to me with a link and a code.
Apparently the Mini-Marathon — which covers the last 4.195km of the main Berlin Marathon route — is a big schools event, with around 10,000 schoolchildren from all over Germany participating. We had a bit of a nightmare trying to pickup my son’s race bib as apparently pickup at the Expo had ended on the Thursday and when we got there on Saturday, no-one at SCC (the event organiser) knew what was happening. We eventually found the bib pickup area but it was closed down.
So we headed to the start line in Potsdamer Platz and asked SCC there, and got Little Man’s bib in about 60 seconds — very easy! Although by this point they only had large finisher’s t-shirts left, so he’s got a good few years to grow into it!
He absolutely loved the race, it was by far the largest he’d participated in and he even got to run through the Brandenburg Gate before I did!
Collecting him afterwards was hugely stressful, however. There was no clear signage on where to go — all the parents headed into the Berlin Marathon finisher’s area but the actual end of the Mini-Marathon was further down the road. There were also two exits, so we were freaking out a bit as we didn’t anticipate that so had no idea where Little Man would emerge. I took one exit and my wife took the other, and thankfully I found him pretty quickly.
So from his perspective, the Mini-Marathon was awesome… I’m so happy he enjoyed it but as a parent it was a massive stress from start to finish.
On Marathon Day itself, getting to the start line of the Berlin Marathon was one of the easiest experiences I’ve ever had.
No need to get up in the middle of the night to catch a ferry to Staten Island like you do when running the New York Marathon, or jumping on a bus from pretty much the finish line to the start if you run the Athens Authentic Marathon or Boston Marathon.
Berlin Marathon starts in Tiergarten near the Reichstag and travel by U-bahn and S-bahn is free, with the trains run every few minutes.
There’s not much there at the start village of the Berlin Marathon.
I only recall massive queues for toilets (until the men discovered they had outdoor urinals). There were also many bag drop areas, which you could walk up to and drop-off without queuing.
Before entering my corral, I found a small piece of ground to run some warm-up loops, then saw a team mate from my running club so we headed into the corrals together.
There are no toilets in the corrals, but there are more toilets and urinals just before you enter. And if you’re tempted to go in the bushes you’ll be out of luck — literally everywhere was fenced off, so it was either go in the toilets/ urinals or not at all.
Berlin Marathon is a loop, starting and finishing in Tiergarten in the city centre.
You start in the park just beyond the Reichstag parliament building and head west past Victory Monument before turning right and looping round Tiergarten and into Mitte.
There are a couple of small bridges over the Spree but you’ll barely feel them. The first ‘uphill’ segment is around Mile 4, with an elevation gain of +25ft (7.6m). There’s another +22ft (6.7m) segment in Mile 6, then the course is virtually flat until Mile 19 when there’s a -26ft (7.9m) segment and another downhill -24ft (7.3m) segment in Mile 21.
So bottom line is, you’re not really going to feel any of the elevation gain, but there are a couple of nice (but short!) downhill sections later in the race.
The Berlin Marathon begins to draw to a close running through Potsdamer Platz, where the crowds become thronging again. Support is great along the entire marathon course, and even though for 90% of the race it’s thin, the crowd gives off a welcoming vibe.
Lots of families were out supporting, with dozens of kids looking for high-fives, which was really motivating. Berlin Marathon also prints your name on your bib, and even though my name is difficult for non-English speakers to pronounce I had more personal shout-outs running the Berlin Marathon than any other race. You really feel a close connection with the crowd.
The final stretch of the Berlin Marathon has you running through the famous Brandenburg Gate and past the Reichstag to the finish line. But as the Brandenburg Gate is still a good 400m from the finish line, it’s prudent to hold off that sprint finish until you get a little closer!
Water and aid stations are plentiful along the course, the first set are at the 5k mark and then every 2.5k afterwards. Just watch out for the brown liquid — it’s cold, sweet tea, so not to everyone’s liking!
Eliud Kipchoge may have ran a new world record that day, but I knew I wasn’t going to PB at the Berlin Marathon.
I’d had a terrible training block over the summer with two consecutive injuries that put me out for five weeks, then two weeks before the Berlin Marathon I caught COVID-19.
I also had to think about running the Chicago Marathon two weeks later, so for me the Berlin Marathon was going to be an exercise in discipline.
I decided to try to run negative splits for the first time at this distance, running the first 20 miles between 7:20 and 7:40 min/ mile, then seeing what I could give for the last 10k.
I managed to clock my first 5 miles at an average pace of 7:35 mins/ mile, then upped it to 7:20 mins/ mile up to Mile 20. I felt surprisingly good at this point, so cracked on to average 6:50 mins/ mile for the last 10k, with a sprint finish peaking at 4:59 mins/ mile at the end.
Without any hills or other notable terrain to contend with — unlike the monster hill in the middle of the Athens Authentic Marathon or the ups and downs of the New York Marathon over the many bridges — Berlin Marathon lets you focus on what pace you’d like to run to achieve your goal.
I can see why it’s so fast!
The Chicago Marathon may be flatter, but Chicago suffers from poor GPS coverage through The Loop, which makes it hard to know exactly how fast you’re going at the start and the halfway point, plus all those 90-degree bends mean you slow down at every corner.
Berlin Marathon, on the other hand, just flows, and bar one sharp turn just before Mile 3 when the two lanes of runners merge, the rest was easy going.
Post-race was excellent!
There was a massive positive vibe as Kipchoge had just ran a new world record, then the sun started to peep out. It had been a comfortable 12C (54F) for the race, so the timing (for me at least) was perfect.
You get your medal pretty much right after you finish, then water and a few other bits and pieces. It’s about a 1km walk to the end of the finish area, where it’s extremely important NOT to miss the Erdinger tents giving out their Alkoholfrei beer!
I headed to the grassed area in front of the Reichstag and sat on my poncho, drinking in the sun and my ice cold beer. I could’ve stayed there much longer, but besides the Erdinger tents there wasn’t much else going on. So after half an hour to chill, I headed back to the U-bahn station and my hotel for a well-earned bath.
I really, really enjoyed running the Berlin Marathon.
Even though the organisation wasn’t always been plain sailing up until race day, the Berlin Marathon itself was superb.
The atmosphere was relaxed, the support had a real warmth to it and the course lets you concentrate on your race.
One thing I will say about the Berlin Marathon is that it’s hard to notice anything specific about many of the areas you run through as they all kinda blend into one. Sure, the downtown area around Potsdamer Platz had a unique vibe to it, but bar the final mile through the Brandenburg Gate I had no idea where in the city I was at any given time. For sure that’s mostly on me for not being very familiar with Berlin, but I didn’t have the same issues when running the New York Marathon or running the Chicago Marathon, where it’s very clear when you move from one borough or neighbourhood to another.
This isn’t really a criticism, just an observation, and it certainly hasn’t put me off wanting to run the Berlin Marathon again.
As one of the six Abbott World Major Marathons, Berlin Marathon always sells out every year. So if you’re thinking about entering, you’ll need to be fast!
Odds through the lottery are decent — I got in on my first attempt — and it opens right after the race finishes, so one year ahead. Time qualifiers need to meet a pretty tough standard — a sub-2:45 for men aged 44 and under and a sub-3:00 for women in the same age bracket.
But if you’re looking for a marathon PB on a fast, flat course with amazing support, give running the Berlin Marathon a go!

One of my favorite hobbies is collecting inspirations of art and design I come across while browsing the internet. Thanks to those new “save” features in apps like Pinterest or Instagram, I’m able to build little digital art museums for myself. I have thousands of “saved” pictures, from vintage photography to exotic art collage. One day I caught myself amused by the simple, elegant, extremely creative logo of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.
Whatever your career is, imagine yourself designing an orchestra logotype. First, you’d take a look at previous creations: mostly elegant curve-shaped designs with ornamental details or typographies. In color patterns, you’d see a majority of red, black and white, sometimes blue or green.
Second, you’d might brainstorm general aspects of orchestras. I’ll help: Tradition. Old Style. Chic. Elegant. Perfection. Beauty. Cult. Deep emotions. Beethoven. The frequency of sound wave. Instruments. Symphonies. The treble clef. The air-drawn lines of a baton.
The ordinary “elegant curve-shaped designs” illustrates these round elements of an orchestra. Music is not “straight”. Emotions are not “straight”. What about the color pattern? They are clearly trying to call attention, communicate passion (red tones) in a classic and elegant way (black, white tones) with notes of respectfulness or loyalty (blue, green tones).
The access to a huge source of inspiration enables the creation of my little digital museums, but it also harms uniqueness. You can create something beautiful and well constructed, but it’s easy to fall into ordinary. You can find many “how-to-do-a-beautiful-orchestra-logo-in-10-steps”, but the real challenge is to be creative and unique and still carry the message you are trying to transmit.
Well, here is why the Berlin Philharmonic logotype owned it:
This overlapped series of pentagon forms (straight lines), instead of illustrating common aspects of an orchestra, communicates the masterful architectural work of Hans Scharoun (1832–1972) for the orchestra’s concert hall, previously all fan or shoebox shaped.
The chosen yellow, a color that’s uncommon for this market, grabs attention, transmits creativity, motivation, optimism, and warmth. That conveys the Berlin Philharmonic is a modern, vivid, joyful orchestra but also warm — musically and emotionally deep.
There is also an easter egg: The overlapped pentagons clearly but not perfectly represent the floor plan of the concert hall. These overlapped pentagons suggest, besides all, a circular movement:
Yes. Circular. Do I have to say more? The logotype merges, in an exquisite way, an architectural uniqueness that characterizes the Berlin Philharmonic, without forgetting the musicality, elegancy, and round elements that surrounds an orchestra. All of those represented, with not a single curve.
“Good design is obvious. Great design is transparent.”
— Joe Sparano

You might expect a 91-year-old to have plenty of leisure hours. Not Francis Kilduff. The WWII veteran is so busy putting the final touches on his latest docudrama and hobnobbing at the USO headquarters, he barely made it to the theater. Though he managed to carve some time out of his weekend to enjoy a pre-performance meal at the Geffen Playhouse, he’s hurriedly slicing into his beef and hoping he doesn’t miss curtain.
It’s the Sunday night before Veteran’s Day, and Geffen has invited military vets not only to take in the final dress rehearsal of Hershey Felder as Irving Berlin, but also to enjoy a catered dinner buffet. Partnering with the Gary Sinise Foundation (Sinise and Randall Arney, Geffen’s Artistic Director, are pals from their days working together at Chicago’s Steppenwolf Theatre), the Geffen celebrates veterans by hosting these special veterans nights for every Gil Cates Theater subscription production. As a proud partner of Blue Star Theatres, the Geffen Playhouse also offers veterans free tickets to season productions year-round.
But tonight is extra special. For most of these vets, Irving Berlin composed the soundtracks to their lives.
Seated at the table with Kilduff is Alan Bertik, an affable vet who was on a Navy destroyer in the Korean War (“It was 30 below,” he says, chuckling). He and his wife used to usher at the Geffen. They saw Felder perform one New Year’s Eve, but he’s especially excited about this show for the simple reason that he knows most of the music. Of course, everyone knows the biggies: “White Christmas,” “There’s No Business Like Show Business,” “Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning.” Still, Berlin’s catalog is so expansive — he wrote at least 1,500 songs — there are many that history has forgotten. Yet the men and women who fell in love, broke up and fell in love again remember them fondly.
“Of course I’m excited!” Kilduff chimes in. “That’s my era.”
Hershey Felder has crafted one-man shows based on Gershwin, Chopin, Beethoven and Bernstein, creating experiences that are half concerto, half stage play. In fact, they’re so unique he’s become quite famous not only in Southern California, with many premieres at the Geffen, plus performances at Pasadena Playhouse, Laguna Playhouse, San Diego Rep and the Old Globe, but also across the nation and world. (You can read more about his work in a recent American Theatre magazine article that is also re-published as the program note for the show.)
For Hershey Felder as Irving Berlin, Felder recounts Berlin’s life story by weaving memories into songs. During the peformance, Felder plays one of Berlin’s most famous songs, “God Bless America,” and invites the audience to sing along. As voices surged with pride during the dress rehearsal, there were more than a few eyes filled with tears. The one constant in Berlin’s life — from being an immigrant baby to a “singing waiter” to Fred Astaire’s best bud to a lonely recluse — was that he found comfort in music. Berlin may be America’s most famous composer, but to that end, he’s not so different than the rest of us.

It’s been 5 months since we moved to Berlin; I’m still astonished we pulled it off as a family. Here are some things we did and learned along the way:
That’s it. I don’t mean to sound cheeky but it’s actually completely doable and only seems daunting in principle. Once you’re executing, you’re operating a checklist, it becomes all about unwavering project management. The biggest deal breaker for us was the school and it worked out rather well.
I’ve got a ton of early impressions and can only spew them out in random order:

I was in Berlin, Germany, on May 8th; the 80th anniversary of the day that German forces surrendered unconditionally to the Allies, marking the end of WW2 in Europe. This day is sometimes referred to as “VE Day” (Victory in Europe Day). What a fitting place to be for this momentous occasion.
I have been in Berlin twice before. My first visit, in the summer of 1963 when I was 15 years old, was as part of a “teen tour” of Europe. Asleep in a Berlin hotel, I was awakened by gunfire. The construction of the Berlin Wall (at first, a barbed wire fence) began in August 1961 and in the years following, many people were shot as they tried to escape from East into West Berlin.
My second visit was 24 years ago, as part of a small group from the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, visiting historic sites in Eastern Europe that included memorials, museums, and several concentration camps. Sachsenhausen, one such camp near Berlin, is in the village of Oranienburg. It began as a slave labor camp for “political prisoners” with many subcamps. Still visible are barracks and the ruins of buildings in which remain the remnants of a gas chamber, medical experimentation areas, torture and killing areas, and several crematoria. Prisoners were treated inhumanely, inadequately fed, and openly killed. If you are reading this article, you probably know the list of who would be considered enemies of the state. A partial list includes those against the Reich whether they were Christian, Protestant, Jewish, Coptic, Roma, Communists, Gays, and anyone who was perceived to be mentally or physically disabled. This camp, not unlike others, was not on the outskirts of town. It was in the town. An alleyway separates the town from the gates to the camp with the words “Arbeit Macht Frei” (Works Sets You Free) welded into the gate. This place was not hidden. Quite the contrary, it was wide open to view and more importantly to odor. With several crematoria where bodies were burned, the smell and the ash wafted over the town, falling onto people’s rose gardens as well as onto the town residents themselves.
But I digress. Twenty four years ago, when I visited this camp, there was a person with us who, as a young man, had been a prisoner in Sachsenhausen. Somehow, miraculously, he survived. A Christian man, he had been a journalist, soon to be married, but that did not happen. It was a privilege to see the camp through his eyes, and listen as he recounted his experiences, some of which he had thought he buried along with his fellow inmates.
This was a sacred place whose stories were told to keep alive the memory of those who perished and those who survived. For decades after the war ended, “Never Again” was repeated to ensure that this kind of unleashed hatred and vitriol, resulting in these sorts of inhuman actions, would never happen again. And most of us in the world were confident that nothing like this could ever happen again!
This visit was different.
First, I am different. I am 24 years older. What I try to convince myself of is “unbelievable.” I need to believe.
Second, the world is different. Hatred, vitriol, and cruelty have become normalized. The vile antisemitic tropes that were used to degrade and denigrate people are not only ripe, but they are blossoming. Regrettably, in many places, they are in full bloom. This kind of hate flourishes on the dark web, and in the full light of day. Repulsive speech and actions have become acceptable. Throughout the world we see the rise of political parties with slogans reminiscent of a world which we thought could never be resurrected. And not only is it resurrected, but these parties have also gained representation in congresses and parliaments in the same countries where brave citizens sacrificed and fought against this to make the world safe for all.
Third, the camp is not the same. Shockingly, there are some people who visit the camp, stand next to the crematory ruins, on the rim of the entrance of the first experiment for a gas chamber, beside the remains of a barracks, who say: “this did not happen.” When you tell a lie often enough, people tend to believe it. That’s what happened prior to and during World War II. And in many parts of our world, it is happening now.
I am at a time in my life when more people than not ask me “When are you going to retire?” Here’s my response. Not only am I not going to retire, I am also committing to rededicate myself to engaging in education programs and social justice issues concerning basic human rights related to antisemitism and anti-LGBTQ hatred. All in, in my “golden years” I will not stand by and silently witness the normalization of hatred.
I write this article with both a heavy and a hopeful heart. When I say things are unbelievable, I reinforce in my own mind that I shouldn’t believe them. I am awake to the reality and the knowledge that I must believe what I see, hear, and witness. When I believe it, I will be able to address it in ways that, hopefully, will change where we are, and where we can go as a civil society.
We can choose hate, or we can choose to stand up to hate. We can be silent, or we can call people out when they say or do things that are rooted in prejudice and hate. Each of us can use our voice and our platform for good. We can choose to make excuses for bad behavior, or we can call it out. We can acquaint ourselves with history. We can familiarize ourselves with the consequences when hate is permitted to run amok. We can call out when we see lies presented as truth. And we can challenge people who are fearful or intimidated into saying and behaving in ways that are unacceptable.
When we sit by as people are being dehumanized, referred to as the “other,” we are at the entrance to the gates of Hell. I went through those gates as a tourist. I’ve listened to and read testimonies, seen films and photographs of what Hell looks like. If we consider ourselves members of the human race, we need to take that membership seriously and be aware of what it means to be human. To have hope in the future we need to discover compassion within and speak out against antisemitism and all forms of hate. We cannot excuse the inexcusable and we must believe the unbelievable.
In life’s most challenging moments, how we respond influences both our immediate wellbeing and long-term recovery. Crises arrive uninvited, testing our resilience when we feel most vulnerable. The following tips offer guidance through the turbulence, toward steadier ground.
Remain Calm: When crisis emerges, take a gentle body scan — notice your breathing, pulse, and physical sensations. Do not judge, just observe. Then begin to breathe and focus on your breath. The key is to avoid panic. When we panic, we cannot solve problems effectively. The goal is to think clearly while being aware of what is happening in your body. During this process, pause, take more slow, deep breaths. For some people, repeating prayers that offer solace, doing mindful practice, mindfulness, or engaging playfully with a pet can help.
Assess The Situation: From this centered state notice where you are physically, mentally, and emotionally. Then, identify the elements defining the crisis. What risks exist? What consequences might follow different actions? This assessment doesn’t require perfect information — only honest recognition of what is known and unknown in this moment.
Create Safety: Do what you need to get out of harm’s way. Look around, listen attentively, and notice your surroundings with fresh eyes. Take actions that move you toward greater security, extending this same protective attention to others if they’re with you.
Gather Your Support Circle: Reach out to those whose compassion brings calm — trusted friends, family members, professionals, or others who have walked similar paths. Seek those who offer the support you need rather than imposing what they believe you should want. Throughout the situation, maintain connection with beloved others. Consider engaging in creative activities that redirect mental energy — photography, gardening, music, reading, or writing — offering your mind the opportunity to “reset.”
Communicate with Transparency: Share information others need to hear to assist you, especially during medical emergencies when providers need accurate knowledge of your condition to offer effective care with minimal risk. Honest communication about symptoms, relevant medical history, concerns, and needs, creates the foundation for receiving proper assistance.
Create a Crisis Plan: Consider creating a simple emergency kit kept in your vehicle or near an exit. Maintain accessible records of essential medications, identification, and emergency contacts — both digitally and physically. Identify people who might assist with temporary housing, caregiving, pet-care, or other practical needs that could arise.
Honor Your Fundamental Needs: In crisis, the basics become precious: adequate rest, nourishment, hydration, and moments of quiet. Reflect on what essentials you require and consider how to ensure access to these necessities even during disruption. Tending to these fundamental needs becomes an act of self-compassion during challenging times.
Remember that getting through times of crisis times isn’t about handling everything perfectly. It’s about showing up as best we can, being kind to ourselves, and figuring things out as we go. Sometimes the hardest moments teach us what we’re made of and connect us more deeply to what matters. We might surprise ourselves with what we can handle, even when it feels impossible at first.
I’ve co-authored a book about kindness. I believe deeply in the lasting effects of love. It is in that context that I share my own daily habit. Each morning, I say thank you for another day and ask for an opportunity to make a difference in this world.
To that end, I look for signs of connection to those who came before me — a robin reminds me that my father is near, a butterfly reminds me of my mother. I feel their presence and listen for their guidance. Certain songs transport me to moments in my past, conjuring places, people, and, sometimes, lessons learned.
This daily habit provides continuity to my life. I’m grateful that my journey has been a healthy one so far. Though everything is unpredictable, I express gratitude however I can and move through the world appreciating all the companions I’ve known along the way.

It’s not simply a restaurant, it’s an experience. You’ll find it in Sweden’s agricultural heartland, about an hour from Copenhagen’s airport. Daniel Berlin Krog, a dining experience worthy of 2 Michelin stars.
To call it a restaurant doesn’t do justice to the careful preparation and exquisite presentation of locally sourced ingredients in the hands of a team who respect the palate’s power to delight, nurture, comfort and celebrate.
Paired with 5 wines hailing from France, Germany, and Spain — from dry whites to a sweeter varietal that foreshadowed the close of the meal — the lunch tasting menu was a taste bud explosion.
I was lucky enough to enjoy the experience on a brilliant autumn afternoon. Read this and you’ll be planning a visit, I promise.
Nestled in the hamlet of Skåne-Tranås, in an unassuming farmhouse with an ample farm garden in the back, luncheon guests are greeted with a glass of champagne to start. Because, well, why not.

Twenty five years ago this week, TV images flashed on screen of people singing and dancing atop the Berlin Wall.
It seemed almost impossible. I gulped, smiled and felt all tingly.
The fall of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9, 1989, was emotional and personal for me. Years earlier, I had lived on the free side of the divided city at the height of the Cold War as an American military high school student. Were our neighbors trapped in the East now free after nearly three decades of Soviet control?
To stem the flow of East Berliners who wanted to escape, a jagged 27-mile wall cut the city into two halves, and 100 miles of barbed wire encircled the back half of West Berlin, making it an island city. But as American military dependents, we enjoyed a good life and freedom in a cosmopolitan half protected by American, British and French soldiers.
Those in East Berlin experienced a daily existence that was dreary and drab behind a 13-foot-tall concrete barrier. Although all roads in West Berlin ended at the wall, we couldn’t help but see the oppression on the other side. “This wall is an illusion,” read graffiti painted on the free side. “You stand like a scab, an unhealing wound,” were scrawled words I still remember today.
With my father’s U.S. Air Force status we were allowed to venture into the East. We occasionally drove through the famous Checkpoint Charlie border crossing in our gigantic1962 Pontiac Star Chief. During day trips, we would purchase camera gear, crystal glassware and wall clocks in shops intended for visiting communist dignitaries.
We avoided the regular markets with no fresh fruit, and shoe stores with only one size, style and color.
On one outing my family returned to our car to find people standing by the trunk, which was large enough to hold three people. They asked us to take them over to the West.
My father just shook his head “no” and told us to get in the car. He had heard of other GI’s who had smuggled East Berliners back to the West and were caught by the American military police. U.S. officials would immediately transfer those soldiers who risked an international incident. They would be sent from West Berlin (a plum assignment) to a desolate outpost in South Korea as punishment the next day, or so the rumor went.
On my 16th birthday, my father took me over to the East for dinner at the Moscow Haus, a high-end restaurant frequented by communist officials. Within minutes, a man in a Russian uniform joined us at the table. In decent English, he asked about the stripes on my father’s uniform and what they meant.
I remember great awkwardness and a racing heartbeat as the soldier continued to sit with us as we remained silent. Finally the Soviet officer returned to his own table. Who was he? Where did he come from? Could we have disappeared that night, deep in the heart of East Berlin?
Another time we tried to buy a motorcycle in a showroom full of choices, or so we thought. The clerk pulled a big book from behind the counter and asked us to write in our name and address. “Three years,” he told us. “What about these in the store?” we asked. No, those were just for display, he said. We would need to get on a list and wait, so we declined.
While the Soviet east sat basically untouched and neglected for 28 years, the fall of the Wall led to massive, but slow, renovations.
The former districts of East Berlin today are festive places, full of upscale townhouses, offbeat art galleries and ethnic restaurants. Playhouses host performances that rival those of New York and Las Vegas, and American celebrities like Matt Damon and Tom Cruise turn up weekly for vacations or movie premieres.
The former swath that cut through the center of city has provided prime real estate for development again, especially along the Spree River. The city’s subway systems are united and provide seamless and efficient transportation for Berlin’s 3.5 million people.
Everything happens on a grand scale, whether it’s a massive fireworks display at the Brandenburg Gate on New Year’s Eve or the opening of Europe’s largest train station days before the 2006 World Cup soccer tournament began. The main government building, Der Reichstag, is a contrast of visions — with old style below and a futurist glass dome above that allows visitors to peer into the legislative chamber below.
By guiding University of Florida student journalists the past 10 years on study-abroad trips, I have been privileged to help tell the story of a reborn Berlin. Armed with digital cameras, voice recorders and laptops, UF students have spent two weeks every May since 2005 reporting on a cross-section of Berliners. From the city where I discovered my interest in photojournalism, we document some of the people and places that exemplify Berlin’s ongoing spirit of freedom. It’s a subtle revelation as the students come to understand the significance of what they are seeing and feeling.
Many return to Florida saying they’ve been changed; they have felt the underlying spirit of survival, transformation, creativity and openness. Most are surprised and enthralled that the city lives up its reputation of “anything goes.” Some students feel more patriotic after learning and seeing first-hand how American forces kept the city alive following World War II. Some say they want to return to Berlin and open a coffee shop – or work for the Fat Tire Bike Tour company. Most have heard the expression first-hand from Berliners that “you can be who you want to be in Berlin.”
All remember Dr. Pong — a virtually unmarked club where the only entertainment is a single ping-pong table and loud music. Holding a beverage in one hand and a paddle in the other, up to 30 partiers circle the table in a counter-clockwise motion, enjoying a group game that shrinks in size as players miss and have to sit out. After the final two players battle for the championship, the winner bangs the table three times with his paddle, and everyone starts up again. It’s a happy mix – a free-for-all of ages, styles, religions and politics.
Dr. Pong is only a hole-in-the-wall pub, a relic in the former East. It’s poorly lit, has unadorned concrete walls and is full of choking smoke. Yet it speaks volumes about the edginess of Berlin, the acceptance of others and the freedom that the united city now enjoys.
Twenty-five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Germany’s capital continues to reinvent itself, balancing between an historic past and an optimistic future to remain one of the world’s leading cities. I’m proud to be a part of that transformation every year.

La Casa De Papel or Money Heist was the Picasso of Heist series with a powerful cast, sky-high stakes, and a plot with more twists than a DNA strand. Berlin on the other hand is a series that softens the psychopathic image of the enigmatic heist player in Money Heist.
Make no mistake, Berlin in La Casa de Papel was a monster who raped, killed, and looted just because he could do it. But the Money Heist Spinoff Berlin series portrays his human side that is slightly empathetic, pathologically romantic, and mindful.
Berlin opens with Pedro Alonso saying goodbye to his third wife, in true Bollywood style — it’s raining when this happens and the mood is somber. This immediately cuts to Berlin figuratively AND literally stepping into a heist with his key players.
[Andrés de Fonollosa is the true name of the fictional character Berlin, played to perfection by Pedro Alonso in this mild heist series. But to stay true to the theme of this review we shall refer to our protagonist as the titular Berlin.]
There’s Keila, the electronics engineering wizard who is pathologically shy, Roi the misanthrope, Damian the genius absent-minded professor, and Bruce the point man who is good at everything in general.
Later on, Berlin introduces us to the unstable bombshell Cameron. So begins the grand heist that involves the theft of 44 Million euros worth of jewels. The cliched heist music is a bit too on the nose, but definitely not out of place in the first episode.
The heist in itself is pretty simple by Money Heist standards, where Berlin’s team tunnels into a Parisian vault to steal jewels. There is a Rick and Morty episode that echoes the same visuals as this series with a hand holding a red jewel.
The main antagonist in this series is Berlin’s romanticism and foolhardiness. It is also necessary to make the plot interesting, else there would be nothing to make this heist really exciting. He falls for the wife of the mark whom they are targeting which becomes most of the plot as you continue watching.
Damian represents the brains of the operation as the professor did in the Money Heist seasons. He also goes through issues with his wife but handles it way better than the impulsive and still-human Berlin.
Read Love and Monsters (2020) Movie Review
The visuals in this series are beautiful although not as amazing as the ones in Money Heist. There is one particular scene where Berlin rejects Camille at first but then walks in to kiss her in a lift chamber with his approach shown from a mirror in the lift. This scene is particularly well done.
Apart from great shots of Paris, the vault, and the tunnel they take to reach the vault there is not much else to look forward to. I am not saying these are not great but, compared to La Casa de Papel it’s not mind-blowing.
You might like The Mission Impossible Franchise So Far
There are three characters that the plot revolves around with the rest of the characters having subplots that are not that interesting. There is Berlin, his love interest Camille played by Samantha Siqueiros, and Tristán Ulloa as Damián the professor.
While Berlin seems almost sane in this series, Damian is undergoing a lot of turmoil in his marital life. Camille plays a clueless, daydreaming, 1.5-dimensional wife of a wealthy man who is ready to be swept off her feet by Berlin.
I have to single out Begoña Vargas playing Cameron as she is beautiful and rugged both in real life and as her character. She could have been given a meatier role, but none of the characters in this series have a substantial role apart from being a background for Berlin’s origin story.
Read The Boys Series on Prime Video — A Reality Check for Superheroes
If you have not watched Money Heist and are into romance, then go for it. If you have watched La Casa de Papel and don’t mind a Heist series that is mediocre and has time to kill, then sure, you can watch it as well.
In case you are a hardcore fan of the Money Heist series or even Money Heist Korea, and love how layered they are then don’t. Do not expect any plot twists, fantastic heist set-ups, or even complex characters.

I travel the world exploring high tech low life places. Most of these places are in Asia, but what about Europe? Wikipedia Cyberpunk page mentioned Sony Center in Berlin as an example of cyberpunk-influenced cityscape. Modern incarnations of cyberpunk are exact focus of this blog, so we’re going to Germany!
First place we’ll visit is Potsdamer Platz in Berlin’s central borough called Mitte.
This place is awesome and looks more like Manhattan than a German city.
Being a kid in late 90s I loved a TV show called “Total Recall 2070”. It was loosely based on Philip K. Dick works. Plots of most episodes are quite cheesy, but its futuristic atmosphere was so damn dark and sinister! And you know what? Potsdamer Platz looks and feels exactly like Total Recall 2070.
As I know, no cyberpunk books or movies are based in Berlin, but they definitely should!
Berlin is worth visiting just for Potsdamer Platz, but let’s proceed to the Sony Center, which is nearby.
It is easy to approach Sony Center from Potsdamer Platz, just go where all the neon lights are.
This area consists mostly of shopping malls, offices, restaurants. But who cares? For me it looks exactly like William Gibson’s 80s vision of the future.
Large shining dome reminds me of Highlander 2 movie. By the way, the movie was very much high tech and low life.
Offices on the sides of Sony Center looks super futuristic even without glowing neon lights.
The area of Sony Center and nearby office buildings is quite crowded and noisy. Walk couple of minutes westward and suddenly the streets become empty.
Approaching Tiergarten, Berlin’s central park. It is completely empty at 8pm.
Going to Unter den Linden street, which passes Mitte horizontally. Westernmost part of the street is a place of famous Brandenburg Gate and different government building.
But let’s go east, where Berlin looks more hi tech and noire.
Probably low life is not what you’ll find here, but central Berlin still has its dark vibe at night with techno clubs and dark cold streets.
Mitte reminds me both Manhattan and Moscow, but feels darker than each of them.
Speaking of Moscow, we’re approaching Alexanderplatz which looks a lot like large soviet city, rather than Western Europe.
Which is quite obvious, since this district was a part of Eastern Germany.
When it is foggy, Alexanderplatz feels like a vampire movie.
Visiting Berlin is definitely a good idea for dark future fans. Other districts look less dark, but still interesting to explore. Berlin is easy to reach via major airlines (sometimes with connection in Frankfurt or Munich) and its relatively cheap, comparing to other Western Europe capital cities.

Travel Date: Oct 25, 2022Trip Duration: 4 daysLocation: BerlinCountry: Germany
It was late October, and autumn had fully embraced Europe. The air was crisp, the leaves were golden, and I found myself in a refreshed state of mind after months of routine in the Netherlands. My last adventure had been to Belgium, and I felt the need for another break — a chance to both recharge and reconnect with a close friend living in Berlin. With that in mind, I booked a BlaBla car, a budget-friendly option, for the 7-hour drive. It was a journey shared with strangers, but the ride turned out to be quite enjoyable, with pleasant conversations and the excitement of traveling to a new place.
As we approached Berlin in the evening, my first glimpse of the city was the iconic Fernsehturm, the famous TV Tower. Bathed in the soft evening light, it loomed over the skyline like a symbol of Berlin’s complex past. Once a broadcasting tower and a proud symbol of Communist power, today it stands as one of the city’s most recognizable landmarks. My first impression of the city was a blend of awe and anticipation.
Eager to experience Berlin, I spent some time wandering the lively streets, soaking in the urban energy and the distinct buzz of the city. The streets were a blend of old and new, modern cafes and shops nestled between centuries-old buildings that told their own stories of Berlin’s history. Eventually, I made my way to my friend’s apartment. It had been years since we last saw each other, so catching up felt like a breath of fresh air. After settling in and relaxing for a bit, my friend decided it was time to introduce me to Berlin’s legendary nightlife. The city came alive after dark, and we hopped from one lively spot to another, enjoying the pulse of the city.
The next day, on the 26th of October, I had planned something a little more structured — a walking tour booked through GuruWalk. The morning air was chilly but refreshing, and I made it to the meeting point just in time. Our guide, knowledgeable and passionate, took us on a historical journey through Berlin’s war-torn past. One of the first stops was Checkpoint Charlie, the best-known crossing point between East and West Berlin during the Cold War. Standing there, I could almost feel the tension and uncertainty that must have hung in the air during those days of division.
As we moved on, we visited the site of Hitler’s final bunker, the very place where he spent the last moments of his life. It was a sobering experience, knowing that beneath the unassuming ground lay a chapter of history that shaped the world. The tour continued, and soon we found ourselves at the Brandenburg Gate, standing tall and proud. This grand monument, once a symbol of division, now stands for unity and peace. Under the unexpectedly warm autumn sun, I took a few photos, trying to capture the magnificence of the gate with its classical columns and rich history. After lingering there for a bit, basking in the sun, I met a traveler from the United States. We clicked immediately, and together, we decided to continue exploring.
Our next destination was the Konzerthaus Berlin, an elegant concert hall known for its neoclassical architecture. The grandeur of the place was awe-inspiring, and I could almost imagine the musical performances that must have filled the air with harmony and culture. We walked the historical streets, each corner revealing layers of Berlin’s rich and sometimes tumultuous past. Eventually, we found ourselves at Berlin Cathedral, a majestic structure that has stood since the 1800s. The cathedral was imposing, with its grand dome and intricate details. Inside, it houses a massive organ with 7,269 pipes, a royal tomb, and offers breathtaking views of the city from its dome. We admired the architecture and strolled through its quiet interior, feeling the weight of history within its walls.
By late afternoon, it was time for me to meet up with some old colleagues from a previous job. Around 5 p.m., I grabbed a quick bite and made my way to Alexanderplatz, one of Berlin’s busiest and most famous squares. We spent the next few hours at Museum Island, a tranquil spot surrounded by stunning museums, and it was the perfect place to catch up and relax. As evening fell, we headed to a cozy bar nearby, where we shared stories, laughed, and reminisced about old times. The hours slipped away effortlessly — there’s nothing quite like the ease of conversation with familiar faces after so long apart.
The next day, October 27th, my friend had some time off, and he suggested we visit Teufelsberg, a unique and slightly offbeat destination. It was once a U.S. listening station during the Cold War, perched atop an artificial hill made from the rubble of WWII. Today, it’s known for its panoramic views and vibrant street art. We hopped on a train and made our way through the city, the excitement of exploring something new bubbling between us. After getting off at the station, we hiked through the Grunewald Forest. The autumn colors were at their peak, and the forest was alive with shades of amber, gold, and crimson. It was a peaceful walk, and the beauty of the season made it all the more special.
Teufelsberg itself was a fascinating place. The structure, abandoned and worn by time, was now a canvas for street artists. The walls were covered in colorful, intricate graffiti, each piece telling its own story. We spent hours wandering around, taking in both the art and the history of the place. The view from the top was breathtaking, offering a sweeping panorama of the city and the surrounding forest. It felt like a hidden gem, a place that not every tourist would think to visit.
Before heading back, we grabbed some Indian snacks at a nearby spot. Later that evening, we decided to make a simple but delicious dinner at home — Aglio olio. My friend had perfected the recipe, and it turned out to be a delightful meal.
The following day was more relaxed. After a leisurely breakfast, my friend gave me a mini-tour of his apartment, which had a fantastic view of the street below and a spacious terrace perfect for parties. The weather continued to surprise us, warm and sunny, which is rare for October in Germany. I spent the day revisiting some of the places I had already seen, this time at my own pace. Walking through the streets with my earphones in, I listened to Rick Steeve’s videos., taking in more of the city’s history and architecture. There’s something deeply satisfying about exploring a city on your own, taking the time to absorb its energy and appreciate its stories.
That evening, my friend invited me to dinner at a fancy Greek restaurant. It was my first time trying Greek food, and the dishes were amazing — rich, flavorful, and hearty. We were joined by a friend of his who was Greek, which made the experience even better as he explained the origins and significance of each dish. After our meal, we took a final stroll through the streets of Berlin. The city had left a lasting impression on me, with its mix of history, culture, and modern vibrancy.
The next morning, I caught my bus back to the Netherlands, reflecting on the incredible experiences of the past few days. Berlin had been everything I hoped for and more — both a journey through history and a personal adventure that I wouldn’t soon forget.

This is the Fernsehturm Berlin, the TV tower. Built in the late ’60s, at 1206 feet it is the tallest structure in Germany and third tallest in Europe.
During the Cold War, there were two independent Germanies:
Berlin was entirely within East Germany but was divided into sectors, the US, French, British, and Soviet. Westerners were limited in going to Berlin in the first place, but getting to East Berlin was a major hassle.
There were three roads from West Germany to Berlin, and they were carefully monitored. None of my friends even considered trying that drive. There was also a rail service from Frankfurt to Berlin, the Berlin Duty Train. Like the three highways, carefully planning and getting the required approvals was essential for the train.
However, I did get to East Berlin for a couple of days in 1981. Co-worker Bill (of the Vienna trip fame) and I got a military hop from our base in West Germany to Berlin. Melinda, one of our friends, had just been transferred there as a protocol officer. Clever of us to have a friend in that business, wasn’t it? She had arranged rooms for us in the huge hotel at Tempelhof airport.
Because the city was still occupied, you couldn’t just go into East Berlin and wander around. We had to wear our military uniforms so you know how much we stood out among the locals.
My first thought when we started sightseeing was how stern all the people looked. Not that they disliked us, but like they were not enjoying life there. We saw lots of rubble still there from the war years. Guess I’d have expected more repair work to have been done by then, 1981.
Checkpoint Charlie was and is still known as a major symbol of the Cold War so we wanted to see it. It was the only approved checkpoint, walking or driving, for foreigners and military personnel. (Sorry, my picture isn’t too good; couldn’t Photoshop it enough.)
This is me, in uniform, at the Brandenburg Gate in the Soviet zone. People and vehicles could use it freely until August 1961 when the Berlin Wall was built. The Wall enclosed the entire city, passing right by the west side of the gate. President Ronald Reagan gave his famous ‘Tear down this wall’ speech near the Gate in June 1987. As you may remember, the Wall was ended in December 1989.
Thanks again to Melinda; we got a tour of West Berlin, the Wall, and even into East Berlin just a bit. She’d arranged a helicopter tour for a visiting US Air Force general. You know biggies often get special treatment and opportunities.
Since the General’s aide was the only other passenger, Melinda asked the General to take two visiting USAF officers. He kindly agreed. I’d been in a helicopter before, even saw the Tucson home of a mafioso kingpin from one! This trip was unique, a matter of international law, I guess. Flying over the Wall into the Soviet Zone was a huge no-no. But the crew said they did it regularly, just a brief crossover, to maintain US rights!
Is this cheating? It’s me at the Berlin Wall from the good guy side, on a different trip.
Now, about that TV tower…
Like the Brandenburg Gate, it is one of the most prominent symbols of Berlin. When the sun shines (as it does once in a while in Germany) it reflects on the tower’s dome in the shape of a Greek cross, a symbol against the East German removal of crosses from churches during the Cold War!

Berlin has a complex history that has significantly shaped its urban landscape and development. As the capital of Germany, it has experienced monumental shifts over the centuries—transforming from a Prussian capital into a divided city during the Cold War and now into one of Europe’s most dynamic and modern cities. What makes Berlin so captivating is how its infrastructure and urban planning tell the story of a city constantly rebuilding and reinventing itself.
Berlin’s modern identity is rooted in a unique combination of historical events and urban resilience. Initially, Berlin was a modest settlement along the River Spree, but it gradually became a trade center during the Middle Ages. By the 18th century, Berlin had become the capital of Prussia, a major European power, and it underwent significant development under the rule of Frederick the Great. However, it wasn’t until the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century that Berlin truly began to transform into a major European metropolis. Factories, railroads, and grand boulevards like Unter den Linden were constructed, making Berlin a vital economic and cultural hub.

My feeling about Berlin is still very conflicted. The city is full of culture, history and character, and yet, I can’t say that I love it. This surprises me given how many friends have only raved about Berlin. I fully expected to be a Berlin-lover, too. A week before we move onto our next stop, I still feel like we have so much to see. And we do. Even in 3.5 weeks, we haven’t ventured anywhere near all the nooks and crannies we know are worth seeing. One more weekend to make the most of! On the list: Mauerpark, the Pergamon or DDR Museum, graffiti tours, underworld visits, and other recommended bars and haunts.
One thing we have had the privilege of living through is the most recent German elections. I say “living through” lightly as we didn’t vote and honestly didn’t experience much fuss around the city other than some people demonstrating in front of Brandenburg Gate when we biked past it a couple of weeks ago. (Going to go by again this weekend to see what’s brewing now.) As you may know, Angela Merkel won another tenure as Chancellor of Germany but the relatively new far-right party of AfD (Alternative for Germany) garnered a whopping 12.6% of votes, making it Germany’s third largest party and marking the first time in 60 years that a far-right party has entered Parliament.
I won’t make this an in-depth political post, so I’ll pause here to recommend some reading if you’re interested in finding out more about how the AfD came about and some of the tactics it used to make its historical entry into the Bundestag (parliament).
What strikes me is that just last week, I was talking about how Germany’s efforts to remember its history and specifically its mistakes throughout history felt omnipresent throughout Berlin. I mentioned how the country makes a point to honor the victims of its past rather than their perpetrators. And then I read about how the AfD is rebelling against this practice, calling it weak and encouraging Germany to “take a more positive attitude towards its history.”
I had thought this attitude was quite positive already… How many countries are so open about their mistakes and actually make (sometimes unpopular) political decisions that demonstrate it has learned from them? Seeing Germany step up as the European country to accept the most refugees in need of a home at the peak of the refugee crisis in 2015 was a powerful moment for me. My family suffered first-hand from the Holocaust — 3 of my grandparents were in Auschwitz and lost their entire families. I never want any race or religion to suffer the same kind of persecution the Holocaust embodied. It’s not just the Holocaust — genocides in Rwanda and Armenia and Apartheid in South Africa are other recent examples of racism we in hindsight condemn and critique. The American Civil War and fight against slavery may have been over 150 years ago, but we still witness undeniable expressions of racism and rejection in the United States today.
That history is cyclical should not stand as an excuse to let it repeat itself. As I live through the repercussions of the Brexit vote, read about exaggerated travel bans and unsanctioned white nationalist/neo-nazi rallies, watch outspoken discriminating politicians slowly but surely claim more power in the Netherlands, France, Austria, now Germany under the guise of ‘nationalism’ and ‘identity’… I’m terrified kids one or two generations from now will be learning about these events as catalysts towards a larger global conflict I don’t even want to put a name on.
What does nationalism even mean today?
When talking about diversity in Germany with a couple of friends recently, they matter-of-factly stated that for example Russians and Turks are a central part of today’s Germany. You can’t imagine Berlin without kebab stands at every corner, they justly remarked.
The makeup of a country changes over time and what may have been a “pure” (debatable) population centuries ago is now mixed and enriched. To be nationalistic can mean to embrace this growth and diversity, rather than long for a past that alienates new- and otherness. With open economical borders, refugees escaping war-torn areas, broadening spirits and more informed, less fearful constituents, I would hope that European countries (and North American, and Middle Eastern…) choose to welcome and even promote this now globalized reality. Of course, there will always be people clamoring for “the good old days” and yes, some of the old days do have value and a country’s identity and history should also be preserved. I just hope we can work together to find a balance that doesn’t conflate identity with discrimination, and sadly the advancement of the AfD and the shift in its policy since its creation represent an upsetting setback.
I acknowledge this post is by no means a complete political commentary that compares both sides of the argument. It represents a few thoughts and concerns that have been weighing on my mind, and I welcome any comments or feedback to continue the discussion.
In the meantime, I’ll leave you with some of my favorite recent campaigns for acceptance and diversity before I resume my explorations of Berlin:

This wasn’t a trip intending to explore the capital. No, I’ve never been to the capital of my home country. But the city of Berlin is also far away from where I grew up in the country.
This trip only led us to the city because we found no closer Decathlon than on the outskirts of Berlin. Decathlon is the sports store where I buy all my sports equipment. From swimsuits and snorkel to hiking pants and boots, sunglasses, and whatever else I need. We even bought an inflatable kayak here.
There are many stores across the world (we even found a Decathlon store in Thailand) but the closest one to our current home was about an hour's drive away. And in Berlin.
We were looking for a bicycle for my husband and that was the reason why we went on the journey to Berlin. Originally I had said I won’t be driving into the city. There’s public transport here. Use it. It’s much more relaxing than taking the car.
But remember, we live in the countryside. It takes a bit until we get to a train station. Or bus stop. Plus, we would be coming back with a bicycle as luggage. Maybe I should get over my shadow and just drive.
We’ve driven in many cities before and even though I wasn’t the driver in Bangkok’s crazy city traffic, I’ve done a…

Thinking of making Berlin your new home?
Take these things into account for a smoother move.
A “Wahlberlinerin” (Berlin citizen by choice) explains.
Visiting my hometown in Groningen, the Netherlands feels like a breath of fresh air, as if I’m walking through a village. Most pedestrians on the street greet me with a smile and a nod.
It doesn’t work like that in Berlin.
You ignore one another. Some neighbors who accepted my packages in the past and certainly know who I am ignore me in any other setting.
It’s no different when walking on the street. No one greets you, you greet no one. If you do, expect frowns, very confused, or even scared looks.
The temperatures drop to or below zero during the winter months. People get moody, sulky, and the city turns bleak.
The only good thing about Berlin winters from the perspective of a Dutch person: it doesn’t rain…

By John Glab
Berlin is internationally famous for its techno clubs and my visits to Tresor and Berghain upheld the stereotypes: dark spaces with intense flashing light shows, blurred by the occasional smoke screen. Loud, heavy, four-on-the-floor industrial techno rattles the concrete structure of the buildings, as well as the bones of those either dancing in ecstasy or swaying as they try to not to fall over from exhaustion.
But just because the techno scene now lives above ground doesn’t mean the rest of Berlin’s music scene does.
Hidden across the city are many punk and DIY venues that offer a space for a community of musicians to create their own art. In my time in Berlin, I’ve looked at posters taped to walls and light poles, searched names online, and asked around for some places to see a show.
Køpi, a squatting development in Kreuzberg, has a couple spaces for live music performances. I entered through a gate, obscured from street view by some vegetation. Behind it was a courtyard area flanked by the building’s two short wings. Its cracked, concrete facade was well adorned with colorful graffiti murals of contorted human figures, stencil art, and the common message of “kein foto,” no photography allowed.
German Punk Time meant I waited well over an hour for the show to start. In that time, I played a game of pick-up basketball with a few of the people who lived there, trying to avoid splashing in the puddles in the courtyard’s potholes. At Køpi, the line between public and private living spaces feels non-existent.
Koma F, the performance area at Køpi, was down a flight of stairs in a basement. Old bricks, rounded from age, formed arched ceilings in what felt like a former storage space. A crowd of around 30 people — who were well beyond their 20s — fit the punk cliché, dressed in black vests with studs and large boots.
The two bands that played, Shell-Shocked from Berlin and Disturbance from Rotterdam in the Netherlands, both reflected this vintage aesthetic in their music. Shell-Shocked had quick tremolo pickings that droned over blasting d-beats. The band’s vocalist stumbled around the front of the stage, leaning back while screaming into the mic, looking as if he was trying to swallow a sword.
Disturbance was much more straight forward, playing into the punk sentiment of less-is-more. They had a definite Oi! punk sound with frequent gang vocals sung over more classic stylings of simple rock-and-roll songs, but played faster and noisier. This affinity for the past makes sense as Disturbance has been a band since 1995. Perhaps you can critique them for never evolving, or holding onto the past too hard even from the beginning, but they were still entertaining enough for the people who came to see them.
The other venue I went to was OGH, located somewhere in the sprawling southern neighborhood of Neukölln. The entrance was tucked in an alleyway. Beyond the door, a stairwell splotched with graffiti and posters led up to the fourth floor of the warehouse space. There, the stage stood at the front of what looked like a former office area. In the backhalf of the space, people sat and talked between sets at a bar and lounge area. Large windows lined the entire wall of the venue, where many people looked out over the alleyway at surrounding apartment blocks.
The show at OGH followed a more post-punk garage sound, without the aggressiveness of hardcore. The bands were Dackelkontakt from Potsdam, Fantuzzi in Berlin, and Teo Wise, an Italian living in Leipzig. About 50 people filled the space. Dackelkontakt went first, sitting behind a small synth array set on a repurposed ironing board. They played fast, peppy, synthpunk tracks with a bit of added whimsy from the little squeals of a theremin. Often songs would pause for brief spoken word parts, traded off between members, including at the climax of their set when two of the band members quickly and aggravatedly talked over each other for about 30 seconds before falling into the last riff.
At the end, Teo Wise performed his light but robust punk tracks. Together with the other members of his band, they mastered the balance of playing locked-in and succinct while effecting a sprawling free spirit that gave the music so much livid personality. Wise’s set moved the audience into an ecstatic dance, with shoes slipping across a sweat slicked concrete floor.Most enthralling was that everyone danced together. There were no imposed boundaries as people whirled around each other, one person making contact with another’s psyche, before turning to the next, until there was a point of connection between everyone in the room. Theboundaries of the individual became invisible.
After the set, people lingered in the fourth-floor warehouse loft for well over an hour. They were simply talking, making new acquaintances, and building on the commonalities they had found during the performance. Whether it be two people just passing through the city, or someone finding a new community, these moments define life and cannot be manufactured. In Berlin, they can still be found in DIY spaces — if you just know where to look.

There are thousands of films shot in Berlin (click for city map). Opposite to many other shooting locations, Berlin surpasses the mere location tag. Instead, the city is a breathing creature, making it a character on its own.
It holds true not only in movies, though. When visiting Berlin, I felt like walking through Berlin is to walk through human memory, through disaster and overcoming. It was a walk through the urban movements seemingly never stopping to run its streets, breathe from its walls and remind us about the history and human condition.
Here are 4movies (to be frank, I only watched 3 of them, and adored 2.5) that are must-sees before visiting berlin. Or, you may just follow my path and watch the first three.
The movie takes a look into East Berlin life of intellectuals in 1984.
The scenes of the prison of the lives of others were filmed in the Royal Prison, the former Central Prison of State Security (Stasi) of the German Democratic Republic, today converted into the memorial site of Berlin-Hohenschönhausen. If you wish to book a visit, you must first register here. What’s more, former prisoners often offer guided tours where they narrate their personal experience.
Run Lola Run is a movie that literally takes you through Berlin in the turn of century. From now oh-so-hip Friedrichstraße to Charlottenburg near the National Opera, with stops on the Museum Island, Lola is on the mission to save her boyfriend’s life (literally). The other storyline of the movie conveys the saving of herself. Visiting her father, and running through the whole Berlin, she finds herself once again.
She also passes through Schlesischer Tor, Oberbaumbrücke in Kreuzberg or the beautiful square of Gendarmenmarkt in Mitte among many other streets.
In short, its route does not make any geographical sense, but how good and beautiful is Berlin from beginning to end from home and in less than an hour and a half?
Berlin, Symphony of a Great City has an incalculable historical value: this silent film immerses us in day-to-day life in the centre of Berlin in 1927, a Berlin that we neither knew nor will know as it would be reduced to rubble a few more years late.
Probably only the river Spree has remained immutable since then. The Berlin Cathedral, like so many other buildings and monuments portrayed by Walter Ruttmann’s camera, we only know of its recent reconstruction. And others, like the Royal Palace in Berlin, cannot be visited again until 2019 (next year).
Roberto Rossellini stood in what was left of Berlin in 1947, made a casting between non-professional actors and filmed the third chapter of the quintessence of the Italian neorealist: the trilogy of Rome, Appointment aperta, Paisà and this Germania, Anno Zero.
The result is devastating. Edmund Kohler is thirteen years old and wanders through the centre of Berlin with the sole purpose of surviving and helping his family survive. The backdrop is a Reichstag that is already only rubble and the barren esplanade of the Tiergarten, whose wood served to warm German homes during World War II.
The penury was such on and off the screen that many actors escaped when it came time for repatriation after recording the interiors of the film in Rome.

(Author’s note: A German version of this article was published in Berlin’s “Der Tagesspiegel” newspaper on March 15, 2025)
It didn’t matter if the neighbors looked on disapprovingly. The New Year had arrived, and spring began with a large fire that we, as children, would jump over for what felt like hours to leave behind the evil spirits of the past year. The scent of saffron rice and grilled fish. The loud music surrounded us and the families of my father’s Persian friends who visited each other, greeting with kisses and embraces. Whenever I remember the Persian New Year celebrations I experienced in West Berlin during the 1980s, I’m filled with a warm, hopeful feeling. Back then, I didn’t understand how much more this festival must have meant during that time, amid a terrible war between Iraq and Iran that lasted nearly a decade and resulted in half a million casualties. A celebration amid a German society that was still firmly convinced it was not yet open to immigrants and what they could contribute. For my dad and his friends, the celebration was a piece of home helping them feel more at home in a foreign land.
Only years later did I learn how widespread the tradition of this New Year’s festival is. According to UNESCO, “It has been celebrated by more than 300 million people for over 3,000 years in the Balkan Peninsula, the Black Sea region, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Middle East.” The festival’s observance traces back to the Zoroastrian ancestors of today’s Iranian people. Since 2009, the UN has even included Nouruz in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
When I would return to my Berlin school on Mondays after the festival, there was no mention of the Persian New Year. Only Christmas, Easter, and New Year’s Eve existed. Once, in 12th grade, our English teacher asked about our backgrounds and our parents. I remember it clearly because it was such an unusual experience. She wanted to know if we, as children of immigrants, felt any particular conflict. The only thing I felt were the glances of my classmates, which led me to give an evasive answer. The meaning and power of the New Year’s festival thus remained hidden from her and the rest of the teachers and students.
For example, the story of Kaveh the Blacksmith, who plays an important role in Ferdowsi’s famous Book of Kings. According to legend, Kaveh led an Iranian uprising against a cruel, child-devouring dragon king. This symbolism of resistance against oppression has led authoritarian governments to attempt to ban the festival over the years repeatedly. However, the most important meaning of the festival is the awakening of nature to new life in spring, the victory of light over darkness, and of knowledge over ignorance.
When I speak with my friends in Berlin every weekend, it becomes increasingly clear to me how important it is to celebrate the Persian New Year and remember its message, especially this year. For weeks, I’ve been hearing much about the challenges originating in Moscow and here in Washington, D.C., and the increasingly difficult political and economic situation for Germany and Europe. Even during the pandemic, I didn’t perceive this much fear and uncertainty about the situation.
Next week, I will tell the children at my daughter’s elementary school in Washington, D.C. about the Persian New Year. There are some children there who are directly affected by their parents’ dismissals by the Trump administration. There are flyers preparing for the possible removal of children of illegal immigrants at the school. The teacher invited me at my daughter’s request, who had so enjoyed the presentation of the Indian Festival of Lights, Diwali, in the fall by a mother of Indian descent. I will tell them about the great New Year’s festival and its message that we will celebrate with friends and neighbors. With a fire that many in the city will jump over to rid themselves of the evil spirits of the past year. And about how for me, the festival is also a piece of memory of Berlin and a home that I gladly share with all who currently need more confidence and community.

He’s a trained cabinet maker, a qualified social pedagogue, and a professional graphic designer and illustrator. Christian Rothenhagen, also known as deerBLN, is a Berlin patriot with a conceptual flair. proud magazine sits down with the artist to discuss his love for the city, his creative ambitions, and what it means to be a true Berliner.
proud: What is your ambition behind putting tiles on the city’s streets?
deerBLN: My ambition is clearly to beautify my city and to express myself: in drawings, on t-shirts, on skateboards, in installations, wherever. I am happy to live in the most beautiful city in the world. I see myself as a modern local historian. I document the city through my drawings and give something back to it through my work in public spaces. My “street art” is, for the most part, not illegal, but rather tolerated interventions in the urban landscape. It’s an expression of my love for this city.
proud: You are a true Berliner. Do you even like the city anymore these days?
deerBLN: I have lived here since 1976. For me, the city is still the most beautiful, the roughest, the most diverse, the most interesting, the most incorruptible, the most broken — and the most honest. It’s the city that doesn’t lie to you. It wears its scars openly, shows its wounds, and is as direct as a punch in the gut. But it’s also the city that will always catch you. I love Berlin — now more than ever!
proud: You just designed a skateboard series for Artsprojekt. Are you a skater?
deerBLN: I used to skate a lot, but I wasn’t particularly good. I started in the mid-80s on one of those plastic boards from the department store. When I was 15, I bought my first real board, a Santa Cruz with Independent trucks and OJ II wheels — a classic! That board was my pride and joy and my ticket to a world that has shaped me to this day: skateboarding, punk rock, and hardcore. The DIY ethic of that scene has influenced my work from the beginning. So, to design a board series now is a huge honor for me. It’s a childhood dream come true.
proud: What are you currently working on?
deerBLN: Right now, I’m developing a T-shirt series for a Berlin-based streetwear label and working on a few poster designs. I’m also preparing my next solo exhibition, which will take place in the spring of 2009 in Friedrichshain. Besides that, I’m always drawing… my city… Berlin!

I visited many galleries and art exhibitions in Berlin and here’s my reviews.
It is not as difficult to purchase tickets as it is in Barcelona, but it is critical to double-check the opening days and hours.
I visited ""the soul station"" : the LAS Foundation in Halle am Berghain. An extensive interactive metaverse ethical gaming installation.Brathwaite-Shirley investigates marginalized histories, particularly those of the Black and Queer communities. When prospects go into Berlin’s renowned space, they are greeted by a dark, foggy environment filled with an array of varying screen displays flickering with artificial light, waiting us to tap in.
I spent a lot of time there trying to understand everything, but there still remain some parts of the journey that are perplexing. The storyline offers the sense of limitless possibilities. As my friend grace said , it kind of reminds me of Love + Death robots vibe too.
By the time I visited it was only 8 euro and it was episode 1 of the game.
Episode 2: ARE YOU SOULLESS, TOO?Will start from September to October.
Really really worth it.
Really famous on social media. An immersive museum exploring the concept of dark matter. It was really far away , and maybe I expected too much after the halle- exhibition visit. There are several rooms to explore and you can probably finish it all in 1 and a half hours. Or even faster without the drink/snack breaks in between. However, this place made for a really good video/ photos. The tickets are quite expensive for what it offer though…
I truly had fun that visit! Film buffs will thoroughly like this. There are free smartphone applications for audio guides, and it was simultaneously interesting and enlightening. Day tickets cost 9 euros and close at 6 p.m. After experiencing the museum, visitors can also visit the Library of Film Archives. Aside from that, it’s clear that the Deutsch kinemathek hosts a variety of exhibitions. On top of that, the permanent display will close in October. I had an absolute blast there.
Honestly ， I encountered a lot of fashionable people here. And I think they’re here for the IG post. It certainly is a cool place to take photos.
I saved a lot more museum visit as well but I just couldn’t make it because of prior plans. Next time , Berlin!

I hand my clothes over in a plastic bag and have a number written on my arm. Filled with trepidation and curiosity, I step into Berlin’s most famous gay sex club.
We’d been in love for a year. As he and I re-wove our lives around each-other, we embarked on a program of cultural integration — each of us would take the other to key places in our lives.
I grew up bookish and solitary, he affable and athletic. I found our differences exciting though challenging. At my cousins wedding I read a research paper whilst he danced. I regretted that.
Spurred by our love, I resolved to cross into his world.
We spent the summer learning to party together. Little festivals, nights out. I discovered new ways of being with the world. We danced together, to techno.
Like many others, my boyfriend grew up in a world that did not make it easy to be himself. LBGTQ individuals have had to fight prejudice to make space for themselves. Much has been achieved, but we still live in a world where queerness is constrained.
Since its heyday in the twenties, Berlin has been a haven for the fringes of sexuality and society. The scars of the second world war, maintained in plain sight by the city, permeate Berlin’s psyche: authoritarianism and persecution must be avoided at all costs.
That background can be felt in Berlin’s modern day clubbing culture. Diverse, debauched, as-you-are, anything-goes, a kaleidoscope of venues and events against a backdrop of concrete and electronic music.
In the cab ride over to Lab.oratory, our venue for the night, I was filled with anxiety. Whilst I’m an enthusiastic skinny-dipper, getting down to my underwear in a hyper-sexual environment felt exposing. My bigger worry was emotional: what if I’m left, alone, with my boyfriend engaged with someone else?
The queue for the club was like an inside-joke: we all stood quietly clothed in the cold, knowing the alternate universe we’d shortly enter. Three straight men reversed back out of the entrance, laughing uncomfortably, realizing this was not the club they expected.
Upon paying the fee, one is presented with a clear plastic bag and undresses under fluorescent lights. Surrounding men transform into jockstraps and harnesses. I ask my friends if I should keep the jeans. They say no.
You then descend into the bar: a cavern, beautiful and hellish, of debauchery. The bar is surrounded by electric pylons and gas masks. A warm human scent fills the air. Groans can be heard distantly over the loud techno.
If Berghain is the cathedral above, this is the demonic paradise below.
Vodka sodas in hand, my now almost naked friends take in the view and grin; “Oh it’s good to be back”.
My boyfriend takes me on a tour. Squeezing through holes in brick walls, the complex has creative architecture catering to many kinks, from sex-slings to multi-level wet-rooms. Lubricant is dispensed from wall mounts like burger-bar ketchup. Outdoors there is a shipping-container box park.
We find a corner with a sling and he reclines; Sex, techno and red lighting blurs into one. A crowd forms around us, I swot their hands off my body like flies. It is like the end scene in the film Perfume, I wonder if we will be devoured by the masses.
We explore some more, then eventually decide to leave. To get out, you settle the bar-tab against the number on your arm. It’s eleven-pm and we take a cab home for an early night. My apprehensions gone, I’m thrilled to have explored this other world with my partner.
I did not know what to expect to find in Berlin, from its harsh urban exterior the place appears unwelcoming. That’s the sort of paradox at the heart of it: everyone is free and equal because nobody is favored. Concrete and techno seem inhuman, but they do not discriminate. And in that, was a sort of comfort.

This is drawn from my recent bestselling book on heroes (cue Bowie) who dug escape tunnels under the Wall, The Tunnels: Escapes Under the Berlin Wall and the Historic Films the JFK White House Tried to Kill. Part of Bruce’s performance, and remarks, via link below. I would attend an epic Springsteen concert in Berlin almost 30 years later.
https://youtu.be/WBIcfPBVxxQ
On this date in 1961 the Berlin Wall started rising overnight (first as mere barbed wire) dividing East and West for almost three decades. The fall of the Berlin Wall, 28 long and deadly years later, has been attributed to lots of things, from Mikhail Gorbachev’s reforms and Ronald Reagan’s famous plea to the ineptitude of the Politburo and the collective courage of the East German protesters. But there’s little doubt that David Bowie and Bruce Springsteen did their own — if small — part.
When Bowie died several years ago, the German Foreign Office noted as much in a memorial tweet: “Good-bye, David Bowie. You are now among #Heroes. Thank you for helping to bring down the #wall.” For Springsteen’s role, you can read the 2013 book Rocking the Wall: Bruce Springsteen — The Berlin Concert That Changed the World. But Springsteen’s memoir, Born to Run, offers his full account of that epic concert for the first time.
Many Americans are surprised to learn that our rock stars were even allowed to play in East Germany while the wall, constructed in 1961, remained in place. But Communist Party leaders, noting the tremendous buildup of anger and tension among their young people during the Gorbachev “glasnost” era, decided to provide a safety valve of sorts by allowing major rock concerts starting in 1987. Tens of thousands of East German kids were already flocking to the wall to listen as Bowie and others played just on the other side — and there had been clashes between the music-starved youth and East German police.
Bowie’s June 1987 performance was remarkable on several levels. The stage was set up in West Berlin, very close to the wall, with the old Reichstag building as a backdrop. Unlike most Western performers, he had a fitting song for the occasion: “Heroes,” written a few years earlier and purportedly inspired by Bowie’s time living in Berlin. The line about standing by the wall while “the guns shot above our heads” may refer to dramatic attempts by East Germans to escape the East — which happens to be the subject of my book, The Tunnels: Escapes Under the Berlin Wall and the Historic Films the JFK White House Tried to Kill. (You can watch part of Bowie’s performance that day below.)
https://youtu.be/FdykmbbaZI8
And here, from a 2003 interview, is how he described it:
It was one of the most emotional performances I’ve ever done. I was in tears…And there were thousands on the other side that had come close to the wall. So it was like a double concert where the wall was the division. And we would hear them cheering and singing along from the other side. God, even now I get choked up. When we did “Heroes” it really felt anthemic, almost like a prayer. However well we do it these days, it’s almost like walking through it compared to that night, because it meant so much more. That’s the town where it was written, and that’s the particular situation that it was written about.
By then, Bob Dylan had been invited by a youth arm of the Communist Party to play in Treptower Park in the East on September 17, 1987, along with touring mates Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and Roger McGuinn. Protests were building against the regime and the wall, and East German officials hoped to defuse tensions with a few signs of openness.
The Stasi didn’t seem too worried that Dylan, then in a down period in his career, would prove to be a rabble-rouser.
Naturally, the Stasi (East Germany’s notorious secret police) were on top of it. Their six-page preview was filed at their headquarters under “Robert Zimmerman, No. HA XX 17578.” It mainly covered logistics and security — no secret bugging of Dylan, apparently — and the dispersal of 81,000 tickets, with at least one-third going to party officials and their pals. The Stasi didn’t seem too worried that Dylan, then in a down period in his career, would prove to be a rabble-rouser, as he was merely “an old master of rock” with no particular “resonance” with the youth of the day. The crowd, they predicted, would be mostly middle-aged and older. Dylan would act in a “disciplined” way and not cause undo “emotions.”
In the end, the gig played out pretty much as the Stasi had anticipated. By most accounts, Dylan — whose lyrical work just earned him the 2016 Nobel Prize for literature — gave a rather lackluster performance (his norm for the time), consisting of a couple of Christian tunes mixed in with hits like “Blowin’ in the Wind,” “Rainy Day Women” and “Like a Rolling Stone.” He reportedly did not speak a single word from the stage.
This was not the case with Springsteen, who arrived in East Berlin 10 months later to play his biggest concert ever. More than 200,000 showed up, twice what Dylan had attracted. Springsteen opened, pointedly, with “Badlands,” but the indisputable highlight was his cover of “Chimes of Freedom,” a Dylan tune that Dylan himself had overlooked. The show, which in typical Springsteen style lasted nearly four hours, was beamed to millions of East Germans via state television. Many middle-aged Germans I interviewed for my book fondly recalled attending the performance or watching it on TV. “It was a nail in the coffin for East Germany,” one fan told the Guardian years later.
In Born to Run, Springsteen recounts a previous visit to East Berlin with bandmate Steve Van Zandt. “You could feel the boot,” he recalls. The wall, in Springsteen’s view, seemed almost “pornographic.” The experience helped shock the then-apolitical Van Zandt into decades of activism. “The power of the wall that split the world in two, its blunt, ugly, mesmerizing realness, couldn’t be underestimated,” Springsteen writes. “It was an offense to humanity.”
When Springsteen returned to East Berlin for his epic 1988 show, as I note in my own book, he unhappily discovered that the state was billing it as a “concert for the Sandinistas,” the pro-Communist Nicaraguans. So he delivered an impassioned speech. His German was grade-school level, but he got the point across: “I’m not here for any government. I’ve come to play rock and roll for you in the hope that one day all the barriers will be torn down.” East German officials backstage had somehow learned about Bruce’s original statement, which included the explosive word “walls,” and Springsteen’s manager, Jon Landau, had convinced him at the last minute to change it to “barriers.” But after finishing his statement, Springsteen quickly launched into “Chimes of Freedom,” which includes the key reference: “while the walls were tightening.” (See video up top which includes his remarks, then the song.)
The next day, he and the band “partied” at the East Berlin consulate, Springsteen writes, before heading back to the West to play a show for a mere 17,000 people — which “felt a lot less dramatic than what we’d just experienced.” Referring to the “stakes” of rock and roll, he writes, “The higher they’re pushed, the deeper and more thrilling the moment becomes. In East Germany in 1988, the center of the table was loaded down with a winner-take-all bounty that would explode into the liberating destruction of the Berlin Wall by the people.”
German historian Gerd Dietrich would later tell Rocking the Wall author Erik Kirschbaum, “Springsteen’s concert and speech certainly contributed in a large sense to the events leading up to the fall of the wall. It made people more eager for more and more change,” he said. “Springsteen aroused a greater interest in the West. It showed people how locked up they really were.”
As Springsteen himself would later put it, “Once in a while you play a place, you play a show that ends up staying inside of you, living with you for the rest of your life. East Berlin in 1988 was certainly one of them.”

(From someone who grew up there)
Berlin is great. It has culture — so much culture! It has a party scene, a café scene, a bookshop scene, a thrift store scene, a flea market scene, and a farmers market scene. And yet, six weeks ago, I felt the urge to pack up my things and leave. Berlin is like that one popular girl in high school whom you would lock eyes with in the hallway — the moment you couldn’t believe your luck, you would realize that she was looking right through you, as if you were water. Listen, everyone had a different take on the popular girl in high school. Most people simply loved her, which is what made her so popular. Yet, terminology such as “popular girl” or “mean girl” wouldn’t exist if there wasn’t also a certain fear or at least disdain involved. Berlin is a popular girl. You can’t fight me on that. And still — most likely, she will enchant you.
Imagine boarding the subway — yes, the famous yellow U-Bahn that is redonant of piss and houses two thirds of the city’s homeless population [figure deliberately invented]. And while you may think breathing through your scarf is the worst thing, or having to avoid eye contact with creepy strangers, or school children bumping their massive backpacks into you during rush hour, I can tell you that it isn’t any single one of those things. It’s that all these things are happening at once. You don’t get a second to yourself, not a second to just hold still and think, because there is someone very near you breathing down your neck.
At this point, you may have sworn to yourself to never visit Berlin or at least its subway — especially if you generally dislike big-city hustle — but there may be some of you who find the idea of the Berliner U Bahn romantic. And you know what? It is! We even have a world-famous musical that is merely about that. It’s called Linie 1. If you ever visit Berlin, you have to go. It’s wonderful and one of a kind.
I already mentioned that Berlin is the popular girl in high school, and what I mean by this is that she is pretty (very, very pretty) and a trendsetter in a rather basic and unoriginal way. She’d never try something truly new or crazy out herself but would only wear it if her peers approved it. I know that this sounds like a survival guide for high school, and it is, but in Berlin, it’s true for anyone from the age of five to thirty-five, and it is true any time you leave the safety of your own four walls. Popular girl is pretty, but she bites. Are you safe if you’re older? No. Popular girls ripen into Karens and lord knows they’re not safe to be around. You may be confused — am I talking about Berlin or people? The popular girls are the people who shape Berlin. They have no specific gender.
What is my conclusion? Berlin is fantastic if and only if you have a thick skin. If you can handle a stranger screaming at you on the street for no reason or a drunk person harassing you, you will enjoy a city full of sunshine, culture, delicious food, and endless things to do. Just make sure the popular girls like you.

This post is describing the best photography spots in Berlin. Most importantly these are not touristy places but the best for fine art and portrait photography. I do not mention such places as Brandenburger Tor or East-Side Gallery because it’s an author’s blog and I don’t try to make another copy-paste post about some landmarks of Berlin. I also work as a portrait photographer in Berlin and tried them out myself. If you search for unusual and interesting places to take pictures — this is the right place!
Hopefully, there are quite some photography lovers in Berlin who are also using Medium.
I will always update this list with the best photography spots in Berlin when I find new ones.
If you are coming from outside this platform and would like to read my articles for free you can also subscribe to my blog here
These are only my opinion on which locations are working well, but, of course, the photographer defines how the pictures will look like and not the locations.
I would say of course there’s no perfect place for photography, each photography project requires a different atmosphere, but yet some areas have a lot to offer while others are more generic. This post will be for mid-range pictures and photographers who prefer lenses between 35–70mm. It’s best to use prime lenses for learning photography. I would…

Sociology is beautiful. Sociology is synonymous with stories, narratives, mythology, folktales, fantasies, fairytales and legends, foretold for generations and centuries by through the oral renderings of people : elders, grandparents etc. Myths are told and retold.
There is no better way to understand society without myths and folktales. We are nothing without stories.
Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué, a German author was the creator of the fable Undine (1811). The famous myth creature from European tradition called Undine, a water nymph who becomes human because of the love of a mortal man but will be forced to return to the water if he is unfaithful.
Some characteristics of Undine :
Must Watch : Undine (2020)
I love water, oceans and lakes, mermaids and Berlin. And this movie had it all! Undine is a modern-day fairytale romance, between diver and water nymph, successfully bringing the myth of Undine to life.
I made a list of locations and places in this movie I fell in love with and visited on numerous occasions. Nothing like wondering the streets of Berlin.

Coming June, we’ll have completed two years in Berlin. And let me tell you this: Berlin is not the easiest city to love at first. There, I’ve said it upfront.
When I first moved to Berlin, I didn’t get it. I had moved from Luxembourg, a rich-people’s rich country with rich-looking houses and squeaky-clean streets. Even the air there tasted rich. Compared to that, Berlin felt… rough around the edges. Littered roads, worn-out buildings, and unsmiling faces with austere eyes. A month in, and I was less than dazzled by the city. Nothing quite felt quaint, classic European about it — not the homes, not the streets, not the people, nothing. And this was when we lived in the allegedly prettier, greener, cleaner part of the city. For a while, I sulked like a brat refusing to eat lunch because they didn’t like what was served. But after a few months of indifference, boredom made me curious about what all the fuss was about Berlin being ‘so cool, so amazing, such a vibe’. And, boy, was I surprised!
Cut to a year later:
The more I wandered through Berlin’s history, art and subcultures, the more I read about its history, the more I witnessed its evidence pulsing at every turn (and underground), the more I submitted to its quirks and contradictions, the more the city grew on me.
This is, however, not a list of the historical and cultural milestones of the city, Google’s got that covered. This is about a weirdly funny realisation that crept up on me as I went about befriending the city.
The realisation? Berlin is a Scorpio, through and through: intense, magnetic, often misunderstood.
If I had to describe Berlin in five words, they’d be: Wall. Underground. Non-conformist. Creative. Transforming — each, a reflection of Scorpio’s soul.
Here’s why I think so.
The Berlin we know today rose from the ashes of Cold War destruction; the city quite literally rebuilt itself from ruins. Much like the Scorpio’s strength that lies in its unwavering resilience in the face of adversities to emerge victorious, Berlin’s greatest triumph is its inspiring story of resurrection. That Scorpio-spirit of reinvention pulses through daily life and subcultures: fashion that is not luxury but lived-in-cool; vintage, thrifting, and second-hand culture; abandoned spaces and empty lots upscaled into clubs, flea markets, event hubs, galleries, community gardens, and other breathing ecosystems, all without erasing their past. The city’s reinvention, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the city’s diverse subcultures mirror the Scorpio lifecycle: death, rebirth, and transformation.
This rebirth was not a one-shot event; it was a slow-burning movement that simmered through the 1970s and 80s in the abandoned factories and shunned industrial underbelly of the city. During these decades of secret underground rebellion against the Soviets emerged a palpable flood of creativity — punk, techno, dark comedy, graffiti, alternative museums — all forms of raw, unapologetic expression.
Unlike many other underground subcultures that eventually succumbed to the mainstream, Berlin has fiercely protected its exclusive, elusive and effervescent aura — a classic Scorpio move. The city is not trying to be seen. The city is not trying to impress. It chooses what to reveal, channeling mystery, secrecy, and that unmistakable magnetic pull of a Scorpio.
This night crawler lurks in plain sight, unleashing its passion and poison after the dark — much like the city’s nightlife and club culture. You know what they say about a Scorpio? Even when they’re incognito, you feel them. Same with Berlin.
If underground is one definition of Berlin, unconventional is the other. A city where weird is normal and kinky is loved, where vanilla is boring and edgy is celebrated, Berlin openly embraces what others may turn away from: the grey skies, the black moods, and even their dark history. Here, fashion is not the classic European chic; here, fashion has no rules and no boundaries. Sexy or minimalistic, both are welcome with zero judgement. In fact, goth is Berlin’s gospel and black, a no-nonsense dress code that the city loyalists swear by.
In essence, if counter-culture had a face, Berlin would be the poster child. This non-conformist vibe, however, is not a sign of smugness or arrogance. In fact, the city is not trying to please, it is simply comfortable being its honest self. Unapologetically unpretentious, often misunderstood — that’s Berlin. That’s Scorpio.
An interesting fact: beneath a Scorpio’s calm exterior is relentless desire for personal transformation and self-discovery — much like Berlin’s pulsating creative industry that is home to several cultural entrepreneurs, international artists, and media and entertainment companies. The city boasts a creative diversity few others can match. In Berlin, even when you’re alone, you’re never truly lonely. It blooms and booms with a plethora of passions: from pottery to poetry, hiking to pilates, stand-up comedy to gender fluidity, fetish and BDSM to role-play, drag to queer cabaret. There’s something for everyone here. Berlin knows no bounds when it comes to exploring emotional needs, a spirit that resonates deeply with the passionate and emotionally intense Scorpio.
Today, a part of the Berlin Wall remain, standing proud as a symbol of courage, creativity, and hope. Despite the unification of ideologies between East and West, a beautiful contradiction continues to exist in Berlin. Here, punk, goth, and kink co-exist with healing and mindfulness practices like yoga and breath-work, dance collectives, and gong baths. Here, edgy street culture blends with literature and intellectualism (you could literally meet a tattooed person in a hoodie in a bar and later learn that they’re working on a PhD). Berlin is as much about pride parades, climate protests, and anti-fascist graffiti, as it is about Prinzessinnengarten and community gardening workshops focused on rebuilding and nurturing. This is a city that supports radical, divergent fluidity, yet at same time converges like a moody monotonous canvas of black fashion and grey skies.
And finally, as journalist Emily Schultheis puts it: “Germans are increasingly debating how to balance their country’s collective responsibility for the past with a sense of national pride in the country’s achievements and culture.”
The contradictions — fiercely private vs. burning the dance floor, deeply emotional vs. capable of profound detachment, outwardly calm vs. fervent on the inside, constantly transforming and reinventing — all are quintessential Scorpio traits that Berlin embodies.
So, yes, Berlin may not have been the easiest city for me to love at first. The poignant history and lyrical culture aside, it comes with challenges that can feel monumentally frustrating in everyday life. Unless you are into — or open to exploring — the niche, alternative universe Berlin offers, you may not really get to taste the spicy flavour that makes Berlin uniquely Berlin. And without its one-of-a-kind charm, the city might feel like something you’ve already experienced elsewhere in Europe.
For me, the key to falling for Berlin was staying open, just like you would with a Scorpio: peeling back its layers of the unexpected, while also discovering everything else that makes it special — the food, the history, the warm summers, the lake-side picnics, the beautiful libraries, the green spaces, the inclusivity, the hundreds of fun things to do — all of which more than make up for some of the things I may never get to experience.
To me, this city is not all about fairytales; it is a dark romance. And that’s okay. Because Berlin is also a city with undeniably unique character. It is not classically beautiful, but it owns its scars. It does not always feel warm and welcoming, but it lets you be whoever you want with absolute acceptance. And once you learn to enjoy its many shades, it keeps you captivated.
The thing is, falling in love — and staying in love — with the complex, contradictory, beautiful chaos of a Scorpio takes time, patience, understanding, and a whole lot of emotional investment. And it’s absolutely worth it. Just like Berlin.

Part of the gap year was writing about how it’s not impossible to do if you’re open to adventure and serendipity. So this post is about how I got my current job, the wonders of connections (and why you should keep everyone in touch), the bigger wonders of amazing friends (and friends of friends of friends), my first 48 hours in Berlin, and how I think I may have found a job that’s an actual fit!
TLDR; just check the takeaways (particularly my close friends) :) It’s a long post.
Sometime in October, I decided to leave my first job but didn’t have much of a plan of what to do next. Lucky for me, the universe did!
Kidding. Sort of. See, about a month before I decided to leave my job, I met up with a good friend of mine in Venice Beach. He could see I wasn’t the happiest. He planted the idea that maybe I should start exploring some of my contacts. I messaged another friend who had taken his own gap year. His words were the push I needed:
“Don’t stay in a place during your time off that you know isn’t right”
Two days later, I messaged an old friend I had met two years ago in Bangladesh. He was working at a company that had a strong startup alumni at the time, and he was from Germany. “I could move to Germany,” I thought to myself. I asked if he would be willing to pass my resume to some German startups. He was more than happy to help.
Takeaway: Don’t be afraid to ask people for help. Don’t sell yourself short either. Seriously, no-one is 100% qualified for the job.
Takeaway: Try to keep in touch with people. You never know who can help you down the road. I’ve had lots of examples of this in my life.
I hadn’t heard back though for a month so I forgot about it. Then suddenly on “The Day” (aka the 24 hours where I decided to leave LA, cried most of the afternoon cause I didn’t have much of a plan, didn’t think I was cut out for this crazy ass adventure…ya it wasn’t great), my friend replied back apologizing for not getting to passing my resume, did it, and 12 hours later, the place where I’m currently working reached out to me.
Takeaway: What’s that quote? “Life is what happens to you while you’re busy making other plans.” Guess it works for not having plans either haha. I think the point is things can happen when you least expect it. But you can also make an effort to make it happen.
I have the BEST friends in the world. Seriously, I challenge someone to say they have better ones. At 12pm, I told my best friend at Brown that I was showing up at his apartment the next morning at 10am. I gave him less than 24 hours to prepare for me. And he welcomed me with open arms (and a very comfy futon).
I was supposed to stay for 1 week tops. I ended up staying almost 3 weeks. Apartment hunting in Berlin was harder than I expected. But in those 3 weeks, I found so much love, support and comfort amongst my friends. From 5 minute hugs to 5 hour conversations, my friends were the boost I needed to prepare for my next adventure.
Takeaway: Tell your friends you love them. So Anthony, Blake, Spencer, Sophie (and Adam sort of), thanks for letting me bum around the apartment in my pjays all day and reminding me I’m trash. Alex for always knowing what to say. Caroline, Ian, Derek, Max, Matt, Bas for being the best OG squad and making me almost puke at six flags and sleep on your couch. Ali and Julia for being two badass women. Emma, Isabel and Lacy for being unicorns. Minoshka and Anna for being so damn brilliant and being my mothers. Shivam for being crazy but somehow making it work. Taylor for being so wonderful. Manny for making me laugh with your life (it’ll be just fine). Adi for your own self discovery stories and keeping salon going. Priyankar for that little bit of home and big brother love. Ali for doing all the things you wanted to do. Valentin for letting me believe that I can dream big. Lauren for your warmth. Miki for really being one of the best people I know. Abel for the words of wisdom. Cherry and Rosa for the dose of love and adventure. Rohan for your inquisitiveness. Aaron for being one of the greatest spirits I’ve ever met. Xiao for being a dreamer. Timmy for being such a bundle of joy. Nathan for letting me be “international”. And so so many more that just said hi, gave me a hug, laughed at my life and said keep at it. You’re all loved ❤
Apartment hunting in Berlin is HARD. I’ve learned I’m really naive. I’m scammer’s ideal prey. Luckily my friends aren’t as stupid and stop me from booking an apartment when the person doesn’t live in Germany and wants a wire transfer. I was very fortunate that one of my friends at Brown connected me with a friend of his in Germany (also a Brown alum. #Brunonia) who then connected me with her friend who’s apartment I’m currently living in. Yay friends!
I’ve already hung out with one friend of a friend, and another friend of a friend tonight. And I’ve only been here for 48 hours. Yay friends!
Takeaway: If you like your friends, you’ll probably like their friends too. And when you’re new to a city, reach out. Chances are somebody will know someone in the city you’re going to.
My first impressions are gorgeous city, cobble stone is pretty to look at, not to walk on, the public transport here is AMUZING, everything is so CHEAP (€1 falafel people), nobody believes in debit/credit cards (cash is imperative), my German pronunciation is abysmal, I love the people I work with, there’s so much to discover, the rain sucks, Uber sucks here, mytaxi is better (but that public transport tho. I got a monthly pass for €30), can’t wait to travel elsewhere and explore Europe, cats aren’t so bad (as a dog person), still a dog person, I’ll take a small room if I get a big bed over a big room with a small bed, EVERYONE SHOULD VISIT ME IN BERLIN. And that’s it.
Takeaway: Travel. Explore. Observe. Experience. VISIT ME IN BERLIN.
I won’t go into explaining what product management is. This article does a great job if you’re curious to learn more though. I’m more concerned with addressing the fact that it’s often a tech job that has the assumption that you need to be a computer science or related major to be one (heck, even Google’s Associate Product Management internship has “Minimum qualification: Pursuing a Bachelor’s, Master’s or PhD in Computer Science or a related field”).
As a liberal arts major but a pretty firm lover of the tech industry, I’ve been finding it difficult to find a function within this world. I had heard of product management before but because of the CS requirement I was used to seeing, I didn’t think I was fit. UNTIL I read Why Liberal Arts Majors Make Great Product Managers written by a CS major, HBS lecturer, former product manager, and entrepreneur turned VC.
Please please please read that article if like me, you’re not a coder but are interested in tech performing a cross-functional role that leverages multiple skill sets (sorry for the buzzwords).
I’m still in the early stages of my product management internship. However, just looking at how my other product managers work, what type of work they do, and seeing how other non-tech roles function (Sales, Marketing, Ops, Biz Dev, Finance, Legal), I think I may have actually found a job that feels right.
Takeaway: Keep trying things even if you’re not qualified, have the minimum requirements, or whatever arbitrary barrier someone else has put in your way. It’s the only way you’ll know if something is truly a fit for you.

Rich history… these are the first words that come to mind when I think about Berlin. I was so interested in how much history is on display from this city in everyday spaces and museums. I loved how the city did not try to hide events of the holocaust or World War II but rather seeks to put it fully on display to make sure that folks never forget the horrendous events and make sure that it never happens again.
Learning about the Berlin Wall and being able to see and touch it in person was a very chilling experience. I could not truly grapple with how recent these events were and how life varied dramatically from then to now.
During our time in Berlin we did a lot of different tours and museums but one guided tour we had was particularly memorable for because of the detail we received. We saw a memorial that included time stamps of how some events unfolded on the day that the Berlin Wall fell. Understanding what that experience must have been like for some many East Germans was truly special. I am grateful to have learned more about what life was like during the Cold War at the DDR museum. The DDR museum showed a bit more about the ways in which life in east Germany was actually happening, from domestic life, cars, to military, we learned so much.
Lastly, our time in the Bundestag was memorable. Being able to watch the debate was interesting. Although I wish my German was better so I’d be able to fully comprehend the conversation, I still got a lot out of seeing democracy in action. I was left feeling more interested in how German politics compares to US Politics in terms of efficiency and polarization. I think there are actually a lot of similarities when thinking about the rise of Germany’s Far right party, the AfD, and some political factions in the US.
Although, I was sad to see the trip end so soon, I’m really glad that our last stop was in Berlin. Berlin to me encompassed the crux of it all in Germany. It had the culture, the rich history, the walkability, and so much more. I will cherish the memories made on this program and all the knowledge that I gained learning about sustainability.

An ex-pat turned local’s favorite photo spots
If you have read any of my articles before, you know I love history. Huge fan. So indulge me as I walk you through a bit of Berlin’s history. Berlin first appears in the history books in the 1200s. Its strategic location along the river Spree allowed it to become a hotspot for traders and mercantile. There was even a sister city, Kölln, nearby, but as Berlin grew, it ended up engulfing the city with it.
The story of Berlin begins around Nikolaiviertel, or Nicolas Quarter. Here the Nikolaikirche dominates the small square surrounded by rebuilt shops and restaurants that give you a feel of how Berlin would have looked before the war.
As Berlin grew it would later become the capital and permanent residence of the Hohenzollern’s, the electoral princes of Brandenburg, in the 1400s. The city would later become the capital city of the Prussian empire and in the 1700s would expand and grow, adding palaces and infrastructure worthy of a capital city.
Things would stay this way until the World Wars. Berlin was destroyed and divided and served as the playground for the world powers after World War II. This split history would also lead to different alternative movements, the Berlin Wall, and different architectural styles. Which leads us to the now — the alternative, “poor but sexy” Berlin that attracts millions each year.
As a photographer and lover of history and architecture, my favorite photo spots revolve around my favorite historical places. But, to keep this interesting, I will not just point out my favorite locations, but where you should go to shoot the best shots. Now there are things that factor in to this, like construction, etc., but these are generally the best locations that I like to shoot from.
Nikolaiviertel — A tragically missed location in most people’s visit to Berlin, the Nikolaiviertel is the historic heart of the city. Don’t make that mistake. It is right by both Museum Island as well as the Rotes Rathaus, so just take an hour here, even plan lunch or dinner. You won’t regret it! Also, if you do a river cruise through here you get a really great view of the quarter from the river.
Berliner Dome — The Berliner Dome is stunning from all angles. Hike to the top for views over the city, and find new angles along the spree. My favorite spot is back by James-Simon Park, but I also love the view from the other bridge, from Marx & Engels Park.
Gendarmenmarkt — The twin churches that surround the theatre is probably the greatest example of Berlin in its prime. Built in the 1700s, this square is the perfect place to wander and explore new angles to shoot. I love the view from the stairs of the church, or if you can stitch a panorama then smack dab in the middle is where you want to be!
Berlin Wall — The Berlin Wall can be seen from all over the city. There is the section by Checkpoint Charlie, as well as the famous East Side Gallery. This is where all of the graffiti is, and next Oberbaumbrücke as well, so you can easily combine those things!
Teufelsberg — Devil’s Mountain, the famous old NSA spy grounds during the cold war, has some of the best graffiti you will find. In the middle area you will find a tractor. Amazing prop to add some depth to your photography.
TV Tower — The iconic Soviet TV Tower stands tall in Berlin and can be seen from almost anywhere. Literally. You can climb it and photograph the city from above, or search for all sorts of different locations to nail the view. There is the top of the Berliner Dome, Hackescher Markt, and even out by Brandenburg Gate. I also love the view from Prenzlauer Allee as you move further back from the tower (as long as you have a zoom lens mind you).
Brandenburg Gate — The iconic Brandenburg Gate will definitely make it on your photo list, and for good reason. If you can, and the weather is good, wake up for sun rise and you can get stunning light coming through. If not, sunset works from the other direction just as well!
Schloss Charlottenburg — The little escape from Berlin provides amazing photo opportunities as well as beautiful parks to stroll around. The photo at the front gate is incredible, but back by the bridge in the gardens there is always some amazing reflections you can get!
Reichstag/Bundestag — the seat of parliament and the German government is really a stunning building. Get tickets in advance to climb the iconic glass dome, or simply walk around it. The view from the river by Marie-Elisabeth-Lüders-Haus is stunning, as are both side angles. Generally the front on picture isn’t my favorite as there is dead grass and generally police boxes stationed there, but you can take one there too if you want! Also, the view from Brandenburg Gate is also really cool!
Oberbaumbrücke — A stunning bridge from the pre-war time, the Oberbaumbrücke is an amazing location to shoot. Try up close, up the roads a little bit, from the s-bahn stop, and then my personal favorite is from the water around Hotel nhow Berlin.
If you made this far I would like to reward you with my map of my locations. Thank you for reading, and what are your favorite locations in Berlin and where do you shoot them from?

Berlin has an extensive subway network — 10 lines, 170 stations, 151.7 kilometers of rail. The network transports 507 million passengers every year.
In 2014, I photographed all those signs. The end result is one giant poster and a few (not that useful) learnings!
I’m certain not many people have seen every station along the Berlin subway network. Especially if you’re not from here, there really is no reason to go to Hönow, Wittenau or Rudow. Early last year, I decided that my photography project of the year would be to document all the subway station signs of the city. While the project itself might have gotten slightly redundant after a while, the spaces in between, waiting for the next train, walking out to explore a random neighborhood, or chatting with people confused by the bearded, foreign looking dude jumping in and out of the train at every stop, made for a very exciting experience.
Initially, I thought to code a routing algorithm that would calculate the optimal path (too lazy), and to explore the area around every stop (same). In the end, I managed to snap my last photo in the evening of Dec 30th, barely making it in time. And while I wouldn’t mind retaking some photos in the future, this project is done for now. Here are some observations I made along the way, a beauty contest, and a great poster by my friend Michael
A clear pattern arises after riding a few lines from center to end. Barring the shorter lines, and those that only span the city center, younger people and “expats” are prominent in the central third of every route, the second third is full of immigrants, and in the outer , almost only native Germans are anywhere to be seen.
I postponed the U5 trip for as long as possible, and ended up doing it with my flatmate on Dec 30th. The line is fucked up, for lack of a better word. We drove up and down three times because I didn’t feel comfortable stepping out at one particular station (Hellersdorf). The last station on the U5, Hönow, felt like a remnant of a long gone era, grey, lifeless, and fenced off. The new U55 (the so called “Chancellor’s line”, which one day will become part of the U5) is a markedly clean and shiny contrast.
For a lot of people, particularly expats, people in startups and hipsters, the U8 is the lifeline of the city. Apart from a few stops towards the northern end, the signage is relatively bland (or minimalist, this being Berlin).
In the beginning, I assumed that I would have to wait for the next line at every station, which would have taken me ages. Eventually, I established a rhythm wherein I managed to shoot around 8 signs at a time while managing to jump back into the same train.
I avoided taking photos late at night (trains run way less frequently), rush hours (too many people), and ended up shooting most of the lines at around 9pm, and occasionally on a Saturday (trains run less frequently on Sundays too).
I also realized that the best cars to get into are the second from last or first. The stations tend to have more obstructions (kiosks, stairs, etc) towards the middle, and there were always too many people towards the end. The added benefit was that I could still shoot a sign even if there was a train on the opposite track. Barring the weird looks I got from strangers as I hopped in, ran to frame and shoot, and ran back to squeeze in as the doors were closing, this strategy worked perfectly.
In general, the stations in the western part of the city are prettier. Some of the shorter lines (U3, U4) have very intricate, ornate signs that help to mask the distinctly suburban feeling of those lines.
All the above ground stations had the exact same sign (a very functional, sublimely boring one). The abundance of those earned the U1 the title of ugliest line.
Many stations were newly renovated, or under renovation when I photographed them. The general pattern seemed to be the use of modern, minimalist, sans-serif signs.
The longest line in the network, the U7, wins the beauty contest. The stations out west, in particular, are very distinctive.
Enough words. Here are a couple of hi-res posters that Michael helped design — feel free to download, print and use, they’re licensed under Creative Commons by-nc-sa 2.0. I’m happy to share the print versions, or even the original photos (if you have a cool idea that you want to use them for), get in touch @ramz

The streets of Berlin are bristling with art and graffiti. Being new in town I decided to buy some pens and leave my mark.
I’ve always enjoyed those terse epigrams scrawled across bathroom walls so I chose some quotes from great writers and set out on a bar tour across town.
The bars of Neukölln are dark and grimy dens or creativity — the perfect place for poignant art. At each stop I would order a beer, find a toilet, and start writing.
Update
Found something I’d written hastily as someone’s profile image on Grindr; made me laugh. A friend also spotted one on Instagram. Nice to know people appreciate your work!

I still have “soullessness” as a topic to discuss in this Berlin write-up, but bear with me: we all left the Berlinale bubble to come home to, yes, the infamous coronavirus, news of which had been trickling during the event’s ten days but only really started gushing on its final days.
Because of that, and looking back at this year’s selection, I feel (am I the only one?) a tendency to look at a programme that many considered a “rebirth” of the festival’s posture as a sort of “last hurrah”. Not necessarily for the Berlinale itself, more for the whole concept of the film festival in the 21st century. With other important festivals or film series being cancelled worldwide — New Directors/New Films, South by Southwest, CPH:DOX, Oberhausen, and others — Berlin seemed to have squeezed by before the pandemic lockdown. Does what happened just after the festival colour the way I look back at it? I’m not sure. For all intents and purposes, this was a very intense ten days filled with much ado about nothing — the urban renovation of the Potsdamer Platz area that left festivalgoers short of food options at its heart, the shuttering last December of the Sony Center Cinestar multiplex that deprived the event from…

I just got back from my two-week trip across most of Northern Europe. This is my third trip back to Europe. (My first was a summer abroad in Italy nearly 8 years ago and my second was another two-week trip in 2014 where we explored Dublin, London, Amsterdam, and Paris.) I daresay this was the best so far! Thom and I visited Stockholm, Copenhagen, Berlin, and again, Amsterdam this time around. In order to share our experience and to create a living record of its details, I’ve decided to write across a few posts on each city and its adventures. This first post serves to detail our overall travel plans, information on flights/places to stay, tips on light packing, and general advice for good travel. I should mention that I’m not an expert on any other these things but it’s worth sharing the little knowledge that I gained before, during, and after this trip.
To begin with, here are a few starting facts about our trip:
Let’s begin by discussing budget flights. Nine months before this vacation even happened I found some non-stop flights from Oakland to Stockholm for $600 a person. These flights kicked off the entire trip and made everything possible. I recall the very first time I ever flew to Europe. (Which was 8 years this summer!) It was to Genoa, Italy from Buffalo, NY. That flight had three stops (Buffalo to NYC, NYC to Frankfurt, and Frankfurt to Milan) and one train (Milan to Genoa) in order to get to my destination with a total of over 20+ hours at a hefty price of $1500. (Thanks Aer Lingus! 🖕) So to come across a flight that was only 10 hours and non-stop to my choice destination, it felt like fate...
Doesn’t that last sentence feel so inspiring? Statements and facts like those are the gold and shiny wrapper on the cheap bar of travel chocolate. Here’s the nitty-gritty of budget flying:
With some of the add-ons and extra taxes, our $600 tickets actually came to $711.30 a person. Our in-between flights from city to city were around $50 a person. (As compared to a train from Berlin to Amsterdam which was $120 a ticket.) In the end, you have to deal with the minor annoyances for that 💰deal.
Let’s move on to transportation.
Thom and I took public transit for the most part. (I’ll discuss the bicycling and Uber rides a bit later in some of my city posts.) For us, it’s a fun challenge learning a new city’s public transit. And unlike American public transportation, European public transportation is fast, convenient, and very, VERY reliable. Upon arriving at the Arlanda Airport, which is located just outside of Stockholm, we took the Arlanda Express Train that runs directly to the city center in just 20 minutes. (As compared to my 1.5 hour MUNI and BART trip to Oakland International Airport. 😑) Out of the four cities we visited, Berlin boasted the fastest and most reliable transportation (dat German innovation) with Amsterdam coming in at a close second. (Trams, trams everywhere!) All the trams, trains, and buses that we took were clean and clearly marked. My only complaint was the summer heat which was especially felt in the enclosed and non-air conditioned trains.
I plan to discuss each Airbnb in detail for each city post but in general our decision to use this service came from a few points:
Finally, let’s talk about packing. Much like my last Europe trip, I took a single backpack and personal bag with me. That was it! Now that this trip is over, I can say, quite proudly, that it was the best decision that I made for packing. After each city we visited, Thom and I both got a little better at packing our bags. It was a very efficient way to travel, IMO.
Here are some pros:
I admit that there are some cons involved with this kind of packing. While I can pack a mean bag, it doesn’t exclude the fact that the weight gets to you…no matter how light. If you’ve ever landed at an airport and took public transit into a city, the transfers mean a lot of walking between terminals and stations. The weight of the bag can cause a lot of stress on your neck and shoulders. Even this year, I packed a bag that weighed about 8 lbs total and after a while, say 20 minutes of walking, it can really push down on you. I should mention that my bag isn’t meant for hiking or true backpacking and therefore isn’t super ergonomic. I’m sure if I had chosen a small hiking backpack, my experience would be different. The bag that I took is just an everyday backpack for commuting which is why long walks with a lot of weight can easily become a small burden.
Backpacking can also force you to make some crucial decisions as to what you pack. One small error (should I bring a bathing suit?) and you’ll be forced to carry that item throughout the entire trip with much resentment. The last time we were in Europe, it rained for most of the trip. Thom brought an umbrella this year. He never needed it! 😂 🙃 Lessons learned.
A few surprising things that we did bring this year are:
I’ve only really traveled internationally in the summer months so packing has always been dictated by the warmer weather. I took mainly dresses with a single pair of jeans and shorts. A few shirts to mix it up and a hoodie with a jean jacket for cooler evenings/days. I took a pair of black flats since they’re so versatile and my Keds for comfort as I walked/biked everywhere. I kept toiletries to small sizes and bought anything else that might have run out.
Thom and I failed to exchange any currency prior to the trip. But I would recommend making that order with your bank if possible since ATMs abroad will charge you a fee for any withdrawals. Also, make the obligatory call to your bank letting them know that you are traveling abroad so that they don’t lock your card and account.
A kind co-worker provided us an extra SIM card and we had another already from past trips, so this year we both had data/service for our phones. Thankfully our SIM cards were both purchased in the Netherlands with Vodaphone. These cards worked in all the other countries we visited and we didn’t need to purchase new cards along the way.
Finally, I’ll add that we obtained Global Entry prior to the trip. It made entering the US very easy and fast when going through customs. If you are a frequent international flyer, consider getting Global Entry. Global Entry includes TSA PreCheck. So if you fly around the country frequently (which I do), it’s very convenient and handy for jumping those long security lines.
This post is a part of a series based on my recent two-week trip to Europe.

This article explores why I’ve chosen to move to Berlin, based on my experience since the outbreak of Covid. Nothing fixed yet, everything in flux, which is why I am incredibly excited about this new journey.
As I write this, all I have is a short-term housing contract in Charlottenburg, Berlin, a one-way flight ticket, and a resume reflecting three years of experience as a Software Engineer.
When Covid emerged, I lost my job as a tour guide. I was set to travel to Rome. BOOM. No flights meant no tourists. The company that hired me hadn’t encountered this sort of issue, so they didn’t know how to handle this, which put me in the breakdown. I wrote a post(Korean) about it.
Long story short, I transitioned to become a Software Engineer and have worked with four different companies, including start-ups and larger ones that have reached Series E funding, for the past three years. For those curious about why I switched jobs(Korean)
Now, you might be wondering what this has got to do with my decision to move to Berlin. Let me walk you through it.
Yes, getting better. Will to get better. Even when I battled anxiety and depression, I was fully conscious of this. Thing is, I didn’t know how to get better.
My remedy was stepping out of my comfort zone. I took small steps, even though they seemed nothing. I endeavoured not to focus on the end results but rather to adapt to the journey of getting better.
We often tend to highlight something significant and noticeable, but this can only bring pains when those goals aren’t met. I’m not saying that we shouldn’t have goals. What I’m advocating is setting a goal and then appreciating the human experience of progress towards it.
Here’s my story.
I began running last year, pushing myself to run 3k runs at a 5'00""/km pace, with my heart rate up to Zone 5 (+190bpm), which isn’t quite enjoyable. Something felt off. I wanted to get better, so pushed harder, thinking that getting out of my comfort zone meant running harder and faster. But this approach only caused physical pain and left me stuck in a cycle of I DO NOT MOVE and DO NOT KNOW HOW TO GET OUT. I eventually quit running.
This summer was quite a challenging period. I realised that I needed a daily routine outside of work. I returned to running. Fortunately, I stumbled upon a video pointing out the importance of Slow Runs. It taught me to appreciate the surroundings, focus on each breath I take, and feel every step. Now, I don’t give a s**t about how fast I’m running, I’m more interested in the beauty of the Han River, the relief of overcoming foot pain through trainings and stretching, and the gratitude for living life on my terms. These all small, but they keep me motivated to run and aim to go further, not faster. This is one of the ways of leaving my comfort zone little by little. Consequently, I now run 3–4 times a week, covering an average of 5km at a mild pace. Hopefully, I will be able to run 10km by the end of autumn.
The Divide and Conquer algorithm comes to mind. The Divide and Conquer algorithm is a problem-solving technique that involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. I resonate with the philosophy behind it, because it applies to quite everything in my life.
When you work, at least you want something better. It could be thousands and millions of kinds from person to person — higher salary, career success, supportive leadership, or creating impactful products and numerous other objectives.
After all, it all boils down to communication. The workplace is on the verge of crashing with burning desires. The thing that binds individuals is trust. Overcoming skepticism among colleagues by understanding the others’ Will to get better is the key. This understanding humanises us and ensures we are not machines automated to target only speed and accuracy. Human trust is built on the common sense that we all have desires. The only way to find out this truth is through communication.
As a Software Engineer, needless to say, I’m drawn to solid system architecture to ensure that services run smoothly. However, through my experiences in different workplaces, I’ve also discovered that I feel more satisfied from the communication when building products with team mates. I enjoy asking questions that encourage them to voice their thoughts and opinions on every aspect we face at work, which isn’t quite the case in Korean culture.
We are not machines; we are humans. A leader just ordering what to do is not enough. A goal requires division and conquering process through effective communication and attentive listening because, as the saying goes, the devil is in the details.
Last summer, I visited my parents to celebrate my father’s birthday. I was still on the fence, trying to decide whether I should go to Berlin or not. My mind was full of doubts: ‘what if’, ‘but’, ‘so’, and more.
Out of the blue, I spotted a diary on the bookshelf. I couldn’t resist pulling it from the mess. As I flipped through it, found something that I had written three years ago when I had lost my job without even trying. All the negative emotions and cursing words in an attempt to harm myself back then ironically reassured me. ‘Yeah, life is worth giving a try’.
Towards the end, it goes
… I might feel directionless at the moment because I lost my job. However, I see this as an opportunity to explore what I truly desire from the depths of my heart. Secure a job, earn some money, an then go to Berlin.
Reading this cleared the air for me. There was no need to justify to others why I’m going to Berlin based on rational reasons. It was a conversation between my past self and me in 2023, transcending time that doesn’t truly exist.
Therefore, I decided to go
employing the algorithm Divide and Conquer.

Have you ever wondered what it’s like to volunteer at a refugee shelter in Berlin?
I’ve been volunteering with the Berliner Stadtmission for the better part of a year now and work a shift at their shelter in Moabit almost every weekend. There’s a number of duties you can choose from, such as helping with laundry, to handing out hygiene products like shampoo and soap, to working in the kitchen.
As I like keeping busy and interacting with people, I always opt to work kitchen shifts.
The shelter’s tucked away on a quiet street in Moabit. Ironically not too far, but thankfully far enough, from the nightmare that is LaGeSo.
Finding the exact location of the shelter can be difficult for first-timers. Once you find the “house” number, there’s no building within immediate sight. You’ll see a Berliner Stadtmission sign. Walk past the sign and continue along a tree flanked path.
Directly beside the shelter, is a venue which plays host to different types of events. During the summer, I once walked past when they were holding a wedding. There was a small orchestra playing music, wait staff handing out hors-d’oeuvres, and elegantly dressed people sipping glasses of champagne.
On the other side of the shelter are some tennis courts and a soccer field. During the warmer months, it’s not uncommon to see the facilities put to use.
You also can’t help but notice the sheer number of BMWs, Jaguars, and Porsches parked nearby.
The juxtaposition of seeing two such distinct lifestyles physically side-by-side is jarring. The difference is not lost on the refugees, nor volunteers at the shelter.
It just feels weird and somehow wrong, even if no one is actually doing anything wrong.
Once you reach the end of the pathway, turn left. You can’t miss the shelter, which some of the refugees have come to refer to as “the balloon.”
The emergency shelter is a large domed structure, which can house up to 300 people. It contains dorm rooms that sleep six, a large dining area, a children’s play space, a working kitchen, and even, ping pong and kicker tables.
It’s the first inflatable structure for refugees in Germany. Although it was met with criticism when it was first built in the fall of 2014, due to a perceived lack of privacy and dignity for the refugees, the government is now looking to replicate this model elsewhere in the country. Much has changed since then and this shelter is one of now one of the better places a refugee can stay when in Berlin.
Entering the shelter is a challenge in itself. You open the first door and must wait for it to close behind you, before opening the second door. When you attempt to open the second door, there’s a sudden gush of wind, forcing you to push it really hard to actually get the door to open all the way.
Once you enter, you immediately notice how warm it is. It’s like being inside a hot yoga studio. At this point, my glasses usually steam up. I laugh, greet the security staff a friendly hello, and inform them that I’m working in the kitchen. They check for my name and then wave me in.
Walking towards the kitchen, I see familiar faces. While the shelter was first built to house refugees temporarily, for a few days maximum, due to the backlog in the processing of asylum applications, they often find themselves there for days or months at a time.
I smile at an Afghan man, who knows I’m from Canada. We’ve talked about his desire to relocate there and it hurts to know his chances of being able to do so are slim.
My most special friend, is a little Syrian girl named Alisa. She speaks fluent Arabic, some German, and even a bit of English. She once told me that she thinks she’s 20 years old, then later confessed that she’s only 10. She always offers up smiles, big hugs, and begs you not to leave when you’re shift is over. For fun, she likes to try on my sunglasses and pose like a model.
There’s also plenty of “hallos” and “wie gehts” from the other children as you walk to the kitchen.
Finally, I reach the kitchen and from there, the routine is second nature. I hang up my jacket, don an apron, write my name on a nametag, wash my hands, put on gloves, and set out to work. I find out who the kitchen leader is that day and ask them what they’d like me to do.
Often it’s drying dishes used from the previous meal and putting them away. Other times, it’s preparing the food, like chopping pickles into small pieces, putting bread into containers, and more.
The kitchen “boss” will approach the group at some point and ask them what they would like to do during the meal. Some prefer to spend the entire shift working with the dishwasher at the back. Others, like me, prefer to serve food. Some days, I’m the “banana lady” handing out fruity desserts because the kids treat you like you’re a superhero. I usually prefer to take the first position in our little assembly line, saying hello to the refugees, and asking them what they would like to start with.
Then it’s time to serve the meal. Note — when you volunteer, you can opt to work breakfast, lunch, or supper shifts.
At times, the crowds are small, with around 100 people. Other times, the shelter is filled to capacity and you’re serving crowds of up to 300 people.
A typical meal includes fish or chicken, bread, vegetables, and fruit. For obvious reasons, pork is never on the menu. Bananas seem to be the most popular and the kids will line-up multiple times to procure themselves another piece of fruit.
Shifts are usually fun, but sometimes they’re also really tough. There’s rules that need to be followed and sometimes the refugees are not happy with them.
When they lineup for food, all members of the family must be physically present. Sometimes, the kids are sleeping or are off playing outside. You have no choice but to refuse the mother and ask her to lineup again, with the kids in tow. As you can imagine, this does not always meet with a positive response.
Sometimes, they’ll ask for extra portions. You have to request that they eat what they have and get in line again for seconds. It’s only fair, as everyone needs to be fed before you go about doling out more food. It’s extremely hard saying no though, as you only want to be generous.
Language barriers are another problem. Refugees come from all over and speak a number of different languages, but German and English are not usually one of them. This makes communication very hard, especially when there’s not always translators around to explain things. All you can do is smile, try your best, and compromise as needed. Hand gestures and pointing help. Sneaking them extra bananas also helps to keep them happy, maintain the peace, and ensure the line’s moving.
Often the refugees don’t like the food being served, and if I was them, I’d feel the same. While the food is mostly good, there’s sometimes items on offer that I wouldn’t want to eat either.
I’ve noticed a growing trend lately and see that many leave, buying their food elsewhere. They return to the shelter later on and throw together a small meal that doesn’t require any cooking preparation (they are not permitted access to the shelter’s kitchen facilities). Sometimes, it’s something as simple as cheese and bread.
After the first wave of people have taken their meal, they begin queuing up for seconds, thirds, and so on. We pass out food until everything’s gone, before closing the blinds to signal the kitchen is closed.
The real work starts at this point. There’s dishes to wash, dry, and put away. Counters to be scrubbed clean. Floors to be vacuumed, etc.
At some point, the volunteers take a break and eat a small meal together. This is my favourite time, as it’s nice to get to know the other volunteers and what motivates them to be there.
As time passes, you start to see the same people, so instead of exchanging the typical hellos, we hug and give each other high fives. Other times, there’s people on a short holiday, who actually take time from their vacation to volunteer with refugees. If I knew them better and they wouldn’t think I was weird for doing so, I’d hug them too for being so awesome.
The conversation during our break is always interesting. More often than not, it centers around politics and current events. Hearing the perspective of the paid full-time staff is always eye opening, as they are dealing with the refugee crisis on a day-to-day basis. They worry about the ineffectiveness of LaGeSo, how long refugees are stuck in limbo, and how hard it will be to integrate them into German society so they can go to school, secure work, and so on.
This particular shelter is supported by 1,300 volunteers and I’m proud to be one of them. The fact that people show up regularly and give up their free time is simply inspiring.
Groups like Serve the City come in and do art sessions with the kids, musicians come in and perform opera, while others just come in for coffee and conversation with the refugees.
I met a German man, who once took a group of male refugees out for an evening of billiards. Another girl who owns some dogs, organized an event last weekend, where she took out some of the kids and parents to a nearby park to walk and play with her dogs. Volunteers also come in daily to facilitate German language classes.
While Germany, not to mention the city of Berlin itself, may be mishandling the crisis, volunteers and charities are everything right now. If it wasn’t for them, conditions for refugees would be much worse.
For more information about the “balloon” shelter in Moabit, read this NPR Berlin piece.
If you’re interested in being a volunteer at a refugee shelter in Berlin (specifically this one), you can book a shift through vostel.de.
You can also request to be added to Berliner Stadtmission’s mailing list. They send weekly emails, allowing you to book a shift on a date and time that’s convenient for you.

Looking for an apartment in Berlin in 2017 is a madhouse. I’ve been doing it for about 2 weeks now, as I’ll be starting a new job in the city, but I’ve heard stories of people, who are living in temporary accommodations for months before finding a flat. One guy summed it up perfectly in this comment on Facebook, under a job seeker post:
Jobs are plenty in Berlin, it’s harder to find a place to live.
That being said, imagine my surprise when I received the following e-mail:
Rough translation:
“Dear Rumen,
Yes the room is still free. Please, write me something about yourself. Age, occupation, nationality, etc. I’m sorry to bother you.
It would be nice if you could tell a little bit about yourself to see if it’ll work out.
Photos, rent, deposit and address of the apartment will be disposed to your knowledge.
Good morning,
Best regards,
Christoph”
Most of you might say, of course it’s a scam, look at the inadequate writing. But imagine being desperate to find a place to live. You’re racing against time and you finally receive an answer. You really want to believe that it’s true and you start thinking about excuses. Maybe he’s not German, that’s why the writing is so bad — maybe he’s using Google Translate. Maybe he was in a hurry, because he has to answer a lot of e-mails.
I answered Christoph’s e-mail with a little bit of details about myself, why I’m coming to Berlin and included some of my social media profiles, you know, to prove I’m not a fake person. Shortly after, I get the following e-mail from Chris:
Rough translation:
“Good day Rumen,
Thank you for the information. That sounds perfect. I’m happy to meet you. The apartment is centrally heated and well furnished. The 20 sq.m. room is completely equipped, has wlan internet.
The room is located on a cross road, one has to be a little noise resistant if the windows are open. The windows are well isolated, if closed, there’s no problem with noise.
The flat itself is well organised, your room is next to the living room with a big TV, table and a corner for chilling. The kitchen is equipped with a built-in kitchen (incl. washing machine and fridge). There’s a table with 8 chairs in the living room. There’s a mirror in the bathroom, as well as a sink with a cabinet. (…)
The surroundings are excellent. Lots of places to buy stuff, cafes, restaurants are directly around the corner. Additionally, you can reach bars, clubs, markets and galleries within minutes walking distans.
Address — Friedenstrasse 36 10249 Berlin Friedrichshain
Monthly rent (all incl.)—350 EUR
Deposit (refundable) — 700 EUR
Side expenses are included in the rent. If you think it can work out I can write a little bit about myself. I would be happy to get an answer from you.
Attached, you can see some photos of the apartment.”
As I mentioned, the first red flag was the weird wording, which became evident with every next e-mail. Aside from the fact that the deal seems too good to be true, it’s also odd that someone offering an apartment would spend so much time writing long e-mails with detailed descriptions. People who post apartment offers receive hundreds of e-mails per week. Having a multi-email discussion with a single potential tenant is not likely. Still, all the small suspicions I was having were plausibly deniable. So I continued, telling Christoph the offer sounds good and that he can tell me a little bit about himself. I also asked if he could share his FB profile. The e-mail I received back was in English.
As you can see, the wording is still a bit off. The guy says he’s “half German and half UK”, but evidently can’t write properly in either language. Again, it’s a much longer e-mail than I would’ve expected, but an accusation like that sounds silly by itself — “I don’t trust this guy because he writes lenghty e-mails.” Maybe the guy likes to express himself.
It’s interesting how he mentions important details mixed inbetween marginal information. He says there’s a desk for reading in the room and that I need to pay two months rent plus the deposit up front, all in the same sentence. Conveniently, he also doesn’t use Facebook, so he couldn’t send me a profile. Other than that, everything is jolly good and we’d be living together as besties. At this point, I write how wonderful of a person he seems and that I think we’ll get along excellently. I also asked if a friend of mine could come by and have a look at the apartment, since I’ll be arriving in Berlin in two weeks. The plot thickened.
Christoph actually sent me a copy of his ID card, as well as a scanned flight ticket from Warsaw to Berlin for the 23. December. The ID card looks very real, which confused me for a second. Then again, there’s no information about a person of that name anywhere on the Internet.
It’s a well thought through plot. He provides bits of information spread out in several e-mails, before delivering the final detail. He’s not actually in Berlin, but he’ll send me the keys. I assumed it’s self-explanatory that I’ll have to pay him the money upfront. Still, I asked him to describe step by step how he imagines this would go down.
I wrote back a short reply, saying this is getting absurd. I also asked if renting is normally done this way. Chris wrote:
This is where I lost interest in playing along and told Chris I won’t be going forward with his offer.
Perhaps I should’ve pushed a bit further to see how far things would go. I could’ve also messed around with him a little bit to have something to laugh about with my mates. But to be honest, I neither have time, nor am I in the mood. After all, I need to continue looking for an apartment, just like all the hundreds (thousands?) of people sending e-mails every day.
It makes me sad that there are so many individuals trying to scam people and this probably makes everyone trust each other less. My point is to be careful what you agree on (especially on the Internet) and always consider things carefully even when you’re pressed by time or other circumstances.

But what exactly is Pictoplasma? Similar to the question posed in “The Matrix,” I found myself needing to discover the answer for myself. Let me explain: In 2004, I bought the first Pictoplasma character book in a bookstore in Switzerland and was completely captivated. I also visited their very informative website at the time and gathered that it was a meeting for character designers. Since that day, I wanted to attend Pictoplasma myself. However, it took me 20 years to finally make it. So in May 2024, I attended the conference in Berlin. On the first day, I felt a bit overwhelmed, not because of what was offered, but due to the organization. Everyone had to wait patiently until they could register. I felt a bit lost, but around 3:30 PM, things finally got started. I went to the registration and then directly to the first exhibitions by the artists who would be giving talks in the coming days. I saw some of the works and took them in. Then I wandered around the venue for a while.
The next day, the conference truly kicked off. According to the program, some highly renowned artists from the scene had gathered in Berlin. I attended talks by Joe Bennett, a young designer and animator from the USA. He recently made waves with his series “Scavenger Reign” on HBOMax, a sci-fi series that looks like it could have come from the mind of the artist Moebius. He has been working on this series for over seven years, and it will be available on Netflix in the coming months. His other works for Adult Swim and Fox also stand out, characterized by a quirky but endearing sense of humor.
Additionally, the artist duo “Los Calladitos” really impressed me. Their stunning murals depicting a fantastical world centered around the preservation of light captivated me. They work on their pieces with incredible care and creativity. They also showed some animations from their own film, which brought even more life to their characters and world. Unfortunately, I missed a talk by Peter The Roman, an artist known for experimenting with AI in his 3D worlds. However, I saw some of his works in the exhibitions spread across various locations in Berlin. Overall, 20 artists participated, giving talks and workshops.
But what sets Pictoplasma apart? It’s not merely a stage for artists; it’s also one of the largest communities in the realm of character art and animation. The “Artist Talks” provided profound insights into the world of artists: their methodologies, how they develop ideas and strategies, and how they publish, sell, and make a living from their art. It’s a platform for exchange and collaboration, bringing creatives from diverse backgrounds together. Moreover, the conference reflects the zeitgeist of 2024. In a world dominated by AI, Pictoplasma artists emphasize the importance of emotion and craftsmanship. It became evident that while AI is a valuable tool for ideation, the execution of most artists’ works remains in human hands. This realization, which I suspected before Pictoplasma, was confirmed and reinforced during the event. Indeed, the use of AI elevates the significance of handmade art. Consider, for instance, the wooden figures crafted by artist Parn “Ani” Aniwat, who carves more than 30 charming characters each month. Or reflect on Los Calladitos, who seamlessly transfer their unique style from the vast walls of their murals to their animated films. Even the ceramic lamps crafted by Portuguese artist and entrepreneur Ana Seixas demonstrate how handmade artworks garner special relevance and appreciation. Ultimately, one desires to touch the art that inundates our digital world.
All the days at Pictoplasma were incredibly lively and full of inspiration. One of the most interesting talks was by Philip Hunt, a creative director at AKA Studios from the UK. He shared his experiences and insights about design and art, particularly regarding the film industry and the challenges of adapting a children’s book like “Here We Are” by Oliver Jeffers into a film. He discussed the extensive thought and effort required to translate beautifully drawn 2D characters into a 3D medium. After many ideas and experiments, he and his team successfully turned the book into a beautiful film, which can be admired on Apple TV. By chance, I met Philip on Sunday, the last day of Pictoplasma, at a small flea market in Berlin. I approached him because I didn’t get the chance to talk to him at the event. We had a pleasant conversation about the industry, covering topics like advertising, films, and other media. He asked me how I found Pictoplasma, and I told him that initially, I didn’t know what to expect or what I would take away from it. He responded that each year, he takes away inspiration and a reminder of why he continues his work. He loves attending Pictoplasma, getting inspired by other artists, and gaining a perspective beyond commercial work. He also shared that he attended the first Pictoplasma 20 years ago and didn’t know what it was about back then either. Now, he teaches workshops and helps lead the Pictoplasma Academy. It was a very enjoyable conversation. So, what makes Pictoplasma so special? It’s the chance to see designers and artists doing something different from just working on commercial projects. This is something I can definitely take away from it. I was deeply moved by the following artist talks. One of them was by the artist Parn “Ani” Aniwat. Out of necessity, he began carving small figures out of wood. Now, he makes 30 pieces a month — small, cute characters that he sells to collectors and exhibitors. It has become his business. He gave us a glimpse into his workday, which runs from 9 to 5, after which he spends time with his family, sketches ideas, and watches Netflix. The same goes for the Portuguese artist and entrepreneur Ana Seixas. During the pandemic, she started working with pottery and created clay lamp characters that sold faster in her shop than she could make them.
Of course, even at a conference focused on hand-drawn, painted, or crafted characters, the topic of artificial intelligence can’t be avoided. Some artists use AI as a tool to support their ideas. However, despite the technology and digital capabilities that AI offers, traditional craftsmanship remains one of the most important aspects. While no one insists that art must be created by hand, most artists still find themselves holding a pencil or an Apple Pencil. One of the most memorable statements about AI came from Philip Hunt. A young designer from the audience asked him whether she should focus more on AI. He responded that she should focus on drawing, as AI will inevitably come. But drawing with a pencil would always convey ideas better (or something along those lines; I’m not certain of the exact wording). Another artist, possibly Christopher Rutledge, mentioned that AI is a useful tool but compared it to mastering image databases or programs like Photoshop or After Effects. Artists have shown that they engage with AI, but in the end, it’s their ideas and visions that they bring to life. For the past few months, I’ve felt that we are returning to an era of “handmade” artistry, especially in art, film, and design. With the overproduction of AI-generated images and texts, which now look and read quite well, the personal touch is often missing. A good example is animator Joe Taylor, who makes his style unmistakable with hand-drawn loops that resemble flat designs from claymation. He showcased a commercial clip for the ProCreate app, which he both drew and animated using their software.
Aside from the talks, there were workshops, exhibitions, and parties. Unfortunately, I couldn’t attend all the talks or everything that was offered. Given that Berlin is a very large city and the event organizers thought it would be a good idea to use various locations across the city, it wasn’t easy to be everywhere. There was also an AR scavenger hunt called Character Hunt, where participants had to travel around Berlin using the Adobe Aero app to view the characters. Great ideas, but too little time to experience everything. Attending Pictoplasma was a fascinating journey into the realm of art, characters, and animation. It was far more than I could have ever imagined back then. For me, it was a significant source of inspiration for my work as a designer. Here, I could discover new perspectives and gain a wealth of inspiration.
The most captivating talk was also the last one of Pictoplasma. It was by Mila Useche from Colombia. She is an artist and filmmaker who had a tough journey. She had to fight hard in the working world, including working for a game company where she worked up to 15 hours a day. She then became a freelancer, working for studios like Disney, Warner Brothers, Nickelodeon, and Netflix. She also worked on her own concepts and film ideas. One of these is currently being realized in a German-Colombian co-production.
Recently, there has been a crisis in many animation studios in the USA, with widespread layoffs and job cuts. Adding to this were the aftermath of the pandemic and the surge of companies eager to use AI. Mila needed to find a way out, so she began sharing her hand-drawn images on Instagram, reaching many people who celebrated her art. She now lives in Japan, where she produces her art and characters. That was Pictoplasma 2024. A few days in another world, a world full of inspiration, art, characters, and animated films. Just a different kind of matrix.

After 19 months of closure, Berghain’s doors have opened once more. You don’t need to be a techno Viking to know of its existence. In fact, since 2016 the building — an imposing former power plant — has been classified as a cultural institution. As a newbie to Berlin, I’ve yet to try breaching the seemingly impenetrable doors of the ‘World Capital of Techno’ but maybe you have? How was it? If not, fear not.
Recently I came across this trainer created by sansho. the studio which helps you get in the mood — replacing the aforementioned fear (No? Just me?) with a feel of the place instead. Inside, it’s known to be a temple of decadence and hedonism where no rules apply and all things arise. But first, outside, you must bide your time to even stand a chance. You must be dressed appropriately, act accordingly, and be someone that’ll add to the club’s overall atmosphere. This is a place where you start clubbing on Friday and carry on until Monday morning, so, when it comes to the screening process, it’s taken seriously. Without further ado, skip the queue and test your nerve by answering 3 questions.
Alas, I wasn’t so lucky. Next time, eh?
Test your nerve — Try Enter Berghain

Hi! I’m a Berlin-based Irishman waiting on an epiphany. I ramble about hiking, travel, films, and sometimes, my American curiosities. Edit: Still waiting.

A hundred years ago, Berlin was among the biggest cities in the world as its population rapidly grew from 2 to 4,5 million. Just imagine the demand for new housing at that time! Eventually, the city became a testing ground for architectors’ creativity and social experiments.
Passionate about the ideas of affordable mass housing, modernists were trying to make utopia come true — create cheap, standard, and, if possible, lovely houses. Not to mention, it was also a time of the Nazi’s rise to power. Nowadays, pretty small apartments and compact blocks are concealed by colored plaster, original door patterns, and manicured lawns. I’m sure that living in these houses may feel totally different from the careless meditation of a passerby. We are privileged to observe modernist estates from a distance of decades and draw our own conclusions.
This piece should have started with a bird’s-eye view of the horseshoe-shaped building, but let’s leave it to the birds. City explorers like you and me, not aided by drones or helicopters, see this site differently. When I came, the frost was gleaming on the grass in shadows, and the sun shone gently through a gap between “horseshoe” edges.
The Horseshoe Colony is a complex of townhouses and 3-story blocks of flats, and the central one — as you might have guessed — is curved like a horseshoe. A humble memorial stone at the pond tells this estate was designed by Bruno Taut and built between 1925 and 1933.
I was lucky enough to visit the Horseshoe Colony twice, at dawn and dusk, although it took me an hour to reach Britz, a part of the Neukölln district. As I left the metro, sunlit rosy-and-tartare houses with fiery doors popped up. At first, I was walking past them pretty fast, not realizing they were also part of the architectural ensemble — not just the shaped block.
I didn’t expect such a burst of color either because the whole modernist architecture (and Bauhaus in particular) had always seemed minimalistic and monochrome to me before.
Although this estate appeared as affordable housing for rapidly growing Berlin, it was designed with privacy in mind, thus feeling neither fully urban nor entirely rural. In this densely populated area, you’ll notice a lot of hedged yards with lovely arbors, swings, braziers, beds of flowers, and other attributes of carefree leisure.
The Horseshoe Colony doesn’t look luxurious; however, it gives space for individuality and embodies a passion for detail. I spotted a dozen door variations. My favorite ones are the black-framed ones with colorful rectangles in the middle. You can hardly find the same building color and door pattern combination twice.
But let’s turn back to the horseshoe building for a while. What amazed me the most about it was the optical effect of using sky-blue paint. Loggias look like holes in the building, and you can pretend to see the sky through them. As a result, this pretty massive building doesn’t feel overwhelming.
I noticed something about color that would also be relevant to other housing estates in this article. So, color is probably, the cheapest way to convey style, whereas columns or sculptures require a lot of work and material. It’s remarkable how modernists used the power of color, creating affordable yet original housing.
And the icing on the cake — a crimson wall, which turned out to be just the opposite side of those tartare houses I mentioned at the beginning. The setting sun cast its light on the wall, and the windows and balcony frames got lilac. After all this, I did realize why this settlement gained its status as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
I left the Horseshoe Colony after sunset. Black silhouettes emerged from the gloom but didn’t obstruct the sky view. If you stand on the stairs between the horseshoe edges, you’ll see magnificent scenery — the sun sets behind the building, people switch on the lamps, and this light reflects on the surface of the inner pond.
You can easily spot the White City from afar. Its white minimalist geometry stands out among yellowish houses nearby, and the five-story corner towers, like guardians, stand on both sides of the street, Aroser Allee. This housing estate in the district of Reinickendorf was built in 1928–1931 and turned out to be the last modernist quarter of the Weimar era.
The key role in the White City design belongs to Otto Rudolf Salvisberg. The central structure of this ensemble is like a sea resort hotel hovering above the street. I hate when parked cars spoil the picture, so I squatted in the middle of the boulevard and shot through a hole in the hedge, thus “hiding” the vehicles behind the bushes.
And how can an authentic German building be without a clock on its top?
Look! Another clock on the opposite side of the same building. I adore how classical modernist architects could create a style with the simplest geometric shapes: squares, circles, and rectangles. Although all the buildings generally look uniform, they have numerous unique parts — like these clocks.
Now, the doors. Doors are where modernist architects burst into various color combinations and rectangle compositions. Bright red and blue doors look incredibly vivid on the white facades.
Not to mention gorgeous blue windows along the staircase, an eye-catching stripe of volume on a flat facade.
A couple of paragraphs above, I mentioned so-called “towers,” higher parts of the corner buildings. So, I found five of them: two large towers on both sides of Aroser Allee and three narrow ones at the corner of Emmentaler Straße and Genfer Straße. They create a distinctive border with other buildings and hold the borders of this settlement.
I had visited the White City before chestnuts and poplars started blooming and one more time after trees went green. In spring, there is a short period when the sun is bright enough to make the walls sparkle, but the trees, still leafless, don’t obstruct the view. I was happy to enjoy this contrast between glaring facades and black trunks.
My final unexpected observation was red and blue bands underneath the roofs. On the one side of the street — blue; on the other side — red. Pre-war architects used to leave numerous unobvious details, aesthetic gifts for an attentive urban wanderer. By the way, White City also is UNESCO-protected and part of the Berlin modernism heritage.
Call me old-fashioned, but the number of floors in a residential building should be a one-digit number. For example, five. It seems compact enough and doesn’t turn a house into an ugly “anthill” similar to Soviet-time quarters in East Berlin. I decided to check the Carl Legien Settlement late in the evening, just before sunset.
This housing estate is located a 5-minute walk from the station Prenzlauer Berg in a district of the same name. Like many buildings displayed in this article, it appeared between 1928 and 1930 and was designed by Bruno Taut and Franz Hillinger.
Carl Legien estate is more uniform than, for instance, Horseshoe Colony, but belongs to UNESCO World Heritage, too. Its buildings don’t have varying characteristics like doors or facade colors. What fascinated me the most was the pinkish tint of the walls and, of course, red, yellow, and blue frames. Gazing at them, I immediately recalled paintings by Piet Mondrian.
And again, we observe the same simplicity and minimal expressive means — no columns, no sculptures, no molding. Rounded balconies and loggias are all facing the inner yard, and I guess it must create a feeling of privacy and own space for the dwellers.
Not many buildings in Berlin have bare brick facades. Brick is typical for factories and warehouses, but most residential estates are plastered and painted in pastel colors. However, the UNESCO World Heritage complex at Shiller Park stands out; the exposed concrete grid of balconies and ochre walls immediately drew my attention. It was designed by our good old friend Bruno Taut and constructed in 1924–1930.
I noticed a bright green car on the street between the historic houses and decided to look closer. Like the settlement itself, the car turned out to be also vintage. Citroën 2CV was a popular economy vehicle in the 1950s, and it fitted in here so well. The phrase on the car, “I fly bleifrei,” is a pun. In German, “bleifrei” means “lead-free” or “unleaded” (without added tetraethyl lead), which is a characteristic of petrol or paint. This motto and a cute duck mascot made me smile.
I noticed the streets where this estate stood were named after English cities — Bristolstraße, Dubliner Straße, Oxforer Straße, and Windsorer Straße. Later I understood why — in Google Maps, this area was called the English Quarter. Except for the car and street names, there were some other beautiful details, like a white doily in one of the windows.
The way how I instantly spot historically significant buildings in Berlin is by well-preserved wooden doors and windows. Look at these bold red frames. If the door is original, not a later replacement, the paint must have been scratched off and carefully repainted a dozen times. Paint sagging and overshooting on the glass look so heartwarming and naive when you can visualize the story behind it.
At the end of that walk, I was thinking about the balconies, which were half-glazed and half-opened. Large windows with white “skeletons” created the impression of porches. Maybe this is why so many local dwellers have beds of flowers, sun umbrellas, and chairs on their balconies. It’s a blessing when your home has a special place to meditate, sipping coffee to the sounds of birds’ songs.
It’s getting more challenging to impress you with Berlin modernism, but I’ll try. The ace up my sleeve is this lovely settlement on the southeastern outskirts of Berlin. It was built a bit earlier than most estates introduced here, in 1913–1916, and the design belongs to — surprise! — Bruno Taut.
While walking and taking pictures, I felt uncomfortable — like an obnoxious intruder or a guy chewing popcorn and slurping beer at the museum. Fortunately, there is little chance you disturb someone at 6 a.m. on Saturday because people (except for me though) prefer to bask in bed a bit longer. But my weird pleasure is to stay one-on-one with architecture and avoid city dwellers casting suspicious glances at me.
This settlement is probably the richest in styles and colors and feels specially designed for vacationing. Not surprisingly, it’s called “Gartenstadt” (garden city) in German and belongs to UNESCO World Heritage.
All the buildings have two or three floors, bright wooden shutters, and terraces. Even though most houses are arranged in blocks, they don’t feel like dull clones.
On some doors, I saw eye-shaped stickers with a silhouette of a thief and a phrase in German, “Neighbours are watching.” I don’t know about you, folks, but to me, this is a typical village security system when people notice more than any video surveillance from highly urbanized districts.
So far, the “garden city” was primarily painted in warm colors: orange, red, and yellow; however, it has a winter-cold section, too. If I happened to choose my favorite building here, I’d choose this stunning blue villa. The tree, in the shade of which it stands, seems to be at least a century old, planted at the times of settlement construction.
Sorry, I cannot overcome a desire to show you the lovely doors of Falkenberg once again in detail. See how carefully a trellis (this white frame for supporting climbing plants) is covered with a sheet of glass. Residents’ needs might have changed over time, but they didn’t spoil the initial design with a massive overhang. And the red door below, besides being amazingly beautiful, has a sticker I’ve already told you about.
Did you think there was just one blue house in the garden city of Falkenberg? Here is another one. You can compare how differently the same tone looks in the sun and after the sunset. In the light, it is glossy, and in the gloom, it gets matte and soft like a gouache drawing.
It was pretty late when I headed back to the station, yet I couldn’t miss an opportunity to take one more picture. What a combination of a cold-blue sky and pavement and orange-warm lights and a bush.
I’m not overwhelming you with historical facts from Wikipedia, so you should have some energy left to cope with the last chapter. This so-called “Waldsiedlung” (forest settlement) is located in one of the most picturesque districts of Berlin, Zehlendorf. You cannot take a single photo here without capturing at least one pine.
All the previous modernist settlements were located 5–10 minutes from the nearest train stations, but this one surrounds the station with an unusual name, “Uncle Tom’s Hut.” These beautiful 2–3-story blocks of flats and townhouses were finished between 1926 and 1931. Could it happen without Bruno Taut? Of course, no, folks. And Taut was accompanied by fellow architects Hugo Häring and Otto Rudolf Salvisber, whom I mentioned many times in this and previous articles.
Onkel Toms Hütte, unfortunately, hasn’t been (yet?) honored with the status of UNESCO World Heritage and remains the only settlement in this article without this status. However, it doesn’t mean city authorities neglect its preservation. All the buildings look well-maintained and don’t have noticeable stains on their bright facades.
In childhood, my granny dressed me in not-so-new grey and brown stuff because she knew I’d be dirty by the end of the day. A residential building is something people “use” very often, and why the hell do you make it so bright? I admire the courage of architects who cared about the dwellers’ moods, too. It is much more pleasant to live in a place that also pleases your eyes than just a practical and robust apartment!
My poor German skills, though, were sufficient to interpret gorgeous letters on the building below. It must have been a hairdresser’s workplace, but now it looks unoccupied by any business.
The shadows were growing higher and getting longer. Time to return home and view all the photos taken that day…

One of my favorite hobbies is collecting inspirations of art and design I come across while browsing the internet. Thanks to those new “save” features in apps like Pinterest or Instagram, I’m able to build little digital art museums for myself. I have thousands of “saved” pictures, from vintage photography to exotic art collage. One day I caught myself amused by the simple, elegant, extremely creative logo of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.
Whatever your career is, imagine yourself designing an orchestra logotype. First, you’d take a look at previous creations: mostly elegant curve-shaped designs with ornamental details or typographies. In color patterns, you’d see a majority of red, black and white, sometimes blue or green.
Second, you’d might brainstorm general aspects of orchestras. I’ll help: Tradition. Old Style. Chic. Elegant. Perfection. Beauty. Cult. Deep emotions. Beethoven. The frequency of sound wave. Instruments. Symphonies. The treble clef. The air-drawn lines of a baton.
The ordinary “elegant curve-shaped designs” illustrates these round elements of an orchestra. Music is not “straight”. Emotions are not “straight”. What about the color pattern? They are clearly trying to call attention, communicate passion (red tones) in a classic and elegant way (black, white tones) with notes of respectfulness or loyalty (blue, green tones).
The access to a huge source of inspiration enables the creation of my little digital museums, but it also harms uniqueness. You can create something beautiful and well constructed, but it’s easy to fall into ordinary. You can find many “how-to-do-a-beautiful-orchestra-logo-in-10-steps”, but the real challenge is to be creative and unique and still carry the message you are trying to transmit.
Well, here is why the Berlin Philharmonic logotype owned it:
This overlapped series of pentagon forms (straight lines), instead of illustrating common aspects of an orchestra, communicates the masterful architectural work of Hans Scharoun (1832–1972) for the orchestra’s concert hall, previously all fan or shoebox shaped.
The chosen yellow, a color that’s uncommon for this market, grabs attention, transmits creativity, motivation, optimism, and warmth. That conveys the Berlin Philharmonic is a modern, vivid, joyful orchestra but also warm — musically and emotionally deep.
There is also an easter egg: The overlapped pentagons clearly but not perfectly represent the floor plan of the concert hall. These overlapped pentagons suggest, besides all, a circular movement:
Yes. Circular. Do I have to say more? The logotype merges, in an exquisite way, an architectural uniqueness that characterizes the Berlin Philharmonic, without forgetting the musicality, elegancy, and round elements that surrounds an orchestra. All of those represented, with not a single curve.
“Good design is obvious. Great design is transparent.”
— Joe Sparano

“The strength of career success lies in the power of networking.” - Omotola E.O.
I shared in my previous post about my speaking engagement in Berlin at FOSS Backstage, where I spoke on Contributors’ Engagement and Monetization Opportunities.
In this series, I’ll share some of the new connections I made on this trip, particularly at the FOSS Backstage event.
This is my first international trip outside of Africa. I got the feeling you get when you go to a different country and meet people from different cultures. The good thing is I was already looking forward to connecting, learning new cultures, and having a good time.
I did! I met some cool folks from different organizations and career paths. One thing that brought us together is our love for open source.
Among many other connections I made at this conference, meeting with Outreachy mentors was one of my highlights.
I met with Antonin Delpeuch, an Open Refine community mentor, and Jarek Potiuk, an OpenStack community mentor.
We discussed their experience as an Outreachy mentor, how the program has benefited their projects, and them as a mentor. It’s good to hear them talk about what excites them about Outreachy applicants and interns and how the program has enhanced their projects.
After the conference, I had a good dinner with Antonin Delpeuch, and we talked more about the future of open source and outreach programs. We also shared individual goals, our steps, and what we see in open source.
It was such a great privilege to not only meet with other open source advocates who are interested in what the Outreachy program does but to learn more about how open source experts and the community can get involved, the benefit of the program to mentors, and the steps and requirements to participate in the program.
I was able to preach the gospel of Outreachy to these fantastic folks and build and strengthen their knowledge about the program and relationship. Looking forward to further connecting with them and having them support diversity in tech through the Outreachy program.
Until the next and final series, I will share my experience exploring the great Berlin. Mach’s gut (Welle)!

One day I found myself on a flight to Berlin, Germany. Berlin didn’t even rank within the top ten places to visit on my list but I had to go for work, so why not enjoy this obligatory adventure? I had heard that Berlin was moody and grungy, like the emo child of Europe except it’s not “just a phase”. I was prepared to be met with a lot of punk rock and broody, techno vibes but (as is custom when traveling) I discovered the unexpected.
I landed in the mid evening in Berlin and my colleagues and I were starving and excited to sample Berlin cuisine. Three of us were American and were humbly disappointed that many restaurants nearby were already closed — how inconvenient! It’s usually good to be humbled like this as an American abroad, it definitely enriches one’s character. We did manage to find — what else —but a McDonalds. At this moment, I was less than dazzled by Berlin’s seemingly inaccessible evening meal options but figured it could only get better from here.
In the days that followed, I found Berlin to be a fascinating albeit (at times) icy, bustling city of natives, expats and tourists with cool modern buildings and large boulevards. While the overtone of German austerity, order and efficiency was undeniable, there were surprising pockets of whimsy mixed in here and there.
My personal favorite site was the Brandenburg Gate. A stunning piece of architecture with a lot of history and easily one of the most recognizable landmarks of Berlin.
I also visited Checkpoint Charlie, which was historically the Berlin Wall crossing point. This was a quirky museum overflowing with objects large and small, significant to a major turning point in German history. Not too far from the Brandenburg Gate was the beautiful, lush state park called the Tiergarten. Dense with trees, I would describe the Tiergarten as “Central Park with European elegance” — definitely another favorite location.
While Berlin certainly had highlights of grunge, some parts were charming and even rather quirky with fun thrift stores, local farmer’s markets and the unexpected hipster-style cafe.
Before traveling to Berlin, I was looking forward to sampling famous local fare (currywurst and sauerkraut of course) but Berlin also had much to offer in terms of international cuisine, with a lot of Turkish influences. I made it a priority to sample at least one döner kebab (something I would describe as a cross between shawarma and a sub sandwich) and it did not disappoint. To date, one of the best breakfasts of my life (avocado toast, covered in sautéed mushrooms over thick, fresh bread) was at a highly aesthetic cafe called Kaffee Karamell Berlin. And when I finally got my fork into some local sauerkraut, I knew that I was ruined for any canned, store-bought variety…forever. At the end of my trip I discovered that Berlin was certainly more complex than I had originally imagined. Quirky, grungy, cool, refined, steeped in history yet unapologetically modern, a bit edgy with it’s soft sides as well. Snag your ticket to Berlin and see for yourself!

I was in Berlin, Germany, on May 8th; the 80th anniversary of the day that German forces surrendered unconditionally to the Allies, marking the end of WW2 in Europe. This day is sometimes referred to as “VE Day” (Victory in Europe Day). What a fitting place to be for this momentous occasion.
I have been in Berlin twice before. My first visit, in the summer of 1963 when I was 15 years old, was as part of a “teen tour” of Europe. Asleep in a Berlin hotel, I was awakened by gunfire. The construction of the Berlin Wall (at first, a barbed wire fence) began in August 1961 and in the years following, many people were shot as they tried to escape from East into West Berlin.
My second visit was 24 years ago, as part of a small group from the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, visiting historic sites in Eastern Europe that included memorials, museums, and several concentration camps. Sachsenhausen, one such camp near Berlin, is in the village of Oranienburg. It began as a slave labor camp for “political prisoners” with many subcamps. Still visible are barracks and the ruins of buildings in which remain the remnants of a gas chamber, medical experimentation areas, torture and killing areas, and several crematoria. Prisoners were treated inhumanely, inadequately fed, and openly killed. If you are reading this article, you probably know the list of who would be considered enemies of the state. A partial list includes those against the Reich whether they were Christian, Protestant, Jewish, Coptic, Roma, Communists, Gays, and anyone who was perceived to be mentally or physically disabled. This camp, not unlike others, was not on the outskirts of town. It was in the town. An alleyway separates the town from the gates to the camp with the words “Arbeit Macht Frei” (Works Sets You Free) welded into the gate. This place was not hidden. Quite the contrary, it was wide open to view and more importantly to odor. With several crematoria where bodies were burned, the smell and the ash wafted over the town, falling onto people’s rose gardens as well as onto the town residents themselves.
But I digress. Twenty four years ago, when I visited this camp, there was a person with us who, as a young man, had been a prisoner in Sachsenhausen. Somehow, miraculously, he survived. A Christian man, he had been a journalist, soon to be married, but that did not happen. It was a privilege to see the camp through his eyes, and listen as he recounted his experiences, some of which he had thought he buried along with his fellow inmates.
This was a sacred place whose stories were told to keep alive the memory of those who perished and those who survived. For decades after the war ended, “Never Again” was repeated to ensure that this kind of unleashed hatred and vitriol, resulting in these sorts of inhuman actions, would never happen again. And most of us in the world were confident that nothing like this could ever happen again!
This visit was different.
First, I am different. I am 24 years older. What I try to convince myself of is “unbelievable.” I need to believe.
Second, the world is different. Hatred, vitriol, and cruelty have become normalized. The vile antisemitic tropes that were used to degrade and denigrate people are not only ripe, but they are blossoming. Regrettably, in many places, they are in full bloom. This kind of hate flourishes on the dark web, and in the full light of day. Repulsive speech and actions have become acceptable. Throughout the world we see the rise of political parties with slogans reminiscent of a world which we thought could never be resurrected. And not only is it resurrected, but these parties have also gained representation in congresses and parliaments in the same countries where brave citizens sacrificed and fought against this to make the world safe for all.
Third, the camp is not the same. Shockingly, there are some people who visit the camp, stand next to the crematory ruins, on the rim of the entrance of the first experiment for a gas chamber, beside the remains of a barracks, who say: “this did not happen.” When you tell a lie often enough, people tend to believe it. That’s what happened prior to and during World War II. And in many parts of our world, it is happening now.
I am at a time in my life when more people than not ask me “When are you going to retire?” Here’s my response. Not only am I not going to retire, I am also committing to rededicate myself to engaging in education programs and social justice issues concerning basic human rights related to antisemitism and anti-LGBTQ hatred. All in, in my “golden years” I will not stand by and silently witness the normalization of hatred.
I write this article with both a heavy and a hopeful heart. When I say things are unbelievable, I reinforce in my own mind that I shouldn’t believe them. I am awake to the reality and the knowledge that I must believe what I see, hear, and witness. When I believe it, I will be able to address it in ways that, hopefully, will change where we are, and where we can go as a civil society.
We can choose hate, or we can choose to stand up to hate. We can be silent, or we can call people out when they say or do things that are rooted in prejudice and hate. Each of us can use our voice and our platform for good. We can choose to make excuses for bad behavior, or we can call it out. We can acquaint ourselves with history. We can familiarize ourselves with the consequences when hate is permitted to run amok. We can call out when we see lies presented as truth. And we can challenge people who are fearful or intimidated into saying and behaving in ways that are unacceptable.
When we sit by as people are being dehumanized, referred to as the “other,” we are at the entrance to the gates of Hell. I went through those gates as a tourist. I’ve listened to and read testimonies, seen films and photographs of what Hell looks like. If we consider ourselves members of the human race, we need to take that membership seriously and be aware of what it means to be human. To have hope in the future we need to discover compassion within and speak out against antisemitism and all forms of hate. We cannot excuse the inexcusable and we must believe the unbelievable.
In life’s most challenging moments, how we respond influences both our immediate wellbeing and long-term recovery. Crises arrive uninvited, testing our resilience when we feel most vulnerable. The following tips offer guidance through the turbulence, toward steadier ground.
Remain Calm: When crisis emerges, take a gentle body scan — notice your breathing, pulse, and physical sensations. Do not judge, just observe. Then begin to breathe and focus on your breath. The key is to avoid panic. When we panic, we cannot solve problems effectively. The goal is to think clearly while being aware of what is happening in your body. During this process, pause, take more slow, deep breaths. For some people, repeating prayers that offer solace, doing mindful practice, mindfulness, or engaging playfully with a pet can help.
Assess The Situation: From this centered state notice where you are physically, mentally, and emotionally. Then, identify the elements defining the crisis. What risks exist? What consequences might follow different actions? This assessment doesn’t require perfect information — only honest recognition of what is known and unknown in this moment.
Create Safety: Do what you need to get out of harm’s way. Look around, listen attentively, and notice your surroundings with fresh eyes. Take actions that move you toward greater security, extending this same protective attention to others if they’re with you.
Gather Your Support Circle: Reach out to those whose compassion brings calm — trusted friends, family members, professionals, or others who have walked similar paths. Seek those who offer the support you need rather than imposing what they believe you should want. Throughout the situation, maintain connection with beloved others. Consider engaging in creative activities that redirect mental energy — photography, gardening, music, reading, or writing — offering your mind the opportunity to “reset.”
Communicate with Transparency: Share information others need to hear to assist you, especially during medical emergencies when providers need accurate knowledge of your condition to offer effective care with minimal risk. Honest communication about symptoms, relevant medical history, concerns, and needs, creates the foundation for receiving proper assistance.
Create a Crisis Plan: Consider creating a simple emergency kit kept in your vehicle or near an exit. Maintain accessible records of essential medications, identification, and emergency contacts — both digitally and physically. Identify people who might assist with temporary housing, caregiving, pet-care, or other practical needs that could arise.
Honor Your Fundamental Needs: In crisis, the basics become precious: adequate rest, nourishment, hydration, and moments of quiet. Reflect on what essentials you require and consider how to ensure access to these necessities even during disruption. Tending to these fundamental needs becomes an act of self-compassion during challenging times.
Remember that getting through times of crisis times isn’t about handling everything perfectly. It’s about showing up as best we can, being kind to ourselves, and figuring things out as we go. Sometimes the hardest moments teach us what we’re made of and connect us more deeply to what matters. We might surprise ourselves with what we can handle, even when it feels impossible at first.
I’ve co-authored a book about kindness. I believe deeply in the lasting effects of love. It is in that context that I share my own daily habit. Each morning, I say thank you for another day and ask for an opportunity to make a difference in this world.
To that end, I look for signs of connection to those who came before me — a robin reminds me that my father is near, a butterfly reminds me of my mother. I feel their presence and listen for their guidance. Certain songs transport me to moments in my past, conjuring places, people, and, sometimes, lessons learned.
This daily habit provides continuity to my life. I’m grateful that my journey has been a healthy one so far. Though everything is unpredictable, I express gratitude however I can and move through the world appreciating all the companions I’ve known along the way.

Almost three-quarters of a century ago, the German Army had been pushed back to Berlin. Six years of war culminated in fierce fighting through the streets of Berlin. Adolf Hitler claimed his Third Reich would last for a thousand years, yet by the end of the battle his army was depleted, and his right-hand men had begun to abandon him.
The battle, which was predominantly between German and Soviet Union soldiers, was the last stand of the Nazi regime. Yet the swift advancement of the Allies on both the Eastern and Western Front meant that by the time the Battle of Berlin began, the war was coming to a gradual and bloody end.
A battle which resulted in Germany’s surrender came at a significant human cost. Over three-quarters of a million people, soldiers and civilians were either killed or wounded. Society within Berlin was almost destroyed. Destruction of the city began on the 19th April 1945. The Soviet Union began shelling the city in preparation for the tank and infantry assault. Six days later, led by General Zhukov, the first Russian soldiers broke through to the Berlin suburbs. Day by day, more and more of outer-Berlin fell into Soviet hands.
The counter-attack which was desperately needed by the Germans came from the 12th army, commanded by General Wenck, on April 27th. Yet the sheer number of Soviet soldiers, the lack of resources at Wenck’s disposal and tactical bombing from the Royal Air Force to delay the German reinforcements ultimately made sure that the counter-attack had no real impact. Wenck was halted and the Soviet forces were just 15 miles from the centre of the city. By early May, the Third Reich and everything which Nazism stood for was on the brink of total collapse.
In the meantime, Hitler was deep in his bunker underneath the streets where his people were being slaughtered by an invading force. One of his final acts as German leader was to send members of the Hitler youth out onto the bombed-out streets of Berlin. Many of these would fall during the dying days of the Third Reich.
The people who had followed him, often so loyally, for many years had been left to die by Hitler at the hands of the Soviet Union. When British and American troops made their way into the city from the west, Berlin was surrounded by the Allied forces. The Reichstag lay in ruins, as did the Nazi regime.
It had taken the Allies almost five years to regain a foothold in continental Europe, with Britain and France suffering greatly in the process. Millions of lives were lost in the struggle to crush fascism and the slaughter had been taken to the streets of a city previously considered impregnable by Allied command.
Berliners were, like at the end of the First World War, left with their governments in ruin. Thousands of people lay dead in Berlin, over a million were without power and clean water, yet for many, the worst was yet to come. Although the Second World War was over, the fear an all-new type of warfare was beginning to grip the continent.

Twenty five years ago this week, TV images flashed on screen of people singing and dancing atop the Berlin Wall.
It seemed almost impossible. I gulped, smiled and felt all tingly.
The fall of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9, 1989, was emotional and personal for me. Years earlier, I had lived on the free side of the divided city at the height of the Cold War as an American military high school student. Were our neighbors trapped in the East now free after nearly three decades of Soviet control?
To stem the flow of East Berliners who wanted to escape, a jagged 27-mile wall cut the city into two halves, and 100 miles of barbed wire encircled the back half of West Berlin, making it an island city. But as American military dependents, we enjoyed a good life and freedom in a cosmopolitan half protected by American, British and French soldiers.
Those in East Berlin experienced a daily existence that was dreary and drab behind a 13-foot-tall concrete barrier. Although all roads in West Berlin ended at the wall, we couldn’t help but see the oppression on the other side. “This wall is an illusion,” read graffiti painted on the free side. “You stand like a scab, an unhealing wound,” were scrawled words I still remember today.
With my father’s U.S. Air Force status we were allowed to venture into the East. We occasionally drove through the famous Checkpoint Charlie border crossing in our gigantic1962 Pontiac Star Chief. During day trips, we would purchase camera gear, crystal glassware and wall clocks in shops intended for visiting communist dignitaries.
We avoided the regular markets with no fresh fruit, and shoe stores with only one size, style and color.
On one outing my family returned to our car to find people standing by the trunk, which was large enough to hold three people. They asked us to take them over to the West.
My father just shook his head “no” and told us to get in the car. He had heard of other GI’s who had smuggled East Berliners back to the West and were caught by the American military police. U.S. officials would immediately transfer those soldiers who risked an international incident. They would be sent from West Berlin (a plum assignment) to a desolate outpost in South Korea as punishment the next day, or so the rumor went.
On my 16th birthday, my father took me over to the East for dinner at the Moscow Haus, a high-end restaurant frequented by communist officials. Within minutes, a man in a Russian uniform joined us at the table. In decent English, he asked about the stripes on my father’s uniform and what they meant.
I remember great awkwardness and a racing heartbeat as the soldier continued to sit with us as we remained silent. Finally the Soviet officer returned to his own table. Who was he? Where did he come from? Could we have disappeared that night, deep in the heart of East Berlin?
Another time we tried to buy a motorcycle in a showroom full of choices, or so we thought. The clerk pulled a big book from behind the counter and asked us to write in our name and address. “Three years,” he told us. “What about these in the store?” we asked. No, those were just for display, he said. We would need to get on a list and wait, so we declined.
While the Soviet east sat basically untouched and neglected for 28 years, the fall of the Wall led to massive, but slow, renovations.
The former districts of East Berlin today are festive places, full of upscale townhouses, offbeat art galleries and ethnic restaurants. Playhouses host performances that rival those of New York and Las Vegas, and American celebrities like Matt Damon and Tom Cruise turn up weekly for vacations or movie premieres.
The former swath that cut through the center of city has provided prime real estate for development again, especially along the Spree River. The city’s subway systems are united and provide seamless and efficient transportation for Berlin’s 3.5 million people.
Everything happens on a grand scale, whether it’s a massive fireworks display at the Brandenburg Gate on New Year’s Eve or the opening of Europe’s largest train station days before the 2006 World Cup soccer tournament began. The main government building, Der Reichstag, is a contrast of visions — with old style below and a futurist glass dome above that allows visitors to peer into the legislative chamber below.
By guiding University of Florida student journalists the past 10 years on study-abroad trips, I have been privileged to help tell the story of a reborn Berlin. Armed with digital cameras, voice recorders and laptops, UF students have spent two weeks every May since 2005 reporting on a cross-section of Berliners. From the city where I discovered my interest in photojournalism, we document some of the people and places that exemplify Berlin’s ongoing spirit of freedom. It’s a subtle revelation as the students come to understand the significance of what they are seeing and feeling.
Many return to Florida saying they’ve been changed; they have felt the underlying spirit of survival, transformation, creativity and openness. Most are surprised and enthralled that the city lives up its reputation of “anything goes.” Some students feel more patriotic after learning and seeing first-hand how American forces kept the city alive following World War II. Some say they want to return to Berlin and open a coffee shop – or work for the Fat Tire Bike Tour company. Most have heard the expression first-hand from Berliners that “you can be who you want to be in Berlin.”
All remember Dr. Pong — a virtually unmarked club where the only entertainment is a single ping-pong table and loud music. Holding a beverage in one hand and a paddle in the other, up to 30 partiers circle the table in a counter-clockwise motion, enjoying a group game that shrinks in size as players miss and have to sit out. After the final two players battle for the championship, the winner bangs the table three times with his paddle, and everyone starts up again. It’s a happy mix – a free-for-all of ages, styles, religions and politics.
Dr. Pong is only a hole-in-the-wall pub, a relic in the former East. It’s poorly lit, has unadorned concrete walls and is full of choking smoke. Yet it speaks volumes about the edginess of Berlin, the acceptance of others and the freedom that the united city now enjoys.
Twenty-five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Germany’s capital continues to reinvent itself, balancing between an historic past and an optimistic future to remain one of the world’s leading cities. I’m proud to be a part of that transformation every year.
John has been teaching photojournalism at the University of Florida since 1991. Each summer, he organizes a trip to Berlin for students interested in documentary journalism.

Berlin has become one of the most interesting and exciting cities in Europe to visit. You can go back in history to a church from 123o A.D., to the more recent history of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the ever-changing city and rejuvenating neighborhoods. Berlin is a terrific city from a runner’s perspective, but it takes some planning because it is big and sprawling. You can run almost anywhere in Berlin — the sidewalks are wide and there is an unbelievable network of bike paths (but note they really are for bikes…).
From the city’s center, there are wonderful runs around some of the most important sites and monuments, along the Spree River, and into some wonderful parks, notably the Tiergarten and Volkspark. Just outside the city, highlights include the Grunewald Forest, Spandauer Forest, Tegeler Forst, and some wonderful parks for running near the convention center and airport. If you have the time, hop on a train and go to Potsdam and run in on of their wonderful parks, including our famous ‘Palace Run’.
Berlin is very spread out — about 5x the size of Paris, and distances are big. So, best to plan your runs and where to stay, and use the
fabulous transportation system with extensive subway and rail (U-Bahn and S-Bahn), and bus lines. This allows you to do a run one way and hop the U-bahn back!
Topographically, the city is fairly flat. For some hills, go to Volkspark Friedrichshain.
Berlin climate is typical of continental Europe. Winters are cool but not frigid and there is rarely persistent snow or ice. Summers can be warm and humid but not hot, with lovely long days. Rain is plentiful and os spread throughout the year.
14 miles of paths. Start: Brandenburg Gate. MAPNice add-on: Schlosspark Charlottenburg, ~2 miles west. Baroque castle surrounded by beautiful gardens, with paths along the River Spree. ~2 mile perimeter run and ~2 miles of paths.
The Tiergarten is the running capital of Berlin. A vast, 545 acre green space right in the city, Tiergarten is a running paradise for locals and visitors alike. There are about 14 miles of mainly gravel trails. A ‘straight’ option is to take the paths alongside Strasse des 17 Juni, past the Victory Column. There are several small lakes, lovely English Gardens, and paths along the Landwehrkanal and Spree River. Several of Berlin’s important landmarks are also part of this run: Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag building (seat of the German parliament), Bellevue Palace (German President’s residence), the Congress Hall, the Kanzleramt (Chancellor’s Office), some remnants of the Berlin Wall, and the Soviet War Memorial. Our embedded map shows a nice 7k tour of the park, courtesy of the Sheraton Grand Hotel, and our linked map shows the park’s entire trail system. There are maps well situated throughout the park, as well as WCs, water, and places for snacks or an after run beer.
2 miles or more. Start: Park. Access: Ubahn Richard-Wagner-Platz. MAP
The largest palace in Berlin and its lovely gardens are a popular tourist attraction. The park surrounding the palace makes for a lovely run, with grand paths approaching the palace and then along the water. The perimeter paths add to ~2 miles, with a couple more miles possible using all the interior paths. Closest subway access is Richard-Wagner-Platz or Sophie Charlotte Platz. A nice add-on is to run west along the Spree to Tiergarten, which is ~2 miles. Then you can run even more in the park, or along the water.
A great ‘long run’ option is to start at Brandenberg Gate, run through Tiergarten to the end, and then take the canal paths to Schlosspark Charlottenburg. Do a tour of the park and take the lovely tree-lined Schlosstrasse to the Sophie Charlotte Platz U-bahn for a return. About 7 miles one-way.
7.5 miles. Start: Alexanderplatz. MAP
This is a “jogging sightseeing” tour, incorporating some of the visitor highlights of Berlin. It’s about 7.5 miles, and you can jump on or off depending on whatever location is most convenient. Our route starts at the centrally located Alexanderplatz — a major transport and shopping center, and near the Berlin Congress Center. There are several examples of important German architecture and history in this area. Head west, running by the Aquarium, East Germany museum, and on the river, just across from the Museumsinsel — an island with several of Berlin’s important museums. Head south, passing by the Berlin opera and the Communications Museum, to Checkpoint Charlie. Pass by a the Topography of Terrors (actually a very serious exhibition of Nazi atrocities), up to the Potsdamer Platz — a square at the heart of the city’s history, and area with several concert halls and theaters. Head north, on the outskirts of Tiergarten to the Brandenberg Gate and German Parliament (Reichstag). The run concludes with a 2 mile jaunt east, through the University of Berlin, along Unter Den Linden, a wide street with many important buildings and museums (and tons of construction). Easy add-ons to this run are the paths of Tiergarten. See river paths, or west along the Kurfürstendamm.
This is an island right in the heart of Berlin that has several important museums and buildings. One can run on the island, and on paths along the river on either side, using the many pedestrian bridges to cross over. It is a good 3.5–4 miles on the paths around the island. Lots of ways to add on with river paths in area. Note: lots of construction in the area.
4.8 miles out and back along the Kurfürstendamm. Start: western end in Hallensee, or eastern end at Wittenbergplatz subway. MAP
This is Berlin’s most important commercial street, akin to the Champs Elysees. The Ku’damm, as it is called, has been the heart of west Berlin, lined with cafés, clubs, fashion stores, car dealerships (nice looking ones) and restaurants. It is pleasant to run along this wide road, especially in the morning before it’s too crowded. Also a good night running option. A there and back along the main sections of the road is ~4.8 miles. Good options to continue south of Kurfürstendamm into the Wilmersdorf area and lovely Volkspark. Also, the side streets off Kurfürstendamm are pleasant for running. An interesting site here the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church.
5 mile Loop w/shorter options. Start: S-Bahn Treptower park stop. MAPLonger option or separate run: Over bridge and along Spree River paths. MAP
Treptower Park is a good anchor point for running in east Berlin. It’s a bit of a ride from the city center but easy to get to via S-Bahn. The pleasant park has numerous paths that can be combined with a run along the Spree River. Our route starts at the S-Bahn station, through the Treptower Park trails and the Planterwald nature preserve. An important landmark is the Soviet War Memorial, which commemorates the 80,000 Soviet soldiers who were killed in the Battle of Berlin. Then loop back along the river paths, viewing remaining elements of the Spreepark amusement park, which operated from 1969–2001. Our run is 5 miles. For a nice add-on, cross the bridge over the river and run along Spree River paths of the Rummelsbergarea. It’s a This is mostly waterfront running, with some 7.5 miles RT possible. A 3.5 mile loop would be the finger out to Friedhof Alt-Stralau. Nearby is the massive Arena Berlin, and good running options along the Landwehr Canal trails.
6.25 mile loop. Start: U Hallesches Tor U-Bahn or other stops. MAP
This is another pleasant run in east Berlin, taking in the trails along the Landwehr Canal and Gorlitzer Park. The dirt path goes along the water here, with weeping willows and by beer gardens and restaurants, including Restaurant Boat van Loon. There are lots of restaurants and cafes along Maybach-Ufer or Paul-Lincke-Ufer. Our route includes a tour of Gorlitzer Park, with its big open fields and paths. This run can also be combined with Treptower Park, about 1 mile away. On Tuesdays and Fridays there is a wonderful Turkish market, which makes for a great post-run stop.
Many trail options. 3 lakes w/good perimeter paths. Access: Grunewald station (closest to the city), Nikolassee station (south end), or Wannsee station (closest to the beach)
At 7,000 acres, this is the largest park in Berlin. Nearly 100 miles of roads and trails. Some fairly rugged for running. Hard to proscribe a particular run since there are so many options. Some lakeside path perimeters include 2.5k around Grunewaldsee, 4k around Krumme Lake, and 8k around the Schlachtensee. One option is to do a long run, such as to the south end of Lake Schlachtensee, and then the S-Bahn Nikolassee station. A good hill option is to follow the trail called Teufelsberg, which is a 350-foot high mountain made out of rubble from WW2. Now that’s a one-of-a-kind ‘er.!
Prenzlauer Berg
A nice neighborhood for running. Combine this with Volkspark Friedrichshain. Lots of pleasant streets with cafes, parks, and playgrounds. Stay west of Prenzlauer Allee and east of Brunnenstrasse. Good streets include Kollwitzplatz and Kollwitzstraße.
The Wilmersdorf. Pretty neighborhood in the southwest part of the city. Volkspark Wilmersdorf is a lovely linear park that has a tour of 5–7k. Western end is along small ponds. Access via subway: Rathaus Schöneberg. Others nearby. MAP
Volkspark Rehberge. Nice park which, combined with Goethe Park to the southeast is nearly 300 acres or ~3 miles of pleasant biking and walking trails, and a nicely manicured memorial garden. ~4 miles west of the city and only 2 miles from Tegel aiport. Can be combined with Volkspark Jungfernheide, which is 1.5 miles east. Access: Rehberge metro.
Volkspark Jungfernheide.Nice 300 acre park with sporting facilities. Great option near Tegel airport.
Volkspark Friedrichshain. a path-packed melange of wooded rolling hills, grasslands, a Baroque fairy-tale fountain, and two good-sized hills made from surplus rubble. Berlin’s oldest park. Combine with nearby Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood. MAP
Spandauer Forest. Access: Spandaur U-Bahn. This is a huge park about 10 miles west of the center of Berlin. Closest public transport access is Spandauer, 1.5 miles from the park. It is nearly 4 miles from the southern end of the park to the northern end. There are tons of trails, with a good variety of woods, fields, and waterside paths. Good maps and loop options right off the parking lot at Schoenwalden Allee. A couple of highlights are to run along the stream paths one way, and then along the Brandenberg Wall path on the way back. If 10+ miles of running in this park isn’t enough, Tegeler Forest, with its more wooded, rugged trails, is just to the east. Spandauer Forest is a good running option near Berlin’s international airport.
Tegeler See. Access: U-Bahn Tegel. Just north of Tegel airport. Wonderful waterfront run along the Tegler See. Run across Borsigdamm towards Greenwichpromenade. Once past the mooring sites, you’ll reach the beautiful park of the Tegel Palace. Just past Villa Borsig via Schwarzer Weg, you’ll reach the Tegeler See and a beach & swimming site. This out and back is just over 4 miles, and can be combined with trails in the Tegeler Forst. MAP
6 miles RT. Start: Potsdam Train Station. MAP
About 15 miles from Berlin and an easy train ride, Potsdam is the capital of the German state of Brandenberg and was the residence of Prussian kings and the Kaiser until 1918. Running options here abound — there are wonderful palaces, paths along the Havel river, and wonderful parks. Our route highlights the famous castles and landmarks of Potsdam. Start at the train station and take Friedrich-Ebert-Straße to the northern city gate. Then take the park path to the main city gate, and into the Marlygarten and the main palace area. Use the northern end paths of the park, running by the Sanssouci (Frederick the Great) palace and gardens, the Orangery Palace and Botanical Gardens, and then along Hauptalee to the Neues Palace — enjoy the stairs! Return along the other area paths. There are great options to add on here: University of Potsdam, paths along the Havel river 2k just to the south, Babelesberg Park and several other wonderful parks, particularly to the east.
There is a huge selection of hotels in Berlin. The city is very spread out, so best to plan you stay near one of the routes and near a metro station. Recommendations:
Many of the running shoe companies have running stores in Berlin.
Runners Point. Has 5 stores in the Berlin area. They have a very centrally located store right on Kurfürstendamm A fast growing group run culture, with events nearly every day.
Nike Store. Near Tiergarten. Group runs.
Spreeläufer. Good running store in Prenzlauer Berg area.
Puma Store and Adidas Store, Potsdamer Platz, and a couple of other locations.

Runners Point and the Nike Run Club store also host group runs.
Running in Germany. Good site for info about marathons and other interesting races in Germany.
Berlin Marathon. September. One of the world’s three largest and best marathons. It has two gentle inclines at miles 17 and 21. Otherwise, it’s a fast, flat course through the whole city, and 800 years of history with a spectacular new finish, through the Brandenburg Gate.
Berliner Half-Marathon. April. Nearly 15,000 runners take a 13.1-mile sight-seeing tour of the city. Visit www.berlin-marathon.com.

Last summer I went to Berlin and it was beautiful. Despite the heat wave that had been sweeping across Europe when visiting, it didn’t ruin the experience — even if we were sweating.
After taking an overnight train on Friday, I woke and started my early day in Berlin on Saturday. I had planned the day out so that I would see most of Berlin in my limited time (I had to leave by Sunday night) and it was successful, hitting most of the main spots. However, there is some things I missed, so if you want a more in-depth experience I’d recommend staying longer. Berlin is not a smaller European city like Copenhagen, but a huge area a Manhattan-style feel at points.
Here is how I saw Berlin in about 48 hours:
Right off the train stop you will be able to walk towards Brandenburg gate and the Reichstag (German Parliament building).

The future is already here — it’s just not very evenly distributed. Stories about cyberpunk becoming our modern reality.

I travel the world exploring high tech low life places. Most of these places are in Asia, but what about Europe? Wikipedia Cyberpunk page mentioned Sony Center in Berlin as an example of cyberpunk-influenced cityscape. Modern incarnations of cyberpunk are exact focus of this blog, so we’re going to Germany!
First place we’ll visit is Potsdamer Platz in Berlin’s central borough called Mitte.
This place is awesome and looks more like Manhattan than a German city.
Being a kid in late 90s I loved a TV show called “Total Recall 2070”. It was loosely based on Philip K. Dick works. Plots of most episodes are quite cheesy, but its futuristic atmosphere was so damn dark and sinister! And you know what? Potsdamer Platz looks and feels exactly like Total Recall 2070.
As I know, no cyberpunk books or movies are based in Berlin, but they definitely should!
Berlin is worth visiting just for Potsdamer Platz, but let’s proceed to the Sony Center, which is nearby.
It is easy to approach Sony Center from Potsdamer Platz, just go where all the neon lights are.
This area consists mostly of shopping malls, offices, restaurants. But who cares? For me it looks exactly like William Gibson’s 80s vision of the future.
Large shining dome reminds me of Highlander 2 movie. By the way, the movie was very much high tech and low life.
Offices on the sides of Sony Center looks super futuristic even without glowing neon lights.
The area of Sony Center and nearby office buildings is quite crowded and noisy. Walk couple of minutes westward and suddenly the streets become empty.
Approaching Tiergarten, Berlin’s central park. It is completely empty at 8pm.
Going to Unter den Linden street, which passes Mitte horizontally. Westernmost part of the street is a place of famous Brandenburg Gate and different government building.
But let’s go east, where Berlin looks more hi tech and noire.
Probably low life is not what you’ll find here, but central Berlin still has its dark vibe at night with techno clubs and dark cold streets.
Mitte reminds me both Manhattan and Moscow, but feels darker than each of them.
Speaking of Moscow, we’re approaching Alexanderplatz which looks a lot like large soviet city, rather than Western Europe.
Which is quite obvious, since this district was a part of Eastern Germany.
When it is foggy, Alexanderplatz feels like a vampire movie.
Visiting Berlin is definitely a good idea for dark future fans. Other districts look less dark, but still interesting to explore. Berlin is easy to reach via major airlines (sometimes with connection in Frankfurt or Munich) and its relatively cheap, comparing to other Western Europe capital cities.

Travel Date: Oct 25, 2022Trip Duration: 4 daysLocation: BerlinCountry: Germany
It was late October, and autumn had fully embraced Europe. The air was crisp, the leaves were golden, and I found myself in a refreshed state of mind after months of routine in the Netherlands. My last adventure had been to Belgium, and I felt the need for another break — a chance to both recharge and reconnect with a close friend living in Berlin. With that in mind, I booked a BlaBla car, a budget-friendly option, for the 7-hour drive. It was a journey shared with strangers, but the ride turned out to be quite enjoyable, with pleasant conversations and the excitement of traveling to a new place.
As we approached Berlin in the evening, my first glimpse of the city was the iconic Fernsehturm, the famous TV Tower. Bathed in the soft evening light, it loomed over the skyline like a symbol of Berlin’s complex past. Once a broadcasting tower and a proud symbol of Communist power, today it stands as one of the city’s most recognizable landmarks. My first impression of the city was a blend of awe and anticipation.
Eager to experience Berlin, I spent some time wandering the lively streets, soaking in the urban energy and the distinct buzz of the city. The streets were a blend of old and new, modern cafes and shops nestled between centuries-old buildings that told their own stories of Berlin’s history. Eventually, I made my way to my friend’s apartment. It had been years since we last saw each other, so catching up felt like a breath of fresh air. After settling in and relaxing for a bit, my friend decided it was time to introduce me to Berlin’s legendary nightlife. The city came alive after dark, and we hopped from one lively spot to another, enjoying the pulse of the city.
The next day, on the 26th of October, I had planned something a little more structured — a walking tour booked through GuruWalk. The morning air was chilly but refreshing, and I made it to the meeting point just in time. Our guide, knowledgeable and passionate, took us on a historical journey through Berlin’s war-torn past. One of the first stops was Checkpoint Charlie, the best-known crossing point between East and West Berlin during the Cold War. Standing there, I could almost feel the tension and uncertainty that must have hung in the air during those days of division.
As we moved on, we visited the site of Hitler’s final bunker, the very place where he spent the last moments of his life. It was a sobering experience, knowing that beneath the unassuming ground lay a chapter of history that shaped the world. The tour continued, and soon we found ourselves at the Brandenburg Gate, standing tall and proud. This grand monument, once a symbol of division, now stands for unity and peace. Under the unexpectedly warm autumn sun, I took a few photos, trying to capture the magnificence of the gate with its classical columns and rich history. After lingering there for a bit, basking in the sun, I met a traveler from the United States. We clicked immediately, and together, we decided to continue exploring.
Our next destination was the Konzerthaus Berlin, an elegant concert hall known for its neoclassical architecture. The grandeur of the place was awe-inspiring, and I could almost imagine the musical performances that must have filled the air with harmony and culture. We walked the historical streets, each corner revealing layers of Berlin’s rich and sometimes tumultuous past. Eventually, we found ourselves at Berlin Cathedral, a majestic structure that has stood since the 1800s. The cathedral was imposing, with its grand dome and intricate details. Inside, it houses a massive organ with 7,269 pipes, a royal tomb, and offers breathtaking views of the city from its dome. We admired the architecture and strolled through its quiet interior, feeling the weight of history within its walls.
By late afternoon, it was time for me to meet up with some old colleagues from a previous job. Around 5 p.m., I grabbed a quick bite and made my way to Alexanderplatz, one of Berlin’s busiest and most famous squares. We spent the next few hours at Museum Island, a tranquil spot surrounded by stunning museums, and it was the perfect place to catch up and relax. As evening fell, we headed to a cozy bar nearby, where we shared stories, laughed, and reminisced about old times. The hours slipped away effortlessly — there’s nothing quite like the ease of conversation with familiar faces after so long apart.
The next day, October 27th, my friend had some time off, and he suggested we visit Teufelsberg, a unique and slightly offbeat destination. It was once a U.S. listening station during the Cold War, perched atop an artificial hill made from the rubble of WWII. Today, it’s known for its panoramic views and vibrant street art. We hopped on a train and made our way through the city, the excitement of exploring something new bubbling between us. After getting off at the station, we hiked through the Grunewald Forest. The autumn colors were at their peak, and the forest was alive with shades of amber, gold, and crimson. It was a peaceful walk, and the beauty of the season made it all the more special.
Teufelsberg itself was a fascinating place. The structure, abandoned and worn by time, was now a canvas for street artists. The walls were covered in colorful, intricate graffiti, each piece telling its own story. We spent hours wandering around, taking in both the art and the history of the place. The view from the top was breathtaking, offering a sweeping panorama of the city and the surrounding forest. It felt like a hidden gem, a place that not every tourist would think to visit.
Before heading back, we grabbed some Indian snacks at a nearby spot. Later that evening, we decided to make a simple but delicious dinner at home — Aglio olio. My friend had perfected the recipe, and it turned out to be a delightful meal.
The following day was more relaxed. After a leisurely breakfast, my friend gave me a mini-tour of his apartment, which had a fantastic view of the street below and a spacious terrace perfect for parties. The weather continued to surprise us, warm and sunny, which is rare for October in Germany. I spent the day revisiting some of the places I had already seen, this time at my own pace. Walking through the streets with my earphones in, I listened to Rick Steeve’s videos., taking in more of the city’s history and architecture. There’s something deeply satisfying about exploring a city on your own, taking the time to absorb its energy and appreciate its stories.
That evening, my friend invited me to dinner at a fancy Greek restaurant. It was my first time trying Greek food, and the dishes were amazing — rich, flavorful, and hearty. We were joined by a friend of his who was Greek, which made the experience even better as he explained the origins and significance of each dish. After our meal, we took a final stroll through the streets of Berlin. The city had left a lasting impression on me, with its mix of history, culture, and modern vibrancy.
The next morning, I caught my bus back to the Netherlands, reflecting on the incredible experiences of the past few days. Berlin had been everything I hoped for and more — both a journey through history and a personal adventure that I wouldn’t soon forget.

BERLIN — Berlin is gritty and urbane, where techno music throbs against the graffitied walls of sex clubs and drag bars. The city is known for being progressive and tolerant — but hop on the S-Bahn to one of the last stations in the East and you’ve entered Marzahn.
This is the other Berlin.
Marzahn is tucked in the northeast corner of Berlin, a working class industrial region, dotted with high-rise flats dating from the Communist era. Far-right politics find fertile ground here. After the Berlin Wall fell, Marzahn became a hub for skinheads and swastikas in the 1990s, an area rife with nationalism and populism.
Today, Marzahn is a stronghold of the country’s most successful nationalist party, the Alternative for Germany or AfD. The party embraces a platform of familiar right-wing causes — anti-immigration, isolationism, anti-LGBTQ, anti-vaccine, antisemitism and climate change denial — which are part of the American political landscape as well. Like former U.S. President Donald Trump, some in the AfD have grudging admiration for Russian leader Vladimir Putin. They oppose supplying arms to Ukraine to defend itself against Moscow’s recent invasion.
Although AfD support slipped in the most recent elections last year, its formerly fringe politics are moving deeper into the mainstream —in Germany as abroad.
Jorn Geissler, treasurer of the Marzahn branch, is keen to explain himself and his views to American readers. He invited me into his office, projecting a voice that exuded his buoyant demeanor as he walked me through the local city hall. This German nationalist wore a pair of gray khakis and greeted me with vanilla wafers and black coffee.
“You are now leaving the politically correct sector,” reads a mousepad on a desk in the AfD Marzahn office. This is a party that trades inclusive policy and progress on human rights — or political correctness — for nationalist and anti-immigrant sentiment.
Of course, speaking to an American journalist, Geissler presented the polished rendition of the far-right faction, meticulously packaged as socially acceptable. Geissler wanted to make this remarkably clear.
“I’m not a Nazi and I’m not a racist,” said Geissler. “We hear so much about fascists and Nazis in Germany, in Berlin, in Marzahn, but I’ve never seen a Nazi.”
The AfD party was founded in 2013 by mainstream Christian Democrats, who wished to abolish the euro as Germany’s currency. It adopted a clear anti-immigration platform amid the influx of Muslim refugees in 2015, when the party’s popularity rose.
Supporters are primarily from the former Communist eastern part of the country, where the political divide today reflects a split along the former Iron Curtain. During the AfD’s peak in the 2017 election, only 11.1% of western German voters cast a vote for the AfD as compared to 22.5% in the eastern states, according to tracking carried out by the German publication FOCUS.
Right wing parties have made strong inroads in the former East Germany, a phenomenon attributed to high unemployment and loss of identity after the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989, what Germans call the Wende, which means ‘Turn.’
“The whole East lost its political orientation in 1989,” Geissler said. “The former parties collapsed and all people in East Germany had to orient in a new way because we had no strong connection with the existing parties.”
Upon its creation in 2013, the AfD did not meet the five percent threshold to elect members to the German parliament. Very quickly, however, party support skyrocketed due to its feisty social conservative politics and its opposition to an influx of asylum seekers from the Middle East and Africa.
In Marzahn, support in 2021 hovered around 16%, maintaining the right-leaning reputation of the neighborhood. In the 2017 national election, 20.6% of Marzahn voters chose the AfD in the first round of voting, the party’s peak year.
Geissler, a construction engineer, joined the far-right party in 2014, attracted to its nationalist stance against the euro. He came to appreciate the party’s disruptive politics, seeing it as the German counterpart to Trumpism.
“We are not controlled by the system,’’ he said.
Even as a young man, growing up in the Germany Democratic Republic, or East Germany, Geissler was the rebellious type, dissatisfied with the living conditions maintained by the ruling Communists.
The same goes for Jeannette Auricht, 62, a member of the Berlin Senate who as a child danced around her room to Michael Jackson and Earth, Wind & Fire on the radio. In all areas of Berlin, TV and radio channels were left unrestricted which also gave her and other East Berliners access to the American Forces Network, a U.S. Army-run radio channel that contributed to her rising angst over lack of freedoms in the East.
Auricht was arrested in her teen years for demonstrating against the Berlin Wall. Now, she represents the AfD in Berlin and says she has “learned to read between the lines” in German politics, meaning she has a long-standing mistrust of government.
As she pledges to hold onto her center-right stance, not all of her party co-members do the same, instead drifting further right.
The alternative ideology of the party has attracted many extremist members, prompting the German courts in March 2021 uphold the government-declared designation of the AfD as a “suspicious entity,” which makes it legal to monitor groups who may be engaging in anti-constitutional activities.
Germany’s attempt to put the AfD under surveillance for extremism does not phase Auricht, who said she does not fear wiretapping because she has nothing to hide.
“I’m not planning a revolution,” she said. “Criticizing the government is a job you have to do and that is nothing against the country or the democratic ways.”
Within the party, leaders try to push out extremists by researching whether they have a racist or fascist history, Geissler said. However, German laws make it difficult to remove members from their parties and this proactive measure was only implemented a couple years into AfD’s existence, he said.
So, extremists do still exist here. And while the party is currently split between center-right and far-right directions, the far-right fringe casts a dark shadow on the reputation of the party.
In late 2020, former AfD party official Christian Lueth was recorded saying that to allow more migrants into Germany would be better for the party because it would attract more membership. As for the immigrants, he said, they can “shoot them all afterwards.”
“Or gas them, whichever you like. I don’t care either way,” the Lueth was quoted as saying.
Geissler said that other political parties in the governing coalition fight against the AfD because of some outspoken extremists, and he also blames the media for misrepresenting the party, due to what he considers a journalistic lean to the left.
He also points out that most party officials are beginners in the political scene.
“AfD members are mostly newbies,” Geissler said. “Most people have no political experience compared to other political parties. And you have to go a long way to get to the top.”
The fringe is gaining ground not only in Germany but in other parts of Europe, where voters in countries like Hungary and Poland are also continuing to accept the far-right in their political mainstream. Despite the AfD’s drop in votes in Germany’s most recent parliamentary election, the nationalist movement is gaining traction among the general public.
“Far-right groups are starting to share straight-out white supremacist ideas that used to be unacceptable in ‘mainstream’ politics,” said Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the U.S.-based Global Project Against Hate and Extremism.
The AfD’s social platform places it far into the political edges with its subversive ideology on human rights, she says, adding that its populist platform reflects the shifting political climate in Germany.
“There is a hard move to the right built mostly on anti-immigrant positions, a simultaneous collapse of the left, and a scramble at the center to keep the fringe out,” Beirich said.
Far-right anti-immigration sentiment is the most obvious example of social conservatism that has the potential to turn dangerous — as it has on a few other occasions in the three decades since German reunification. The AfD platform pushes for strictly regulated borders, especially for Muslim migrants who “don’t take up German culture,” said Marzahn party treasurer Geissler.
He says there is a stronger opposition to Muslim refugees than to Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian invasion because the new arrivals are of European descent and share Christian principles and other cultural norms.
“Migrants from Islamic countries are completely different from European countries like Ukraine,” Geissler said. “The culture is more similar, such as how to speak to women, and the family culture.”
The AfD is vocal about its anti-immigrant stance, but its antisemitism is more hidden. It does not support certain inclusive laws and regulations, such as those governing circumcision and animal slaughter rituals — some of which affect both Muslims and Jews, said Sigmount Koenigsberg, Commissioner Against Antisemitism at the Jewish Community of Berlin.
“The AfD is pretending to be pro-Jewish and pro-Israel,” Koenigsberg said. “It’s a fig leaf to hide their anti-Muslim sentiment. The far right parties are all antisemitic and that is clear.”
In July, the state of Brandenburg, outside Berlin, voted to amend its constitution to include stronger language banning discrimination against Jews, and specifically naming the Sinti and Roma diaspora for protection, codifying a commitment to fight antisemitism and antigypsyism.
The AfD was the only party to vote against it.
Beirich, of the global anti-hate project says the AfD’s populist rhetoric is now part of a global fabric, and she cites parallels between the German AfD and the American Republican Party.
“There’s a lot of political science work that’s been done about where the Republican party sits now and AfD is one of the parties that they most compare our GOP to nowadays,” Beirich said. “So it just shows how far the Republicans have moved to the right.”
She said the GOP and AfD dovetail most on their anti-immigrant positioning, seeking to deny benefits to migrants and cut back on numbers.
But while abortion laws are politically charged in the United States , especially after the Supreme Court reversed the Roe v. Wade right to abortion, the German right has maintained a more ambiguous stance.
“Every woman should make their own decision about their body,” said Auricht, who represents the AfD in Berlin. “With vaccinations too, you cannot say ‘my body my choice’ and then not hold that same principle with receiving the vaccine.”
Gun rights and regulation is also a hot topic for polarized America, and the AfD spokespeople cannot understand the American obsession with guns.
While the far-right narratives are similar worldwide — anti-lockdown fervor, dangerous conspiracy theories, and opposition to gay rights, just to name a few — the U.S. might be in more danger of veering into reactionary politics than Europe is, say analysts.
“There are some parallels with a hard shift to the right and openness by regular conservatives, especially here in the United States, to white supremacy and street movements,” American anti-extremism activist Beirich said. “I think the situation actually is worse here in the United States than it is in Germany.”
Because of Germany’s Nazi past, democracy is better protected by a state that is highly concerned with anti-democratic movements and hate speech, she said.
Beirich points out that far-right wing parties tend to be opportunistic, attaching themselves to crises such as the pandemic to keep their numbers up. If there is another social or economic crisis tomorrow, she said, party support would likely reflect the country’s circumstances.
“They are going to rise and fall in various ways depending on the mood of the country,” Beirich said. “The fringe is not disappearing like they did in previous eras. They seem to have a foothold now and are surviving.”
So the AfD may have lost some ground electorally, but its ideas have seeped into mainstream politics, strengthening the broader array of rightist parties.
Annemarie Schmidt, 74, a retired teacher from Marzahn who identifies herself as left-leaning, admits that she shares the AfD’s concerns over refugees, over rising housing and energy costs and the financial burdens of the war in Ukraine.
Schmidt thinks the climate is ripe for the AfD to do well in the future.
“Poor people here get nothing and the refugees get a lot, so the state makes it difficult for everyone to get along,” Schmidt said. “Though the AfD is taking advantage of these problems, they could be right on this topic. I wouldn’t vote for them, but during the next election the AfD will be very strong.”

My feeling about Berlin is still very conflicted. The city is full of culture, history and character, and yet, I can’t say that I love it. This surprises me given how many friends have only raved about Berlin. I fully expected to be a Berlin-lover, too. A week before we move onto our next stop, I still feel like we have so much to see. And we do. Even in 3.5 weeks, we haven’t ventured anywhere near all the nooks and crannies we know are worth seeing. One more weekend to make the most of! On the list: Mauerpark, the Pergamon or DDR Museum, graffiti tours, underworld visits, and other recommended bars and haunts.
One thing we have had the privilege of living through is the most recent German elections. I say “living through” lightly as we didn’t vote and honestly didn’t experience much fuss around the city other than some people demonstrating in front of Brandenburg Gate when we biked past it a couple of weeks ago. (Going to go by again this weekend to see what’s brewing now.) As you may know, Angela Merkel won another tenure as Chancellor of Germany but the relatively new far-right party of AfD (Alternative for Germany) garnered a whopping 12.6% of votes, making it Germany’s third largest party and marking the first time in 60 years that a far-right party has entered Parliament.
I won’t make this an in-depth political post, so I’ll pause here to recommend some reading if you’re interested in finding out more about how the AfD came about and some of the tactics it used to make its historical entry into the Bundestag (parliament).
What strikes me is that just last week, I was talking about how Germany’s efforts to remember its history and specifically its mistakes throughout history felt omnipresent throughout Berlin. I mentioned how the country makes a point to honor the victims of its past rather than their perpetrators. And then I read about how the AfD is rebelling against this practice, calling it weak and encouraging Germany to “take a more positive attitude towards its history.”
I had thought this attitude was quite positive already… How many countries are so open about their mistakes and actually make (sometimes unpopular) political decisions that demonstrate it has learned from them? Seeing Germany step up as the European country to accept the most refugees in need of a home at the peak of the refugee crisis in 2015 was a powerful moment for me. My family suffered first-hand from the Holocaust — 3 of my grandparents were in Auschwitz and lost their entire families. I never want any race or religion to suffer the same kind of persecution the Holocaust embodied. It’s not just the Holocaust — genocides in Rwanda and Armenia and Apartheid in South Africa are other recent examples of racism we in hindsight condemn and critique. The American Civil War and fight against slavery may have been over 150 years ago, but we still witness undeniable expressions of racism and rejection in the United States today.
That history is cyclical should not stand as an excuse to let it repeat itself. As I live through the repercussions of the Brexit vote, read about exaggerated travel bans and unsanctioned white nationalist/neo-nazi rallies, watch outspoken discriminating politicians slowly but surely claim more power in the Netherlands, France, Austria, now Germany under the guise of ‘nationalism’ and ‘identity’… I’m terrified kids one or two generations from now will be learning about these events as catalysts towards a larger global conflict I don’t even want to put a name on.
What does nationalism even mean today?
When talking about diversity in Germany with a couple of friends recently, they matter-of-factly stated that for example Russians and Turks are a central part of today’s Germany. You can’t imagine Berlin without kebab stands at every corner, they justly remarked.
The makeup of a country changes over time and what may have been a “pure” (debatable) population centuries ago is now mixed and enriched. To be nationalistic can mean to embrace this growth and diversity, rather than long for a past that alienates new- and otherness. With open economical borders, refugees escaping war-torn areas, broadening spirits and more informed, less fearful constituents, I would hope that European countries (and North American, and Middle Eastern…) choose to welcome and even promote this now globalized reality. Of course, there will always be people clamoring for “the good old days” and yes, some of the old days do have value and a country’s identity and history should also be preserved. I just hope we can work together to find a balance that doesn’t conflate identity with discrimination, and sadly the advancement of the AfD and the shift in its policy since its creation represent an upsetting setback.
I acknowledge this post is by no means a complete political commentary that compares both sides of the argument. It represents a few thoughts and concerns that have been weighing on my mind, and I welcome any comments or feedback to continue the discussion.
In the meantime, I’ll leave you with some of my favorite recent campaigns for acceptance and diversity before I resume my explorations of Berlin:

This is the Fernsehturm Berlin, the TV tower. Built in the late ’60s, at 1206 feet it is the tallest structure in Germany and third tallest in Europe.
During the Cold War, there were two independent Germanies:
Berlin was entirely within East Germany but was divided into sectors, the US, French, British, and Soviet. Westerners were limited in going to Berlin in the first place, but getting to East Berlin was a major hassle.
There were three roads from West Germany to Berlin, and they were carefully monitored. None of my friends even considered trying that drive. There was also a rail service from Frankfurt to Berlin, the Berlin Duty Train. Like the three highways, carefully planning and getting the required approvals was essential for the train.
However, I did get to East Berlin for a couple of days in 1981. Co-worker Bill (of the Vienna trip fame) and I got a military hop from our base in West Germany to Berlin. Melinda, one of our friends, had just been transferred there as a protocol officer. Clever of us to have a friend in that business, wasn’t it? She had arranged rooms for us in the huge hotel at Tempelhof airport.
Because the city was still occupied, you couldn’t just go into East Berlin and wander around. We had to wear our military uniforms so you know how much we stood out among the locals.
My first thought when we started sightseeing was how stern all the people looked. Not that they disliked us, but like they were not enjoying life there. We saw lots of rubble still there from the war years. Guess I’d have expected more repair work to have been done by then, 1981.
Checkpoint Charlie was and is still known as a major symbol of the Cold War so we wanted to see it. It was the only approved checkpoint, walking or driving, for foreigners and military personnel. (Sorry, my picture isn’t too good; couldn’t Photoshop it enough.)
This is me, in uniform, at the Brandenburg Gate in the Soviet zone. People and vehicles could use it freely until August 1961 when the Berlin Wall was built. The Wall enclosed the entire city, passing right by the west side of the gate. President Ronald Reagan gave his famous ‘Tear down this wall’ speech near the Gate in June 1987. As you may remember, the Wall was ended in December 1989.
Thanks again to Melinda; we got a tour of West Berlin, the Wall, and even into East Berlin just a bit. She’d arranged a helicopter tour for a visiting US Air Force general. You know biggies often get special treatment and opportunities.
Since the General’s aide was the only other passenger, Melinda asked the General to take two visiting USAF officers. He kindly agreed. I’d been in a helicopter before, even saw the Tucson home of a mafioso kingpin from one! This trip was unique, a matter of international law, I guess. Flying over the Wall into the Soviet Zone was a huge no-no. But the crew said they did it regularly, just a brief crossover, to maintain US rights!
Is this cheating? It’s me at the Berlin Wall from the good guy side, on a different trip.
Now, about that TV tower…
Like the Brandenburg Gate, it is one of the most prominent symbols of Berlin. When the sun shines (as it does once in a while in Germany) it reflects on the tower’s dome in the shape of a Greek cross, a symbol against the East German removal of crosses from churches during the Cold War!

On January 18th, I flew to the city I've been most looking forward to (so far) on my travel itinerary, and Berlin lived up to the hype.
Berlin has a sordid past, but the city has done an incredible job of being as transparent as possible about it. Unlike Madrid, which largely sweeps up its past under a rug, it is impossible to avoid being confronted with the harsh realities of all that has happened in Germany's capital.
Throughout the centre, signs provide a long look at the historical events that tore the city apart over and over again, but also showed how resilient the residents are. Black and white photos reinforce the ravages of war, white crosses honour those who died trying to cross into West Germany, and the path of where the wall stood leaves a jagged scar through the city.
I stayed in an Airbnb Prenzlauer Berg, a hipster neighbourhood in what was Eastern Berlin, brimming with cute restaurants serving vegan breakfasts and stores selling colourful clothing and handmade ceramics from local artists.
My apartment was a stone's throw from the Berlin Wall memorial along Bernhauer Strasse, which was surprisingly informative. For blocks, you follow the line of where the wall stood and read placards in German or French that explain what life was like for people on both sides of the border.
There are also screens where you can watch archival footage, which makes the experience so much more immersive. On the buildings along the walk, giant pictures throughout the forty years of horror show what the area looked like exactly where you were standing. Unfortunately, some residents along the strip fought against having their property cut by the memorial line of the wall. I can't imagine caring more about having a space for a bike rack surrounded by a fence than allowing the city to honour its past and all the people impacted by it. It seems selfish and shortsighted in my opinion.
I'll go through my museum excursions in my next post, but can I just rave about the restaurant scene in Berlin for a second? First of all, no other city I've traveled to in Europe has had as many fantastic vegan options. From fancy and pretentious to junk, it was all easy to find no matter what area I was in, and SO GOOD. It's tasty things like this that demonstrate why not all vegans are skinny. Guilty!

Thinking of making Berlin your new home?
Take these things into account for a smoother move.
A “Wahlberlinerin” (Berlin citizen by choice) explains.
Visiting my hometown in Groningen, the Netherlands feels like a breath of fresh air, as if I’m walking through a village. Most pedestrians on the street greet me with a smile and a nod.
It doesn’t work like that in Berlin.
You ignore one another. Some neighbors who accepted my packages in the past and certainly know who I am ignore me in any other setting.
It’s no different when walking on the street. No one greets you, you greet no one. If you do, expect frowns, very confused, or even scared looks.
The temperatures drop to or below zero during the winter months. People get moody, sulky, and the city turns bleak.
The only good thing about Berlin winters from the perspective of a Dutch person: it doesn’t rain…

I was back in Berlin last year after a long gap. The last time I was there I was lucky enough to attend an event the Business Design Summit. I can safely say that event changed the course of my work and heavily influenced the canvas card based approach we are using in IASA Global across the BTABOK and the IASA learning programs.
The event was pitched for visionary leaders, executives, entrepreneurs, and consultants (hard to know what I was then). It was an exciting point in time where a group of visionary thinkers were coming together to share their ideas, merge methods, find connections and co-design a new toolbox for business.
The pitch…
People improving todays businesses and building tomorrows need new, practical, strategies to deal with today’s brutal new business environment. A handful of visionary business thinkers, educators, authors, and world class entrepreneurs know this. Separately, that’ve been crafting a new business toolbox and playbook. What if all that knowledge, experience, and all those tools came together?
The people behind this event brought together strategy, innovation, entrepreneurship, design thinking, leadership, culture.
Yves Pigneur, Rita Gunther McGrath, Mark Johnson, Luke Hohmann, Dave Gray, David Sibbets, Henry Chesbrough, Alex Osterwalder, Stefano Mastrogiacomo, Lisa Kay Solomon, Steve Blank plus Patrick van de Pijl (apologies for the image quality the best the internet could provide).
Each of them had published books, academic papers and created toolkits to support businesses in what they described as a ‘brutal new business environment’. About ~300 people from all over the world arrived in Berlin hosted in the Classic Remise Berlin on 19th & 20th April 2013 a restored tram depot with displays of Classic cars.
We were crammed in, packed tables and a palpable energy. The focus was to discuss, explore, evolve a practical toolkit to do the jobs that we needed to do. These were new thinking tools their goal to improve the quality of thinking and elevate the level of conversation.
What resulted was 2 days and nights of playing with these tools and realising that each one was like a finding a magic potion. Mostly presented as 2D canvases e.g. Business Model Canvas. They were infinitely flexible and multi-dimensional they had depth, they could jump through time and let me play with different futures. They were also scalable and malleable they could be scaled up & down, twisted and repurposed to suit different contexts and problem spaces. They were light and could be created and abandoned (not like the document heavy worlds that are still pervasive). And lastly they were ‘mostly’ open source allowing both use and derivative works to be created, moving away from strictly proprietary works, frameworks and methods which presumed to have some secret sauce that imbued the creator with the mystical powers of transformation. Alex Osterwalder recently posted a reflection on the journey here.
I came away energised and excited about how these ideas could be used; our company was christened Business Model Adventures as we saw the opportunity to take people on creative adventures to discover new opportunities.
I’m an Architect, I saw the need for a toolchain to help me do the work I was doing better. I started searching, curating and integrating lightweight tools, canvases, cards, kits, games and methods into my practice. Where a tool didn’t exist I tried to fill a gap, overtime what I realised was that each tool fulfilled a need I had and fit into my practice.
If you want a great article on the modern architect read David Jones recent CIO.com piece on juggling architect identities and activities.
My own view has always been that an architect worth their salt is involved in…
Architecture got lost in standards, frameworks, methods, debates about “what is architecture?” and “what is an architect?”, trend chasing and surfing and lots and lots of documentation for us by us (write-only; no one reads). In hindsight it feels indulgent, self-interested, self-important and self-centred. I wasn’t above this, I did these things; I committed these sins so I feel the self-criticism is justified.
It feels like an eternity since I wrote this article about the impact of our approach to documentation. What the canvas methods offered was an opportunity to strip this back and rethink the work. To paraphrase Lisa K Solomon “conversation is the technology of architecture” the canvases became a language to design strategic conversations.
First the language — to design a strategic conversation, I think through what I need to understand and the destination we (‘conversations’ are sometimes but rarely solo) want to arrive at. Canvases can be used to clearly describe the flow of the conversation and the outcome of each piece is clear.
Second, the canvas provides a frame and a constraint for a part or the whole of the conversation. Take business model canvas as an example, it’s trying to capture the essence of a business model in 9 panels. It’s highly opinionated it doesn’t care about low level detail, it omits the environment it lives in. It asks the questions —
Third it provides a shared externalised focus for a conversation and a frame to build a shared mental model. One thing I think is underestimated is the effort it takes to create a model for anything with multiple elements in the human brain. The problem is amplified when I’ve got more than one person involved. Imagine 2 people have to create a mental model of the same elements at the same time in the same way. Without a frame and a common language this becomes impossible. The canvas creates a space for shared focus and understanding inside a constrained model. Now we can engage with the canvas physically and share a mental model.
I’ve found that the ability to point at something to bring attention to an element is critical; “let’s look at the customers” brings everyone into a collective focus. We can then navigate and build a narrative e.g. “what’s our relationship to this customer?”. We let the story unfold using the canvas as the guide.
Fourth the canvas method allows injecting prompts as questions to support facilitation and improve the repeatability and predictability of the process.
The work Lewis Curtis and others have done on question-based analysis (PBAAM Perspective Based Architecture Analysis Method) comes into focus as the questions become part of the tool.
Fifth canvases are composable and connectable each canvas regardless of it’s origin or choice of terminiology can ‘usually’ be mapped onto a metamodel e.g. ebmm, archimate. We then have a model elements with clear relationships, we begin to join the dots. See here on creating a metamodel from Ardoq.
Sixth canvases promote rapid prototyping and refactoring in lo-fi friendly ways. I don’t need much to get started, a printer is handy or online tools like miro, but anything works — napkin, paper, post-it, whiteboard and something to make a mark with a sharpie, pen, crayon. I can create, adapt, destroy and repeat; all of this can be done at speed. One thing we do in IASA Training is model a business in 12 minutes. I stole this from Alex Osterwalder he did it with an audience of about 500 people in pairs modelling their businesses with a 12 minute time limit.
Seventh, we build collective memories; the artefacts we create build a collective memory that all participants benefit from, the structure aids memory and recall while the outputs act as physical/digital reminders of the process that can be easily referred to.
Eighth, last but not least, number 8. The canvas method lends itself to VIVID Thinking approaches, Dan Roam in Blah, Blah, Blah , David Sibbets and the guys at Grove, Sunni Brown the doodle manifesto and last but by no means least Dave Gray. Their collective work in Visual Thinking, Graphic Facilitation, Workshop design and Facilitation (e.g. Gamestorming) has helped. Lest I forget Per Kristiansen and the guys in Lego Serious Play who extended the LSP method to support BMC and other canvas-based methods.
Of all of these factors the most powerful for me has been #8. The creativity that comes from these visual approaches is rocket fuel, this quite literally rewired my brain. I couldn’t look at a business without trying to model it with BMC; I couldn’t experience a journey without starting to model the customer experience on a journey map.
I’ve been involved in IASA and the development of the profession and practice of architecture for 20 years now, I first contacted Paul about setting up an IASA Chapter in Ireland in 2005, after 3 tries we got it up and running in 2008. I went through IASA Core training in 2010 in Stockholm with Andy Ruth. I became an instructor and delivered this program many times all over world. I then had the opportunity to participate in a redesign of the course which ultimately led to the canvas-based methods outlined in the BTABOK and last year the publication in Miro Universe of the canvases.
As with everything my thinking has evolved with my experience. I’ve spent since 2018 working in the health service in Ireland. The journey has been incredible, the experiences and the people likewise. We’ve battled through COVID, a major cyber attack, the Ukraine response, the development of Digital for Care a strategy for digital health in Ireland to 2030, the development of the HSE Health App, the procurement of a National Shared Care Record and many other side hustles. I’ve used, stretched, stressed and tested most of the methods in different contexts and in different ways. I’ve never been pure about this, I’ve remixed and riffed where necessary to fit the situation, culture and people.
Like everything many of the canvases/cards captured what was going on in my head at that point in time; me today would certainly argue with me 10 years ago. The BTABOK will be the place where these updates begin to emerge.
Where did the journey lead? I was solving my own problems and following my own curiosity first and foremost. The work has helped me and hopefully clients and colleagues I’ve worked with over the years overcome some formidable challenges. It’s been a busy few years in Health in Ireland and I haven’t had a lot of time to reflect on the journey too much.
One thing that happened last year that I haven’t had a chance to mark yet is that I became an IASA Fellow. I was attending a CAF Summit (Chief Architect Forum) event in Amsterdam.
In a ceremony in the Miro offices (thanks Grisha and the team in miro) in Amsterdam I became the 15th IASA Fellow.
If my impostor syndrome wasn’t strong enough, I look at the other fellows and I wonder. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting and talking to many of them through the years Grady Booch, Angela Yochem, Scott Whitmire, Daniel Akenine, Max Poliashenko, Eoin Woods and I’m grateful and humbled to have my name mentioned next to theirs. Years of conversations with so many friends and colleagues also helped shape my thinking.
Paul Preiss, Leo Peyton, David Jones, Dennis Mulder and other friends and colleagues who have been along for the ride were there to help me celebrate. This ended in a wonderful wander through Amsterdam with Leo reflecting on what I have to acknowledge as a major event in my career.
Three final thank yous to Paul Preiss who has been a friend, co-conspirator, confidante, collaborator none of this would have happened in the way it happened if Paul hadn’t started IASA 20+ years ago (thanks brother :), to the alptitude and Happy Valley gang Laurence, Carlos, Jack, Arno and the rest of the gang, our recent trip recharged me. Lastly to Orlaith my life and business partner who has helped, created, developed, listened, and otherwise dealt with Gar’s canvas obsession and the mess of paper, post-its, canvi, thanks Orlaith!
My handle on medium, twitter and elsewhere was always @aspiringarc. I always felt that this acted as a constant reminder of the correct mindset to maintain.
Always be aspiring!
There is no end to the learning, growth development and there is certainly no end to my optimism, curiosity and enthusiasm. Architecture is a team sport, a collaborative endeavour and most importantly in my head it’s always been a big game to play and an infinite game at that.
So this started as a trip down memory lane and it’s ending on a hopeful and grateful note of thanks to all who have shared their knowledge and helped me through my career and life, you know who you are…

By John Glab
Berlin is internationally famous for its techno clubs and my visits to Tresor and Berghain upheld the stereotypes: dark spaces with intense flashing light shows, blurred by the occasional smoke screen. Loud, heavy, four-on-the-floor industrial techno rattles the concrete structure of the buildings, as well as the bones of those either dancing in ecstasy or swaying as they try to not to fall over from exhaustion.
But just because the techno scene now lives above ground doesn’t mean the rest of Berlin’s music scene does.
Hidden across the city are many punk and DIY venues that offer a space for a community of musicians to create their own art. In my time in Berlin, I’ve looked at posters taped to walls and light poles, searched names online, and asked around for some places to see a show.
Køpi, a squatting development in Kreuzberg, has a couple spaces for live music performances. I entered through a gate, obscured from street view by some vegetation. Behind it was a courtyard area flanked by the building’s two short wings. Its cracked, concrete facade was well adorned with colorful graffiti murals of contorted human figures, stencil art, and the common message of “kein foto,” no photography allowed.
German Punk Time meant I waited well over an hour for the show to start. In that time, I played a game of pick-up basketball with a few of the people who lived there, trying to avoid splashing in the puddles in the courtyard’s potholes. At Køpi, the line between public and private living spaces feels non-existent.
Koma F, the performance area at Køpi, was down a flight of stairs in a basement. Old bricks, rounded from age, formed arched ceilings in what felt like a former storage space. A crowd of around 30 people — who were well beyond their 20s — fit the punk cliché, dressed in black vests with studs and large boots.
The two bands that played, Shell-Shocked from Berlin and Disturbance from Rotterdam in the Netherlands, both reflected this vintage aesthetic in their music. Shell-Shocked had quick tremolo pickings that droned over blasting d-beats. The band’s vocalist stumbled around the front of the stage, leaning back while screaming into the mic, looking as if he was trying to swallow a sword.
Disturbance was much more straight forward, playing into the punk sentiment of less-is-more. They had a definite Oi! punk sound with frequent gang vocals sung over more classic stylings of simple rock-and-roll songs, but played faster and noisier. This affinity for the past makes sense as Disturbance has been a band since 1995. Perhaps you can critique them for never evolving, or holding onto the past too hard even from the beginning, but they were still entertaining enough for the people who came to see them.
The other venue I went to was OGH, located somewhere in the sprawling southern neighborhood of Neukölln. The entrance was tucked in an alleyway. Beyond the door, a stairwell splotched with graffiti and posters led up to the fourth floor of the warehouse space. There, the stage stood at the front of what looked like a former office area. In the backhalf of the space, people sat and talked between sets at a bar and lounge area. Large windows lined the entire wall of the venue, where many people looked out over the alleyway at surrounding apartment blocks.
The show at OGH followed a more post-punk garage sound, without the aggressiveness of hardcore. The bands were Dackelkontakt from Potsdam, Fantuzzi in Berlin, and Teo Wise, an Italian living in Leipzig. About 50 people filled the space. Dackelkontakt went first, sitting behind a small synth array set on a repurposed ironing board. They played fast, peppy, synthpunk tracks with a bit of added whimsy from the little squeals of a theremin. Often songs would pause for brief spoken word parts, traded off between members, including at the climax of their set when two of the band members quickly and aggravatedly talked over each other for about 30 seconds before falling into the last riff.
At the end, Teo Wise performed his light but robust punk tracks. Together with the other members of his band, they mastered the balance of playing locked-in and succinct while effecting a sprawling free spirit that gave the music so much livid personality. Wise’s set moved the audience into an ecstatic dance, with shoes slipping across a sweat slicked concrete floor.Most enthralling was that everyone danced together. There were no imposed boundaries as people whirled around each other, one person making contact with another’s psyche, before turning to the next, until there was a point of connection between everyone in the room. Theboundaries of the individual became invisible.
After the set, people lingered in the fourth-floor warehouse loft for well over an hour. They were simply talking, making new acquaintances, and building on the commonalities they had found during the performance. Whether it be two people just passing through the city, or someone finding a new community, these moments define life and cannot be manufactured. In Berlin, they can still be found in DIY spaces — if you just know where to look.

There are thousands of films shot in Berlin (click for city map). Opposite to many other shooting locations, Berlin surpasses the mere location tag. Instead, the city is a breathing creature, making it a character on its own.
It holds true not only in movies, though. When visiting Berlin, I felt like walking through Berlin is to walk through human memory, through disaster and overcoming. It was a walk through the urban movements seemingly never stopping to run its streets, breathe from its walls and remind us about the history and human condition.
Here are 4movies (to be frank, I only watched 3 of them, and adored 2.5) that are must-sees before visiting berlin. Or, you may just follow my path and watch the first three.
The movie takes a look into East Berlin life of intellectuals in 1984.
The scenes of the prison of the lives of others were filmed in the Royal Prison, the former Central Prison of State Security (Stasi) of the German Democratic Republic, today converted into the memorial site of Berlin-Hohenschönhausen. If you wish to book a visit, you must first register here. What’s more, former prisoners often offer guided tours where they narrate their personal experience.
Run Lola Run is a movie that literally takes you through Berlin in the turn of century. From now oh-so-hip Friedrichstraße to Charlottenburg near the National Opera, with stops on the Museum Island, Lola is on the mission to save her boyfriend’s life (literally). The other storyline of the movie conveys the saving of herself. Visiting her father, and running through the whole Berlin, she finds herself once again.
She also passes through Schlesischer Tor, Oberbaumbrücke in Kreuzberg or the beautiful square of Gendarmenmarkt in Mitte among many other streets.
In short, its route does not make any geographical sense, but how good and beautiful is Berlin from beginning to end from home and in less than an hour and a half?
Berlin, Symphony of a Great City has an incalculable historical value: this silent film immerses us in day-to-day life in the centre of Berlin in 1927, a Berlin that we neither knew nor will know as it would be reduced to rubble a few more years late.
Probably only the river Spree has remained immutable since then. The Berlin Cathedral, like so many other buildings and monuments portrayed by Walter Ruttmann’s camera, we only know of its recent reconstruction. And others, like the Royal Palace in Berlin, cannot be visited again until 2019 (next year).
Roberto Rossellini stood in what was left of Berlin in 1947, made a casting between non-professional actors and filmed the third chapter of the quintessence of the Italian neorealist: the trilogy of Rome, Appointment aperta, Paisà and this Germania, Anno Zero.
The result is devastating. Edmund Kohler is thirteen years old and wanders through the centre of Berlin with the sole purpose of surviving and helping his family survive. The backdrop is a Reichstag that is already only rubble and the barren esplanade of the Tiergarten, whose wood served to warm German homes during World War II.
The penury was such on and off the screen that many actors escaped when it came time for repatriation after recording the interiors of the film in Rome.

(Author’s note: A German version of this article was published in Berlin’s “Der Tagesspiegel” newspaper on March 15, 2025)
It didn’t matter if the neighbors looked on disapprovingly. The New Year had arrived, and spring began with a large fire that we, as children, would jump over for what felt like hours to leave behind the evil spirits of the past year. The scent of saffron rice and grilled fish. The loud music surrounded us and the families of my father’s Persian friends who visited each other, greeting with kisses and embraces. Whenever I remember the Persian New Year celebrations I experienced in West Berlin during the 1980s, I’m filled with a warm, hopeful feeling. Back then, I didn’t understand how much more this festival must have meant during that time, amid a terrible war between Iraq and Iran that lasted nearly a decade and resulted in half a million casualties. A celebration amid a German society that was still firmly convinced it was not yet open to immigrants and what they could contribute. For my dad and his friends, the celebration was a piece of home helping them feel more at home in a foreign land.
Only years later did I learn how widespread the tradition of this New Year’s festival is. According to UNESCO, “It has been celebrated by more than 300 million people for over 3,000 years in the Balkan Peninsula, the Black Sea region, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Middle East.” The festival’s observance traces back to the Zoroastrian ancestors of today’s Iranian people. Since 2009, the UN has even included Nouruz in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
When I would return to my Berlin school on Mondays after the festival, there was no mention of the Persian New Year. Only Christmas, Easter, and New Year’s Eve existed. Once, in 12th grade, our English teacher asked about our backgrounds and our parents. I remember it clearly because it was such an unusual experience. She wanted to know if we, as children of immigrants, felt any particular conflict. The only thing I felt were the glances of my classmates, which led me to give an evasive answer. The meaning and power of the New Year’s festival thus remained hidden from her and the rest of the teachers and students.
For example, the story of Kaveh the Blacksmith, who plays an important role in Ferdowsi’s famous Book of Kings. According to legend, Kaveh led an Iranian uprising against a cruel, child-devouring dragon king. This symbolism of resistance against oppression has led authoritarian governments to attempt to ban the festival over the years repeatedly. However, the most important meaning of the festival is the awakening of nature to new life in spring, the victory of light over darkness, and of knowledge over ignorance.
When I speak with my friends in Berlin every weekend, it becomes increasingly clear to me how important it is to celebrate the Persian New Year and remember its message, especially this year. For weeks, I’ve been hearing much about the challenges originating in Moscow and here in Washington, D.C., and the increasingly difficult political and economic situation for Germany and Europe. Even during the pandemic, I didn’t perceive this much fear and uncertainty about the situation.
Next week, I will tell the children at my daughter’s elementary school in Washington, D.C. about the Persian New Year. There are some children there who are directly affected by their parents’ dismissals by the Trump administration. There are flyers preparing for the possible removal of children of illegal immigrants at the school. The teacher invited me at my daughter’s request, who had so enjoyed the presentation of the Indian Festival of Lights, Diwali, in the fall by a mother of Indian descent. I will tell them about the great New Year’s festival and its message that we will celebrate with friends and neighbors. With a fire that many in the city will jump over to rid themselves of the evil spirits of the past year. And about how for me, the festival is also a piece of memory of Berlin and a home that I gladly share with all who currently need more confidence and community.

At first, just like any city, Berlin is full of strange faces and smells, the traffic sounds like most city noise, the streets full of tempting offers, doorways that lead into dark passages and cellars, and the next corner with its posted signs suggesting that you walk this way, or that way to discover a new experience, can make you feel as if a good weekend stay is ahead of you. But when your friend, whom you came to visit, takes you by the hand and leads you away from the shops, and into the real Berlin city, you may just, if lucky, begin to feel the magic of a city that holds secrets and temptations that have been the cause of some many a nomad to stop and become a villager, to settle and give up wandering through the world.
A visit to the hot spots of town where you can drink, dance, and meet all sorts in one night, becomes an introduction to a city that clearly offers everything for any taste.
To see the malls and the boulevards of Berlin that connect the present with the past. The old streets that…

I visited many galleries and art exhibitions in Berlin and here’s my reviews.
It is not as difficult to purchase tickets as it is in Barcelona, but it is critical to double-check the opening days and hours.
I visited ""the soul station"" : the LAS Foundation in Halle am Berghain. An extensive interactive metaverse ethical gaming installation.Brathwaite-Shirley investigates marginalized histories, particularly those of the Black and Queer communities. When prospects go into Berlin’s renowned space, they are greeted by a dark, foggy environment filled with an array of varying screen displays flickering with artificial light, waiting us to tap in.
I spent a lot of time there trying to understand everything, but there still remain some parts of the journey that are perplexing. The storyline offers the sense of limitless possibilities. As my friend grace said , it kind of reminds me of Love + Death robots vibe too.
By the time I visited it was only 8 euro and it was episode 1 of the game.
Episode 2: ARE YOU SOULLESS, TOO?Will start from September to October.
Really really worth it.
Really famous on social media. An immersive museum exploring the concept of dark matter. It was really far away , and maybe I expected too much after the halle- exhibition visit. There are several rooms to explore and you can probably finish it all in 1 and a half hours. Or even faster without the drink/snack breaks in between. However, this place made for a really good video/ photos. The tickets are quite expensive for what it offer though…
I truly had fun that visit! Film buffs will thoroughly like this. There are free smartphone applications for audio guides, and it was simultaneously interesting and enlightening. Day tickets cost 9 euros and close at 6 p.m. After experiencing the museum, visitors can also visit the Library of Film Archives. Aside from that, it’s clear that the Deutsch kinemathek hosts a variety of exhibitions. On top of that, the permanent display will close in October. I had an absolute blast there.
Honestly ， I encountered a lot of fashionable people here. And I think they’re here for the IG post. It certainly is a cool place to take photos.
I saved a lot more museum visit as well but I just couldn’t make it because of prior plans. Next time , Berlin!

This Berlin flew by! A good overview is that of Screen Daily and if we’re lucky, you can read it here without subscribing. My own activities flowed from two sources:
1) Education: I taught and led tours of the market for Berlinale’s Talent Campus Meet the Experts, for Deutsche Welle Akademie Film Festival Workshop, and for INA Sup, a TV, film and new media school based in France and linked to the French National Audiovisual Institute (INA). This is the most rewarding work, seeing what talent is coming up in our world, seeing ideas take hold as the students learn about the market.
2) Our Consulting: Another pillar of our company, aside from blogging and professional education, is strategic planning with filmmakers. This Berlinale was very intense and very energizing for my partner Peter Belsito and me, with Beyond the Moonwalk having found a berth for international sales representation with Steve Arroyave’s Arrow Entertainment and a U.S. distribution commitment, and more actively involving, with Donna Deitch’s The Catcher, where a series of meetings with top German and Canadian producers and sales agents gave the project the momentum of a race horse bound for first place!
What follows are my impressions of various other Berlin events as they passed by — ever so quickly — but still with enough eye-catching power to capture my attention in the first place.
I was happy to see Jeff Lipsky and Adopt Films’ co-managing executive Tim Grady cleaning up with 3 acquisitions; no time to waste anymore as the third Bingham Ray memorial pointed out to those who have the mind to realize the message. Sister (L’enfant d’en haut) by Ursula Maier (ISA: Memento, Swiss rights with FilmCoopi), I hear is A+, Paolo and Vittorio Taviani’s Caesar Must Die (Cesare deve morire) (ISA: Rai Trade) won the Golden Bear, and Chris Petzold’s Barbara, all in Competition.
American indie works-in-progress have been granted a second chance to screen for European indie distributors (EuropaDistribution) at the upcoming Paris Film Festival in June. I have been invited to be on the jury of “U.S. in Progress” and am thrilled at the prospect. I was honored to have been invited to be on the jury in Wroclaw at the American Film Festival in November as well, for the first edition of this chance for U.S. filmmakers to win post-production and cash prizes. This is where the film Now, Forager was picked up by fledgling international sales agent, the only international sales agent in Poland, New Europe Sales founded by Jan Naszewski [jnaszewski AT gmail.com] and Anja Sosic [anja AT NewEuropeFilmSales.com]. The film went on to screen at Rotterdam Film Festival. Even hotter news will be forthcoming from MOMA and The New York Film Society’s New Directors/ New Films about one of the films at the AFF’s “U.S. in Progress”. If you missed it in Poland you will be able to see it in New York this April!
I was lucky to see two films during the market and after the market closed, this last Saturday and Sunday, when I caught some more films I was unable to see earlier due to my “real” work. Of the films I saw here in Berlin, here are my unique :) comments for what they’re worth.
Children of Srikandi (Panorama) is a very personal account by a female filmmaker collective in Indonesia on what it means to be a lesbian in their society. The sweet intimacy of the film overrides its non-professional veneer (the “filmmakers” were all non-professionals). In fact, this could serve as a template for other non-professionals who want to tell their stories. Schools come to mind as possible candidates for this sort of filmmaking, as does my own pet project, The Literacy Project. The Indonesian contingent here in Berlin was interesting and sociable as they met their audience and fans. They were hosted by Berlin based producers Laura Coppens who is a doctorate student in ethnological studies in Zurich and Angelika Levi, doc filmmaker (My Life, Part 2 about growing up Jewish in Berlin).
Bergman & Magnani: The War of the Volcanos. This invitation-only work in progress with Wide House uses a unique way to show the emotion filled and the biggest jet-set love scandal of all times, the story of Roberto Rossellini, Anna Magnani and Ingrid Bergman as Rosellini and the volcanic Anna Magnani ended their relationship after making Volcano (1950) and the married Ingrid Bergman and Rossellini began theirs with the filming of Stromboli (1950), the name of the second volcano on this Aeolian Island which has been in almost continuous eruption for 2,000 years. The visuals of their stories are illustrated entirely with the scenes from movies starring them as they enact the real life emotions and the commentary of the doc. I am most interested to see how well this technique succeeds.
Paolo and Vittorio Taviani’s Caesar Must Die (ISA: Rai Trade) is a moving illustration of the transformative power of art as hardened criminals in an Italian prison rehearse and perform Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar. The the 80 + year old Brothers Taviani deserve recognition for their artistic excellence. I can’t argue with Mike Leigh and the jury’s judgement except that on my emotional meter, Rebelle (War Witch) was the real winner.
Rebelle (War Witch) by Kim Nguyen (ISA: Films Distribution) should have won the Golden Bear. The Silver Bear for Best Actress was awarded to Rachel Mwanza, but this film is so deeply moving on the most primal levels, maintaining its African roots while touching our most sensitive emotions of parents, love, rape, pregnancy and infants as they are experienced by a female child soldier from ages 12 to 14. It should also win Best Foreign Language Film in next year’s Academy Awards. Produced by the industry vets Marie-Claude Poulin and Pierre Even, it is yet another feather in the cap of the the Canadian film industry.
Dieter Kosslick observed that with 15 Competition titles confirmed at the time Screen International interviewed him, “both thematically and geographically, we have many films coming this year from Asia, and particularly China and Indonesia. There is also an interesting focus on France this year, beginning with the opening film Farewell My Queen (Les adieux a la reine) (ISA: Elle Driver) and going through all of the festival’s sections. Moreover, we have two French jury members [Francois Ozon and Charlotte Gainsbourg] in the International Jury.“ Eight titles selected to date have German majority or minority participation, so German filmmakers and (co-)producers will again enjoy a record presence in the Competition on a par with 2011’s tally of eight films involving German directors or German production partners.” He also notes Competition films’ trending toward “times of upheaval and new departures… with many films coming from Africa and Arab countries”. My observation of the 23 Competition films finally selected is that the nostalgic look back at European aristocracy and top social tiers (A Royal Affair, Bel Ami, Farewell My Queen) and its mores stands in stark contrast to today’s upheavals of families and children (Childish Games, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, Postcards from the Zoo, Just the Wind, Mercy, Shadow Dancer, Sister, Rebelle, Home for the Weekend, Jayne Mansfield’s Car, Coming Home). Seven other films continue the theme of social upheavals: Tey — which deal with childhood memories of Senegal experienced by an American, Captive about Phillipine hostages, Barbara an Eastern German looking to move to the West, Caesar Must Die about prisoners finding art in their sequestered lives, Flying Swords of Dragon Gate about upheavel during the Ming Dynasty, White Deer Plain about upheavel towards the end of Imperial China, The Flowers of War about the upheavel of China by the Japanese in World War II. The exceptions, Tabu and Meteora, deal with love, the Saving Grace.
Two major disappointments were Steven Soderberg’s Haywire (ISA: Mandate) and Stephen Elliott’s Cherry. Both about women, they left me puzzled with what the plot was about. Pretty, well done and negligible.
This Berlin Diary Part 2 will continue after I work on my new and soon-to-be launched website! I have spent an entire day on this blog and I still have much more to write!

This is drawn from my recent bestselling book on heroes (cue Bowie) who dug escape tunnels under the Wall, The Tunnels: Escapes Under the Berlin Wall and the Historic Films the JFK White House Tried to Kill. Part of Bruce’s performance, and remarks, via link below. I would attend an epic Springsteen concert in Berlin almost 30 years later.
https://youtu.be/WBIcfPBVxxQ
On this date in 1961 the Berlin Wall started rising overnight (first as mere barbed wire) dividing East and West for almost three decades. The fall of the Berlin Wall, 28 long and deadly years later, has been attributed to lots of things, from Mikhail Gorbachev’s reforms and Ronald Reagan’s famous plea to the ineptitude of the Politburo and the collective courage of the East German protesters. But there’s little doubt that David Bowie and Bruce Springsteen did their own — if small — part.
When Bowie died several years ago, the German Foreign Office noted as much in a memorial tweet: “Good-bye, David Bowie. You are now among #Heroes. Thank you for helping to bring down the #wall.” For Springsteen’s role, you can read the 2013 book Rocking the Wall: Bruce Springsteen — The Berlin Concert That Changed the World. But Springsteen’s memoir, Born to Run, offers his full account of that epic concert for the first time.
Many Americans are surprised to learn that our rock stars were even allowed to play in East Germany while the wall, constructed in 1961, remained in place. But Communist Party leaders, noting the tremendous buildup of anger and tension among their young people during the Gorbachev “glasnost” era, decided to provide a safety valve of sorts by allowing major rock concerts starting in 1987. Tens of thousands of East German kids were already flocking to the wall to listen as Bowie and others played just on the other side — and there had been clashes between the music-starved youth and East German police.
Bowie’s June 1987 performance was remarkable on several levels. The stage was set up in West Berlin, very close to the wall, with the old Reichstag building as a backdrop. Unlike most Western performers, he had a fitting song for the occasion: “Heroes,” written a few years earlier and purportedly inspired by Bowie’s time living in Berlin. The line about standing by the wall while “the guns shot above our heads” may refer to dramatic attempts by East Germans to escape the East — which happens to be the subject of my book, The Tunnels: Escapes Under the Berlin Wall and the Historic Films the JFK White House Tried to Kill. (You can watch part of Bowie’s performance that day below.)
https://youtu.be/FdykmbbaZI8
And here, from a 2003 interview, is how he described it:
It was one of the most emotional performances I’ve ever done. I was in tears…And there were thousands on the other side that had come close to the wall. So it was like a double concert where the wall was the division. And we would hear them cheering and singing along from the other side. God, even now I get choked up. When we did “Heroes” it really felt anthemic, almost like a prayer. However well we do it these days, it’s almost like walking through it compared to that night, because it meant so much more. That’s the town where it was written, and that’s the particular situation that it was written about.
By then, Bob Dylan had been invited by a youth arm of the Communist Party to play in Treptower Park in the East on September 17, 1987, along with touring mates Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and Roger McGuinn. Protests were building against the regime and the wall, and East German officials hoped to defuse tensions with a few signs of openness.
The Stasi didn’t seem too worried that Dylan, then in a down period in his career, would prove to be a rabble-rouser.
Naturally, the Stasi (East Germany’s notorious secret police) were on top of it. Their six-page preview was filed at their headquarters under “Robert Zimmerman, No. HA XX 17578.” It mainly covered logistics and security — no secret bugging of Dylan, apparently — and the dispersal of 81,000 tickets, with at least one-third going to party officials and their pals. The Stasi didn’t seem too worried that Dylan, then in a down period in his career, would prove to be a rabble-rouser, as he was merely “an old master of rock” with no particular “resonance” with the youth of the day. The crowd, they predicted, would be mostly middle-aged and older. Dylan would act in a “disciplined” way and not cause undo “emotions.”
In the end, the gig played out pretty much as the Stasi had anticipated. By most accounts, Dylan — whose lyrical work just earned him the 2016 Nobel Prize for literature — gave a rather lackluster performance (his norm for the time), consisting of a couple of Christian tunes mixed in with hits like “Blowin’ in the Wind,” “Rainy Day Women” and “Like a Rolling Stone.” He reportedly did not speak a single word from the stage.
This was not the case with Springsteen, who arrived in East Berlin 10 months later to play his biggest concert ever. More than 200,000 showed up, twice what Dylan had attracted. Springsteen opened, pointedly, with “Badlands,” but the indisputable highlight was his cover of “Chimes of Freedom,” a Dylan tune that Dylan himself had overlooked. The show, which in typical Springsteen style lasted nearly four hours, was beamed to millions of East Germans via state television. Many middle-aged Germans I interviewed for my book fondly recalled attending the performance or watching it on TV. “It was a nail in the coffin for East Germany,” one fan told the Guardian years later.
In Born to Run, Springsteen recounts a previous visit to East Berlin with bandmate Steve Van Zandt. “You could feel the boot,” he recalls. The wall, in Springsteen’s view, seemed almost “pornographic.” The experience helped shock the then-apolitical Van Zandt into decades of activism. “The power of the wall that split the world in two, its blunt, ugly, mesmerizing realness, couldn’t be underestimated,” Springsteen writes. “It was an offense to humanity.”
When Springsteen returned to East Berlin for his epic 1988 show, as I note in my own book, he unhappily discovered that the state was billing it as a “concert for the Sandinistas,” the pro-Communist Nicaraguans. So he delivered an impassioned speech. His German was grade-school level, but he got the point across: “I’m not here for any government. I’ve come to play rock and roll for you in the hope that one day all the barriers will be torn down.” East German officials backstage had somehow learned about Bruce’s original statement, which included the explosive word “walls,” and Springsteen’s manager, Jon Landau, had convinced him at the last minute to change it to “barriers.” But after finishing his statement, Springsteen quickly launched into “Chimes of Freedom,” which includes the key reference: “while the walls were tightening.” (See video up top which includes his remarks, then the song.)
The next day, he and the band “partied” at the East Berlin consulate, Springsteen writes, before heading back to the West to play a show for a mere 17,000 people — which “felt a lot less dramatic than what we’d just experienced.” Referring to the “stakes” of rock and roll, he writes, “The higher they’re pushed, the deeper and more thrilling the moment becomes. In East Germany in 1988, the center of the table was loaded down with a winner-take-all bounty that would explode into the liberating destruction of the Berlin Wall by the people.”
German historian Gerd Dietrich would later tell Rocking the Wall author Erik Kirschbaum, “Springsteen’s concert and speech certainly contributed in a large sense to the events leading up to the fall of the wall. It made people more eager for more and more change,” he said. “Springsteen aroused a greater interest in the West. It showed people how locked up they really were.”
As Springsteen himself would later put it, “Once in a while you play a place, you play a show that ends up staying inside of you, living with you for the rest of your life. East Berlin in 1988 was certainly one of them.”

So I’m really interested in the climate tech space and especially how AI/ML can be applied to help make the world sustainable.
In particular I found the Climate Change AI (CCAI) paper has a great taxonomy to start thinking about areas AI/ML applies to the climate tech world. However it does not offer a lot of on-the-ground examples of real startups working in the space. I was also unable to find a really satisfactory list anywhere online so I decided to make my own:
The current mapping is built an underlying dataset I built and have published publicly below. It’s an aggregation of the following sources: (Dealroom, Climate-KIC’s alumni page, PwC’s report on state of Climate Tech 2020, Angel List jobs board, this article from Tech Founders, this one from EU-Startups, and this one from MTC, as well as some conversations from the Work on Climate Slack and my own personal knowledge.
This is by no means an exhaustive mapping, but I do think it is currently the most comprehensive list for Berlin. However if there are any companies I’ve missed and you think should be added, I’d be really happy to hear from you.
As mentioned above, the CCAI paper has a great taxonomy which I used to start thinking about areas AI/ML applies to the climate tech world:
I did the categorization manually for both domain and subdomain, as the number of companies was still relatively small and I was interested in researching each organization individually.
I also added an additional boolean field ‘AI/ML’ in the data for companies who specifically mentioned using Machine Learning in their venture.
The climate tech space in Berlin is growing fast and it's exciting to see so many new companies and founders joining the space.
I hope to maintain and update this market map as the space grows and hopefully to expand to other areas in the EU (see, London). I’d also like to run some analysis on the dataset as it grows to understand some of the key trends emerging in this space.
In the meantime, feel free to reach out if you have any questions or comments.

(From someone who grew up there)
Berlin is great. It has culture — so much culture! It has a party scene, a café scene, a bookshop scene, a thrift store scene, a flea market scene, and a farmers market scene. And yet, six weeks ago, I felt the urge to pack up my things and leave. Berlin is like that one popular girl in high school whom you would lock eyes with in the hallway — the moment you couldn’t believe your luck, you would realize that she was looking right through you, as if you were water. Listen, everyone had a different take on the popular girl in high school. Most people simply loved her, which is what made her so popular. Yet, terminology such as “popular girl” or “mean girl” wouldn’t exist if there wasn’t also a certain fear or at least disdain involved. Berlin is a popular girl. You can’t fight me on that. And still — most likely, she will enchant you.
Imagine boarding the subway — yes, the famous yellow U-Bahn that is redonant of piss and houses two thirds of the city’s homeless population [figure deliberately invented]. And while you may think breathing through your scarf is the worst thing, or having to avoid eye contact with creepy strangers, or school children bumping their massive backpacks into you during rush hour, I can tell you that it isn’t any single one of those things. It’s that all these things are happening at once. You don’t get a second to yourself, not a second to just hold still and think, because there is someone very near you breathing down your neck.
At this point, you may have sworn to yourself to never visit Berlin or at least its subway — especially if you generally dislike big-city hustle — but there may be some of you who find the idea of the Berliner U Bahn romantic. And you know what? It is! We even have a world-famous musical that is merely about that. It’s called Linie 1. If you ever visit Berlin, you have to go. It’s wonderful and one of a kind.
I already mentioned that Berlin is the popular girl in high school, and what I mean by this is that she is pretty (very, very pretty) and a trendsetter in a rather basic and unoriginal way. She’d never try something truly new or crazy out herself but would only wear it if her peers approved it. I know that this sounds like a survival guide for high school, and it is, but in Berlin, it’s true for anyone from the age of five to thirty-five, and it is true any time you leave the safety of your own four walls. Popular girl is pretty, but she bites. Are you safe if you’re older? No. Popular girls ripen into Karens and lord knows they’re not safe to be around. You may be confused — am I talking about Berlin or people? The popular girls are the people who shape Berlin. They have no specific gender.
What is my conclusion? Berlin is fantastic if and only if you have a thick skin. If you can handle a stranger screaming at you on the street for no reason or a drunk person harassing you, you will enjoy a city full of sunshine, culture, delicious food, and endless things to do. Just make sure the popular girls like you.

By Alexandra Goldberg
BERLIN — The history of coffee culture can be thought of in waves, with the advent of mass coffee consumption dating back to the 1700s in Germany. The first wave was defined by classic filtered coffee, still popular in the United States. Then, the second wave had a clear emphasis on the traditional Italian style, which was picked up by other countries through globalization. American soldiers stationed in Italy during World War II realized that espresso was too bitter and difficult to drink, so they mixed the espresso shot with hot water, and voila, the Americano was created.
The third wave of coffee was characterized by the emergence of large coffee corporations such as Starbucks, which combined the Italian coffee culture of lattes and macchiatos with modern additions such as a vanilla or almond flavor — as well as sizing up to a venti cup. Now, the globe is entering the fourth wave, which is popularizing a newfound obsession with high-end cold brews and tonic drinks.

Coffee culture anywhere follows the ebb and flow of what the consumer needs, and Berlin is still aiming to capture the traditional café life that dates back to the second wave. This is especially true for Mod Rockers & Mod Coffee Roasters, a neighborhood shop in Rosenthaler Platz that emphasizes creating a personal experience and bringing people together in a local café.
Reporter and host Alexandra Goldberg sat down with founders of Mod Rockers & Mod Coffee Roasters, Yusuf Akkaya and Levent Akkaya, to talk about coffee culture in Berlin.

Sociology is beautiful. Sociology is synonymous with stories, narratives, mythology, folktales, fantasies, fairytales and legends, foretold for generations and centuries by through the oral renderings of people : elders, grandparents etc. Myths are told and retold.
There is no better way to understand society without myths and folktales. We are nothing without stories.
Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué, a German author was the creator of the fable Undine (1811). The famous myth creature from European tradition called Undine, a water nymph who becomes human because of the love of a mortal man but will be forced to return to the water if he is unfaithful.
Some characteristics of Undine :
Must Watch : Undine (2020)
I love water, oceans and lakes, mermaids and Berlin. And this movie had it all! Undine is a modern-day fairytale romance, between diver and water nymph, successfully bringing the myth of Undine to life.
I made a list of locations and places in this movie I fell in love with and visited on numerous occasions. Nothing like wondering the streets of Berlin.
2. Berlin Hauptbahnhof, Berlin, Germany

Back in May I have announced, that I received an invitation from the Berlin Buzzwords org team to record live onsite.
The invite to do so actually came already for 2023, but due to family reasons I could not attend. It was a happy and an exciting moment to be able to finally come to Berlin to my favorite tech conference and record LIVE episodes with the speakers! In 2022 we have already spoken at the conference with Aarne Talman, our talk recording can be viewed here. Back then I have tried out an experimental format of recording an episode with conference participants. It felt nice, that this idea caught the attention of the conference org team.
The first episode I have recorded this year was with Doug Turnbull. It was also the first time we have met in person, although already in 2013 we have simultaneously attended the Lucene Revolution conference in Dublin. It turns out about that time Doug has also co-created Quepid, the tool I’ve been loud about for evaluating your search quality.
In this episode Doug shares how he thinks about everything he does as an act of learning in public: blogging, open source, book writing, speaking — I’d even add his posts on LinkedIn. Personally, I learn a lot from his thought leadership in search.
I will keep updating this blog post with more episodes I’ve recorded — so stay tuned! As usual, you will get to listen to these episodes on your lovely audio platforms — be sure to subscribe to be notified of new episodes.
And enjoy your summer!

It is the spring of 2003, midway through my first year in graduate school, and my friend Nathan had earlier that day acquired a used vinyl copy of David Bowie’s Station to Station from Amoeba Music. Some months later, we are driving down Sunset Boulevard listening to the song “Negativland” from Neu!’s 1972 debut album. Again, an ominous quasi-industrial noise, something like a jackhammer, leads off the track. Again, a muffled guitar squeals in the background, defiantly on its own trip as Michael Rother’s plodding baseline and Klaus Dinger’s motorik-beat propel the song forward. Again I explain, “This is the sound of postmodernism. . .”
Julian Knox, David Bowie and Romanticism, pp. 117–118
Bowie’s Berlin period is both famous and misunderstood. Well before the end of 1976 Bowie’s cocaine addiction had led him in and out of psychosis, dropped him to 90 lbs. on a diet of peppers and milk, and pushed him to the point of death. He knew he had to leave the United States and its easy availability of drugs just to save his life. In late 1976, he and his wife Angie moved to Switzerland, where they purchased a house. The couple was largely estranged by this point, alternating their time spent in the house rather than living together, and Bowie eventually moved to Berlin to share an apartment with Iggy Pop, whose career was floundering after the breakup of the Stooges.
Check out the iTunes playlist for David Bowie and Romanticism.
Bowie’s work after moving to Europe included co-writing and producing two albums for Iggy, both in 1977: The Idiot (recorded in Switzerland, final mixing in Berlin) and Lust for Life (Berlin). These albums most famously produced the songs “China Girl,” a later hit for David Bowie rerecorded for the album Let’s Dance (1983), and “Lust for Life,” Pop’s signature song. Bowie wrote music and Pop lyrics on both songs. Bowie then teamed up with Tony Visconti as producer and Brian Eno as collaborator on the albums Low (1977) and “Heroes” (1977).
Bowie wrapped up his work at the Hansa studio in Berlin with the soundtrack for his performance of Brecht’s Baal (1981). Lodger (1979), typically mentioned as the last of Bowie’s Berlin Trilogy, and the last album on which he collaborated with Brian Eno until 1995’s 1. Outside, was recorded in Switzerland and New York, not Berlin.
Watch “Station to Station” live on YouTube.
Julian Knox’s “Too Late to be Late Again: David Bowie, the Late 1970s, and Romanticism,” chapter 6 of David Bowie and Romanticism, explores the arrival of the “European canon” in Bowie’s music from Station to Station through the Berlin Trilogy to Scary Monsters against the background of German electronica, German Romanticism, Byron, and Coleridge — and his own personal life and growth.
Bowie’s Romanticism in this chapter is described as “a philosophy of artistic creation as self-disclosure, not through purportedly unfiltered, unmediated ‘sincerity,’ but rather through permutation and flux. . . [which] lies at the heart of a major strand of Romantic aesthetics, articulated by Coleridge in his appraisal of Shakespeare-as-Proteus: ‘to become by the power of Imagination another thing–Proteus, a river, a lion, yet still the God felt to be there’” (p. 122). Read more in David Bowie and Romanticism. Pick up a copy in The Bookstore or ask your local, college, or university library to order it.
Julian Knox is Assistant Professor of English at Georgia College & State University, where he teaches Romanticism, the eighteenth century, and Victorian literature, and where he coordinates the M.A. Program in Literature.

(In Search of George Wyllie’s Berlin Burd)
Last month, as one of the minders at The George Wyllie Foundation social media (For The Burds) I received an interesting late night message from Stevie Neil. Stevie is a member of the of the Ayrshire Ukulele Clan.
As a homage to George Wyllie’s favourite instrument, Stevie and the Clan played on the opening night of the George Wyllie Paper Boat exhibition at the Scottish Maritime Museum, Irvine back at beginning of July. (Exhibition continues until Monday 26th September)
While looking at the exhibition, Stevie became intrigued by the story of George Wyllie’s five-metre high Berlin Burd sculpture. George sited this gangly creature beside a section of the (four-metre high) Berlin Wall in 1988 just weeks before the wall came down.
George Wyllie made this Burd from stainless steel in Scotland and and transported across Europe to Berlin to look over the Berlin Wall. He worked with local school-children in Berlin and The George Wyllie Foundation has since been in touch with a few of the kids who remember the experience fondly.
At the time, given the political sensitivities surrounding the wall, politicians in Berlin were very cagey about giving George permission for such a project. One of the planning officials said to George at the time: “Ein vogel ist keen stein,” (“a bird is not a stone”).
This appealed to George’s sense of the absurd. Which of course the Burd was. As was the Wall. Despite the Burd not being a stone, George was given permission to place it beside the wall so that it keeked over it.
The George Wyllie Foundation (of which I am a Trustee) has always been a wee bit mystified as to the exact location of the big Berlin Burd. A couple of years ago, when his wee brother Burd found a permanent nest in The Scottish Parliament at Holyrood in Edinburgh, we made some enquiries but our lack of German stymied our attempts to track him down.
Intrigued, Stevie decided to seek out this giant flightless wonder for himself…
Stevie wrote to us: “I’ve just returned from Berlin where I managed to track down the Berlin Burd with the help of a German-speaking friend and some helpful locals.
“I found an article on the Burd on the Whysman education website and sent the link to my friend Amanda as we were heading to Berlin on holiday and thought it might be good to try to track it down.
“Amanda noticed from the picture in the article that it was in the French Quarter and did a bit more research on German websites before we left for Berlin. Once there we went to the area and went walkabout, initially without success.
“Amanda, who is fluent in German, then asked at the information office in a shopping mall whether anyone knew of it. No one did, but we were directed across the road to a small building where a representative of the factor responsible for maintenance of ‘monuments’ had a small office.
“Amanda made enquiries there and after a couple of phone calls we were directed further up the road.
IS IT A BURD…?
“I must say that while I had the notion of finding the Burd it was Amanda who did all the hard work and emailed the factor to advise of our success. It was also Amanda who translated the plaque for me and gave the explanatory notes.”
THE PLAQUE READS:
George Wyllie put up the Berlin Burd on the West Berlin side of the Wall on 1st December 1988 as part of a cultural initiative with children from schools in the Märkische Viertel under close observation by the East German police.On 9th November 2009 the Berlin Burd was finally moved to the former route of the Wall in memory of the Fall of the Wall.
Reinickendorf Youth Arts School Atrium
Explanatory notes:
The Berlin Burd is located on Wilhelmsruherdamm, near numbers 61–63, in the Märkisches Viertel, Reinickendorf, Berlin. It is on the route of the Wall marking the border between West and East Berlin, today between the administrative districts of Reinickendorf and Pankow.
The Märkisches Viertel or Quarter is the name of the large housing estate built in the 60s and 70s on West Berlin’s northeastern fringe.
The Jugendkunstschule Atrium or Youth Arts School is a local council funded institution which offers classes, projects, after school activities and workshops in all areas of the arts for children and youth in the area.
The date 9th November 2009 was the 20th Anniversary of the Fall of the Wall.
The George Wyllie Foundation would like to say a BIG thanks to Stevie and Amanda for all their sterling efforts in tracking down The Berlin Burd and saying hello. It’s very much appreciated!
You can read all about George Wyllie and the many influences which shaped his life and artworks (including the Berlin Burd) in Arrivals and Sailings: The Making of George Wyllie by me (Jan Patience) and Louise Wyllie (Polygon, £25)

The most expensive production in German TV history, Babylon Berlin is a tumultuous panorama of history on the move. It was adapted from Volker Kutscher’s Weimar novels and directed by Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run (1998)), Hendrik Handloegten and Achim von Borries, whose biggest decision may have concerned what tone to adopt.
Enfolding a political struggle that leads to horrific street battles between Communist workers and the police, the decadence of Berlin nightlife, scenes of extreme poverty, and the suspense of an espionage thriller joined to a potential romance, Babylon Berlin could not afford to be mired in solemnity on one hand or irreverence on the other.
It had to be more accessible than Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s experimental 14-part Berlin Alexanderplatz (1980) and more immediate than Edgar Reitz’s moody and romantic Heimat (1984–2013), which stretches to 32 films. In the end, the filmmakers settled on a breezy observational style that is neither emotionally manipulative nor ironic. The viewer can make what they want of the debauchery — no moral judgement is imposed.
At one point, the hero, Special Investigator Gereon Rath (Volker Bruch), stumbles on a screening room where a producer is watching Marlene Dietrich’s screen test for Josef von Sternberg’s The Blue Angel (1930). Dietrich’s awe-inspiring presence is a reminder that the pursuit of sex is one of the absurdest of human activities.
Visually, there’s a comic-book quality about the succession of heightened incidents, which barely allow the audience to draw breath. Police raid a studio where pornographic movies (one involving young boys) are being made. A Trotskyist cadre hijacks a Russian freight train bound for Berlin and attach a truck full of gold. Svetlana Sorokina (Severija Janušauskaitė), a cabaret performer in Dietrich drag, turns her act into an early rock concert that inspires audience line dancing — did that really happen in Weimar Germany?
There’s an artificial equality to these scenes occasionally reminiscent of Volker Schlöndorff’s The Tin Drum (1979) and Fassbinder’s Lili Marleen (1981), though Babylon Berlin is inevitably more televisual. Less artificial is the Dickensian depiction of squalor in which the heroine, Charlotte Ritter (Liv Lisa Fries), lives with her ailing mother, grandfather, sister and vile brother-in-law, and many younger siblings.
Cumulatively, the series builds a picture of chaos. All that grounds it is the daily traffic of office workers rushing to and fro on Alexanderplatz — life goes on despite the sense that Berlin is standing on a precipice.
The show’s success lies in its marrying of the sociopolitical and the personal. Investigator Gereon and police clerical temp (and would-be homicide detective) Charlotte are borne along by the unstoppable flow of crises even as they try to understand them and ferret out the mysteries of a missing porn film and a missing Trotskyist agitator, Alexej Kardakow (Ivan Shvedoff), whose bedeviled character apparently has nine lives.
When Gereon and Charlotte kick up their heels at a gay nightclub, they are not simply bonding but actively participating in Weimar hedonism. They are not tangential to history — they are two of its components.
And each is compromised by history. Gereon — who has been sent to Berlin to extricate Cologne’s mayor from blackmail — fought on the Siegfried Line during World War. He suffers PTSD and takes shots of morphine, carried in phials in his pocket, when he gets the shakes; he and Charlotte meet cute in a men’s toilet cubicle when he is having a fit.
The only wage earner in her family, girl-about-town Charlotte supplements her income by working as a dominatrix in the brothel beneath her favorite nightclub. She is proudly “not a whore” but is blackmailed by Gereon’s fellow detective, Bruno Wolter (Peter Kurth), into having sex with him — an unwelcome development — and agreeing to inform on Gereon when she becomes his unofficial assistant. Part of the show’s tension derives from whether or not she will betray Gereon.
Babylon Berlin is major-event television and a satisfying binge watch. If it is less than gripping that is because Tykwer, Handloegten, and Borries cooly distance us from the action. How immersive one finds the series depends on how much one empathizes with Gereon and Charlotte, who may be components in history but are also protagonists in a vision of pre-Nazi Berlin that’s part Fassbinder, part Max Beckmann. The reality, for most, was probably much harsher.

One shy tweet promoted the first meetup of Berlin’s Zebras on Eventbrite, but the almost disproportionately large interest in the Zebras Unite movement started by four female US founders proved that the mission has hit a nerve in Germany’s capital. An old colleague of mine, among others, texted that he is thrilled to see Zebras in Berlin, as he was passively following the movement for a while.
Zebras stand for a company model countering the existing startup and venture capital culture. Instead of striving for fast exits and exponential growth at all costs, Zebra companies want to grow sustainably, honor diversity and inclusion, and work both towards profit and benefiting the public (read the manifesto). It’s something we desperately need in a society increasingly overtaken by the centralized services of tech giants bowing to shareholder interests rather than serving the public.
The first meetup of Zebras Unite in Berlin took place on December 4th in Mozilla’s office. After almost 30 registrations, Zebras Berlin had the pleasure to convene a group of 10 who made it through the grey Berlin weather to Kreuzberg.
After a short introduction, the round anonymous faces revealed themselves to be a diverse mix of founders, activists, consultants, and ex-academics experienced in financing their ventures with the help of Kickstarter, micro-investors, or entirely bootstrapping it. All were determined not to lose control of their businesses, but at the same time struggling with navigating the bureaucracy and fundraising landscape. Women founders shared their struggles with bias against women in tech, which led us to discuss the systemic issues behind the horrendous statistics on the diversity in the European startup scene (93% of all funds raised by European VC-backed companies in 2018 went to all-male founding teams).
We discussed how the idea of a Zebra company translates into the German and European reality. Entrepreneur and activist Evgeni Kouris introduced us to a cause he is leading, tailored to the German market and closely aligned with Zebra values: #NewMittelstand.
We wondered how we can encourage the often conservative investors with access to the “old money” in Germany to open up to new kinds of companies. We mentioned the challenge of measuring impact versus profit and the need for innovative investors who “get it” and are willing to take the risk, as well as founders who stand by their values, even under pressure. Because a pressure for exponential impact can be as detrimental as the pressure for exponential growth of profits.
We discussed the role education can and needs to play in this context. We joked we need a “sustainerator” instead of an “accelerator” in the startup ecosystem. Lastly, one of the founders wondered if there is a way to grow your business without taking any external money, which started a discussion about scaling and its challenges.
All in all, we all saw the need to unite in a smart way and raise visibility for the ideas that are already growing in different sectors and communities. Through events, education, meetups and emotional support and skills sharing, Zebras seemed like a great umbrella to talk about a change that is cultural at its core.
We know that once we get people thinking, actions will follow.
We would like to extend an invitation to local founder communities, and investors to talk about what we can do together.

I spoke with Paul Gurner, owner of the St George’s Bookshop, at Wörther Straße 27 in Prenzlauer Berg. Paul, who had no previous experience in the bookstore business, has been running one of the most successful English bookshops in Berlin since 2003 and is planning to open a larger, second location in the Schöneberg neighborhood in 2017. Paul’s answers to how and why St. George’s came into being might be surprising, as is his attitude to Amazon and other competition from the digital domain. Paul’s responses have been edited.
SK: Have you run a bookstore before? What experience did you bring to the bookselling enterprise?
Wow (he laughs), no one asked whether or not we had experience. We have run businesses before, in England, a couple of businesses, and we were looking for a new project.
You get people coming up from the market [on nearby Kollwitz Straße] and they will come in here and you will ask, are you here ’cause of the market? And they will say, No, we are here ’cause of you.
SK: Where in England?
I grew up in Cambridge, and the business was actually based out of Berkshire, the last one I had. It was furniture.
SK: Ah, so you had a furniture business, this was a furniture business and then you turned it into a bookstore.
Indeed. The shop was empty before we came in here.
SK: Why Berlin?
In 2000, I followed a girlfriend over to Berlin, and she left me stranded here; she moved on to Switzerland or southern Germany, and I stayed. It was a good introduction to the city, although we were in Brandenburg.
SK: So you were looking for a new business, but why an English-language bookshop in a German-speaking country? What made you think, okay that’s what I should do?
We had a lot of books from a business we had invested in. We were going to do some markets and off load them as quickly as possible. But in the end, we decided, I was here anyway, storage here was cheaper, ship ’em across here, have a go.
SK: How many books are we talking?
We had about 20 of these Chesterfield sofas, and 10,000 books. It was ridiculous, actually.
SK: You are not a bibliophile then? You are not crazy about writers and writing…
The bookshop worked cause it’s a business, and we treat it as such. I don’t use it as an excuse to sit around and read; I use it as a business.
SK: How did you come upon 10,000 books?
We — me and my brother — invested into a business that didn’t do too well, a bookshop, and the only thing we could get out of in the end was not our money, but the books. They were well selected, and I think we sold most of those books.
It’s all curated through the customers’ needs. Over the years you see what people want, you see the publishers that sell, you see the authors. There is no doubt that the philosophy is chosen by customers’ orders, but also by the staff.
What was the bookstore landscape like when you first started the shop in 2003?
This was an area where a lot of Americans were coming in, from Charlottenburg, and still quite rough around the edges. It was quite obvious that there should have been a bookshop here.
There were no English bookshops?
There was one in Friedrichshain and we didn’t want to go too close to them. Prenzlauer Berg. It seems a bit obvious, why isn’t anyone there? So we jumped on it as quickly as we could. We got things together and we just opened up, rather naively, but in the end you don’t need a qualification to do it, you don’t need permission to do it, you just do it.
Where do you go to get your books now?
We ship a thousand books across every month from England, used stock. There’s no set place where I do my buying: warehouses that are spread all over the place. I avoid London…over the years you have your set routes, you can find bookshops where you do deals with people. Generally, we get phone calls from people closing shops, downsizing, going online. From a selection of 10,000 to 20,000 books you get a thousand books, you cherry pick them.
Who are you cherry picking, who are you looking for?
From Camus to Ishiguro…Ballard, Nabokov, anyone really, you just got to remember 10,000 names.
At one point you called it a curated collection, can you talk more about that? Curated by whom?
Yeah, it sounds wanky, I know. It’s all curated through the customers’ needs. Over the years you see what people want, you see the publishers that sell, you see the authors. There is no doubt that the philosophy is chosen by customers’ orders, but also by the staff.
In these ten plus years, you have built up your knowledge about books. How many years did it take for the bookstore to take off?
We were really busy from year three and we have kept that. We have a large turn over. This is the first time I have been alone all day.
I think people are slowly reconnecting with browsing. You will have people coming in here with their younger teenage kids and just browse. There was a young mother in here with her 16-year old daughter and they seemed to be having fun, genuine fun looking through the books together.
Are bookstores still thriving in Berlin, and if so, how do they survive in this age of Amazon and internet shopping when they are shutting down elsewhere?
There are more opening up, but there are quite a few closing. Last year we saw two bookshops close that have been there 30 plus years.
So it’s changing here as well?
Exactly. I suppose it’s a bit like clearing out. Bookshops that don’t work close. You got to keep your game up. There was one here in Mitte, four or five years ago, not too far from here, and they closed as well. It must have been an operator error because the customer base is down there. And then another one closed last year. Fair Exchange. They been there donkeys years. They were doing German [books] at the front, English at the back. Again they blamed Amazon…but you just can’t blame Amazon. It’s too easy. Concentrate on your own thing. You never know, I could be ten years down the line and saying the same thing.
So you don’t feel a threat from digital media or Amazon?
Even if everyone in this neighborhood came to us and ordered their books there would be too much work. We don’t advertise, we do our job and people talk about us. It’s worked wonderfully. Amazon do their job and we try to do ours.
I think people are slowly reconnecting with browsing. You will have people coming in here with their younger teenage kids and just browse. There was a young mother in here with her 16-year old daughter and they seemed to be having fun, genuine fun looking through the books together. You can imagine that this is something they might remember. It was actually quite sweet…they sat on the sofa discussing books, and what she’d read and what the daughter might like to read.
Given that 90% of your stock is used, do you cultivate relationships with writers? You said you don’t necessarily have the time or space to do readings.
We don’t get approached that often for readings. People know that we just don’t have the space — if we move everything we can fit about forty people sitting down. We still do poetry readings. It was nice when we first started out…it did make us the customer base…it’s what we would do with the bigger shop in Schöneberg, the shop we are looking to buy, it’s one big room about 90–100 square meters that naturally lends itself to readings.
It’s a bit of a family. I know half the people by sight, probably 20% by name, but purely because my memory with names is terrible. I do wonder about the people who used to be customers, people who have just disappeared off the face of…
Who are your main customers?
You have seen the people who were in here. They were expats, I guess. Expats, not necessarily native English, but I’d say non-German 70/30 during the week, and during the weekend it probably levels out to 50–50, where’s there’s 50% German, maybe growing.
What are the intersections between the German speakers and the Anglophones?
I think the Germans are very slowly realizing that they don’t have to go to these big bookshops to get their books, they don’t have to rely on that kind of traditional way of buying books: they can come to us and we can order the books in and they are considerably cheaper. Amazon is not the cheapest route especially in Germany…
How is the price structure determined in Germany? I know that prices are fixed for books published in Germany, but what about books published in the UK, in the US, elsewhere?
People charge whatever they want.
So there is no regulation on those?
No. We choose to match or beat Amazon prices on 90% of our books, there’s 10% on which we can’t.
I know you don’t have the space for cultivating relationships with writers, but can you talk about cultivating relationships with readers. Do you have neighborhood customers…
It’s a bit of a family. I know half the people by sight, probably 20% by name, but purely because my memory with names is terrible. I do wonder about the people who used to be customers, people who have just disappeared off the face of…
Prenzlauer Berg?
No, our customer base is Berlin, it really isn’t only Prenzlauer Berg. It’s much wider reaching than that. You get people coming up from the market [on nearby Kollwitz Straße] and they will come in here and you will ask, are you here ‘cause of the market? And they will say, No, we are here ‘cause of you.

The streets of Berlin are bristling with art and graffiti. Being new in town I decided to buy some pens and leave my mark.
I’ve always enjoyed those terse epigrams scrawled across bathroom walls so I chose some quotes from great writers and set out on a bar tour across town.
The bars of Neukölln are dark and grimy dens or creativity — the perfect place for poignant art. At each stop I would order a beer, find a toilet, and start writing.
Update
Found something I’d written hastily as someone’s profile image on Grindr; made me laugh. A friend also spotted one on Instagram. Nice to know people appreciate your work!

I’ve spent the last few days in Berlin and I’ve become the person I never thought I’d become.
I now ride e-scooters.
I want to clarify that I have always been one of those people who hates those things. Visit any big city, and they’re literally everywhere. If an e-scooter isn’t hammering past you on the pavement, it’s either clogging up the road in front of your car or strewn across the path after coming into contact with a reveller the night before.
However, in Berlin, those instances are, as one might expect, few and far between. The rentable e-transport scene in Germany’s capital is efficient, and reliable, and it just works.
It also got me thinking about the iPhone. Again.
I’m not one to hold back on my opinion of the iPhone. It is, without question, one of the most impressive pieces of tech I use and rely on every day. It makes running my business easier, it makes taking photos of literally anything a joy, and instances of it letting me down are so infrequent I genuinely can’t remember the last time I had to restart it.

A step-by-step guide through the recently released online Blue Card application
The fact that Berlin’s Immigration Office, a.k.a Ausländerbehörde, is currently totally collapsed is widely known. As time passes by, more and more people apply for a residence permit, blue card, or any other immigration matter, and they have almost Zero digitalized processes, which makes the workload humanly impossible to handle by the workers there. The current backlog was estimated to be processed within the whole year of 2024. And the forecast doesn’t bring any good news about digitalizing the entire immigration process. (What would be the most reasonable thing to be done).That said, when you try to make an appointment to do whatever you need to do there, the system proves to be failed once more, and it’s not operational at all. A piece of brick to be written on would do a better job.
As surprising and ghastly as it can sound to the average German citizen, Berlin LEA has recently released an ONLINE application for Blue Card purposes, that includes IT Specialists as well. (You didn’t read it wrong. Yeah, it’s online, and it’s in Germany).
Before diving into the guide, I just want to highlight my situation with this bureaucracy.
On September/23 I was a victim of a mass lay-off from a company in Berlin, the good old story of the awful Upper Management that brings dozens of immigrants to work at their startup with nothing but a bet on getting money out of it in the future, and when things goes wrong the immigrants pay the price (Less than 5% of the laid-off were Germans or had lived in german for more than 5 years).
For my luck, I got a new Job on October/23 and things were quite good at this point. I didn’t know what was expecting me tho…
I got the information that since I’ve been in Germany for less than 2 years (I arrived on October/22), I needed another approval from the Central Foreigners and Specialist Placement office a.k.a ZAV. This consists of a bureaucratic step where a person with ZERO knowledge of your area of expertise will evaluate if you have or not the qualifications to engage in the new Job that you already have. So, no matter if you pass through a selection process of the company and they evaluate your skills, this government organ must approve it as well. It’s the government shooting its own feet and creating the problems on its own.
That said I got an appointment at the Immigration Office (Every Wednesday between 11 am and 1 pm pretend that you have no other thing to do in your life and just refresh the appointment page every 1 second and you may be lucky to get an appointment). When I went there I was told they needed to send my application to ZAV to get the new approval and only then I could start working.
2 Months have passed, and nothing happened.
At the beginning of December, almost sure that I would need to ask for money on the streets, while I was exploring all possible options on the immigration office website, I found this online tool to apply for a Blue Card.
And they won’t let it easy to be found, on purpose, I believe.
After the last step you pay the 100 Euro fee, and it’s done. After 1 week I got the info that ZAV approved my new Job and I could finally start working.
TLDR: here’s the link: https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/324659/
Just translate the page and click on “Do it online now”
Two things are important to highlight:
1 — Your company must provide you with a letter (PDF) saying that your English level is good enough and that they only speak English at your company. Additionally, they can amend it by saying that you’re qualified enough for the role and have passed through a selection process.
2 — After applying you must call ZAV every day on +49 228 713 131 and make sure that your company can reach out to LEA as well.
When calling ZAV you shall go for option 2 (speak in English) and 1 (ask about work permit). Most of the time a robot speaking in German will just drop your call, so try at 9 am and 12 pm, 1 pm and 2 pm. These are the best times to call.
When speaking with the agent you shall ask about the status of your blue card application informing your last name and birthdate. Once they say it’s approved, you can ask your company to reach out to LEA so they can get a confirmation document saying that you’re allowed to work.
Your blue card in fact will only arrive after several months, but at least you’ll be able to work till then.
I hope that this guide can be useful for other people struggling with Berlin’s Immigration Office and for those who are in a situation similar to the one I was in.

Frohe Weihnachten means Merry Christmas in German. My preoccupation with this newly learned holiday greeting squandered every potential opportunity I might’ve had to speak the little German that I knew.
It seemed as if it were my crutch — saying it as annoyingly often as possible — during my holiday stay in the trendy city of Berlin. That said, nobody could say I wasn’t festive.
If Christmas in New York is magical, then Christmas in Berlin is the magician’s favorite trick. The city is at its finest at this time. After all, it is the German capital. How could it not put on its Sunday best?
Simple white lights illuminate the trees in Unter den Linden, horses and buggies parade through the night in the chilly winter air, and numerous charming Christmas markets feature delicious German foods, hand-made crafts, children’s rides, and a specialty hot wine, commonly referred to as Glühwein.
As part of the German holiday tradition, nearly everyone drinks Glühwein. “It’s an acquired taste,” a friend informed me. Of course, when you’re freezing your arse off at a Christmas market, you’ll drink just about anything to keep warm.

When you think of travelling to Berlin, a late night run in the snow probably isn’t the first thing that comes to mind. Things like the dense history, diverse food scene, and an internationally renowned club scene, are probably the main attractions which draws people around the globe. I’ve never been much of a partier, and when fellow travellers from the hostel I was staying in were clamouring to get to the Berghain, Kit Kat Club or the Matrix club, I felt like an alien. That’s not to say I judge people who partake, it’s just not for me. Instead, I decided to do something I had never done before, run in below freezing temperatures, through the snow.
Coming from Australia, I’m lucky to run in anything below 20 degrees (celsius that is), so the opportunity to run and not have my back having a waterfall of sweat rivalling Niagara falls was a welcome thought. So decked out in my newly acquired winter activewear from Decathlon, sporting a stylish torch atop my head, I began my maiden voyage through the snow at around 10pm.
I didn’t know what to expect. I was a bit hesitant that my shoes which had accrued about 5 months of traction, weren’t going to hold up on the icy…

Looking for an apartment in Berlin in 2017 is a madhouse. I’ve been doing it for about 2 weeks now, as I’ll be starting a new job in the city, but I’ve heard stories of people, who are living in temporary accommodations for months before finding a flat. One guy summed it up perfectly in this comment on Facebook, under a job seeker post:
Jobs are plenty in Berlin, it’s harder to find a place to live.
That being said, imagine my surprise when I received the following e-mail:
Rough translation:
“Dear Rumen,
Yes the room is still free. Please, write me something about yourself. Age, occupation, nationality, etc. I’m sorry to bother you.
It would be nice if you could tell a little bit about yourself to see if it’ll work out.
Photos, rent, deposit and address of the apartment will be disposed to your knowledge.
Good morning,
Best regards,
Christoph”
Most of you might say, of course it’s a scam, look at the inadequate writing. But imagine being desperate to find a place to live. You’re racing against time and you finally receive an answer. You really want to believe that it’s true and you start thinking about excuses. Maybe he’s not German, that’s why the writing is so bad — maybe he’s using Google Translate. Maybe he was in a hurry, because he has to answer a lot of e-mails.
I answered Christoph’s e-mail with a little bit of details about myself, why I’m coming to Berlin and included some of my social media profiles, you know, to prove I’m not a fake person. Shortly after, I get the following e-mail from Chris:
Rough translation:
“Good day Rumen,
Thank you for the information. That sounds perfect. I’m happy to meet you. The apartment is centrally heated and well furnished. The 20 sq.m. room is completely equipped, has wlan internet.
The room is located on a cross road, one has to be a little noise resistant if the windows are open. The windows are well isolated, if closed, there’s no problem with noise.
The flat itself is well organised, your room is next to the living room with a big TV, table and a corner for chilling. The kitchen is equipped with a built-in kitchen (incl. washing machine and fridge). There’s a table with 8 chairs in the living room. There’s a mirror in the bathroom, as well as a sink with a cabinet. (…)
The surroundings are excellent. Lots of places to buy stuff, cafes, restaurants are directly around the corner. Additionally, you can reach bars, clubs, markets and galleries within minutes walking distans.
Address — Friedenstrasse 36 10249 Berlin Friedrichshain
Monthly rent (all incl.)—350 EUR
Deposit (refundable) — 700 EUR
Side expenses are included in the rent. If you think it can work out I can write a little bit about myself. I would be happy to get an answer from you.
Attached, you can see some photos of the apartment.”
As I mentioned, the first red flag was the weird wording, which became evident with every next e-mail. Aside from the fact that the deal seems too good to be true, it’s also odd that someone offering an apartment would spend so much time writing long e-mails with detailed descriptions. People who post apartment offers receive hundreds of e-mails per week. Having a multi-email discussion with a single potential tenant is not likely. Still, all the small suspicions I was having were plausibly deniable. So I continued, telling Christoph the offer sounds good and that he can tell me a little bit about himself. I also asked if he could share his FB profile. The e-mail I received back was in English.
As you can see, the wording is still a bit off. The guy says he’s “half German and half UK”, but evidently can’t write properly in either language. Again, it’s a much longer e-mail than I would’ve expected, but an accusation like that sounds silly by itself — “I don’t trust this guy because he writes lenghty e-mails.” Maybe the guy likes to express himself.
It’s interesting how he mentions important details mixed inbetween marginal information. He says there’s a desk for reading in the room and that I need to pay two months rent plus the deposit up front, all in the same sentence. Conveniently, he also doesn’t use Facebook, so he couldn’t send me a profile. Other than that, everything is jolly good and we’d be living together as besties. At this point, I write how wonderful of a person he seems and that I think we’ll get along excellently. I also asked if a friend of mine could come by and have a look at the apartment, since I’ll be arriving in Berlin in two weeks. The plot thickened.
Christoph actually sent me a copy of his ID card, as well as a scanned flight ticket from Warsaw to Berlin for the 23. December. The ID card looks very real, which confused me for a second. Then again, there’s no information about a person of that name anywhere on the Internet.
It’s a well thought through plot. He provides bits of information spread out in several e-mails, before delivering the final detail. He’s not actually in Berlin, but he’ll send me the keys. I assumed it’s self-explanatory that I’ll have to pay him the money upfront. Still, I asked him to describe step by step how he imagines this would go down.
I wrote back a short reply, saying this is getting absurd. I also asked if renting is normally done this way. Chris wrote:
This is where I lost interest in playing along and told Chris I won’t be going forward with his offer.
Perhaps I should’ve pushed a bit further to see how far things would go. I could’ve also messed around with him a little bit to have something to laugh about with my mates. But to be honest, I neither have time, nor am I in the mood. After all, I need to continue looking for an apartment, just like all the hundreds (thousands?) of people sending e-mails every day.
It makes me sad that there are so many individuals trying to scam people and this probably makes everyone trust each other less. My point is to be careful what you agree on (especially on the Internet) and always consider things carefully even when you’re pressed by time or other circumstances.

Time to break the suspense and finally give you a glimpse at the mystery German street food we are excited to be bringing to you. Please allow me to introduce you to the Berlin Doner:
Officially, in Germany, they call it the doner kebab. Personally, I find this very misleading as it tends to get confused with donairs (which it is not) and/or kebabs (which it is definitely not). To add to the confusion, the meat is cooked on a vertical grill, which immediately makes you think of shawarma, gyros, or tacos— which again, it is most definitely not.
So forget the name and don’t bother trying to compare it to anything, cause I promise you it is unlike anything you’ve ever eaten before. So just keep an open mind until you’ve tasted it for yourself. In the meantime, why not make all our lives easier and call it a sandwich. That’s essentially what it is after all: bread stuffed with meat, veggies, and sauce. It just happens to be the best sandwich ever.
The numbers speak for themselves: Germans consume 2 million of these doners a day. It’s a $4 billion industry in Germany alone with over 40,000 doner shops across the country.
What’s crazy to me is how they’ve managed to keep this secret from us for so long! They eat it for lunch, for dinner, and — perhaps best of all — late at night. It’s been a major staple of the German diet for decades, yet somehow, most of us here in North America have never heard of it… wtf?
So what is it really? Allow me to dissect it piece by piece for you.
The meat. The original doner is made with beef, veal, or lamb (or a combo thereof). It is ground ultra fine and seasoned to perfection, roasted on a vertical spit until perfectly caramelized, before being sliced paper thin — giving it a texture and flavor unlike anything else. There is also a chicken option which is doused in an insanely delicious marinade. We are also working on a vegetarian option. One of the key differences is how juicy the meat is — much more succulent than other vertically grilled meats *cough* *cough*.
The bread. The bread is this triangular flatbread/panini hybrid. It’s thin, yet sturdy. Crispy, yet chewy. Plus a little sesame sprinkle just to top it off. It is a golden baked beauty.
The veggies. This is what makes it the most refreshing sandwich. It comes loaded with crisp lettuce, lightly marinated (not pickled!) cabbage, thinly sliced onions for just a little zing, as well as fresh tomatoes and cucumbers. This perfectly counter-balances the richness of the meat and skyrockets the nutritional value of this sandwich — delivering a full serving of veggies.
The sauce. Our secret sauce. I really can’t say much more. But I can tell you that you’ll have two options: a heavenly creamy herb or a spicy kick in the ass. Some go for both. I don’t judge. It’s all love over here.
We will also be giving you the option to have it in salad format for those who would like a lighter open or who are doing the keto thing.
And here’s the kicker: it is also much healthier than other fast food options. To me, this is a big part of what makes this the ultimate street food: it delivers the satisfaction of comfort food, without the guilt — nor the gut. And thank god, since when I can, I tend to eat it everyday :P.
Ok, now a quick warning: it’s addictive AF. Case in point, I’m obsessed with it. There’s a good chance you will be too. It’s just one of those foods that induce cravings. And the cravings are real. The good news is, we’ll be there to help satisfy those cravings — without requiring an 8-hour flight as I’ve had to deal with for the past couple of years. You’re welcome.
Now I really hate overselling things and I realize that’s what this sounds like, but in this case I really can’t help it cause it’s just that good. But I’ll stop now and let it speak for itself. You’re right to doubt me. Just be prepared to also be wrong — like I was.
More details coming soon.

By John Glab
Jacob Sweetman, a long-time Union Berlin football fan, walks through the empty summer stands of the Stadion An der Alten Försterei, located among trees in eastern Berlin’s Köpenick neighborhood. The stadium dates from 1920 and was famously redeveloped around 15 years ago with the help of 2300 fan volunteers devoted to the team. Sweetman, the club’s English language spokesman, loves to recount stories of the club’s historic rivalries — particularly with western Berlin’s Hertha club.
He remembers a game in 2019 when tension ran so high among both sets of supporters that Hertha fans threw fireworks onto the pitch, setting on fire part of a net behind the goal, and delaying the game. “When Hertha and Union started playing each other more, there was a friction that formed between the two,” Sweetman said.
It’s more about pride in one’s team than any lingering East-West resentments. “It’s not that I or any other Union supporters hate Hertha. We want both of our clubs to be successful,” Sweetman said. “When it comes to playing against each other though, there are no friends in football. We want to beat the fuckers.”
This summer, Union and Hertha fans, along with others across Germany, left local rivalries aside to express their fervent passion for football — soccer to North Americans — on the national and European level, as German cities hosted the Euro 2024 tournament.
The competition saw 24 national teams compete for the UEFA European Cup. At the center of the month-long event was the nation’s capital, Berlin. Along with hosting the final match, the city welcomed more visitors than any other Germany city did, estimated at more than 2 million.
In Berlin, grassroots excitement over the Euros was everywhere. On the S-Bahn from the airport into the city, Austrian supporters in football shirts and lederhosen with three streaks of red, white, and red on their faces filled the seats. Billboards on the sides of buildings displayed the competition’s logos in massive fonts. On the streets, people were constantly talking with each other about who they thought would win a certain match, or sitting down at cafes and bars to watch games on large television screens that appeared to have been set up by any establishment that wanted to keep its paying patrons during the tournament.
Felix Tamsut, a German sports journalist who focuses on football fan culture, says that when someone supports their national football team, it comes in the context of their history and connections to their country. Their expressions of nationalism occur on a continent where millions of people have died from nationalist wars.
“Supporting a national team is a way of identifying with your own national identity,” Tamsut said. “As a result, when you combine the very strong emotions in football and national feelings of pride with national symbols, those feelings are not neutral.”
On the night of a match between Belgium and Romania, Romania was trailing for most of the match, but its fans persisted in loud support. For them, having the national team perform on the global stage of the Euros was a source of national pride. “Historically because we were always oppressed by the big powers from the East and West, we’ve always stayed together, and united under the national umbrella,” said Petru Badea, a Romanian who has been living in Berlin for the past several years. He said coming out to support Romania was about being together as a community, and a victory would be just a plus. “Even if we lose 10–0, we’re still going to love our team.”
This national fervor is most apparent at the host stadiums, such as the Olympiastadion — the home stadium of Hertha Berlin — which hosted a group-stage match between Austria and the Netherlands in late June. The stadium’s Nazi-era, neoclassical facade opened into a looming, cavernous space with orange and red walls of supporters sloping down towards the green pitch in the center. Sunlight poured through the gap in the stadium’s west curve onto the 70,000 fans in the stands, as if lighting a cauldron on fire.
Austria took an early lead, but the Netherlands tied the game shortly after halftime. The mass of Netherlands orange in the stands grew louder and louder before it was out-chanted by Austrian supporters when their team again took over the lead. The Dutch tied the game again, but Austria won in the end.
The energy coming from Austrian supporters in the last 10 minutes of the match was unrelenting. “Immer Wieder Österreich” (Forever Austria) they continuously repeated, echoing off the stadium walls, drowning out any noise from the Dutch. At the whistle, the Austrian fans lingered in the stadium singing together as one.
Austrian supporter Petr Schladming described it as the best result in the modern history of Austrian football. “For us it’s such a big moment to see we have all this potential. The emotions are just so big and great. Everyone from the country is singing these songs together and it gives you chills with this communal feeling,” he said, hoarse after 90 minutes of shouting. The S-Bahn trains back to the center of Berlin were loud with song as the celebrations continued through the night.
Outside the major stadiums, the largest display of national Euro fan support came at Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate fan zone, especially when the host country Germany played. In the Round of 16 game against Denmark, around 100,000 people came to the outdoor area to watch — though the actual game took place in Dortmund. A mass of people dressed in white with German flags draped across their shoulders stretched for a kilometer in front of the main screen.
Chants rang out, and each action hundreds of kilometers away in Dortmund provoked a reaction. During the 90-plus minutes of Germany’s 2–0 victory, the park erupted in jubilation after both goals. In close quarters, people moshed against each other, pressing forward toward the main screen as if trying to get closer to their heroes. Individual Germans, with their own varying club allegiances, were all united in support for the national team.
Overt expressions of nationalism are all but taboo among Germans given the country’s imperialist, Nazi, and East German communist pasts. “You always have to draw a line between the national team and Germany in general,” said Jano Rotanburg, a German at the fan zone for the Round of 16 match. “I think that the Euros, and Germany winning, is a great way for Germans to be proud of themselves. But it could bring a great danger if the wrong people were to phrase it a certain way.”
The wrong people Rotanburg referred to are adherents of the far-right and their main political party Alternative for Germany (AfD). The AfD uses nationalist, anti-LGBTQ and racist, anti-immigrant sentiments in its messaging. The party has become more popular in recent years — particularly among youth.
“The whole country is in a critical state right now, especially with the rise of the AfD,” said Niko Mohr, a Berliner who was watching the Germany match at one of the fan zones. “Germany is very much divided between the urban and rural areas, where cities have more progressive ideals while rural areas have the old ways of thinking.” He explained that many have felt left behind by the government, and have embraced the populist messages of the AfD.
A main AfD focus is reclaiming Germany’s national pride, and rejecting the cultural shame that they say is imbedded in post-World War II German society. Many Germans worried this summer that the far-right could use the Euros as a rallying point. But sports journalist Felix Tamsut noted that it hasn’t been the case.
The German Football Association (DFB) has made a point of stressing inclusivity for LGBTQ people and migrants and so the AfD hasn’t seen the German national team as “their team,” which would represent a less inclusive image of Germany. With more players from migrant backgrounds now on the team, football reflects the country as it currently is — not as it used to be.
Still, right-wing populism has been sprouting up across many countries in Europe, and for them football is a perfect vehicle to spread their credos. “International tournaments, whether you like it or not, have always had a political element,” Tamsut said. “A national team doing well or failing has repercussions on a country’s national identity.” Benito Mussolini used the 1934 and 1938 FIFA World Cups to try to show how strong fascist Italy was. In 2024, many world leaders are trying to do the same.
In Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán leads an authoritarian, far-right autocratic government. He has revived a nationalist narrative tied to “The Humiliation of the Treaty of Trianon” which redrew Hungary’s borders after World War I. A large part of Orbán’s platform is to regain these lands he sees as stolen, and the sentiment has emboldened many Hungarians — including football fans.
Orbán has invested millions into Hungary’s footballing infrastructure, and success at the Euros would have helped promote the nationalistic Hungarian agenda to the rest of Europe and the world. Hungary didn’t prevail at the Euros, eliminated at an early stage. But the team’s ultra-nationalistic supporters made their presence felt in those German cities where Hungary was playing. In the stands and on the streets, they wore black, displayed images of a Greater Hungary, and frequently sang racist chants, intimidating those around them.
Within the Berlin fan zone, organizers tried to maintain a space free from politics. “We think of the fan zone more as ‘united by football,’ working with the famous UEFA slogan. We want to unite cultures and for everyone to enjoy themselves, have fun, and make new friends,” said Petra Neye, spokesperson for Kulturprojekte Berlin, the company that ran the fan zone on behalf of the Berlin state government.
“We don’t want people to use it as a political platform. It’s a bit of an escape from all the bad stuff happening in the world. People need a break from it.” A key house ‘rule’ the event management agency enacted was to allow only flags of nations participating in this year’s Euros to be flown inside the fan zones.
Keeping politics out was easier said than done. For Turkey versus Austria, hundreds of Turkish supporters showed up in red, wearing the flag like a cape to support the national team. From the earliest goal onwards, supporters were unrelenting, with several people in front of the crowd leading coordinated, clapping chants, and each turn in the game prompting a frenzied reaction of hope. In the match, Turkish player Merih Demiral celebrated one of his goals with the Grey Wolf hand gesture, an important symbol for Turkish right-wing extremists who make up part of the support for Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the president of Turkey.
Demiral was given a two-match suspension for the gesture. In the following game against the Netherlands in the quarter finals, many Turkish fans showed the Grey Wolf gesture in support of Demiral after his suspension. At the Brandenburg Gate fan zone, organizers asked them to stop, preventing an escalation.
Berlin resident Merve Guendogdua came to the fan zone for the atmosphere and connection with the other Turkish fans in Germany. “It feels good because we have the same nation and all support the same team. We connect together, we watch the game together, and we feel everything together. It’s great,” she said. She added that the large Turkish population in Germany meant many Germans supported Turkey, as well, at the Euros. And being German, she also supported the German national team.
At the Brandenburg Gate during the Germany and Spain quarter final match, another showing of 100,000 lined up through the Tiergarten to cheer Germany on. Chants of “Deutschland” bellowed out from supporters until Dani Olmo’s goal for Spain early in the second half. Now, the German fans watched anxiously as the clock ticked up towards 90 minutes, pleading with the higher powers of football to let Germany score, in order to stay in the tournament. The situation looked dire until Florian Wirtz bounced the ball off the post and into the goal at the last minute to even the score.
Immediately, German supporters leapt off the ground, erupting in euphoria. Strangers embraced each other as they bounced up and down in pure delight. Their dream of being European champions on home soil was still alive for at least 30 more minutes. Throughout extra time, Germany appeared to control the match over Spain. But in the final moments of the match, silence spread across the fan zone as Spain’s Mikel Merino headed the ball into Germany’s goal zone. Devastation numbed the faces of Germany fans, who desperately urged their players on for the last few seconds before the whistle was ultimately blown. Germany was out.
Afterwards, everyone in the fan zone fell silent, partaking in a solemn mass exodus out of the Tiergarten to go their own separate ways. One fan, Philip Buchholz, said that even though there was an immense collective sadness, Germans would forget about it in a couple days, and everything would go back to normal in the country.
The semifinals saw England beat the Netherlands and then the final game went to Spain, which beat England 2 to 1. With the air already out of the balloon for Berliners after Germany lost in the quarter finals, the energy on Berlin’s streets never rose to out-of-control levels and organizers were pleased to report no major incidents during the tournament.
A collaborative spirit persisted, with football — as marketers liked to insist — bringing people together. Like everything, though, this zealous unity is ephemeral. International tournaments end after only a month. The divisions that separate Europe and the world are still there and nationalism is on the rise. But for one month, everyone appeared to be united by football and met each other on common ground.
At the Union Berlin club in Köpenick, and for Jacob Sweetman specifically, the sport has offered a sense of belonging. From those who rebuilt the stadium, to those who are there for every match day of the year, the team offers community. “This club is how I met so many of the people Iknow,” Sweetman said. “Coming here each week, I’ve developed a bond with all these people, and I’m so lucky to have this club be my life.” That, he says, is what it means to be a football fan.

Life often has a way of steering us toward unexpected paths, and mine led me from the bustling event scene in Berlin to the serene shores of Zanzibar. My name is Emin Mahrt, and I’m the founder of Why Not Limited, a nightclub I’ve envisioned as a space where music, culture, and connection come alive in this tropical paradise.
For years, Berlin was my playground—a city renowned for its underground scene, experimental music, and cultural diversity. It was here that I honed my understanding of what makes an event unforgettable. From intimate gatherings to large-scale productions, Berlin taught me how sound, space, and atmosphere intertwine to create something truly magical.
But as vibrant as Berlin is, I began to crave something different. The fast pace of city life, while exhilarating, left me searching for a deeper connection—both with myself and with the world around me. That’s when Zanzibar came into view.
Zanzibar is a place of contrasts, where tradition and modernity coexist in harmony. From the moment I arrived, I was captivated by the island’s rich cultural tapestry, warm community, and, of course, its natural beauty. Yet, as I explored, I saw an opportunity: Zanzibar had a vibrant tourism scene, but there was room to introduce a unique nightlife experience—a place where locals and visitors alike could come together to celebrate music and creativity.
The idea for Why Not Limited began to take shape. I wanted to create a venue that wasn’t just another club but a destination—a space where the energy of Berlin’s underground scene could meet the soul of Zanzibar.
Starting a project like this wasn’t without its challenges. Zanzibar’s pace of life is different from Berlin’s efficiency, and adapting to this new rhythm required patience and flexibility. From sourcing materials to navigating local regulations, each step was a lesson in perseverance.
But the community made it worthwhile. I found incredible talent among local artists, DJs, and craftspeople, all eager to contribute their skills and perspectives to the project. Collaborating with them brought the vision for Why Not to life in a way that felt authentic to Zanzibar while honoring the influences I brought from Berlin.
The name Why Not embodies the spirit of curiosity and openness that has driven this journey. It’s a question that invites exploration and challenges the status quo—a reminder that sometimes, the best experiences come from saying “yes” to the unexpected.
Our club is designed to reflect this ethos. The music lineup is eclectic, blending local sounds like taarab and bongo flava with global genres, from techno to Afrohouse. The venue itself combines modern design with traditional Zanzibari elements, creating an atmosphere that feels both familiar and fresh.
Why Not isn’t just a club; it’s a meeting point—a place where people from all walks of life can share stories, dance, and create memories.
Looking back, the journey from Berlin to Zanzibar has been transformative. It’s taught me to embrace uncertainty, adapt to new environments, and trust in the power of collaboration. Why Not Limited is more than a nightclub; it’s a testament to what can happen when you follow your instincts and dare to dream big.
I’m thrilled to see how Why Not grows and evolves, becoming a part of Zanzibar’s cultural landscape. For those who find themselves on this beautiful island, I hope you’ll stop by, share a moment, and perhaps ask yourself the same question that brought us here: Why not?
