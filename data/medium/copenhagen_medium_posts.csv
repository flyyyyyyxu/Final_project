Copenhagen. The beautiful port city and capital of Denmark.
Copenhagen was originally a viking fishing village and a place of commerce back in the 10th century. In fact, the original name of the city in Old Norse, from which Danish descends, was Kaupmannahǫfn, meaning “merchants’ harbor”. The name underwent pronounciation changes in line with regular sound change in the local language until it came to be known as København in modern Danish. The literal English equivalent of the modern name would be “chapman’s haven” or “traders’ harbor”.
I moved here in November 2021, and I’m now a little over the 1-year mark.
A lot of people have asked me about my experience living here. So I’m penning down a snapshot of the good and not-so-good aspects of life here.
Note that I still consider myself fairly new to Denmark, so I haven’t yet hit the challenges of trying to fully integrate with the locals.
All said and done, I feel happy and privileged to call this city home!

Copenhagen is full of culture, amazing food, and so much to do. We visited in the off-season, from the 13th to the 19th March 2024, so most places were not too busy and flights were cheaper. Unfortunately Tivoli Gardens was closed during our stay, but apart from that, we managed to visit pretty much every other place we had planned to. As of writing this (March 2024), the exchange rate was GBP 1 = DKK 8.72 — this is for reference as I mention how much we paid for tickets to certain attractions.
There is the Copenhagen Card that gives access to public transport and over 80 attractions, including all the ones mentioned in this article. To make it worthwhile, in my opinion, you would have to try to see as much as possible every day, and use a lot of public transport. For those who want to see everything, I believe it is a good option, but on our schedule that I have listed at the end of the article, we saved money by paying for everything individually. If the Tivoli Gardens had been open, we may have decided to get one as we were very close and we would have used the Copenhagen Card to go in for the restaurants and rides over a few days. One last thing to note is that many places are closed on Mondays, so make sure to plan ahead, or do what we did, and make Monday your day of relaxation. Without further ado, here is what Denmark has to offer…
Beginning with the one place not in Copenhagen, Kronborg Castle is a perfect day trip, as it is only a 55 minute train to Helsingør, costing around DKK 150.00 for a return ticket — it is also included as part of the Copenhagen Card. It is most famous for its inclusion in Shakespeare’s Hamlet in which it is called Elsinore — possibly due to the mispronunciation of Helsingør from returning Englishmen who visited the castle during Shakespeare’s era, or maybe just an intentional alteration of the original name.
Walking from the station, you approach Kronborg, seeing it across the water as the imposing fortress it once was. Tickets to enter were DKK 125.00 and there is lots to see — from the courtyard, you can enter different rooms of the building, discover the underground dungeons/soldiers quarters (known as the casemates) and climb a spiral staircase to the top of the square tower.
Dating back to the 15th century, Kronborg castle has had many uses over its lifetime, from a fortress to a royal residence to a prison and now a UNESCO World Heritage site. The fortification was strategically built in a perfect position to control one of 4 routes into the Baltic Sea and defend against Sweden across the Øresund (The Sound) strait. The narrowest point of the Sound is between Helsingør and Helsingborg and therefore it was wise to build the castle there as a show of strength and for defence. My favourite story of the castle comes from the Swedish conquest of 1658 in which they stole the ornamental fountain that once resided in the courtyard — now all that remains is the small plinth where it once was and a plaque explaining its absence.
Walking up the tower offers some beautiful views of Helsingør and Sweden alike. The garrison barracks that are just outside the castle walls are very scenic in their bright orange and yellow colours.
Underneath the grounds of Søndermarken, a public park and garden, resides an underground art venue in 3 former cisterns. Known as the Cisternerne, it hosts a variety of exhibitions in a unique space. Above this unused water reservoir, Frederiksberg Palace sits pride of place. The palace grounds continue behind it, hosting English-style landscaped gardens and canals reminiscent of the palace’s 18th century heritage. Copenhagen Zoo is adjacent to the palace marked by an Eiffel Tower-esque structure just to the left of the building.
When we visited the Cisternerne, the current exhibition was a sound installation by Taryn Simon titled, “Start Again the Lament”. As described by the website, it explores “how we mourn individually and collectively, considering the anatomy of grief and who we choose to guide us through it.” (https://frederiksbergmuseerne.dk/en/cisternerne/)
Tickets for the Cisternerne were DKK 90.00 and all we were told was to walk slowly and follow the lights on the floor. Walking down the stairs, it was pitch black, save for the thin LED strip lights under the steel grate walkways. A shallow pool of water flooded the ground reflecting what little light there was. After a couple of minutes your eyes begin to adjust and can finally take in the moody atmosphere. The sound installation was very disconcerting, and horrifying to an extent, which I suppose was its aim. Over the speakers, a long recording of people crying, moaning and wailing echoed through the big, cavernous space. It was certainly an experience, a type of art where you participate and exist within it.
The Rundetaarn, or Round Tower, was built in the 17th century as an astronomical observatory. Interest in astronomy grew in this period and its close connection to religion is interesting. The Rundetaarn was built as a replacement observatory to Tycho Brahe’s which had been demolished after he had fallen out of favour in Denmark. However, as astronomical instruments were getting bigger and more accurate, alongside the increased traffic and light pollution in the expanding city, the Rundetaarn became outdated and was eventually decommissioned. Now it is open to the public for as little as DKK 40.00.
According to the Rundetaarn website, “in the 1760s, surveyors started measuring Denmark in order to make the first accurate map covering the whole country. To verify the measurements, the surveyors established a network of triangles covering Denmark. The starting point of the network was the Round Tower’s hollow core, which therefore became Denmark’s geographical zero point.” (Rundetaarn Website)
The top of the tower provides a panoramic view of Copenhagen where there are copper roofs and orange buildings as far as the eye can see.
The tower is connected to the Trinitatis Kirke (Trinitatis Church) which also served the students of Copenhagen University at the time of its completion. The nave is richly decorated with chandeliers and gold accents everywhere. The bright white-washed walls only aid to amplify the gold decorations and ornateness.
Found right outside Marmokirken metro station, Frederiks Kirke is certainly a unique building. Its almost cylindrical design is uncommon for a church, making it that much more special. It is free to enter and boasts an spectacular dome vaulted ceiling with windows below letting in lots of light.
Just down the street from Frederiks Kirke is the Amalienborg complex. It is the Royal Family’s Copenhagen residence and consists of 4 identical palaces built around an octagonal courtyard. The church’s impressive dome can be seen looming over the courtyard. There is a museum open to visitors that takes you round Christian X’s study, the Fabergé Chamber and the Gala Hall.
Amalienborg is customarily the Monarch’s winter residence and is famous for its Royal Guard, called Den Kongelige Livgarde. According to Visit Copenhagen, “every day you can experience the changing of the guards, as they march from their barracks in 100 Gothersgade by Rosenborg Castle through the streets of Copenhagen and end up at Amalienborg, where the changing of the guard takes place at 12:00 noon.” We witnessed this happen twice as they were passing by the Rundetaarn. The guards are accompanied by a marching band and a couple policemen making a path through the busy streets.
Originally built as a summerhouse for Christian IV in 1606, Rosenborg Castle now holds the entire Danish treasury, including the crown jewels, and is open to the public. On its grounds are some quaint gardens that I can imagine would be beautiful in summer when in full bloom and, in general, a nice open space that breaks up the cityscape.
It is from the barracks by Rosenborg Castle that the Royal Guards begin their march towards Amalienborg. The map below shows how close all of these landmarks are.
The Palm House is located very close to Rosenborg Slot and is a must-see even if you are not particularly interested in plants. The Botanical Garden is host to over 13,000 species of plants and the greenhouse dates back to 1874.
Tickets to the Palm House individually were DKK 70.00 but we later found out that if you buy a ticket to Museum of Natural History just across the garden, it entitles you access to the Palm House included. The museum ticket was DKK 115.00 and was hosting the Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition — as someone who is very into photogrpahy, it was well worth seeing. Although all the photographs are available to see online, it was nice being able to walk around and see them printed and set in light boxes. The museum setting makes you take in the art and stop to examine the pieces.
The Palm House has species of plants from all over the world, including Aquatic and Mangrove plants, Warm Subtropics, Dry Tropics, and Mediterranean plants as well as Succulents and Cacti. In the centre room, there is a spiral staircase that takes you up to a 360 degree walkway around the room. It is pretty high up and gives you a birds eye view of the trees and plants below.
There are plenty of sightseeing opportunities walking along the Port of Copenhagen (Københavns Havn). We walked South along the river from the Kastellet, where the famous Little Mermaid can be found, to The Royal Library (Det Kongelige Bibliotek). They can all be seen in one day and are makes for a nice walk along the water.
The Kastellet, translated as The Citadel, is fortress that was founded in 1626 and remains in use by the military today. It is however open for public access as it has a museum and an amazing path around the star-shaped perimeter. It was initially constructed to protect Copenhagen’s port, but now in peacetime, it is home to geese, swans and many people out for a run.
On the grounds, there is a windmill (Kastelsmøllen) that was used to make flour and grains, useful for military use when under siege. Nearby towards the port, the Little Mermaid can be found. It is usually crowded by tourists but still worth seeing as it is an iconic Danish landmark.
Walking South along the water, you will see the Opera House (Operaen) across the water on your left. Further down, you will find Nyhavn, a canal lined by colourful townhouses built in 17th and 18th centuries. There are plenty of restaurants to choose from and canal boat experiences.
Finally, you will stumble across The Royal Library, aka The Black Diamond. It is a cool looking piece of architecture which has an observation deck inside where you can look upon the circle bridge opposite it.
Christiania is a small commune neighbourhood behind the Opera House in Christianshavn. What started as a squatted abandoned military town in 1971, is now considered an unofficial enclaved state mostly known for its open trade of cannabis. The residents were eventually allowed to buy the land in 2012 but are technically still citizens of Denmark and are as a result subject to its laws. Despite this, there is a mutual agreement between Christiania and the government that if there is no violence, or hard drugs sold, they will be largely left alone. There are occasional police raids but during the daytime, there are hundreds of tourists that pass through making it feel safe.
As a result of the threat of police, there are signs that state no photography allowed and the sellers all wear balaclavas to hide their identities. It is a unique place to visit and serves as an example of what a community looks like when run by gangs and residents. It is worth a visit, but I would advise to just keep your wits about you.
The internationally famous Studio Arhoj HQ and flagship store can be found on Skindergade 7, st. 1159 in Copenhagen. Every item is unique and handmade by skilled glassblowers and ceramicists in store. You can watch through the gaps in the shelves as they consistently create amazing pieces of art by hand. We had to return because we both wanted to buy a souvenir as all the artworks are just beautiful.
Throughout our trip we had a wide variety of food including sushi from Sticks N Sushi, burgers from Sliders, smørrebrød, salmon pasta, foccacia, pizza, chinese and even a couple 7-Eleven hot dogs. I have heard Gasoline Grill is really good as well. There is so much choice but I would have to say you need to try either Sliders or Sticks N Sushi as they were both amazing.
It is impossible to see everything in Copenhagen, and especially Denmark, all in one trip. For starters, Tivoli Gardens is (as I have been told) a must-see, but as I said before, it was unfortunately closed when I visited. If you are interested in arts and culture, there is the Palads Theatre, Arken Museum and Design Museum. In terms of architecture that I did not get to visit, there is Frederiksborg Castle outside of Copenhagen which looks incredible, and the Church of Our Savior with its famous serpentine spire you can walk up. Finally, as someone interested in churches, Grundtvigs Kirke (Grundtvigs Church), from looking at pictures, has some really cool architecture.
Wednesday 13th March
Arrived in Copenhagen Central (Kobenhavn H) in the afternoon and checked into our hotel — Axel Guldsmeden. After unpacking, we walked around Central to get our bearings and ate at Sticks N Sushi — Tivoli Haven.
Thursday 14th
Walked through the streets towards Nørreport, taking some photographs and stopping in Hay House. We had lunch in Mojoe Kitchen & Bar where I had salmon pasta. Visited Studio Arhoj and then got some 7/11 hotdogs which we brought back to the hotel. Bought passes to the spa.
Friday 15th
Got a 24-hour metro pass and went to the Palm House (Palmehuset) then the Danish National History Museum (Statens Naturhistoriske Museum) where they had the Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition on. Had a look around the church attached to the Round Tower (Rundetaarn), returned to Studio Arhoj to buy some ceramics. Metro to Sliders restaurant for some dinner, then spa.
Saturday 16th
Took a train to Helsingør to visit Kronborg Slot, more commonly known as Hamlet’s Castle or Helsingør Castle. Walked into town afterward and got a smørrebrød at a restaurant called №20. Returned to Central, got a takeaway from Tony’s Pizza, and ended up in the hotel spa again.
Sunday 17th
Busiest day by far. Went into the Rundetaarn and walked up to the top. Metro to Valby to see the Cisternerne in Søndermarken. Next, to Frederiks Kirke (Frederik’s Church). Walked towards the Amalienborg where there are several palaces near the waterfront. Walked along the water towards the Little Mermaid. Metro to Christianshavn to have a wander around Freetown Christiania, then walked back to the hotel via the Circle Bridge. Had a Chinese at Magasasa for dinner.
Monday 18th
Had a sleep in. Metro to Østerport to walk around Kastellet and see the windmill (Kastelsmøllen). Metro to Gammel Strand to see Christianborg Slot. Then walked to the Royal Library/ Black Diamond Library (Det Kongelige Bibliotek). Metro back to Central and returned to Sticks & Sushi for a big platter. And of course, spa.

Copenhagen, the Danish capital with a perfect mix of visual elements. Not only does it have a gorgeous composition filled with urban and green spaces, it also comes with an amazing blend of historical and modern landmarks, making it the perfect buffet for my camera to feast on.
The first stop is the city centre. The bustling heart of Copenhagen is filled with malls, restaurants, and attractions, acting like the arteries that circulate culture throughout the city. However, there are also quieter alleyways and secret shortcuts that invite further exploring. It is also surrounded by a few parks, allowing visitors to immerse themselves in nature and take a breather.

Throw an anxious woman into the bustling, crowded city of Copenhagen. A stupid idea destined for failure? Perhaps, but the cat-sitting job was too good to refuse…
Ask anybody about their top 10 destinations for a European city trip, and I bet Copenhagen will make the bucket list. It's not a surprise: Denmark’s capital is easy on the eyes and widely regarded as one of the most livable cities in the world. It offers a visual feast! From the Baltic Sea beaches and romantic channels to cobbled streets adorned with stunning architecture and a sense of supermodern design, Copenhagen inspires.
However, Copenhagen is also known for crowds of people. Hype a destination well enough, and you’ll create hyper tourism. Well...
It had been over ten years since my last trip to Copenhagen. Back then, I was young enough to find anything new “cool” and did not care about blowing half my monthly budget on a weekend trip. Happily, I pushed through crowds of people on the narrow sidewalks of Indre By, Copenhagen’s…

I grew up in and around of Copenhagen. So my relationship with the city is very dear. I adore the old buildings and the fact that this capital city is one among very few capital cities without a real skyline and super tall buildings.
For me that’s a beautiful way of caring for the legacy and the architecture of the city.
When that’s said there has over the years, like many other major cities been a lot of development and old buildings have gotten brand new neighbors. That’s not always a bad thing. Some times change is needed.
I’ve tried to find the beauty from both the old and the new.
When walking through Copenhagen you’ll quickly notice many historic and colorful buildings. But from time to time these buildings are often accompanied by some new development either close by or right next door.
Here are some of my favorite architecture in Copenhagen from the super old to the brand new.
Nyhavn, above, is one of the absolute most iconic and most visited places in Copenhagen. Famous for its colorful buildings along the channel. It’s always a joy to walk to Nyhavn on a grey winters day…

I love walking through an airport for the first time. A new country. New experiences waiting just beyond those exit doors. If I could only find them.
My wife loves this. Despite the many signs directing the way out, and the mass of people heading that way, I somehow, always believe I know better.
I’m learning.
It is the end of January 2022. The world is finally starting to put the pandemic to rest and we are about to spend the next month exploring Copenhagen and Denmark. We’re a little lucky with our timing, we’ll actually enter Denmark on the first day international travel restrictions from COVID would be fully removed.
We love traveling this time of year. In January 2019 we were in London, England. We would be back there and to Paris, France later that same year with our four teenage daughters. That’s a story for another time.
Being fortunate enough to make those trips I learned a little about myself along the way.

The cleanest, coolest, most peaceful city I’ve ever been! Yes, I can say that sincerely. Their life standard deserves to be enviable… The tales that I have grown up with cannot be attached anywhere else more! Dreamy city…
When we planned this trip, I had zero expectations for Copenhagen. However… The city changed my mind entirely about it and has a highlighted place on my ‘top’ list.
It was my first time in a North and Scandinavian country, so the weather was horrifying me. Surprisingly, the weather was sunny! We wandered around the city with a jacket…
After having a stressful ticket-buying process, we arrived at our first stop: Nyhavn! Iconic place… We couldn’t believe the safety of the city, the bikes were just standing there. Trust can be felt.
I can imagine the fishermen in a rush, children running along to the harbor, women waving their hands to their husbands and helping them in the 1800s.
We enjoyed the atmosphere, had a tasting test (sandwich biscuit with banana), took photos.
My friend and I like walking in random streets, exploring cities watching around and receiving surprises. So, we started to walk.
Frederik’s Church…
I don’t know why we hadn’t any picture of the church where we met with friendly, kind people… While we were exploring the city, we saw a church and wanted to enter. The door was closed and there was no one else outside. We tried to enter by using door handle. The door didn’t open, so we gave up and when we headed to exit, at that time the door just opened. An old man with a smiling face, kindly told us that we could enter. There was a hall which smelled like cinnamon and vanilla with a few old people (I guess it also had a cafe inside the building). After the hall, there was church venue. Still, I cannot forget the beautiful energy inside there.
Next: The Little Mermaid Statue.
While going to our target, we passed by a military area: Kastellet. There were many colorful 17th-century townhouses and when you look at there from the map, the area looks like star.
A park. Pretty neat, clean and felt like teletubbies were around.
Rosenborg Castle. Excellent garden, pretty roses. I admire the neat and clean image of the city.
We sat on the benches around the park, talked about many things with my friend, felt like sitting on a British university campus.
Rundetaarn.
I loved Denmark and Copenhagen. So livable city!
Overall
Copenhagen is extremely expensive for a student budget. I want to visit Copenhagen again with a rich budget and at that time I must go to The National Museum of Denmark, have a canal tour, stay in a hotel with a Nyhavn view, explore the city by cycling.
Regards, Ozlem.

Guide by Lisa Abend Introduction by Helen RussellPhotographs by Carol SachsIllustrations by Louise Rosenkrands
THERE WAS something different about the Danes, I noticed from the saddle of my Jetsons-­style city bike — complete with touchscreen — on my first visit to Copenhagen. The locals didn’t look like us, quite apart from the fact that they were all strapping individuals, towering above me. They looked more relaxed, and healthier. They walked more slowly. They took their time.
Having lived in London for 12 years, I relocated to Denmark when my husband was offered his dream job working for Lego, the iconic Danish toymaker. Denmark ranks among the happiest countries in the world in studies going back to the 1970s, so as a correspondent for the Guardian and an amateur anthropologist, I resolved to investigate the ­Danish happiness phenomenon firsthand, embarking on a year of “living Danishly” (I later published a book of the same name) to uncover the secrets of happy Danes. Copenhagen, regularly voted one of the world’s best cities, was top of the list for a pilgrimage.
Originally a Viking fishing hub, thanks to a natural harbor and an abundance of herring, Denmark’s understated capital has evolved into a cultural smorgasbord and an Instagrammer’s paradise. Only 29 percent of households in Copenhagen own a car, so the streets are picturesquely filled with stylish people on bikes.
Once in the saddle, I took in the colorful terraced houses of Nyhavn and the Little Mermaid statue before ending up in one of the city’s canal-side restaurants, dining on powdered mushrooms followed by peppered loin of venison. The pocket-size capital of just 583,000 people has enjoyed a culinary renaissance in recent years with the rise of New Nordic cuisine and its emphasis on simple ingredients, eating in micro seasons, and foraging.
And your average Dane actually has time to forage, as I discovered. They work far less than the rest of us, clocking in an average of 32.4 hours a week. This means they get to have a life, get on in life, and, crucially, make time for hygge — the guttural-sounding word used to describe Denmark’s national obsession with being cozy and relaxed. Candlelight is key, and fittingly, Danes burn the highest number of candles per head in the European Union.
While biking around town, I noticed a few babies sleeping outside cafés in prams, their parents lunching inside. I later learned that, according to one 2009 study, 79 percent of Danes trust “most people,” which is why they’re able to leave their kids outside without having a heart attack. And this calm, of course, makes Danes even happier: If you’re not anxious all the time, you’ve got the headspace to enjoy life more.
After just a few days in Copenhagen, I was a ­convert — and at the end of our year-long ­experiment, we decided to stay for good. But you don’t have to relocate to reap the benefits of living Danishly. Just a few days in the capital can act like a decompression chamber. Watching the sunset from a ­harborside bar, or strolling cobbled streets with no particular place to go, can imbue a feeling of calm so strong, you just might be able to bring the hygge back on the plane with you.
City Hall is the setting for scenes in Nordic noir favorite The Killing, and the bridge in, well, The Bridge is near the airport. The Necco-­wafer-colored facades of ­Nyhavn figure prominently in The Danish Girl, an Oscar-winning film about transgender pioneer Lili Elbe.
Set in Copenhagen and Greenland, Smilla’s Sense of Snow, by Peter Høeg, is both a gripping, atmospheric mystery and a pretty biting indictment of Denmark’s colonial past. The Almost Nearly Perfect People, by ­Michael Booth, is part humorous travelogue, part insightful cultural analysis, and amusingly expounds on the notion of hygge.
Stay near buzzy art galleries, gritty clubs, or somewhere quaint and quiet — choose your own adventure.
VESTERBRO: WHERE THE COOL KIDS HANG
Once — and, if we’re honest, still — the city’s red-light district, Vesterbro extends west from City Hall and includes the amusement park Tivoli Gardens. But thanks especially to the conversion of the old meat-packing area, it has also become hipster central, with craft breweries, small galleries, creative start-ups, and stylish restaurants galore.
ØSTERBRO: FOR THOSE WITH WEE ONES IN TOW
More upscale and sedate, this is where prosperous Copenhageners move when they start having kids. Streets here are a little broader, with fine apartment houses, tasteful shops, and a lot of embassies. On nice days, the lush Fælledparken fills with families (the park is also home to the national soccer ­stadium), as does the beach at Svanemolle.
NØRREBRO: WHERE THE ACTION IS
When the old demarcation line between city and country was eradicated in the mid-19th century, this neighborhood boomed with worker housing. Today, it’s the most culturally diverse and liveliest of the city’s districts. Home to ­Assistens cemetery (where Hans Christian Andersen is buried), it’s ­populated by tons of cafés, cocktail bars, and ethnic restaurants — including the (locally) famous ­Kebabistan.
CHRISTIANIA: WHERE THE HIPPIES ARE
A self-declared “free city” on the southern edge of the city center, Christiania began when hippies and other free spirits took over an abandoned military base in 1971 and began building homes there. (Alas, there are no Airbnbs in the neighborhood, but it’s still worth an afternoon.) Today, despite frequent police raids, it remains most famous for Pusher Street, where stalls (a lot of them run by gangs) openly sell pot and hash. But it’s also home to a thriving community, with schools, restaurants, theaters, and sometimes whimsical DIY homes and gardens.
A certain minimalist aesthetic and Denmark’s comparatively small gene pool can sometimes make it seem like the streets are filled with tall blond people looking effortlessly great as they cycle around in black jeans, black coats, and massive scarves. And while there is something to the cliché — the prevailing street vibe, according to fashion blogger Marie My, translates into “sneakers with everything, no matter if you’re wearing a feminine floral dress or mom jeans” — designers are embracing bold colors and looking beyond their ­borders. The population is diversifying, and “everyone is wearing everything!” says My.
ARMIN TEHRANI, art director
Tip: Always bring a light jacket with you, ­because the temperature will dip very quickly as soon as the sun sets!
My Outfit: This green jacket was my very first purchase when I moved to ­Copenhagen. It’s a very versatile piece for the summer and spring by Norse Projects.
LUISA ELVIRA TRAINA, creative consultant
Tip: Combine styles in an eclectic manner. If you’re wearing a super-fancy, sequined ­skintight dress, pair it with sneaks.
My Outfit: This is a piece from a collection I created with the Danish kids label Miniature. I decided the brand should create a few grown-up styles inspired by kidswear, and I always get girls stopping me on the street when I’m wearing it, asking me where it’s from.
Join the 41 percent — that’s how many locals bike each day. Mikael Colville-Andersen, founder and CEO of Copenhagenize Design Co., which advises cities on how to improve their cycling infrastructure, breaks down Danish biking basics.
1 / Dress for the destination.
In ­Copenhagen, cycling isn’t working out, and it isn’t recreation: It’s transportation. So wear whatever you would normally wear. You don’t dress specially to drive a car or sit on a bus!
2 / Learn by watching.
You can ride side by side with someone, but otherwise, stay to the right. And raise your hand when you’re about to stop — that’s unique to Copenhagen. And, you know, ride in a straight line.
3 / Wheels up!
There is no shortage of rental options, but the one I always recommend is Baisikeli, which collects used bikes in Denmark and sends them to Mozambique and Sierra Leone.
Where world-renowned local architect Bjarke Ingels sends visitors looking for design inspo.
1. Bagsværd Kirke: Danish architect Jørn Utzon’s church is inconspicuous from the outside, but inside the supremely peaceful space, the light is magical.
2. Eremitage ­castle: King Christian VI’s castle, where the entire dinner table was built like an elevator, to descend into the floor at will.
3. Vor Frelsers Kirke (Our Savior Church): A baroque church famous for its outdoor winding staircase that goes right up to the spire.
4. Rundetårn: King Christian IV built this observatory with ramps, so in the past you could ride a horse all the way up to the roof, should that have been of interest.
5. 8 house: An entire city block designed by Ingels such that people can stroll, run, or bicycle all the way from the street to the roofscape and down again.
Copenhagen’s hottest new neighborhood isn’t really a neighborhood at all. For most of its existence, Refshaleøen, an island on the south side of the city’s harbor, was populated by nothing more than shipping warehouses. But a stint as the home to the Eurovision Song Contest 2014 — as well as some much-loved local music festivals like Distortion — drew attention to the area. Now creative entrepreneurs are grabbing up the abandoned warehouses as fast as they can, turning this once industrial wasteland into the city’s newest destination for food, sports, and all kinds of fun.
1 / Amager Bakke: Leave it to Copenhagen to make a power plant a thing of, if not exactly beauty, at least good design. The smokestack-topped structure, which incinerates the city’s trash and turns it into energy, is also about to become a sports and fitness park, complete with a climbing gym up the side of the building.
2 / Amass: Ex-Noma chef Matt Orlando opened this ambitious, utterly unique restaurant in an old warehouse. On the plate, his cooking looks refined and innovative, but it’s based on a profound dedication to sustainability, from the garden out back where they grow many of their own vegetables to his imaginative use of ingredients others might discard.
3 / CopenHot: It’s got its own sauna, with a glass wall facing the harbor, but the real draw is the boats, each of which comes equipped with a water-­level Jacuzzi that seats five. Floating around the harbor in bubbling hot water on a cold day is one of Copenhagen’s unique pleasures — and an experience you’d be hard-pressed to find in many other cities.
4 / Mikkeller Baghaven: Cult brewer Mikkeller recently opened a brewery at New York’s Citi Field, but Baghaven acts as a reminder of its experimental roots. Here, new Master Blender Ehren Schmidt makes mostly sour beers from wild yeasts and ferments them in oak casks, producing delicious — and uniquely local — brews.
5 / La Banchina: Quite possibly the most pleasurable bar ever, La Banchina serves up food and drink from inside an old boathouse, but most take their glasses to the dock outside, to sip in between dips in the harbor. On a warm, sunny day, with women in bikinis all around, you’d think you were on the ­Mediterranean.
6 / Reffen: After losing its lease on Paper Island, Copenhagen Street Food has moved its much-loved food stalls to the edge of the city and is now ­bigger and better. In addition to stalls offering pulled-pork sandwiches, duck-fat fries, and the like, there are also performance spaces for creatives, plus co-working offices.
THE WORLD OF SMØRREBRØD
Danish open-faced sandwiches may look simple: Slap some stuff on bread and call it a day. But there is a complex, unspoken set of rules that govern not only when smørrebrød is eaten, but also how it’s made. Trine Hahnemann — the chef and author who literally wrote the book Open Sandwiches­­ — schools us on building the perfect æggemad, or egg on rye.
WHERE AND WHEN
It’s typically lunch food, so you’ll mostly find it in restaurants during the day. However, Hahnemann admits that one of her favorite dinners is to lay out bread, ­butter, and a collection of simple toppings and let everyone build their own.
GARNISH
Each piece should have at least three colors, so use herbs, flowers (here, chive) or vegetables. “It’s all about balance,” says Hahnemann.
TOPPINGS
The range of suitable toppings is wide, from tiny hand-peeled shrimp to liver paste to egg. But whichever you choose, include a mix of flavors and textures: “You want at least three of the five ­flavors — sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami — and to make sure that there’s creamy, crunchy, and soft.”
BUTTER
Smørrebrød literally means “buttered bread,” but Hahnemann says butter is negotiable: “I use it if it’s important for the flavor, or if the topping would soak the bread without it.” One thing is not up for discussion, however: “It must be salted.”
BREAD
Danes love rye bread with a passion others reserve for football teams or their childhood pet, and most smørrebrød will start with a slice of the dark stuff. “But there are exceptions,” says Hahnemann. Shrimp and salmon can be overpowered by rye; then use white.
Dad is famed Noma chef René, mom is cookbook author Nadine, and even the wee-est member has a perfect palate. Some must-eat recs for every age from the Redzepi clan.
Ro / age 4: My mom’s pasta with meat sauce. ­Because she makes it with pasta.
Genta / age 7: Ice cream from Dessertboden. Get the strawberry dipped in chocolate and dried raspberries on a stick.
Arwen / age 10: The dried fruits and shrimp at Noma. At first you think it’s just shrimp heads, and then you open it and you think it’s just the crispy chicken skin, and then you eat that and it’s the fruit and oil and raw shrimp.
Nadine / age 33: The schnitzel at Barr. They serve it with peas and horseradish cream, and you can add some caviar if you want. It’s the best I’ve ever had.
René / age 40: The dirty carnitas taco at Sánchez. That’s like medicine for me.
Grandma Bente / age 63: Arwen stole my answer! That’s the only dish that’s ever made me cry.
Natural wines, excellent dancing, and wee-hours-of-the-morning shawarma
5 P.M. Head to Queen ­Louise’s Bridge, where friends gather to drink and people-watch.
7 P.M. The city has one of the biggest natural-wine scenes in the world, and no shortage of wine bars specializing in the funky stuff. Check out Pompette, a new bare-bones space in Nørrebro with keenly knowledgeable staff.
9 P.M. Vega is one of the city’s great venues, drawing big names to its 1,500- p­erson-capacity main hall.
11 P.M. Try Balderdash for its cozy room and whimsical concoctions, or Atze Peng for an artisanal post-show experience.
12 A.M. Jolene is the city’s quintessential club, despite the fact it has no cover, no cocktails, and no design to speak of. Just beer and excellent dancing.
1:30 A.M. You basically have two choices for food: Kebabistan, its three outlets offering shawarma to the inebriated masses, or Barabba, a restaurant that serves inventive Italian food so excellent you’d find it delicious even if you were stone cold sober. (Note: Last order’s at 2 a.m. Thursday through Saturday.)
Søren Krogh Sørensen, beloved cult bartender and local cocktail visionary, shares his favorite places to drink.
Ved Stranden 10: There’s no menu — the staff just asks questions about your preferences and suggests a glass from that. The bar itself has beautiful interiors filled with Danish Modern furniture, and in the warmer months, the outdoor service area along the canal is one of my all-time favorites.
Himmeriget: It’s at the perfect level of super nerdy beers and service that still makes you feel comfortable. You can ask for beers that will challenge you or that are right in your comfort zone. They also have a nice collection of amaro and whiskeys.
Atze Peng: When it comes to cocktails, I like places that stand out a little, places you would only find if you were a local. This spot offers a small, very personal take on what cocktails in Copenhagen can be. You’ll also have a fantastic conversation with the bartender on what you’ll be served.
Ceramicist Inge Vincents likes to work, as she puts it, “at the edge of the functional.” From her studio on the happening Jægersborggade, she shapes clay into daily objects — vases, bowls, and candleholders — that are so thin as to be literally translucent. The results are delicate works that push the boundaries of Scandinavian design and whose beauty has made them a favorite on restaurant tabletops throughout the city.
Copenhagen is ground zero for the foraging movement, launched in its modern form when chef René Redzepi of Noma began searching for local ingredients that would help him define a distinctly Nordic cuisine. His team still goes out regularly to forage for plants and ants, but there’s no need to trek far to find the flavor of the city.
A vast nature preserve in the city, Amager Fælled, has a mix of wild varieties and domesticated plants from people’s gardens, since parts of the preserve are built on a dump. “Some of them are really weird,” says Mikkel-Lau Mikkelsen, director of Vild Mad, a program that promotes foraging. “But you also have the expected ones, like sea buckthorn.” The latter, among the most typical of Nordic ingredients, are juicy berries that grow on spiky shrubs. “Each berry has the same amount of vitamin C as a whole orange,” he says.
Once part of the old city fortifications, today Østre Anlæg is a lovely park, located right behind the National Gallery. In the fall, the fruit on its apple trees will be ripe, and because these too are a mix of wild and domesticated trees, you can never tell what sort of flavor and texture they’ll have. “I’ve tasted some that were like eating a cantaloupe,” says Mikkelsen. Just northwest of the city is a deciduous forest, Hareskoven, where, in fall, you can find field mushrooms and hazelnut trees just coming into fruit. And at the city beach Amager strand, there is plenty of beach mustard growing on rocks along the water. It has the exact same flavor as regular mustard but is very crisp and light, with a saltiness it gets from the sea air. “Like everything from the beach, it pairs well with seafood,” says Mikkelsen. Hook some fish, and you can have yourself a nice little meal.
Castles, culture, sunbathing, and famous falafel, just a short way away — we’re talking sometimes as short as a bike ride.
The imposing castle on a spit of land was supposedly the inspiration for Hamlet, and every August a Shakespeare festival, complete with performances by prominent international theater troupes, is held on its patio. Even without the Bard it’s a cool place to visit, with a museum, craft shops, and a coffee roastery inside the moat walls.
An impossibly adorable Danish village on the water, Dragør has narrow streets lined with red-tiled and thatch-roofed houses and neatly tended flower gardens. The center holds a handful of small galleries and charming restaurants. Note: Because it’s located just 13 kilometers from the center of Copenhagen, it makes for a great bike ride.
A posh, stately town up the coast that has become a bedroom community for the city, Humlebæk is home to the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, one of the best — and most idiosyncratic — modern and contemporary art museums in Europe. Just up the road, the farm stand at Krogerup Avlsgaard sells excellent produce, flowers, and cider.
Malmö may be a country away, but it’s also an easy 35-minute train ride from Copenhagen. (Note of interest: You get there by crossing the bridge in the television show The Bridge.) With the exception of Santiago Calatrava’s stunning Turning Torso building and its new food hall, there’s not much in the way of sites, but the vibe in its urban streets is distinct, and its falafel is rightly famous.

Copenhagen is doubtless a lovely and historic city. But it didn’t seem to inspire the happiness which Stockholm and Malmo (and Lund for that matter) did. Part of that will be down to tourism fatigue. After nine nights in Sweden there had been no break, no real rest time. I was hurting. My shins were feeling like I had shin splints and were being address by copious amounts of biofreeze to help them out.
Initial impressions help, and it was raining when we arrived, and when we went on our first little foray around the city. I think that kind of thing does tend to cloud your judgement a bit. It did feel as if we never really got into being there. And it was noticeably more expensive. The prices were the same as in Sweden, only with them being in Danish Krona and not Swedish Krona, the exchange rate is quite different, where it had been thirteen Swedish Krona to a pound it was less than nine Danish Krona to a pound.
But there was an early bonus, we had been given a room upgrade, and had lounge access, and ended up with free breakfast. Our room was on the nineteenth floor and there were good views out over to the airport and countryside.
At that height, none of the windows in the rooms open, but then on the fire escape stairwell, the windows only go halfway up, and the top half is open to the elements. I didn’t go near that; it was dizzying enough through the fully secure and in place window in the room.
There is a lot to see in Copenhagen. The hop on, hop off bus tour was acquired and used. There isn’t just the one loop, they have three different loops. Which we did back to back to back, which is a lot of continuous bus time. And a lot to take in.
A lot to see indeed. Old, new, and more palaces than you could shake any number of sticks at.
And it left us trying to work out what we would get around to looking at in more detail later. We did also get around to doing a boat tour. Which was probably the best one we’ve been on. There is a lot of history all around what would have been the port.
Nowadays the water has been cleaned out. Commercial traffic stops long before the centre of the city and the water there is clean enough that they have twenty-odd designated swimming areas in it. And going past one of these on the boat there were teenagers dive bombing in to try and splash the passengers on the boat.
We have been back at home for a few weeks now as I try and cobble this piece together, such has been the lack of writing motivation, and now a lot of the things we did and saw have blended into one. The order we did things is all over the place as well.
There was a lot of walking around the outside of historic buildings. Mainly because the city likes to try and gouge as much money as possible out of the tourists it attracts. One of the palace complexes, which now houses the Danish parliament, had numerous different buildings to it. They all charged to get into each one of them separately, and none of them were cheap.
We did go inside the grand church of Frederiks Kirke, or The Marble Church as it is colloquially known.
It is an impressive building and nice and cool inside on the only really hot day there was when we were in Copenhagen. But it was busy, and we didn’t want to draw attention to ourselves by doing the clap and echo test there.
We did also go up the spire of Vor Frelsers Kirke.
There are a lot of steps up to the base of the unique corkscrew spire, all of them inside, and no sense of hoe high up you were. To then come out on a level where we were granted spectacular views across the city.
And the chance to head up the spiral of the twisted tower which gets narrower as you reach the top. So narrow, my fat ass couldn’t get into the very top bit. And I gave myself proper vertigo fear trying to turn around in the tight space to come back down and be partly hanging over the barrier even higher up than before. I just about managed to make it down the twist and back inside without bursting into tears or hyperventilating.
That afternoon we also had some food over in the part of the city known as Freetown Christiania. Where they try and live outside of the governance of the city, and which was the home to dope central for a long time.
There were no shortage of amusing (to my childish mind anyway) signs to see.
And there was the Bastard Café. We went in and found it is quite possibly the biggest board game bar anywhere in the world. Every wall has floor to ceiling shelving all crammed full of different board games.
They say there are nearly six thousand in total. The bar was full of people playing different games on every table.
Nyhaven is worth a look and one of the main attractions. And so says nearly every other tourist there. It was one of the few places where trying to see, let alone get a photograph of was difficult. Instagrammers of the world — fuck off.
Barging in front of you, not caring if they get in your shot, and then hogging the site for twenty minutes. I resisted the temptation to ‘accidentally’ bump any of them into the Nyhaven which has no railings next to the water. I was more tempted to push a twunt with a selfie stick and no self-awareness into a fountain by the Amalienborg palaces. He was getting in everyone else’s shots, looking quite deliberate about it, and then spending ages taking and retaking the same gormless selfies. Even his wife was getting pissed off with him.
It was petty payback later when we were at Tivoli Gardens and he was doing the same thing, and we would casually wander into his shots, but with our back to him.
We did spend a while in Tivoli Gardens, probably the most famous of all Copenhagen’s attractions. Arriving in the afternoon, we had a wander around the park, and then had dinner, and wandered around it again. To me it does seem to be a bit of a case of hype over substance. We did go on the world’s oldest big wheel, which isn’t that big by modern standards, so much so it was difficult to find it hidden away between buildings. But it still went up far enough to give me the heebie jeebies.
I feel as if Tivoli might be better at other times of the year. It is midsummer and there isn’t much night and darkness and so even with the lights coming on it doesn’t stand out in the near night. But it probably looks wonderful when it is properly dark.
The Monday must have been cruise ship day as everywhere was rammed and it felt a bit overwhelming, but a couple of days later and a wander only a street away from the main shopping strip in the Latin Quarter, it felt so much more relaxed. More restful, less stressful.
And we passed churches, university buildings, and little squares.
I took a lot of photos which I haven’t really looked through properly yet, but when trying to find a prompt for a writing group I found I had taken a lot of pictures of doorways.
Lots of very impressive and interesting doorways. I didn’t realise I was doing it. but having a flick through the photos from other places we have visited I find that I have been doing this everywhere we’ve been to. A secret (even to me until now) doorway fetish.
On the day we were coming back home it was raining and the forecast was for it to be doing so all day. So we just went along to the shopping centre near the hotel. We were a few miles outside of the centre of the city in an area called Orestad. In the shopping centre they had a display about the area. When they build new areas in Scandinavia, they do it with a view to how it will be to live there, rather than just throw some random buildings up and hope for the best. The transport links are sorted, and it is cheap to get in and out of the city on public transport. There are wide cycle lanes on both sides of the road, and wider pavements set back. And being a bit further out there were nature reserves within the gaps between buildings, and something like twelve different country walks advertised in the area. Everywhere is so clean. It is interesting to see just how well other countries build compared to the shit show we have in the UK.
And then it was that time. The cases are packed, and the sun has come out to see us off, two stops on the train to the airport, duty free shopping and the flight back to Gatwick just in time to vote.
All in all a decent holiday. Perhaps we were trying to cram too much in doing three cities where there feels like a need to be going and seeing things and doing stuff every day, and so there is no rest. Something to bear in mind for next time.

I boarded my flight to Copenhagen with a sense of excitement that, interestingly, kept growing on me. I spent three weeks in the land of rye bread last March 2025. The weeks flew by in a flash — and just like that, a month has passed since that trip.
I have kept myself busy, but the thought of writing about my time in Denmark has always lingered at the back of my mind. It took me a while to finally sit down and write — not because I was insanely busy (well, maybe just a little?) — but mainly because I found it hard to condense everything into a neat 2,000-word piece. What should I write about? What style should I use? How deep should I go? The endless choices to be made left me feeling paralysed.
But hey, here I am — itching to write. So forget about the perfect structure; let’s just dive in!
If there was a common thread running through my trip, it was the question I kept circling back to: “Why, how, and what makes Denmark… Denmark?” A country that consistently ranks among the highest in quality of life. A place where sustainability is not just a buzzword but a way of life. And for cyclists? A heaven.
I went to Denmark for a short course on Responsive Project Management, funded by the Danida Fellowship Center— (no, this is not a sponsored post 😉). I thought I would spend my time learning frameworks and management tools. Instead, I found myself on a much deeper journey: exploring the slow, steady story of a nation shaped over centuries, not built overnight with a snap of the fingers.
Let me start with this — it might sound overly simple. I would not pretend that three weeks in Denmark and a month of reflection could reveal the full answer to how a country develops. But I am trying to make sense of my experience.
If I had to point to one reason why everything seems to work in Denmark, from public transport to waste management, from bicycle lanes to water drinking system, it would be trust. Yes, just five letters: T.R.U.S.T.
The system is built on a foundation of trust. Danes trust their government to distribute welfare fairly and effectively, which is why high tax rates are widely accepted without major protest. The government trusts its citizens to act in the best interest of the common good, which is why penalties for non-compliance are often minimal. It is a mutual understanding that holds the whole system together.
I was mind-blown when I found out that the metro in Copenhagen runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, without fail. I could not think of any other country where public transport operates nonstop like that. It felt like such a powerful service offered to citizens for the benefit of the common good. I doubt running the metro at 3 a.m. adds much to the company’s bottom line — but then again, is not that the true role of public services? To serve the public interest, not just capital.
When it comes to building a bicycle culture in their journey toward becoming a net-zero city, Copenhagen does not stop at simply painting bike lanes on the streets. They walk the talk. They created special carriages for bicycles on trains. They installed bicycle lanes along station stairs to make it easier for cyclists to travel longer distances. Their city planning includes an extensive network of cycle superhighways designed to prioritise cyclist. When they say they want to make cycling a primary mode of transportation, they actually focus on building a comprehensive, interconnected infrastructure — not just making empty promises.
On the other hand, I noticed that trains in Copenhagen are often covered in graffiti that clearly did not look like part of the official design. At first, I wondered — how could such a disciplined country allow vandalism? So, I asked a few locals what they thought about the graffiti on public spaces and why the government seemed to do nothing about it. Their response was casual: “Yeah, some people do that, but it is not really a big deal.” And in that moment, it clicked for me: the government trusts that not enough people will behave in a way that disrupts public services. Rather than wasting time and resources chasing down every minor act of vandalism, they choose to focus on bigger, more important priorities.
Cities in Denmark are built for living. You can tell that urban planners truly had the users in mind when designing the city. This becomes obvious in small but meaningful ways — like how supermarkets are always within walking distance from residential areas, or how close train stations are to apartment complexes. I had almost forgotten how fun it is to stroll aimlessly around a supermarket after a long day of work. It was delightful — yes, I loved it. I have never enjoyed online shopping (call me old-fashioned), but there is something uniquely satisfying about wandering through aisles with no intention of buying anything. It feels healthier than scrolling through my phone, and it offers a spontaneous break after eight hours of structured, planned work.
And what is more user-centric than thoughtful city planning? Maybe a door that swings just the right way. At the building where I took my short course, there were several swing doors. Uniquely, the two sides of each door swung in different directions: the right side swung away from you, while the left side swung toward you. Why? Because in Denmark, people naturally walk on the right side of the lane.
How could you not trust a company that pays such close attention to even the smallest details — like how a door swings — for the comfort of its users?
If you are wondering whether I would write about Denmark’s waste management system — you guessed it right. I simply cannot visit a new country without peeking into a few trash bins and wandering through recycling centers.
Denmark’s system is impressive but not perfect. Around 53.9% of waste is collected for recycling and less than 1% ends up in landfill, but about 45.2% of waste is still incinerated.
Some of the waste workers I met during field visits shared differing views. A few doubted that the EPR system could truly work, while others argued that waste-to-energy is the most viable circular solution — since no material can be recycled indefinitely. I agree to a certain extent: we cannot recycle our way out of the mess we have created. So the point? It is not the perfect world I initially imagined. Sustainability is still a work in progress. Not all Danes are passionate about recycling. Not all Danes love rye bread either… okay, maybe I was wrong about the rye bread.
But it is not all gloom — there were definitely more bright stories (as you expected duh).
I visited one recycling center on the outskirts of Copenhagen. The center is designed for self-service drop-offs: no securities, no checkpoints. People just walk or drive in with their waste. For households, it is free (already covered in their waste retribution fees); businesses pay per visit. Surprisingly, there is no staff at the entrance — only a few CCTVs that capture license plates and automatically register and bill accordingly.
Of course, I asked, “What if a business owner uses their private car to dump waste instead?” The manager replied with the same mindset I had heard before: “It does not happen that much. Not enough people cheat the system.”
My next question was, “How do you ensure there is no contamination across the 20 different recyclable categories?” He then said, “If someone makes a mistake, we let them know and ask them not to repeat it.”
“And if they keep doing it?” I probed further. “We do nothing. Maybe less than 5% of people are stubborn. We can tolerate that.”
Another mind-blown moment: trust, again, is a powerful behaviour change enabler. The system trusts that most people will do the right thing, so they focus their resources on helping, not policing.
And that trust is matched by thoughtful system design. Containers are placed underground — essentially large holes — making it easier to dispose of waste properly. New waste categories were introduced slowly over decades to avoid overwhelming households (for example, food waste sorting was only introduced in 2021).
And their waste retribution fees? Completely transparent. The fees are calculated based on the total costs of collection, transportation, incineration, and recycling, minus the revenue earned from selling recyclables. The final cost is divided equally among all households. It is a dynamic system: if households sort better and recycling value increases, fees can go down.
Importantly, this fee is separate from taxes. The philosophy is simple: waste will always exist, regardless of national politics or budget priorities. Waste management should be funded based directly on the real cost of handling waste, not influenced by unrelated government spending.
On my final day in Copenhagen, I had the chance to visit one of the city’s incinerator plants. Surprisingly or not surprisingly, the massive facility was managed by just 4–5 people at a time — only two in the control room monitoring the indicators, and another two on standby for any needed repairs. As I walked around, I barely saw a soul; only the heat humming, doing their work. The chimney was stabbed with dozens of measuring instruments, all working overtime to ensure the final smokes were clean, pure white, and non-toxic.
During the visit, the plant manager casually mentioned a surprising challenge: it is getting harder to find enough waste to burn. Denmark’s rising recycling rate means less and less waste is arriving at incinerators, even though the plant must operate 24/7 to remain efficient.
What an irony, I thought — succeeding too well at recycling is now creating a new challenge.
“How do we build trust in the first place?” I wonder about that a lot. One thing I am sure of — it does not happen overnight. In one of the classes I attended, the instructor shared this formula:
Credibility is about your words — do people believe you know what you’re talking about? Reliability is about your actions — do you do what you say you will do? Intimacy is about safety — do people feel comfortable being honest with you? And finally, self-orientation is about intent — are you in it for others, or just for yourself? The lower your self-orientation, the stronger the trust you can build.
Trust is not just about being good at what you do — it is about showing up with integrity and empathy, consistently, over time.”
Trust is built through reputation. It is built through history. In one introduction to Danish culture, I learned, “Danes generally support their monarchy due to a mix of tradition, national unity, and the royal family’s approachable, down-to-earth demeanour. The royals are actively engaged in public life, which makes them relatable.”
That trust was not built overnight — it has been earned over time, layer by layer, until it became a strong and lasting foundation.
I could go on — there were so many things that fascinated me, from Denmark’s pork industry to the sight of babies left napping in their strollers outside restaurants (yes, you read that right — alone without adult supervision). But I guess I should stop here. I had a truly enjoyable time in Denmark. Oh also, I met wonderful friends, got a little drunk dancing to Swedish music, and played international ping-pong matches with friends from three different continents. Now, it is time to get back to the grind in Jakarta — hopefully, with a little more clarity and trust in the process.

Today wraps my last day in Copenhagen, Denmark — the first leg of the scandinavian holiday that I’m taking while on sabbatical. Copenhagen has been amazing, it’s a complete contrast of what I was expecting with lots of wide open spaces instead of the usual spaghetti of roads that european capitals have.
We flew out on the 4th of November from Heathrow and on landing the vibe of the country was evident when the passport officer had a cheerful chat with us about our travel plans instead of a stern grilling.
The train from the airport to the city centre where we were staying was fast and really spacious. Compared to the LNER train that we took to London from Leeds to get to the airport in the UK the train was taller and while just as wide it was laid out so that there was more space for bikes and disabled seating.
Walking to the hotel we encountered some issues, the pavements are laid out in a way that there’s two lanes of smooth pavement split up with cobblestones. These cobblestones are terrible for suitcases so we had to find ways to avoid these while walking through the Friday night crowds.
We also got told off for wearing our facemasks in public, it turns out that no-one in Copenhagen wears them which as someone who is very conscious of coronavirus and how that could up-end our holiday plans feels like a lot of risk for us to be taking just to fit into the social norms.
On Saturday, the first full day we had we visited Ørstedsparken and Kongens Have, two very nice parks full of statues that looked amazing as the leaves changed colour.
Near those two parks is the Botanical Gardens which was closed by the time we got there on the Saturday so we went back on Sunday and visited the Natural History Museum also. As part of the Museum ticket was entry to the Palm House in the Botanical Gardens so we went back for that.
On the Monday we visited a shared office space that a colleague was working from which was in the old meat packing area of Copenhagen. The area really reminded me of Clerkenwell in London with loads of large buildings repurposed into unique shops and offices.
We had looked to visit Tivoli Gardens on the Monday after the office visit but when we got to the gate we found out that the park is closed for weeks as the seasons change. When we arrived it was halloween season but on the Sunday it closed to change to the christmas season and wouldn’t reopen until after we had left Denmark.
On Tuesday we walked to Copenhagen Zoo which while a bit of a walk from our hotel was worth the effort as not only did we get to have a fun time there but we discovered a number of small shops to revisit and a park too. The zoo itself was amazing, with really nice enclosures for the animals and even enclosures where the animals roamed freely around you.
On Wednesday we had a bus and canal tour booked so we jumped aboard to learn about the history of Copenhagen, learning that a fair amount of that history involves Britain invading or blowing things up. This was something that I never got taught about in school so was interesting to know.
While the history aspect was interesting some of the sights from the boat weren’t as good, for instance someone on the internet said that there’d be a good view of the Little Mermaid statue from the boat but the view was awful.
Thursday was an early start to do some laundry and a walk over to Søndermarken near the Zoo and then over to Fisktorvet near the meat packing area. This involved a fair amount of walking but was a nice trip around town.
And finally today (Friday) was a trip over to the Little Mermaid to get a better picture and a walk around the Kastellet before walking over to the National Gallery. We then did some souvenir shopping and headed back to the hotel to pack, ready for the next leg of the trip — Sweden.

This isn’t one of those annoying headlines that gets flipped on its arse and actually ends up telling you how incredibly amazing Copenhagen is. Nope — this article is an honest account of why Copenhagen is utterly shite.
How did I end up somewhere so awful? I fell victim to various accounts from various friends, all of whom painted Copenhagen as a real ‘must see’. Someone even told me it’s their favourite city in Europe. Oh dear.
I’d also read that the Danes are some of the happiest folk on the planet. Guess what? It turned out to be fake news. We figured this out fairly quickly for ourselves — on the train from the airport, actually, when we got told off by none other than a teenager for daring to whisper in the quiet carriage. We also got a finger wagging for unwittingly leaning against the walls of the palace — fair play there I suppose — although in our defence it didn’t look like a palace…at all.
So, 6 reasons Copenhagen sucks balls:
1. It’s dreary as hell
Actually, hell would be a lot less dreary. At least all that fire would give it some colour — something Copenhagen is noticeably devoid of. The buildings are bleak, lacklustre and remarkably uninspired. With the exception of Nyhavn and Frederik’s Church in Amalienborg, there’s really nothing that catches the eye.
2. It’s SO expensive
A small bottle of water is close to £2 and a pint can set you back as much as £8. One evening, we paid £70 for 2 pizzas, two beers, a glass of wine and a bottle of water. Oh, and the pizzas were shit. AND we had to collect them from the counter ourselves when our crappy plastic buzzer started going berserk. I’m pretty sure you have to pay for tap water too. Not cool.
3. The weather is depressing
Admittedly, winter may not have been the best time to visit Northern Europe. But it’s sure put me off ever going again.
4. It’s pretty boring
The one attraction Copenhagen is known for — the Little Mermaid statue — can be better described as a dwarf-sized non-attraction. The airport has a replica anyway which saves you a disappointing trip, not to mention the huge queue of tourists lining up to take an underwhelming selfie. The only mildly interesting thing about it is that it gets decapitated every couple of years, undoubtedly by bored Danish teenagers.
5. There’s shit in the streets
Horse shit, mind. But shit nonetheless.
6. Christiania is a shithole
I imagined Christiania as a hippy haven and a street art photographer’s dream. How wrong I was. The ‘freetown’ is a total dump full of shifty characters in dire need of a bath and a haircut. Taking photos is also forbidden, which turned out not to be such a problem after all. Verdict: don’t waste your time.
It has a spiral ramp you can run down if you’re feeling energetic, and the roof offers panoramic views of Copenhagen’s splendour. Don’t all rush at once.
2. Frederik’s Church
It has a very impressive dome. And it’s a great place for a nap.
3. The coins
They have holes in, like the donuts you can’t afford.
4. Church of our Saviour
A lovely baroque church with some cool relics and a helix spire with an external winding staircase. 400 steps, 90 metres above street level — it’s probably the only time you’ll have an adrenaline rush in Copenhagen.
5. The Aquarium
Cool building, interesting marine species and, best of all, out of town.
6. The Copenhagen Card
Heads up: they rarely check the expiry date. Hello free attractions for 72 hours instead of the 48 we paid for, plus a free ride to the airport. Having said that, I would’ve happily paid good money to journey back to the airport and get the hell out of dodge.
Have you been to Copenhagen? Did you hate it as much as I did or am I missing something?

Here are a few of my thoughts on the city and the people:
As you walk around the city you start to realise that there are very few overweight people. Everyone seems healthy and happy and beautiful.
Then you also start to realise that there aren’t many fast-food outlets. And that people are riding bikes everywhere. I wonder if there’s any correlation…?
Hygge is a Danish word that’s defined as ‘…a quality of cosiness and comfortable conviviality that engenders a feeling of contentment or well-being (regarded as a defining characteristic of Danish culture).’
As well as being beautiful on the outside, Danish people seem to exude an inner peace and light. You can see it on their faces as they walk or cycle by; their faces look tranquil, content, at peace, full of self-confidence.

This 2nd blogpost of the series marks the next milestone in the collaboration between Dark Matter Labs and the Institute of Human Rights and Business (IHRB), to increase transparency regarding the largest urban landowners in four European cities (see: Blog 1 explaining the project purpose). This study mapped land ownership in Copenhagen (as of August, 2023) aiming to reveal the largest land owners, patterns in management of land, and resulting power dynamics in city space production.
Through these findings, we also suggest initial ways forward with regards to city space production and ownership transparency. We would love to hear your views.
Transparency is a cross-cutting human rights principle, which helps to strengthen decision-making to enable better outcomes for people. IHRB is partnering with Dark Matter Labs to identify the largest owners of urban land in four European cities, as part of its project Building for Today and the Future. This recognizes that knowledge of who owns space within a city is one important step (in tandem with many others) to strengthen decision-making, as well as social and environmental outcomes.
Copenhagen is known for its high quality of living, deeply rooted culture of public welfare and participation, resistance to speculative foreign investments as well as rich urban planning and architectural scene: it is often held up as an example of equitable space production and a “liveable” city. However, in the recent decades, the dismantling and restructuring of the Danish Welfare State and private-led urban development patterns have contributed to Copenhagen’s high levels of unaffordability, as well as spatial disparity and discrimination. Across Danish cities, the housing cost overburden (reflecting housing cost as a share in disposable income) is the second highest in Europe (see also the Right to Dwell — Un-liveability Trends, KADK 2018).
Housing in Europe: Housing cost overburden: cities or rural area - Compare your countryec.europa.eu
→ Data transparency and accessibility in Copenhagen set an example for other cities, as this information is relatively easy to access. However, from our research it is clear that, in contexts such as this, the understanding of the wider city political dynamics, institutional changes, and local actors’ strategic moves are as important, if not more, than the static accessible ownership data registers.
One might therefore want to call for an additional set of tools to increase the transparency and accountability for decision-making. Tools which unlock greater insights into areas such as:
As this might sound complex… the data, at least for Copenhagen, is largely there.
Accessibility to static datasets (or map interfaces — as the Little Mermaid fortunately resting on the municipal soil) sets a good ground for basic analysis of who owns what, which is still an impossible task in most cities.
However, extending the sensing infrastructures (civic and public) might render a possibility of updating the predominantly debt-driven land-value capture model → (see: OECD, 2022 & Cities for Free) to better serve the greater public and environmental good in the long-term.
1. The ten largest owners of land in Copenhagen, which include the municipality, City & Port Corporation (By & Havn I/S), and the public housing corporation FSB.
2. Three case studies, diving into the areas of Nordhavn, Lynetteholmen and Tingbjerg:
I. Municipal land
— land management with land-value capture model.
II. New land
— mega projects
C2. Lynetteholmen — New Municipal Land, Mega Projects & Potentials for City-Region Coordination Capacity: the planned mega project of Lynetteholmen (a 280-hectare, artificial island development ) points to city region coordination issues and the logic behind future city development pathways.
III. Non-profit land
— Commodification of non-profit land and housing
C3. Tingbjerg — Non-profit Land, Socio-economic Indicators & Fight for Space in a social housing area, pointing to approaches to vulnerable neighbourhoods in Denmark.
Concluding reflections
Methodology
1. Københavns Kommune — Copenhagen Municipality (KK)
2. By & Havn I/S — (City and Port Corporation — owned 95% by KK, 5% by the Danish State)
3. Den Danske Stat — Danish State
4. Banedanmark — Danish Railway
5. Bygningsstyrelsen — Danish Building & Property Agency
6. A/S Øresundsforbindelsen — owning land around the Øresund bridge and highways
7. Fsb — The largest public housing organization
8. Forsvaret og Forsvarsministeriets styrelser — The Ministry of Defence
9. Boligforeningen AAB — social housing organization
10. Samvirkende Boligselskaber (SAB) — Cooperative Housing Societies
Based on the case studies, examples of the most powerful land owning actors — defined as “needed in the room” to engage in an impactful discussion about shifting modes of Copenhagen’s development — include:
Note: further landowners can be easily identified based on available data sets.
In Dark Matter Labs, we often aim to design portfolios of strategic interventions as well as institutional capacities for democratization of common resources or civic & environmental good. Analogously, yet in contrast, in collaboration with IHRB, we looked at the set of policies, interventions & approaches that have defined urban land management in Copenhagen. Through this approach we can point towards a set of missing institutional and civic capacities required to update the way city space is produced in Copenhagen.
The purpose was not merely to complain or point fingers but to point towards a set of missing institutional and civic capacities necessary to update the way city space of Copenhagen is produced.
Nordhavn — the upscale neighbourhood in the northern part of the city is a flagship project of the City & Port corporation.
To further understand the reasons behind the push for developments described by many as risky, environmentally, and socially questionable one needs to zoom out and look at the Copenhagen Metropolitan Area as a whole, which includes 34 municipalities.
The famous Finger Plan once aimed to ensure the ecological diversity and functionality of the landscape by incorporated green belts with green wedges for recreational and environmental purposes, as well as a strategy for metropolitan expansion along 5 fingers in multiple municipalities. T he plan has been recognized as one of Europe’s best examples of far-sighted and long-term sustainable urban planning.
In 2015, the responsibility for the FP was handed over from the Ministry of Environment to the Ministry of Industry, Business and Financial Affairs, indicating economic growth as the main function of spatial planning . Apart from the city population growth and political pressures rooted in economic agendas, the green wedges and the structure of the Finger Plan have been challenged by the administrative division of power and interests of the neighbouring municipalities.
An emblematic example of the regional competition, rather than coordination in the Copenhagen Region can be another island development — Avedøre Holme, promoted by the Hvidovre Municipality, as Europe’s largest business district.
Some of the key reflections include:
Finally, several complex questions which require further consideration came out of this initial investigation:
In addition to relatively transparent ownership & transaction databases:
Responding to findings around Almene boliger / Tingbjerg
Reflecting on the dominance of land value capture logic
Some ways forward to explore — context specific (broked down above)
Further, basing on DML, UNDP collaboration “A way Forward”:
The data gathering, analysis and mapping was performed and revealed owners of all plots larger than 2,000 sqm. It was conducted through a combination of methods including data requests from Datafordeler, and sourcing data OIS, BBR and Dawa API. The data was analysed and visualized in GIS and Tableau.
The transparency and accessibility of ownership data can set an example for many cities around the world.

A compact capital with more bikes than cars, Copenhagen is a lively, modern city perfect for weekend getaways.
Copenhagen is also considered one of the world’s happiest cities, boasting plenty of green space, cool museums, and a rambunctious nightlife. Famed for its cyclist-friendly streets, there’s not only more bikes than cars here, there’s actually more bikes than people!
I’ve been visiting the city on and off for over 16 years and always have a blast. The quality of life here is virtually unrivaled. And while the city is expensive, it’s definitely possible to visit without breaking the bank.
To help you plan your trip, here’s my list of the best hotels in Copenhagen:
This three-star hotel is situated right on the canal in the center of Indre By, the most picturesque area of town. The hotel comprises three historic buildings, with large and spacious rooms that are clean and comfortable. The décor is modern, though a little dated, and generally quite minimalist (don’t expect much art or color). The carpeted rooms include a flatscreen TV, a desk, wardrobe, and free Wi-Fi. There’s no coffee/tea maker in the room, but I appreciate that the lounge has free coffee and tea 24/7. The breakfast, while not included, is filling and has a lot of variety, though it’s mostly cold foods like pastries, cold cuts, and cereal. The bathrooms are a bit small, but they are clean and the showers have great water pressure.
While there’s no gym or other facilities on site, the hotel has larger rooms perfect for families or groups. And you really can’t beat the location. It’s an affordable, central, no-frills choice.
Book here!
Part of the former Carlsberg brewery, Otilia is a four-star property that has won several architecture awards for its transformation into a hotel. Located in Vesterbro, an area known for its excellent eateries and third-wave coffee shops, the standard rooms here are stylish but minimal, emphasizing contrasting light and dark tones. Rooms feature Wi-Fi, flatscreen TVs with Netflix, coffee/tea markers, and cozy chairs. If you’re on a budget and traveling solo, they have smaller rooms available too. The bathrooms have chic dark tile and include complimentary toiletries. I love that the bathroom floors are heated, so you stay nice and warm even in the winter. The shower pressure is great too, though just be aware that some rooms have open bathroom designs so privacy is limited.
Breakfast is filling and I especially like that it’s 100% organic. It’s served on the top floor so you can take in the view as you enjoy the fresh spread. Another nice touch is the daily happy hour with complimentary wine.
Book here!
This three-star hotel is just a short walk from the Central Station and the Tivoli Gardens amusement park. Located in trendy Vesterbro, the rooms here are compact but functional, with a cozy Danish-inspired design featuring taupe and sage-green walls along with hardwood or parquet floors. The simple rooms feature a flatscreen TV, a small desk, clothes rack, and free Wi-Fi. The bathrooms are also quite small, but the showers have decent water pressure. A tasty organic breakfast of fresh bread, fruit, and pastries is offered each morning too.
There’s also a chic lobby bar and a rooftop terrace to hang out on, complete with a bar and a sauna (you have to book and pay to use it though). The hotel was completely renovated in 2024 and is clean, comfortable, and perfect for budget travelers.
Book here!
This four-star hotel located in Nyhavn is in a historic transformer station, so the entire place has a chic industrial style. The lobby is especially striking; it’s over two stories high and features a huge 3D-printed sculpture. I like that there’s a cool cocktail bar here too.
The large rooms feature minimal décor and have big windows that let in a lot of natural light. Rooms include soft beds, air conditioning, a Bose sound system, a flatscreen TV, comfy armchairs, a minibar, kettle, and free Wi-Fi. The marble bathrooms are bright and roomy, with complimentary eco-friendly toiletries and excellent water pressure. The breakfast each morning has lots of options (including veg options), and can be ordered as a buffet, a la carte, or continental. There’s no gym or spa on-site, but with its central location, you can pretty much walk to all the main sights from here. It’s a stylish, central choice.
Book here!
Located in the diverse Nørrebro neighborhood, this three-star hotel sits in an ornate 19th-century building. The rooms here are airy and bright and let in a lot of natural light. The décor is minimalist, but the rooms feature bright carpet that really makes the space pop. Amenities include a flatscreen TV, work desk, minifridge, coffee/tea maker, and free Wi-Fi. The bathrooms are a little dated, but they have good water pressure and complimentary toiletries.
A fresh Danish breakfast is available each morning, and you can choose what you’d like to eat in advance (you order the night beforehand). I especially like that you get a bottle of water and a beer when you check in. There’s even a small rooftop terrace where you can hang out and enjoy the view over the city.
Book here!
If you really want to splash out, this five-star hotel is located in Copenhagen’s old Latin Quarter, just minutes away from the main shopping street. The stylish rooms are large and invite in a lot of natural light. They feature darker tones and lots of dark blue, which contrasts nicely with the wooden furniture and minimal artwork. The beds are big and comfy, and rooms include a flatscreen TV, desk, minibar, coffee/tea maker, and parquet or hardwood floors. The large bathrooms are bright and boast complimentary toiletries and plush bathrobes.
There’s a bar in the expansive lobby (the hotel even crafts its own gin), a fitness center on-site, and parking is available for anyone traveling with a car. The breakfast is especially tasty, with fresh waffles, eggs, pastries, fruit, granola, and more. If you want to splurge, stay here.
Book here!

Fermion Physics
The Copenhagen interpretation is one of the most popular interpretations of quantum mechanics, and it is the orthodoxy in physics. It is usually related to all the weird things about quantum mechanics you may have heard, like Schrodinger’s Cat. But what if I told you that the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics — is wrong? Here’s why
Before I write the rest of this article, I want to say that my beliefs here are not the orthodoxy in the physics world — most physicists believe the copenhagen interpretation and most of the rest don’t care. I’m not claiming to have made some new discovery. What I’m doing here is providing an argument against the Copenhagen interpretation. I’m not saying it is a complete fabrication. But what must be kept in mind is that most physicists believe the copenhagen interpretation simply because that is what is usually taught in universities. Many don’t really care to look for actual justifications or an alternative explanation. A majority of physicists agreeing does not make them correct, and it also does not make them wrong. Even though the measurement problem is not a settled issue, the arguments I present here will be as objective as possible and as reasonable as possible. If you disagree with any of my arguments, great! Tell me why I’m wrong in the comments. With all that said, let’s begin.
It would be great to start out by defining the copenhagen interpretation. The Copenhagen interpretation turns out to not be well defined, and there is many disagreement between self identified proponents, but the copenhagen interpretation could be summed up as
These are the postulates of the Copenhagen interpretation.
The way the copenhagen interpretation is formulated is already problematic. It does not define what a measurement is, it does not talk about the eigenvalue of a system before a measurement, and it does not say why the wave function is related to the probability density. It turns out that this is by design. The copenhagen interpretation is intentionally formulated to be vague, and to just describe what is measured. If a scientist walks into a lab, and does a measurement, the wave function will indeed tell the scientist how likely he will get that measurement. The copenhagen interpretation could be thought as the instructions a medicine container has. “Take 1 pill each day and your sore throat will be cleared.” These instructions do not tell you how the pill clears your throat, it does not say what the pill is doing inside your body, it just tells you what happens. The same thing happens with the copenhagen interpretation. It just tells you what you’re gonna (likely) get, and dodges all other questions. For many physicists, this is satisfactory. They have a theory that can predict stuff, so why will they care more about what’s going on beyond the math? I will respond to this point later, but right now I want to give more arguments about why the Copenhagen interpretation is wrong.
Like I said earlier, it doesn’t say what counts as a measurement. Does the measurer have to be conscious? Does the measurer play by the rules of quantum mechanics? Does the measurer have to be outside the system? It doesn’t answer these. Does the system before measurement even have an energy? It doesn’t answer this either. All it does is it tells you what you might get. Some people will try to answer these questions though and still claim they are copenhaganists. A common answer is that before measured, the system is in “all states at once” or “smeared out into a wave”. This is not the copenhagen interpretation; it’s an objectively false description of quantum mechanics that I debunked in this article.
Another statement is that the object does not have a definite value before measured. This statement, though not directly incorrect, is going a step further and talks about the actual nature of a particle before measurement. The copenhagen interpretation only talks about probabilities before measurement (states are probabilistic), not the status of a particle having a certain quality before measurement. So if that stance is taken, then it is no longer the copenhagen interpretation. That stance is also very problematic: If I never observe an atom decay, does that mean that it does not having a decay status at all (ex. it has neither decayed nor not decayed)? This statement is an oxymoron. An object can either decay, or not decay. This is one of the basic principles of logic: a is not “not a” by definition. Some people decide to bite the bullet, and accept that oxymorons can still be true. This is a philosophy called “trivialism”, which is a topic for next time.
A common belief among Copenhaganists is that the measurement devices have to be outside the system. This makes sense, since the opposite would apply that systems can measure themselves, which would imply that systems always exist as having definite eigenvalues since they are constantly measuring themselves. It is this element of the Copenhagen interpretation that destroys itself from the inside. What I want to stress is that what follows is not personal interpretation, but actual undisputed fact about quantum mechanics. When we have 1 particle in our system, the wave function is a function of that one particle: it maps the locations/momenta/energies of that particles into another dimension (the axis of the wave function). In other words, it is a function that maps one input to an output. For 2 particles, the wave function is a function of 2 particles. For 3 particles, the wave function is a function of 3 particles. You get the idea. What I’m describing here is what is called “configuration space”, the space that contains all possible configurations of a system. We can go higher and higher and higher. Quantum mechanics implies that there is a wave function that is a function of every single particle in the universe. Again, this isn’t an assumption or interpretation. It is just quantum mechanics itself: The wave function if a function of n-particles in an n+1 dimensional configuration space. Just replace n to the number of all particles. So now we know that there is a wavefunction of the universe. What does this mean under the Copenhagen interpretation? Well the Copenhagen interpretation requires the measurer to be outside the system, but the system in question is the universe! This means that for the wave function to collapse, then someone outside the universe would have to measure the universe — but wouldn’t this person also be a part of the system? So you’d need another person outside everything else in the system to measure the person inside the system, and you get an infinite regress. Unless you believe that there is someone outside the universe that is collapsing wave functions left and right, then this is huge trouble for copenhaganists. Again, what we did was just normal quantum mechanics. We showed that the Copenhagen interpretation cannot even reconcile with this without postulating an infinite regress of measurers outside of our universe. Now since we actually do measure things inside the universe, this is a direct contradiction of what is implied by the Copenhagen interpretation, making the copenhagen interpretation (the way it is usually presented), false. Someone could try to save copenhagen by saying that systems can measure themselves, but that would mean that a system will have a definite value prior to us measuring it (since it had already measured itself), which would be a hidden-variable theory — something many copenhaganists are against: you can’t have your measurement device and eat it too.
Some people say, “we shouldn’t ask about what happens before it was measured since we aren’t measuring it.” This statement is self defeating. Quantum mechanics talks about probabilities before measurement, so with the logic, the copenhagen interpretation shouldn’t be talked about at all — no quantum mechanics should be talked about at all. But the stance itself is one on quantum mechanics, so it is a self defeating point. This is somewhat analogous to what happened to philosophical logical positivism.
Some people simply don’t care: a usual statement they give is “well all the interpretations lead to the same results”. The people who genuinely believe this are a danger to the progression of physics. It is no secret that particle physics has been somewhat stagnant over recent years. And in my opinion, it is precisely because of people like this: the moderate. The moderate does not care about any deeper insight or intuition in what their mathematics describes. All they care about is performing a calculation. But physics isn’t just about performing calculations — it shouldn’t be just about calculations. Did Newton study the nature of light just to perform a calculation? Did Einstein theorize atoms just to perform a calculation? Did Georges Lemaitre, when he theorized the Big Bang, do so just to perform a calculation? The answer to all 3 of these, if you haven’t gotten it already, is no. These physicists did physics to better understand the world around them. They wanted to understand what made the universe tick. They wanted to fundamentally know the nature of material objects. All of these discoveries of course used calculations, and needed calculations, but calculations are what physicists use to guide them into understanding nature — they do not do calculations for the sake of calculations. One who only does physics for calculations is no different than a calculator; they do not need a job, because a calculator can do it for them — probably better. The reason as to why we do not have many “New Einsteins” or “New Diracs” is because many physicists of this modern age do not question the very meaning of the equations they write. They do not care to see beyond the math. They do not bother to ponder where the lure of physics is leading them — they only care about publishing that paper with some calculation. It was Galileo questioning the geocentric model that contributed to heliocentrism, it was Newton questioning the epicycles that gave us Newton’s laws of gravitation, it was Einstein questioning the works of Newton — looking deeper into the meaning behind the math — that gave us general relativity. It was even Einstein’s challenges towards the quantum mechanics orthodoxy that sparked even more interest in the subject, and an increase in much new exciting material like Bell’s Theorem and Entanglement that became something bigger than intended. All of this started with people looking beyond the math and asking: “what does this all really mean at a fundamental level?” If physics has lost people like that, then it has lost everything.

After I left Amsterdam, I traveled to the beautiful, and quite similar, city of Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark. This Scandinavian city located in between the Danish mainland of Jutland and Sweden is surrounded by the sea on three sides, giving Copenhagen some of the most splendid waterside views next to the many canals, harbors, wharfs, and rivers found throughout the city.
Copenhagen has become one of my favorite cities in Europe. I enjoy its relaxed atmosphere, its abundance of picturesque sights, and its friendly people. Denmark has often been ranked the happiest country in the world, and I can see why. In addition to having a beautiful capital city, the Danes take time to enjoy life, often lounging with friends next to the waterfront, having drinks together at a cozy bar, or cruising on yachts and sailboats. When I studied abroad in Hong Kong in the summer of 2016 (right before my freshman year of college), many of the students I met there were Danish, and I learned that Danes travel quite often and are encouraged to do so with lots of vacation days and financial sponsorship for university students. This societal emphasis on enjoying life makes the typical Dane a happy and amiable individual.
The Danish lifestyle also contributes to the well-being of its citizens. American-style fast food is rare here, and people often eat healthy meals sourced from the surrounding countryside and the sea…

The thing that struck me after my first few days in Copenhagen is that the city feels, at once, foreign and familiar. Familiar, not because I’d been before, but because it feels livable and relatable. Foreign, because it’s dissimilar enough to be interesting.
After spending a month digesting and absorbing life in the Danish capital, I’ve learned some of its norms, and more importantly, a few insights on what can help you feel a little more integrated as you’re settling into this fine city.
Getting Around: Biking is going to be your most efficient — and exhilarating — mode for getting around the city. Be mindful, however, of cycling etiquette and left-hand turns. Cyclists use hand signals here like they’re a new form of communication. Look for the upward raise of the left hand to signal one is stopping on the curb or shuffling to pedal up to make a left hand turn (what they call a box turn, or the “Copenhagen Left”). Refer to diagram below:
It’s super confusing until you do it.
Catching the train or metro from the airport is easy, and takes just 13 minutes to arrive in the city center. Uber is also available, though I’ve found their estimated arrival times to be consistently inconsistent, so if you’re in a rush, better to hail a cab.
Dining: The Danes eat well, and by well, I mean flavor-forward and nutrient dense. Decent attention is being paid to sourcing ecologically and locally, though farmers markets are hard to come by. The closest example is the stalls at Torvehallerne. A few chefs are working to change this, but en masse, it’s slow.
There’s no shortage of delicious smørrebrød. A couple of my favorite establishments include Aamanns and Schønnemann’s. Aamanns is a bit more progressive; Schønnemann’s more traditional. They have an incredibly diverse selection of snaps, which is the classic accompaniment to a Danish lunch of smørrebrød.
Christian Puglisi, one of the two most notable chefs in Copenhagen, owns an empire of four establishments: Relæ, Manfreds, Bæst, and Mirabelle, a bakery. His founding story between Relæe and Manfreds (originally published in Fool Magazine) is a fun one, and worth a read.
And delighting nearly every palate, former Noma chef Rosio Sanchez, originally from Chicago and with Mexican roots, is upping the global taco game with her handmade tortillas and house made cheese, made with Danish milk and cheese cultures shipped in from Mexico. Her tacos are ridiculously good and unique in flavor.
Move that body: While you’re loading up on all the carbs from rye bread (rugbrød) and beer (øl), think about taking a jog or a dip in the ocean at Kastrup Søbad.
The Danes love their exercise. Jogging around The Lakes is popular, as is through the public park, Superkilen.
Danish design: Danes love usefulness, clean lines, minimal pigment, and natural materials. From wooden countertops and bathroom paneling, to slate and tile floors, brick and stone, the home is an expression of the natural resources of the region. As it gets dark early in the evening in the winter months, you’ll find the custom of large, round, warm sailing lamps in many establishments, especially low-hanging to emphasize contrast and focus on the activity at hand. Candles burn nearly everywhere. They provide warmth and the symbolism of energy, when all the world outside is oft grey, damp, and moody.
Sights: Rundetårn is a remarkable monument to explore. The round tower, dating to the 17th century, was built as an astronomical observatory. Most notable is its equestrian staircase — and one of the best views above the city.
A visit to the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, just 30 minutes north of the city by train, is a must.
Fashion: In terms of fashion, CPH is the capital for the sharpest in Scandinavian style. Home to brands like Norse Projects, Wood Wood, Henrik Vibskov, Dansk, Libertine Libertine, Mads Nørgaard, Won Hundred, and Samsøe & Samsøe, it is the Scandinavian capital to compose your look.
Hay House is a perennial must for lifestyle house and writing wares.
Where to stay: Airbnb is a great option for longer-term housing. If you want a place to simply crash for a few nights in style, I recommend the newly-opened boutique hotel, SP34, from the Brochner Group. They have a strong pillow game, and all of their furniture is custom.
In terms of neighborhoods to call home in central Copenhagen, Vesterbro is up and coming. Quiet, mainly residential, it is home to the Meatpacking District with a small handful of restaurants, galleries, and clubs. Dyrehaven is popular among Danes and expats alike. There are also a few co-working spaces clustering and a burgeoning tech scene in this neighborhood.
Adjacent is the town of Frederiksburg. Technically it’s a town surrounded by Copenhagen, but it’s literally in the middle of the city. Today the neighborhood is primarily residential, though it is home to a few great cafés and green spaces. One of the notable boulevards for taking in the scenery is Frederiksberg Allé.
Nørrebro is my preferred neighborhood, primarily due to its proximity to Christian Puglisi’s empire (Bæst, Mirabelle, Relæ, Manfred’s), Superkilen and the famous cemetery Assistens Kirkegården, the center of the city, and one of the best bars — The Barking Dog (and its accompanying shop which sells rare liquors by the 100g).
You, of course, have the city center, Københaven K. Tons of shopping, cafés, cobblestone streets, and palaces. Lastly, a few small neighborhoods linger to the east, namely Christianshavn, which encompasses a few smaller neighborhoods, including the rapidly evolving area where the future Noma will be located.
With the grey, brisk autumn days, you might fancy a coffee to keep you warm and awake. I recommend Coffee Collective, Enghave Kaffe, Democratic Coffee, and Koppi.

Having experienced the issue of connecting someone only to later find out their real age, I’ve always been a fan of this a film, which is a nuanced take on romance that explores maturity, emotions, love, social norms, human dynamics, traumas, and human development. It borderlines on problematic and creepy, but carefully treads that path in an artful and truthful way.
The primary dynamic is the relationship of Effy, from Copehagen, and William, who is an American trying to locate his Danish grandfather, who we later learn was a Nazi and a bad father.
This film does an excellent job of making it difficult to first know Effy’s age. She smokes and is first introduced working at a hotel, which an American could easily attribute to someone older than 14.
Considering the actress who played her was 20 at the time of filming, the character is believable as possibly older, but the actress also does a great job of channeling younger mannerisms and making her age ambiguous.

Just a day after landing back in UK, I was going off to Copenhagen for the family trip! Mom was flying off in the morning due to her flight being booked way before mine, and it being Norwegian airlines. Thus, she left by 6.45am and landed in Copenhagen airport at around 1pm. We booked the Zleep Hotel Copenhagen Arena, which was about 2 metro stops away from the airport. She took the train from the airport to ørestad station, then walked a few minutes to the hotel. It was a budget hotel — no kettle, coffee maker etc, just a shower with a 2-in-1 shower gel/shampoo, and a little study desk by the side near the windows. Very sparse and minimalistic, but suitable for just an overnight stay.
My flight was with RyanAir at 1855, so right after I cooked lunch and did my last minute checks, I left for Victoria station, carrying my backpack and duffel bag. I packed dinner already, so I wouldn’t have to buy expensive airport food. I took the Victoria line to Tottenham Hale station, whereby I then took the Stansted Express to Stansted airport. It was a pretty long journey — 1.5hrs in total, but quite smooth. It was crowded, as expected, since it’s the summer holidays and people are just taking this opportunity to travel again. I reached the airport around 3.45pm, and started queuing for check-in. It was crazy crowded and the queue moved so slowly, since there were tons of people and families travelling. After an hour’s worth of queuing and holding my pee, I finally reached the counter to check in and print my boarding pass. Heng I could sneak in my duffel bag! :P I then proceeded to the security departure area, which again was crowded but managed to get through it in good time. I was done by 1705, so I headed to Joe & The Juice to grab a table and eat my dinner. After that, I waited at the sitting area to just while away my time till it was time for the gate to be announced.
I waited… and waited… and waited until 1830, and I got really worried then — the gate hasn’t been announced yet and it was almost flight time. I went to the information counter, and the girl informed us that the flight had been delayed to 2130! Holy shit, that was another 2 hours wait in that goddamned airport! I felt awful — I was still jetlagged and really tired by then, and was getting a little hungry too. Plus, it was so inconvenient to drink water cause I’d have to lug all my stuff with me every time I went to the toilet, so I tried not to drink too much but was really thirsty. I read my ebook, then watched 2 episodes of “The Office” to try and kill time while saving my phone batteries. Finally, they announced the gate at 2030, and I walked to gate 42. It was a full flight, and lots of people were also tired like me. I queued in the non-priority lane, and finally boarded at the front of the plane since my seat was 12C. We had to wait in the drizzling rain whilst they slowly got us from the airport building, along the tarmac and up into the plane. God, I was so tired. We only departed at around 10pm, and landed at 11.30pm. I slept for the whole flight, but was still tired anyway. I was supposed to make my way to the Zleep hotel myself like Mom did, but since my flight got delayed and it was midnight by the time I’d make it through immigration customs, Mom kindly waited for me at the airport. Good thing too — the metro stopped at midnight, and the trains would only come every hourly. Hence, after walking from T2 to the customs, we took a cab to the hotel. It was really expensive to take a cab — 200DKK which was around 40SGD. Jesus christ. Stuff here is crazy expensive. Anyway, once I got to the room 529, I dumped my stuff, took a shower and started charging my phones. Slept and woke up at 6am.
Woke up early, probably due to being slightly jetlagged. Did some stretching and stuff, then headed down with Mom for a cuppa tea and coffee for her. Their Rooibos tea was really nice — so I had a 2–3 cups of it. We then walked around the outside area, passing by Burger King and Fields (supposed to be the largest shopping mall), before Papa arrived at around 8+am where he would meet us at the hotel. After he dumped his stuff in the room, took a shower, we walked to the Orestad station and took the metro to Christianshavn station, then took bus 2A to the Refshaleøen (Refshalevej) area, whereby we would be able to find the Grønt Marked. Refshaleøen is an old industrial area, home to huge shipyards and wastewater treatment plants. The Grønt Marked is a non-profit farmers market organisation in Copenhagen, with small individual farmers selling home-grown, local, fresh and seasonal produce such as kale, tomatoes, berries and potatoes. They even sold honey schnapps! They appear in different parts of Copenhagen depending on which Sunday it is, so since we’re here on the 1st Sunday, it’s located at Refshaleøen, the original location of the market’s beginnings. There were a few other visitors as well, and lots of them were queueing up to buy food from Lille Bakery, which was located at the end of the market. Whilst Mom and Papa bought their breakfast pastries — mushroom roll, jam cookie, berliner (some kind of sugared donut), and black coffee — I went to buy my tomatoes and blackberries. We left by 10.30am to catch the 2A bus back to Christianhavn, and walked around the area. We strolled along the canal, seeing lots of yachts and boathouses, as well as stopping by the Bolia showroom. Bolia’s stuff is really nice — typical minimalistic yet beautiful Scandinavian style furniture and decor, lots of beige and earthy tones, wool and ceramic materials used. We walked until around 11.30pm, then slowly turned back to make our way back to the hotel to pick up our luggage and head for lunch at Ciao Pasta, which was located near our apartment. We decided to go for lunch first, since we could only check into the apartment at 1pm. However, by the time we took the train and walked to the apartment, it was already 1pm. It was located at Gasværksvej 11, Ground floor, København 1656. Kinda old looking and when we arrived the cleaning lady was still there. There were 3 separate bedrooms, 1 big open concept kitchen, a living room and 1 toilet to share. There were basic amenities like cooking utensils, cups and bowls, and a little utility closet off to the side of the kitchen (vacuum, more soap, random stuff all dumped there). In the toilet, it was really spartan looking — just 1 toilet right beside the sink, opposite was a Miel washing machine and dryer on top, the tiled shower on the right. We just dumped our stuff, then tried to figure out how to get the door key, cause I realised that we needed one to be able to get back in. We spent a good 10–15mins trying and calling for help, but no answer. Our saviour came in the form of an upstairs neighbour who heard our troubles, and solved the issue by figuring out that the key to the door was in the lockbox, and that the lockbox code wasn’t to unlock the door, which we had thought to be so. Thus, we were saved and could finally go for lunch. Well, more of Mom and I going and then Mom dabaoing back lunch, since Kai had landed and Papa wanted to meet him to make sure he got to the apartment cause Kai is useless that way. Mom got the meat lovers pasta for them and herself the veggie loves, whilst I had my special order of the ciao lovers pasta with garlic, chili and added vegetables. The pasta was tortellini with some truffle filling, but I mostly ate the filling and veg cause the pasta was too much. Papa of course was pissed off with the whole apartment, making the usual black face and cursing his head off. Mom of course, felt awful and tried to convince him to go to ah hotel instead, but alas, no. How unfortunate.
Anyway, after I finished lunch, I headed to the nearby supermarket, Superbrugsen, to get some body soap (apartment only had shampoo and bar soap), salad, yoghurt (they only had skyr but same same), and some strawberries. Made it back only by 3+pm, and boy did everyone’s faces look like shit. It was drizzling by then, so the cloudy weather didn’t make anything better. I ate some yoghurt and berries, then after resting a bit, decided to go out and explore some more. Might as well see as much as I could instead of wasting the time away cooped up in the apartment with angry men. I walked towards the Palads Cinema, which was really pink and blocky. The Palads Cinema first opened its doors to the public more than 100 years ago in 1912. At the time, it was located in the former central railway station which had ceased operation a year prior. The cinema was extensively renovated in 1955 and was further updated in the 1970s. In 1989 the cinema received its signature coat of paint which itself attracts thousands of visitors every year. I then walked past the Axel Towers, which was designed by Danish architect Lene Tranberg and opened in 2017. Very modern looking, consisting of five interconnected towers, the tallest of which reaches a height of 61 meters. Whilst walking along the streets, I noticed how clean they were, and also how few rubbish bins were out — it was like Japan where they expected you to keep your trash with you and not litter. There were also lots of Burger King’s and 7-Eleven — their 7-Eleven was very fancy, almost like an M&S in the train stations back in UK kind of fancy. I walked past a Warhammer store and an Animerch store too, which sold little anime trinkets like keychains and soft toys. There was a Hard Rock Cafe too, which was my toilet stop. After the Palads cinema, I passed by the Wallmans Cirkusbygingen, which hosted cabaret acts and dancing. I then proceeded onwards to the City Hall Square, aka Radhuspladsen, and saw the Copenhagen City Hall. Just a very grand looking building, first opened in 1905. t was designed by Danish architect Martin Nyrop who drew inspiration from Siena City Hall and put elements of the Italian style in a Danish context. I passed by the Tivoli Gardens, but didn’t go in since family wanted to go there tomorrow or after. As I walked along the streets of Indre By, there was a Mentos promotion going on, with sales people just giving out free mini bottles of Mentol chewing gum. After a few minutes walk — all of these destinations were within 10–15minutes walking distance of each other — I ended up at Nytorv and Gammeltorv, 2 adjoining squares in the city. Gammeltorv is the oldest square in Copenhagen, dating back to the city’s foundation in the 12th century. Its most distinguishable feature is the Caritas Fountain, the oldest fountain in Copenhagen. Nytorv was created by King Christian IV and is located just to the other side of the former city hall. This old city hall, however, burned down in 1795 and was rebuilt in a different location on Nytorv. I then walked to the Church of Our Lady (Vor Frue Kirke), the city’s most important church and also known as Copenhagen Cathedral. The original church was built soon after the city’s foundation in the 12th century, but fell victim to a devastating fire in the early 14th century. The building has Neo-Classical architecture, and the inside was a large vaulted domed ceiling with lots of columnades at its sides. It was quiet and peaceful, and the white colours of the inside was soothing to the eye. I left the church and walked towards the Round Tower (Rundetaarn). It was this really tall brick tower that was erected in the 17th century under Christian IV, and functions as an astronomical observatory. You could pay to go inside the tower and see stuff, but seeing how boring the brochure looked, plus with a time limit (I had a dinner booking at 1730, and it was already 1630), I decided to make a slow journey back in the drizzle. Yup, still drizzling and cloudy and windy. I passed by Skindergrade Gyde along the way back, which was just a bunch of colourful old looking houses. I made a short stop to see the nearby supermarket Irma, which was much closer to our apartment and sold the skyr yogurt which I’m eating here, Thise. I reached back by around 1715, dropped off my backpack and charged my phone, then headed out again with mom for my dinner booking at Maple Casual Dining. I had pre-ordered the chicken thighs with asparagus instead of the potatoes, and the chef made an alternative sauce of olive oil, herbs and sliced chili. Really tasty, though kind of oily. Oh well. I ordered an extra bowl of veg (broccolini, green beans and asparagus), and it was really good. Mom accompanied me by ordering their mixed berries Nordic sorbet, but the sorbet looked more like ice cream, and her dessert came with these cocoa looking cereal. Of course, to appease Mom, I went back and ate more yoghurt. They were heading out for dinner with Kit and Emily at some other Restaurant Puk at 1930, so left by 1900. I had my shower and then tea afterwards, and just chilled and wind down. Ah, so peaceful without the angry men. I wish they’d just go and stay at a hotel rather than try to live with this and make everyone unhappy. I’m just really sad Mom has to deal with all their unhappiness and cursing, despite planning everything as best she could and scrambling after the funeral happenings. Also, such a waste that she couldn’t come on my little exploration today to see the sights despite the cloudy weather, cause the next few days are forecast to be rainy as well.
After their dinner, Kit and Emily are coming to the apartment to eat durian, so there goes the post-dinner peace and quiet, plus having to smell durian the whole night probably. Also, with only a single toilet to share, one can only pray that Papa doesn’t clog the toilet and that the windows can air it out enough.
Woke up at 5am, then tried to sleep more till 5.15am but couldn’t so just got up and made tea. It was sort of light by then, and there were some people on the street. Alas, it was still drizzling a little bit, so I’m not sure what the plan is for today. Did my usual wake up warm-ups, and hydrated. The Jing green tea and black tea Mom gave me was kinda light, not very strong flavour — oh well. Anyway, Mom got up at around 6am, then after washing up, we re-explored the utilities room and found: body wash, more body wash, and a ton of bin bags. So we actually didn’t have to buy body soap yesterday… dang it. So we decided to use the body soap provided as hand soap instead in the toilet, and the little body wash bottles as hand soap in the kitchen. Yesterday night Kit and Emily didn’t come over for durian as they said they were too full from dinner, and would come over tonight instead. So while waiting for stuff to open, I decided to just read and then drink more water and tea before heading out.
Mom and I left around 7.30am to head out for our morning journey, since Kai and Papa were not up for it and still sleeping, respectively. We walked to the København H metro station, then took the M4 train to Marmorkirken stop. I bought my Copenhagen City card which allowed us to ride all the public transport and access all the different attractions/museums in the city for different duration of times — 48hrs, 96hrs, 120hrs etc. So after getting off at our stop, we actually realised that right outside the station was Frederik’s Church, aka the Marble Church. It’s best known for its outstanding rococo interiors and its striking dome which dominates the cityscape. It was drizzling and really windy, but still manageable. We walked past Khmer Cuisine, a SPAR grocery store, and even a Michelin/Chaine restaurant Bistro Boheme. On our way to the Kastellet, we walked past the Churchill park, then crossed the Kastellet Bridge to enter the area proper. Also known as the Citadel, it is a star-shaped fortress that was once a crucial part of the city’s defense system. Although it is still under the command of the Danish Armed Forces today, it is also a popular recreational space for the locals — there were still people jogging and walking their dogs, even in the grey weather! The barracks were a nice brick red colour. After that, we made our way to the Little Mermaid statue, and on the way saw the Søfartsmonumentet, which is a huge statue dedicated to civilian Danish sailors who have lost their lives during WWI. The Little Mermaid statue was kind of small, being only 1.25m tall and just parked right in the middle of the sea. It was unveiled on 23 August 1913, presented by Danish brewer Carl Jacobsen as a gift to the City of Copenhagen. The sculpture is made of bronze and granite, and inspired by the Hans Christian Andersen’s fairytale of the same name, “Den Lille Havfrue” (The Little Mermaid). Carl Jacobsen fell in love with the character after watching a ballet performance based on the fairytale at the Royal Danish Theatre, so much so that he commissioned the sculptor Edvard Eriksen to create the sculpture of the mermaid. Fun fact: Erikson’s wife, Eline Eriksen, actually posed for the statue! After that, we walked a little further to find the Gefion Fountain, which is a huge fountain donated to the city by the Carlsberg Foundation, depicting the Norse goddess Gefjon driving a wagon pulled by oxen. According to legend, it was Gefjon who plowed the Danish island of Zealand out of Sweden. The Swedish king Gylfe supposedly offered her as much land as she could plow out within a day and a night. In order to accomplish this crazy challenge, Gefjon transformed her sons into oxen, which are seen pulling the plow. Just off to the side is the St. Alban’s Church (English Church), which was currently under restoration works. It was built in the late 19th century in a distinct British Gothic Revival style (aka Victorian style). The church has served the British-Anglican community in Copenhagen ever since and is one of the few churches with services in English today. It’s quite a beautiful structure, just a shame that we couldn’t go inside today. Since we finished seeing the few main sites in the area — and all within an hour! — we decided to head back to the apartment. After taking the train back to the København H metro station, I bought a squash and some fresh tomatoes from the outside grocer. Mom went to the train station to buy some coffee and pastries for breakfast for her and the angry men from Lagkagehuset — 1 espresso, 1 cappuccino, 1 raspberry swirl, 1 chocolate cinnamon swirl, 1 bread thing and 1 almond croissant. We then walked back and got back around 9.30am. After that, it was kind of chill time till they finally decide what to do — mostly the plan is to do indoors stuff as it’s drizzly and gloomy weather. Anyway, there was a lot of mixed up planning for where to go and etc after they finished breakfast, and there was a scramble for me to book another lunch for 6 at 1230pm at Restaurant Havfruen, which I was going for lunch to at today.
Anyway, we ultimately decided to head to the Amalienborg Palace, which is the residence of the Danish royal family since the 18th Century, after the original residence of the royal family — Christianborg Palace — burned down. Parts of the palace are open to the public, while others are reserved exclusively for the royal family. Whether any of them are at home is indicated by the flags hoisted at the palace or the changing of the guards. It was really drizzly and windy when we headed out, and waiting for bus 23 was quite miserable as there was no shelter. We took the bus to the Odd Fellow Palæet stop, then walked a short distance to enter the Palace. We were in time for the changing of the guards too, which was like that in Buckingham Palace. After that, we went to see the inside of one of the buildings available for viewing, and it was quite a short tour — only 2 levels, and just some old furniture and paintings to see. The museum shop was also really small — I got a bunch of postcards and a diorama of the palace, whilst mom got a bunch of fridge magnets. After that, mom and I left first for lunch, which was booked at 1230, but by the time we walked there it was already 1pm. Kai and Papa would settle their own lunch and meet us back at the Frederik’s Church after lunch, where we would go inside to see the interior. On the way to Restaurant Havfruen, we passed by Nyhavn, which was just a row of colourful buildings located along the harbour. We passed by the Royal Danish Playhouse as well, which is this really modern blocky looking building. It’s a mix of brick, stainless steel and glass, with some parts of the building hovering over the water and supported by Venetian-style crooked columns. The restaurant was quite small, and packed. I had already pre-ordered my baked salmon with asparagus, whilst Mom had the fish and chips. The food came relatively fast, and just in time too, cause shortly after we ordered there came a big group of 12 angmohs, American I think from their accent. The food was quite delicious, and while waiting to be served, I ate my blackberries, strawberries and tomatoes. After we finished lunch, I was still a little hungry, and wanted to eat my yoghurt but alas, it was back at the apartment. We strolled back to the church, passing by a little souvenir shop where Mom bought more magnets. We waited for Kai and Papa inside the church, and they finally arrived at 2.35pm. After a short look inside, which wasn’t very impressive unfortunately, we took the metro back to our apartment. Kai and Papa decided to go see the War Museum, so thank god it was only Mom and I. We went back and I got to eat more yoghurt to fill up a little, then we took the bus to Strøget, which was their version of Orchard Road. Not very impressive — just small versions of branded shops like Gucci, LV, COS etc. We also went into their shopping mall, Illum, but also quite chiam lah. We walked on a little further, and saw the Helligaands Kirken on the way to the metro. We then dropped by Lidl for me to buy dinner vegetables — kale, zucchini, red onions and edamame. And we made it back just in time before the guys got back. Mom kindly helped me chop my stuff up and then we just boiled everything in a pot. Ate dinner around 6pm, then waited until they left before showering and having some tea. They had dinner at nearby Ristorante Buono, which I had actually looked up for food but they didn’t reply my email. I planned tomorrow’s activities with Mom before she left for dinner, so she could discuss it with the rest of them during dinnertime. At least by the time they left for dinner, it had stopped raining and seemed ok. They came back around 9pm, and then ate the durian that Papa brought. Emily seemed ok, and it was nice to chat with her again. We discussed tomorrow’s plan, which was thankfully free and easy, just to meet at 5.30pm at Noma. Then, lo and behold, the neighbours smelled the durian smell and reported it to the fire station as a suspected gas leak. So there came 2 firetrucks, and the firemen came into our flat to investigate a gas leak. My god. REAL FIREMEN! IN THEIR SUITS AND EVERYTHING WITH THE TRUCKS!
Holy jesus. They came into and out of the apartment several times, carrying their carbon monoxide detector and trying to find the source of the “leak”. Oh boy, was Kai so pissed off. Mom opened the windows to try and air the flat out so the scent wouldn’t linger, and bagged up the trash for disposal tomorrow. I’m not sure what time they left by, cause I went to sleep first.
Woke up at 5.40am, and surprisingly Papa was awake too — or maybe not so surprising, since he has jet lag too, and worse than us. the day is gloomy but dry, which is at least 1 blessing there. Had my usual tea, and just read and started to revise a little about my case discussion for the PEG interview with Papa. Sian — the more I revise, and when discussing with him, the more stress and worried I get. And this is in addition to the OSCE retake I have to also prepare for once I get back from Copenhagen. Stress, stress stress. Waiting for Mom to wake up before I can finally move out and start walking to Nyboder, which is a block of red, orange and yellow coloured buildings, and people still live there too! They once served as the homes of Danish sailors and their families, and were barracks under the command of the Danish Navy. Eventually, 8am came around and Mom still wasn’t awake, so I decided to head off first and let her sleep in. I changed and walked to Nyboder, taking a straight route through Strøget, seeing the different stores and eateries along the way. It wasn’t rainy but crazy gusty today, and the wind was so strong that you had moments of just standing still trying to keep upright. Along the way, I saw a few wall murals that were quite nice, but incomparable to those in Argentina. I saw the houses in Nyboder, and I guess they were quite pretty, but nothing very impressive. Walked till the end of the block, whereby I saw the statue of Christian IV. I also saw a Jewish church nearby. I then began walking towards the Botanical Gardens, and passed by the SMK Museum at the same time. The gloomy clouds were beginning to clear a little, such that there was some sunshine coming through — makes all the difference man. The garden was ok — I was never really into all the plants and stuff, and it was too early for the Palm house to be open (most things open at 10am here). Mom finally woke up by 9am, so she called and we agreed to meet at the gardens. After seeing some of the sights, we walked to the nearby Museum of Natural History, which was part of the University of Copenhagen, where they were showcasing two special exhibitions: Monkeys — A Primate Story and the Wildlife Photographer of The Year. They also had a mineral exhibition going on, but we skipped that cause it was just looking at rocks and stones. The photography exhibition had a few different categories to look at, and the showcase was for the year’s 100 best images. They were really beautiful and so HD to look at. It was quite a short exhibit, so we finished it pretty fast. We then went to the museum shop, where I got this hand-sewn lion plushie thing, whilst Mom got some mineral stones. Before heading to the Rosenberg castle, we stopped by at a nearby coffee shop, Espresso House, so that Mom could get herself some breakfast. She ordered a cappucino, and had a cinnamon roll and a cinnamon-cardamom bun to go. After that, we went to the Rosenberg Castle, built in the early 1600s and one of Christian IV’s architectural projects. The castle contains Denmark’s crown jewels, and outside was the King’s Garden (Kongens Have), which has been open to the public since 1770. We toured the whole castle, seeing the many paintings and furniture they had — they even had a fancy toilet that was all tiles! Lots of gold stuff, ivory dioramas and handicrafts, plus fancy weaponry like muskets that were inlaid with mother-of-pearl engravings and decorations. The basement levels housed the crown and the more precious items, but beyond that, that was it. So far, all the palaces are pretty ok, not as impressive as I’d thought they’d be. After that, we headed back to the apartment for lunchtime, or at least for my lunch. I stopped by the Coop 365 discount supermarket and bought 2 more boxes of strawberries (they were really sweet!), and a Skyr yoghurt cause I was running out. Cooked the same meal as last night’s dinner — onions, zucchini, squash, tomatoes, kale. Mom had 1/3 of her bun for lunch, as she wanted to save her stomach for tonight’s Noma dinner. Basically everyone but me was saving their stomach for Noma. We finished lunch around 2pm, then left around 30mins later to go to Nyhavn to walk a bit due to the good weather, which would eventually lead us to Kongens Nytorv.
We took the bus to Nyhavn, and it passed by the Royal Library (Det Kongelige Bibliotek), which is the national library and one of the largest libraries in the world. We also passed by BLOX, which is this really modern building that was recently built in 2018 and houses the Danish Architecture Center. Lots of glass and concrete, steel beams. Walking towards Kongens Nytorv, which is the largest square in Copenhagen, which was laid out in the 17th century by King Christian V. After its completion, several notable buildings were erected around the square. To the south lies the Royal Danish Theatre from 1874; to the east Charlottenborg Palace; to the west Hotel D’Angleterre and Magasin du Nord department store; and to the north Thott Palace. In the centre of the square is an equestrian statue of the king himself. After that, we walked towards Agnete and the Merman, which is a collection of bronze statues submerged in one of the city’s numerous canals. They depict a merman and his seven sons, urging his daughter Agnete to return to them. This was done by Danish sculptor Suste Bonnen, who was inspired by a traditional Danish folk story “Agnete og Havmanden”. When we went, it was barely visible in the waters, so I felt kind of cheated… Along the way, we passed by the Charlottenborg Palace, which was originally constructed in the 17th century as a city palace for the half-brother of King Christian V. Since 1754, it has served as the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, and also houses the art gallery Kunsthal Charlottenborg. The building boasts a Dutch Baroque style with Italian influences.
Our last stop before heading to Freetown Christiana was Holmens Bro — a bridge which is one of the 9 bridges connecting the island of Slotsholmen with the rest of Copenhagen. Nearby lies the Holmens Kirke (Church of Holmen), first built as an anchor forge in the 16th century but was converted into a church by King Christian IV in the early 17th century. We walked to Freetown Christiana, which is an autonomous district of Copenhagen that openly sells weed and cannabis. In 1971, a group of hippies broke down the barricades and began squatting there. Nowadays, approximately 900 people live in the area, comprising a community that has its own rules and regulations completely independent of the Danish government. They also have restaurants and cafes there, like the Sunshine bakery and Cafe Loppen. We walked around taking pictures of the colourful murals, but made sure to respect the online rule of not taking pictures of the drug dealers or anyone. When we were there, the scnet of weed as so strong — choking, almost. There was also a police raid happening at the same time, so we left to avoid any trouble. I wasn’t afraid per se, since it was still daylight and there were other tourists and families around, but definitely wary of the environment since it was drugs and weed all around. Nice murals, but Argentina’s are way more colourful and expressive. We backtracked to the entrance, then went to the nearby hotel for a toilet break before heading to Noma for dinner at 5pm. We actually passed by Kit and Emily on the way to the hotel, and they had just finished their canal tour and were going to see the Freetown now. We took the bus 2A to Margretheholm (Refshalevej) stop, and walked a little bit to reach Noma, which was recognisable by the bunch of greenhouses. There were other guests already there too, waiting for their dinner to begin. Papa and Kai had been there since around 4.30pm, and were just waiting for the rest of us to arrive. It was really windy out still, but at least sunny-ish. There was a greenhouse where they grew all their herbs and flowers, which would be harvested and used in tonight’s Vegetable Season dinner. After we all arrived, they brought us to our table and began the dinner — 12–13 dishes with 2 desserts, accompanied by a mix of non-alcoholic juices and tea (you could choose the alcoholic option too). It was beautiful and simple, and the tastes of the food prepared was exceptional. Small portions but very flavourful, lots of that tangy and sourish element incorporated into the dishes. They used a lot of fresh produce, such as oyster mushrooms, flowers, zucchini flowers. Each dish had a drink paired with it for either 1–2 courses. Dessert was a special “onigiri” — ice cream shaped into the triangular shape wrapped in a blueberry leather, and a dish of berries with this delicious almond-tasting sauce. Also, a piece of chocolate with a bunch of flowers on it. Yes, the first time in the past few years that I’ve decided to let myself eat dessert. Who cares about it tonight — Papa paid a hefty 700SGD for this, so I’m not gonna waste it. Plus, it’s a sign from Gonggong that the whole family was supposed to come for this dinner, so I will not let him down. I really enjoyed the dinner, and I think everyone else was impressed too. However, Kai and Kit were obviously still hungry, with Kai searching for dinner options to eat afterwards. But by the time we ended, it was already 9.30pm, so a lot of places have closed for the night except some burger places which Kai was too lazy to go and dabao from. After we finished dinner, we had some tea and then got the opportunity to tour the kitchen area. We got to see their fermenting area, which was like a science lab with some chim looking tools, and their huge buckets of kombucha and fermented items, like lupin and oyster mushroom fermented solutions. They cleaned up and closed shop by 9pm, with some of the staff sitting at the staff canteen polishing the silverware and tidying things up. During dinner, we discussed tomorrow’s plan, and eventually settled on leaving it free and easy again — Kit, Emily and Kai were planning to go to the aquarium in the morning, whilst Mom and I planned on seeing the Christianborg Palace in the morning, then afternoon going to see the SMK Art musem and Torvehallerne. We all took a cab back, as it was already dark out and got back to the apartment by 10pm. Kai didn’t want to go out to buy food, so decided to be hungry and sleep. Poor Kai, he should’ve eaten some lunch :/
Happy National Day! Can’t believe we’re celebrating it, or not really, here in Copenhagen with its gloomy skies and rainy days. Woke up at 5.30am as usual, but just a little tired, not too much. Did my usual warm up activities and tea, then did some Googling to see what could be open. Ultimately, I saw that the zoo was open at 9am, and was just a 30min walk from our apartment. So my plan was to go the nearby park at 8am, walk and chill until 9am, then see the zoo stuff till whatever time. I didn’t intend to eat lunch today, but an early dinner, so will just go straight from the zoo to the Glypotek museum, since Kit wanted to go there in the morning and meet Mom. Then, I probably will head to the Christianborg Palace, followed by the Medicine Museum and Design museum, seeing how the timing goes. We left for the Søndermarken shortly after 7.45am, taking a slow stroll in the drizzle and strong winds. The Søndermarken is one of Denmark’s oldest palace gardens, and is part of the gardens surrounding Frederiksberg Palace. At the end of the 18th century, Søndermarken was redesigned as a romantic landscape garden with meandering paths, allowing access to the Norwegian House, The Cisterns and the Chinese Pavilion. You could even get a view of the elephants in the Copenhagen Zoo! We walked along the paths and saw the Frederiksberg Palace, a yellow stately building, then continued onwards to the Chinese Pavilion. It was just a small little pavilion, quite cute. Mom realised her shoe was coming apart due to the rain, so we decided to go to a nearby cafe to warm up and rest a little. We walked out of the park and to a nearby cafe, Thiemers Kaffebar — very aesthetic and bookish, nice and small. Mom ordered a cappucino and ate a bit of her muffin thing from yesterday. We sat there for a while, then when it was around 8.50am, we left to take a slow walk to the Copenhagen zoo. It was pretty empty since we were the first few stragglers in at the moment of opening, and so we had free rein of the place. We decided to just make a loop around the area, and we managed to see the lions, tigers, elephants, penguins, seals etc. Most of the animals were hiding in shelter due to the crappy weather — poor guys, having to deal with this kind of climate. I saw a claw machine — 25DKK for a chance to win! The soft toys inside were monkey and tiger plushies, whereas the plushies in the out-of-order machine at the Elephant House had red pandas and elephants. Well, losers can’t be choosers! We didn’t have any coins with us, so I went to change a 100DKK into 20DKK coins to play. Upon my first try, I managed to get the claw to grab not only one, but two monkey plushies! :D First time I’ve ever been so lucky on the claw machine in my life! After that, we just finished up at the museum shop, and then left for the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek.
Mom had arranged for us to meet Kit and Emily there, but apparently Emily as busy working in the morning so they missed it completely. We took bus 7A from the Zoologisk Have stop to Hovedbanegården, Tivoli stop, then walked a little to reach the museum. The Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek is one of the most famous art museums in Copenhagen, primarily exhibiting sculpture from Ancient Rome, Greece and Egypt, in addition to showcasing a wide collection of Danish and French art. The founder is Carl Jacobsen. The permanent exhibitions were:
Then there were the special exhibits:
It was quite small for the special exhibits, and the other ones were just huge rooms full of sculptures and paintings, that my mind went numb after a few rooms. Nope, can’t do art for too long. I managed to finish it within 2 hours, and we actually met up with Kai and Papa there. The museum shop wasn’t very impressive too, so quite a letdown for Mom especially. Since I wasn’t having lunch with them, and wanted to go back for tea instead, I left first at around 12.05pm to take the bus back to our apartment. They would be having lunch at Restaurant Havfruen at Nyhavn, then I’m not sure what their afternoon plans are. For myself, I took the bus in the wrong direction for 1 stop, then swapped direction and got back by 1230pm. Had some warm tea and water, and updated the blog and read my emails.
After resting a little, I headed out to the Christianborg Palace. Unfortunately, it was still drizzling and cold, but whatever. Took the bus there and walked a little to enter the castle. Being blur, I queued up to go up and see the Tower, which would provide a view over Slotsholmen. I took the lift up to the top, but the view was ok, nothing special or wow. I guess the weather also kind of destroyed the opportunity to take a nice city view. After that, I found the right entrance to enter the palace, and toured the Royal Reception Rooms (Great Hall, Queen’s tapestries). The tapestries were really beautiful and vibrant, and it is said that these tapestries were made to mark the occasion of Her Majesty Queen Margrethe II’s 50th birthday in 1990, by ordering a gift of 11 tapestries. Bjørn Nørgaard painted the full-size sketches upon which the tapestries were woven, and they depict 1000 years of Danish history. I considered going to the ruins, but saw that it was a long queue, and it was almost 3pm. The Medicine museum closed at 4pm, so I took the M3/M4 to the Marmorkirken station and walked to the museum. It was quite small, and I finished it within 10 mins — nothing very good to see, all old stuff and quite terrible honestly. Along the way I passed by a 19th Century Russian Orthodox church, Skt Aleksander Nevskij Kirke, and a random small Roman church. A short walk away was the Design museum, and the queue was super long so I decided to just go to the gift shop and buy Mom a magnet. Mom they all met for lunch and had a seafood platter to share, but Kit and Emily left first cause they had a booking at the Rosenberg Castle. Mom, Papa and Kai then had dessert at the nearby Vaffelbageren Nyhavn, where they had churros with Bailey’s ice cream and some softserve too. They then walked along the Nyhavn canal and also to Strøget, before taking the bus back. I dropped by the 365 discount store near the Marmorkirken station, getting zucchini and pumpkin and skyr before heading back. So coincidentally, they got back just a few minutes before I did!
The moment I got back, I just dropped off my stuff and started prepping with Mom for dinner, eating my yoghurt and strawberries whilst waiting. I’m quite proud of myself for accomplishing so many destinations today, alone too! Of course, I wish Mom could’ve been there with me to see the sights, but oh well. Had dinner and finished by 1730, while everyone else went to nap before dinner. Tonight, they’re going to that Michelin place Bistro Boheme for a 1915 dinner. Hopefully it’s nice. Meanwhile, I will chill and slowly warm up at the apartment — I think I’ve done enough outdoor walking for today.
Man, I was really tired yesterday night — must be from all that walking, plus falling on my left knee yesterday at the zoo. I lay in bed just as they got home from dinner — Mom said the portions were good size, but food was so-so. Oh well. Usual wake up routine, and everyone else got up at around 7+am. We were going to the Kronborg castle this morning, to try and beat the hordes of tourists that would be sure to come later in the day. We would be meeting Kit and Emily at the Kobenhavn Hovedb. station and take the RE train to Helsingør station, where we would still have to walk a little bit to get to the castle itself. Today’s weather looks better — not raining, but still cool and windy. Fingers crossed it gets warmer and slightly sunnier as predicted by the weather report. We left by 8.30am to get to the station where we got the 8.42am train to Helsingør. It was around an hour’s journey there, and not much to see along the way. Kai was rather unhappy at the rush, cause he didn’t manage to get his breakfast. When we reached, it was kind of gloomy, and I found a cafe for Kai to get some food in before we went to the castle. The nearby Cafe Karisma was very quaint and nice, very coffeeshop vibes — Papa had an apple pie and hot chocolate with whipped cream, Kai had the spicy chicken sandwich and a cuppacino. We decided to wait for Kit and Emily at the cafe and then together we go to the castle. Whilst they were eating their breakfast, I decided to walk around the old town streets of Helsingør, seeing a few of the sights. It began to drizzle a little whilst I was walking the streets.
The first stop I had was to see St. Olaf’s Church, which was situated on the same spot where the city’s first church was built over 800 years ago. St. Olaf’s Church got its present look back in 1559, and it could therefore celebrate its 450th anniversary in 2009. The oldest parts of the church wall, however, are from the 13th century. The first church was established here on what was once the beach of the castle at the time, Drekrog, before Kronborg was built over it. The church takes its name from its guardian saint, the Norwegian Viking king and national saint, Olaf the Holy, who managed to both unify and Christianise Norway. When Erik of Pomerania began collecting the Sound Dues, St. Olaf’s Church underwent a transformation. The church had to keep up with Elsinore’s growing importance for the country, and it was therefore expanded several times. Since 1961, St. Olaf’s Church has formally become a cathedral, due to the fact that northern Zealand became an independent diocese. On the east gable of the church one can see a door leading to a burial vault. Above it, there is seen a skull and crossbones, the symbol of death. The French inscription reads: Thus do we all become. Inside the church, the interior is dominated by an 11.5-metre tall altarpiece from 1664. The altarpiece is constructed of 19 reliefs, depicting the life of Jesus Christ. There is also a treasure trove of Renaissance and Baroque art, such as the pulpit, from the year 1567. There is a yellow house, which lies on Sct. Annagade 6, that faces the church with a large mural — this was the childhood home of the composer Diderik Buxtehude (1637–1707). In the years 1660–1668, he was the organist at the Church of St.Mary, and he was known as one of the 17th century’s most important composers, inspiring famous composers such as Johan Sebastian Bach and Georg Friedrich Handel. The paintings on the gable across from Buxthehude’s house in Sct. Annagade depict the era of the Sound Dues. They show the cosmopolitan rich and very vibrant mercantile town, which for over 400 years profited greatly off the many ships that had to stop and pay the Sound dues. Along a small side street was GI Færgestræde, a very aesthetic cobblestone alleyway.
The second church I saw was St. Mary’s Church and the Carmelite Priory. St. Mary’s Church, together with the Carmelite Priory, is one of Northern Europe’s best preserved priories from the Middle Ages. The priory was founded in 1430, shortly after the introduction of the Sound Dues, when Erik of Pomerania invited the Carmelite monks, the so-called Whitefriars, to Elsinore. The church and priory were completed in their present form around the year 1500. After the Reformation, the priory was converted to a hospital in 1541. The priory also housed Elsinore’s grammar school, and in the 1800s it was a retirement home for those deemed in worthy need. Inside the church the floor is covered in numerous, partly worn down gravestones, which originate from the time where it was possible for wealthy citizens to buy a burial site in the church. The church’s prestigious chalk murals were made from 1440–1500. A main attraction is the church organ which was put there in 1662–63 — this was the same organ that Diderik Buxtehude used while he was the church organist. Following the Protestant Reformation, the church was intially desolate, but was later used as a stable for traveller’s horses. It was on the brink of being torn down, but due to the many foreigners in the city, Frederick I gave it to the German and Dutch congregation. From 1576, sermons were performed exclusively in German. In 1851, the German sermons were halted, but the many German inscriptions still bear witness to the long period where it served as a German church.
I also managed to find a few different murals that were painted on the sides of the buildings: Soul of the Walls; the Middle Ages and the Sound Dues; History of the Churches; and the Maritime History. Very beautiful, colourful large murals. There was also a side street, Stengade 64–76, which has a row of beautiful 16th-century stone houses part of the Sound Dues residences. They are merchant houses from a time when Elsinore was flush with the profits of international trade. By 1426, Erik of Pomerania had given the city certain special mercantile privileges, and for a time Elsinore was Denmark’s second largest city. Erik of Pomerania had pushed for the development of the city by ordering its citizens to “build your city, increase its size and improve it with good merchant houses.” To encourage this, the King tempted the residents with tax cuts: If you built your house out of stone, you would not have to pay taxes for 10 years. (Those who built their houses out of wood only had five years without taxation!) The houses were built concurrently with King Frederick lI’s construction of Kronborg. It is obvious that the houses were built with the assistance of the same foreign craftsmen that were building for the King. The buildings in Stengade 72 and 74 are called “Leyel’s Houses.” For a number of years, they were owned by the Leyel family, an aristocratic bloodline of Scottish descent who came to be very influential in the city. For the house in no. 72, the windows are encased in stone, whilst no. 74 has a stepped gable. Across the front of the building there is a band of limestone with Gothic writing, and upon it there is written in Latin: “For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth. And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.” The horizontal bands were made during the Renaissance. In no. 76, it is the house of customs officer David Hansen. The property is one of the oldest pre-served private residences in Elsinore, built in 1579. The front of the building features bands of sandstone, and it is richly decorated. Above the windows, one can see a row of small busts. Two of the busts, made as portraits of a man and a woman, wear outfits from the time of Frederick II.
I then backtracked as it was around 10.30am, and after a quick toilet break, we walked to the Kronborg Castle. It was a short distance away, and thankfully the large tour groups hadn’t come yet. Kronborg Castle (aka Hamlet’s Castle) was the actual site that Shakespeare set Hamlet in — so you could see lots of Hamlet inspired souvenirs, and also staff doing tours in Hamlet outfits. Kronborg Castle has existed at Helsingør (Elsinore) since 1420. It’s been burned to the ground and rebuilt since, but always maintained its vital position at the head of the Øresund Sound. Ships passing into the Baltic Sea paid tolls at Kronborg Castle,and Helsingør was once one of the most important towns in Europe. In 2000, Kronborg Castle became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was quite nice, with the usual moat and large imposing walls. After touring the inside of the castle, which just showed some rooms and tapestries, I went to climb the Cannon Tower — 145 curving steps up to the top, and you got a pretty good view of the harbour. Gloomy day though, so the view wasn’t so breathtaking. After that, I explored the Casemates, which were the castle’s underground system of corridors and rooms. It was so dark and cramped, and I had to stoop many times to make my way through the tunnels, and at times having to use my flashlight just to light my way. I can only imagine how shitty and creepy it is at night… Oh boy. After seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, I regrouped with the rest of the family (they stayed for the short tour of the castle), and I went with Mom to see the chapel. Then, because I wanted to go off and see more stuff, knowing how slow the rest of them are, I left first. I went to the see their exhibition on “Monsters — Beastly beings with big emotions”. It was about monsters of the past, such as the basilisk, Kraken, with these monsters recreated from recycled materials by artist Shane Brox. His inspiration for this exhibition was human emotions — how everyone can feel and be a monster in their lives. He wanted to start a conversation about emotions in a fun and exciting way, because making the emotions visual through the monsters provide a creative and interactive way to explore this topic. It was quite a short exhibit, and the monsters were very cute. The souvenir shop sold these monster plushies, but they were unfortunately really expensive. Instead, I got myself this Kronborg castle coin. Before leaving the castle, I went up to see the flag bastion, which also provided a view of the sound. I finished everything by around 12pm, then walked to see the Museet for Sofart, or the Maritime Museum of Denmark, since it was just outside the castle. It was all about the shipping industry and history in early Denmark, and it also had on a special exhibition on the Haenyeo divers, showcasing photos and telling their stories. It was quite short and sweet, and I finished within 30mins. After that, I walked to see the Han statue (Han af elmgreen og dragset), this metallic sculpture of some guy on a rock. Then, I walked a little bit further to see the Dancer’s Fountain (Danserindebrønden af Rudolph Tegner), before heading back to the station to catch the RE train at 1303 back to Kobenhavn Hovedb. station. Mom and Kit they all had a light lunch at Helsingør, before taking the 1418 train back. The moment I got back, I went to the apartment and ate my strawberries and skyr with nuts for lunch. After resting a little and charging my phone, I planned to meet Mom directly at Torvehallerne. Torvehallerne is a food market selling fresh produce and fish, in addition to little stalls selling a variety of foods — smørrebrøds, pastries, empanadas, ice cream and more. I bought a few cherry tomatoes from the Torvehallernes Frugt & Grønt, which was located between the two glass halls — it sold such a wide variety of fruits and vegetables — tomatoes, purple carrots and cabbage, apricots, pumpkins — everything so beautiful and vibrant and FRESH! I wish I could’ve bought one of each to try… ah well. Mom bought the classic Danish treat flødeboller, which is a chocolate-covered cream balls topped with different stuff like pistachio, almonds, marzipan, from the famous stall Summerbird. It was packed with people, and just amazing to see the huge variety of foods available. By then, the gloomy weather had cleared and it was nice and cool, with some sunshine. We visited the nearby Flying Tiger shop, then walked to SMK, the National Gallery of Denmark. The National Gallery of Denmark (Statens Museum for Kunst) features Danish and international art from the past seven centuries. It features art from past and present Danish paintings and sculptures, French art, European art, as well as a special exhibit on Baroque art. Pretty nice, but too much art for my brain to handle. We finished it all within an hour, and then went back to the apartment to cook dinner. Initially, Mom told me she would have dinner with me, but as expected, she didn’t keep her word. She wasn’t willing to buy something back to eat with my cooked dinner, so I just told her to go eat with the guys at the Japanese restaurant they booked, Tokyo Restaurant. Ah well, what’s new there, right? At least she helped to cut and wash up I guess. Whilst the dinner was cooking, I made a quick trip down to Irma to buy another tub of Skyr, just to appease Mom that I was eating more food though I already ate at least 1kg worth of Skyr for lunch. Ah well, let’s hope I don’t get too fat then.
Quite happy with all the sights I managed to see today — basically everything that’s on my list and more, so that’s great. Tomorrow I plan to walk around in the morning until the Round Tower opens at 10am, then head to Tivoli to finally ride the rides and see it at 11am. Head for lunch, then see what else I can fill in the afternoon with.
Woke up at 6am, and surprised I managed to get a decent amount of sleep with the noise that was happening upstairs. Don’t know what they’re doing, but there was a lot of loud thumping noises and music too. Today’s weather looks good, as it is partially sunny and bright, so I think a good amount of walking is in order since its a rare decent weather. I found a few smorgesbrod places, since that’s something I haven’t tried and Mom too, and I think the best options are still at Tolverhavernne. But I also located a Vietnamese spring roll place, so I might go there after the bread, and then to La Galette for the buckwheat galettes and sweet crepes for the rest of them. After Mom woke up and had her coffee, I told her the plan and then got ready to leave. Papa wanted to come with us this morning, and as Kai was still sleeping, we decided to just let him be and inform him via Whatsapp that we were out. I was fine with Papa coming along, but made it clear to him that Mom and I would keep walking on first, and he could take his time to take his pictures. I decided to walk towards Vestre Kirkegård, where there was supposed to be a park. Along the way, there were some pretty nice murals to see — one of the wall murals was 85 years old, as we were kindly informed by this old gentleman. We also entered the Christ Church (Kristkirken), and it was a nice old church. We didn’t exactly reach the park, as it was almost 9am by then, and I had planned to go to the Planetarium before the Round Tower. Emily messaged me, and we decided to meet up at 10.20am at the Round Tower to go up together. So Mom and I backtracked to the Planetarium, which opened at 9.30am and saw the very very short exhibition on the Cosmos (about the Big Bang theory, stars, black holes), seeing a real moon rock and a very artsy exhibit on the Rings of Saturn. The museum shop was small, and they were selling popcorn which smelled so good. After that, we took the M3/M4 to Nørreport station, where we dropped by the Taffelbay bakery for Mom to get some breakfast — she got 3 small things to eat (almond florentine, like a little tart; a Berlinervaffel, looks like a dacquoise with a crunchy nut base and filled with mocha cream; and a Limonetti, a light Italian wreath cake with lemon zest) plus a cappucino. After sitting a while, we made our way to the Round Tower, passing by Normal and some lifestyle shop that looked like a Scandinavian version of Muji (we visited after the Round Tower). We met Emily, Papa and Kai there, and went up the tower together. There were just a few things to see, with the ultimate conclusion at the tower top where you could get a 360 view of the cityscape. There was also an exhibit on Meisen Kimono. The meisen kimono became popular in Japan in the first half of the 20th century. This happened after a cultural and technological exchange between Japan and the West made it possible to manufacture kimonos at lower costs than previously, when the silk kimono was preserved for the upper classes. Now, ordinary Japanese people were able to buy fashionable silk kimonos in bold new designs inspired by European art. Over the past 30 years, Danish artist and textile designer Henriette Fris has built up an impressive private collection of these kimonos. Her interest in kimonos was sparked when she was taught by a Japanese silk painter. Since then, she has collected over 100 unique and hand-sewn kimonos dating back to the heyday of the Meisen kimono between 1910 and 1955. During this period, Western art movements such as Art Nouveau, Art Deco, De Stijl and Cubism had a strong influence on Japanese artists’ kimono designs, and these kimonos later re-inspired Western textile design. The exhibition showcases long and short kimonos from Henriette Fris’ private collection. They sold some Japanese crafts like the cat and tote bags featuring the corgi and Japanese landscapes, but crazy expensive. After finishing the tower, Mom and I went to see Tivoli Amusement Park and the Tivoli gardens, passing through Jorck’s Passage. Along the way, we passed by the Frue Plads Marked, a 3-day craft fair that was occurring from the 10th- 11th Aug. It was full of people milling around the various artisan craft stalls, with most stalls selling ceramic handicrafts like cups, plates, and decorative vases. They were all so beautiful to look at, and the minimalistic designs and muted palettes were just so aesthetically pleasing. I wish I could buy a few of the pieces to bring back, but they were crazy expensive. There were a few stores also selling wool clothing and leather items, but mostly ceramic items. Mom and I decided to get a souvenir from the fair, this chameleon looking thing by a female artist — Mom got a vase and I got the chameleon thing itself. Though it was expensive, I decided it was worth the cost as I “made it up” from not going out for meals, plus I definitely did not intend to come back to Copenhagen again. Nope, just not appealing enough unlike Japan or Italy. By then, the sky had turned really gloomy and grey again, and we decided to drop off our stuff at the apartment first and refill water before heading to Tivoli. When we reached, it was packed like sardines, as by the time we arrived it was 11.30am. We managed to skip the queue with our Copenhagen card, but the card only guaranteed us a free entrance but not free access to the rides, where you had to pay 50–90DKK per ride. Nope. So we just walked around the fairgrounds and looked at the rides, seeing the very pathetic Tivoli aquarium, and generally just being disappointed by the whole thing. I believe it’s been overly hyped up, and that in reality it was just another amusement park, and not even as good as Disney World/Sea Japan. Oh boy, will Papa be disappointed. Anyway, we finished walking around, then took the train to Nørreport station to meet everyone else at Tolverhavernne Food Hall for lunch. We got there around 1310, and found Kai and Emily walking around, whilst Papa went to find a seat. Mom queued up a long time for the Hallernes Smørrebrød, getting the chicken salad (homemade chicken salad, bacon, and chervil), Danish meatball (meatball made with pork and veal, homemade potato salad, and thyme), Fish cake (fish cake made with cod, served with dill mayonnaise and hand-peeled shrimps) and I think the last one was Roast pork (roast pork with crispy crackling, homemade pickled red cabbage, and cucumber salad). Emily bought a hotdog thing to share, which Papa ended up eating the whole thing plus a Smørrebrød; Kai also got a hotdog too. Emily also bought cherries, figs, white and black cranberries to share, but ended up bringing back the cranberries cause it wasn’t popular. I got smørrebrød from Rørt: “leftovers” which was organic up-cycled vegetables from MATR, mushrooms, Jerusalem artichoke mayo, pickled cabbage and fried buckwheat on toasted rye; and their “Green Crush” which was smashed avocado, tomato relish, chili and coriander on toasted rye. After walking to find Papa, I finally settled to eat my first ever smørrebrød and it was DELICIOUS! My god, I loved the umami taste of it all, and just so creamy and tasty wow. Emily also got a green apple gelato since Papa ate her hotdog. Oh, I also got my purple carrot for dinner, and Kai bought chocolates for Heidi. After we finished up, we walked a short distance to La Galette, a French restaurant that is inspired by the Asterix French cartoon character. They served a variety of savoury buckwheat pancakes as well as sweet crepes — I ordered the Asterix (ratatouille, egg and chives), whilst Papa had the egg, bacon and ham one, Emily ordered the Confiture (sweet with black currant jam) and Mom had the Crêpe flambée (with banana and Grand Marnier). Mom got twice the dose of alcohol as the guy’s lighter didn’t work the first time round, so he came back with a fresh cup of alcohol to light up. It was really tasty and light, not heavy at all or overly salty. I really liked it, and am glad I decided to go for it today and not miss out. After we finished, Mom and I headed back to let me eat some yoghurt and strawberries, whilst the rest of them went to the aquarium. Kit unfortunately was feeling feverish this morning, so missed out the whole day’s outing, but thankfully was feeling better by lunchtime so would join for dinner. After yoghurt, Mom and I went to the Christianborg Palace, as Mom wanted to see the tapestries. I went with her to finish my tour of the place, seeing the ruins (just a bunch of rocks) and the kitchens (very boring). I bought Mom a magnet of the palace, and after that we departed back for the apartment. Papa was back before us, and that was cause he was tired and also Kai messed up. Apparently, he went to the wrong aquarium which wasn’t covered by the Copenhagen card, and entry was 120DKK. Papa didn’t want to pay entry, so left first. Oh well. I realised that Kai’s been creating a lot of negative energy this whole trip, making snide remarks about Kit to Emily, or making Kit seem like such a lazy shit who got lucky in life. He doesn’t even consider the fact that it may be embarrassing Kit or even Emily, and that maybe Kit actually is jealous of Kai being able to be a doctor. Jesus Christ. Anyway, got back and cooked dinner, finishing up my Thise skyr and feeling sad when I finished it cause I just wanted to keep eating more… oh well. Mom they all were going to El Meson for dinner, a Spanish tapas place. Hopefully the food is good, and no more food poisoning for tomorrow we’re all flying back. Papa’s flight was at 11am so he would set out first, while Mom, Kai and I would go to the airport later as our flights were around 2pm. I pray that Ryanair doesn’t delay the flights again, if not I’ll be so pissed. Really happy and proud of myself for eating the lunch out today and not caring about the salt/sugar content, but just embracing the delicious foods as is. I guess I knew that I would go back to eating a salt-free diet from tomorrow onwards again, and never intend to come back to Copenhagen, so 1 meal won’t kill me. And maybe it’ll actually help heal me. Oh yes, also am very surprised by how trusting the Danish people are — they just leave their bikes unlocked, supermarkets leave produce outside with no cameras or security guards watching. And their MRT station also uses a tap-in/out card that not everyone has to use, with no one really checking. Gosh.
Ah, last morning here in Copenhagen before heading back to the awful reality of life in the UK and school and OSCE retakes and PEG. Woke up at 6.30am, then did the usual warm up and tea time. Papa was up already cause his flight was at 11+am, so planned to leave the flat by 9.30am. Last night’s dinner was so-so according to Mom — they had meatballs, sausage, Iberico ham, paella etc. They wanted the grilled lambchops but they ran out! Anyway, they got back at midnight, as after dinner they went to Tivoli to see the lights. Mom said that all the rides were closed already, and they actually see Rick Astley performing live! Oh man, what a treat it would’ve been. Anyway, packed all the stuff to let Mom bring back on my behalf, and then I changed and left by 7.30am for Juno Bakery. Apparently, it was a really really famous and good bakery as it was opened by former cook of Noma, Emil Glaser. Their cardamom rolls are the most famous, and so I decided to try and get it for breakfast for Mom, Papa and Kai. The bakery was located at Århusgade, and I decided to talk a nice morning walk along the Peblinge Sø, which is like a river, and along the way saw some murals and this island of birds (Fugleøen, on Google Maps). The walk was nice and peaceful, and today was much warmer than usual despite it being cloudy. Lots of people out running and cycling, and the streets were quiet with few cars. By the time I reached the bakery, it was a really long queue. Suddenly, Mom told me that she wanted us all to leave at the same time as Papa, so I very stressed to get back on time. I queued, and bought 3 cardamom buns, 2 pistachio and 2 almond danish. I then chionged back for the flat, taking the M4 from Nordhavn station back to Kobehavn. Speed-walked back to the flat, and managed to get there by 9.30am for Papa and Mom to have a whole bun for themselves, fresh and hot (well, lukewarm). They really liked it, saying the pastry was soft and delicious. :D
After that, we took the train to the Copenhagen airport, and checked in. No queue for Papa’s business class, but a small queue for my Ryanair flight. Thankfully we reached by 10.30am, so hardly anyone there yet. Got my boarding pass and then proceeded through security. Kai was grumpy as shit, having to suddenly rush at the sudden change of plans and not being able to have a proper slow, sit-down breakfast. Oh well. After passing through security, the duty free shops and other shops inside the airport were pretty nice. I just walked around a little while waiting for Mom and Kai to pass through, and after a while managed to meet up with Kit and Emily. They had lunch at Yo! Sushi, and we all convened there eventually. After resting a while, and unfortunately not finding a 7-Eleven, I had to go to my boarding gate, F105. Sian, everyone else’s gate was C-something but mine had to be the furthest away. I was really tired and had a headache, but just powered through it anyway. No lunch, except for a few cherry tomatoes and nuts. Why can’t airports have shops selling greek yoghurt or skyr? Dang it man. Anyway, I’m just glad that the flight wasn’t delayed this time, though we did depart late by 20mins. Full flight, and I was so tired I dozed off for the majority of the flight. We landed at around 3.10pm, and then I went to the Stansted Express for the 3.43pm train to Tottenham Hale Court. Unfortunately, the train journey was extended, due to some guy trespassing on the tracks so yeah. After a 10min delay, we finally continued on and reached the station at around 4.30pm. I walked to the Victoria station line, and took another 30min journey back. By the time I reached Warwick, it was 5.05pm already, and Mom and Kai had just reached before me. Heidi was there already too — she was cooking them dinner tonight. I ate a few spoonfuls of yoghurt then got cooking, as Mom kindly helped me go sainsbury and the market man to buy veg and fruits. Man, was I so tired and my head was pounding. Whilst cooking, I boiled water to refill my bottles and unpacked at the same time. Only finished cooking by 6pm, and then finished by 6.30pm. Finally took a shower, and just updating the blog now. Man I am so tired…
Oh well, it was a pretty ok family trip, though lots of unhappiness and rough patches the first few days — ok, mostly everyday there’s something wrong. Just like today, Kit didn’t even bother saying or hugging me goodbye unlike he did with Kai and Mom. Guess I should just give up on him too.

This is a post about a couple of museums that I visited while I was in Copenhagen. As I was more determined nto not make my holiday into a busman’s trip, I somehow managed to find myself in yet another museum…
Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, or the New Carlsberg Museum, was founded by the same founder who launched the beer brand. The founding collection of the museum was the private collections of the Carl Jakobson. I wasn’t aware of how close the museum was from my hotel and had passed it many times while looking for other attractions.
The highlight of my visit was definitely the winter garden. When I was reading the information on tripadivsor, I thought it was another botanical garden. I didn’t realise how wrong I was until I arrived.
What greeted me first was a stream of different sounds: recordings of both natural sounds, such as birds’ chirping and wind, and artificial sounds. I heard something that reminded me the strange music of a theremin or a glass armonica. Sometimes the melody turned into a high pitch, but most of time it was as if the ruffling leaves were murmuring. The winter garden was smaller than I expected, but the magical sound somehow enlarged the place. I was lucky enough to secure a seat at the cafe next to the garden, and enjoyed a light lunch as if I were in the jungle (a very cold one indeed).
Another thing worth mentioned was a literary project for eight selected sculptures. Invited guest writers were asked to write a short passage, giving the marbles voice and perspectives. I was relieved when learning that the text was all translated in English and juxtaposed with Danish. Nevertheless, this was the moment when I wish I had mastered a foreign language so I didn’t need to rely on translation.
The visit was rather short, as a heavy rain in the morning soaked me through and I had to go back to my hotel to give an online talk to the Museum studies students at the Uni. Leicester. It was a fine museum; a typical “private-collection-turned-museum”. I appreciate the attempt of the literary projects, giving the collections new meaning.
2. Medicinsk Museion (Medical Museum), 1 Sep
I was over the moon when I learned that there was another medical museum in Copenhagen. No surprise, it is a university-affiliated museum, transformed with collections previously used in lectures. At first, I couldn’t find it upon arriving at the address: There was no sign on the street, but a thick wooden door. I then realised that thise must have been the feelings for many visitors when they went to the Whipple Museum: Being discouraged by the intimidating door, fearing that whatever was behind the door was far too important to be disturbed.
Originally I thought it was going to be another small and quirky museum that had no choice but to take advantage of every inch of space possible, that the arrangement and curation were going to be limited. However, I was surprised to find that first of all, the space was bigger than I thought (at least bigger than Whipple), and that there was a certain curatorial logic that went through different galleries. From a display that asked visitor to reflect upon difficult choices during Covid, to an interactive game about factors that extend or shorten humans’ lives expectancy, permanent displays showed a wide coverage of various yet common aspects regarding health and medicine. I especially appreciate the display of instruments for the visually impaired, such as Braille, typewriters, and computers. As a person who is severely myopic, I understand how these tools can make a huge difference to the blind.
www.museion.ku.dk
The Exhibitions “The Body Collected” exceeded my expectations. Making the best use of the human remains collected since the 18th century, the exhibition discussed life, death, deformity, and disease from macro to micro. Exhibitions as such always attracted people who simply wanted to snap pictures of the “freaks” and the “deformed”, i.e. skeletal remains or samples left by people with disability. I don’t deny that the power of genes never stops amazing me, yet every time I see a giggling teenager (usually they were there only because of some private summer camp, and that a cultural visit was a must to satisfy the parents) laughing while taking pictures of “things”, I understand more why there are rules in UK museums that forbid people from any photography. Visitors should always be reminded of the magnitude of historical superstition, prejudice, misunderstanding, and the emotions that accompanied all stillborns of deformity and victims of disease when being presented with human remains. On the other side, UK museums are probably the only country that actually put out signs that forbid photography when it comes to human remains, and not every museum abides the rule (e.g. archaeological remains). It is always surprising to see no effort is made in European medical museums to remind people of the ethics and respect, but truly, what position museums have to do so?
Before my visit ended at a strange temporary exhibition on germs and intestinal health (about digestion and of course, waste), I gladly found that I could buy acopy of the display text for “The Body Collected”, English available. I didn’t have time to read all the labels, but the book provided wonderful, high-res photos of the collections, accompanied with paragraphs written by the curators who explained the context and stories of the dead. After reading the book, I felt that the body parts, severed and partially presented, reclaimed a bit of humanity. It as very important for me.
3. Danish Architecture Centre, 5 Sep
I wasn’t planning on visiting the DAC, but eventually stepped inside since it was included as free entry in my Copenhagne Pass. I’m glad that I did visit this place, as it was very informative.
I had heard many positive comments about Danish architecture, that it was one of the best when talking about modern design. Although I never pay any attention on architecture, I can still apreciate the curatorial decision made in the gallery that presented the philosphy and creativity of Danish architecture. One thing I took away was the importance of techniques to make bricks and bricklaying, as well as the design to let all Copenhagen citizens enjoy water. When looking at the illustration, I remembered the long jetty that I walked by every morning in front of my hotel, where I imagined would be fully packed with swimmers in summer.
I did not visit that many museums when I was in Copenhagen; instead, I went to a few famous historical royal palaces. As my attention now is more focus on how museums manage and care for their collections on the public side, I don’t think I know enough to critique the management of royal palaces and heritage sites. As magnificent as they are, I don’t intend to make this blog into a travel diary.
Copenhagen was a beautiful place that reminded me of Amsterdam: Water, canal, bikes, and clear sky above neat city planning. Yet it is indeed a city of its own distinctive charm.
This blog post was very much delayed in publishing, as I was soon caught in a whirl wind of work and life changes when I came back to the UK: New job, new role, things to learn, etc..

Copenhagen is an incredible food city — from three star meals to hot dog stands, there is something for everyone. I booked my recent trip to eat at Noma one more time before it closes, and I was thrilled to also get a chance to dine at Alchemist. In addition, we enjoyed delicious meals at Marv & Ben, Baest, Silbauers, and Doomsday Deli. The only meal we weren’t thrilled about was a lunch at Selma’s. Reviews of each meal are below.
In addition, our activity each day was to try bakeries and cafes in search of the city’s best pastries. My ranking of bakeries is summarized here. You can also read my trip report from 2021 here.

A new cookbook revealing the hidden gems of Copenhagen cuisine is set to take American readers by storm later this month as Trine Hahnemann’s Copenhagen Food arrives in bookstores across the country.
The Danish chef and food entrepreneur’s latest work is a sprawling exploration of her hometown and the hyggelig cafés and restaurants that make it a unique standout in the global gastronomic map. Chapters covering eight boroughs, including Nyhavn & Gammelholm, Frederiksstaden, Christianshavn, Central Copenhagen, Vesterbro & Frederiksberg, Nørrebro, and Østerbro, and also Outside Copenhagen, are paired with over 70 local and traditional recipes and Trine’s own personal stories of living in and rediscovering each neighbourhood.
#DenmarkInNY met up with Trine Hahnemann to discuss her view on how Copenhagen food culture stands out from the rest of New Nordic cuisine and what the sophisticated New York palate can learn from Copenhagen’s food culture.
DKNY: Can you tell me a little bit about yourself and how you became inspired to produce a cookbook about Copenhagen food culture?
TH: I am native to Copenhagen and I have lived here all my life (a part from a few years in New York and London). I have worked in food for more than 25 years and I thought that now that Copenhagen has become a recognized gastronomic destination I would really like to write about the everyday food culture and how Copenhagen forms part of my history. I also wanted to go back to the roots and tell about where we are coming from.
DKNY: Is there something special that characterises Copenhagen food culture and distinguishes it from the rest of New Nordic cuisine?
TH: Yes, the ‘smørrebrød’ (open sandwiches). The bread culture — especially rye bread. And, of course, all the soft sweet buns we eat where the most iconic Danish is “kanelkringle.” Then the most diffuse traditional fast food is the hotdog, which comes in traditional, modern and organic versions.
DKNY: New Nordic cuisine has built a broad fan base over the past few years but it is now a known entity. Can Copenhagen food culture help maintain New Nordic’s popularity?
TH: Copenhagen is at the epicentre [of New Nordic cuisine] and at the same time finding its own identity away from New Nordic. Restaurants with food from around the world are opening here and I think seasonal, terroir and traditional and cutting-edge sustainable solutions are the future of Copenhagen restaurants.
DKNY: New York is a very diverse city when it comes to food. Is there something that New Yorkers learn from Copenhagen’s food culture?
TH: I would say the culture around eating out is relaxed. Hygge is important in sharing a meal. The other unique aspect is the local produce and the diversity of the seasons. We have more like 12 seasons instead of four, in part because many things only grow here for a very short time. Moreover, restaurants work directly with producers. We are close to the country and distances are short therefore local collaborations are easier.
DKNY: What is a staple of Copenhagen food culture that New Yorkers absolutely need to discover?
TH: The smørrebrød and trying out the lunch culture of having smørrebrød, beer and snaps at some of the classic lunch restaurants thereby trying the whole flow of a Danish lunch. The other thing is bicycling around and trying the different street food markets.

I did not have a single Danish when I was travelling in Copenhagen. Regret? Maybe.
I was in Copenhagen for holiday between 29 Aug and 6 Sep. It was a trip that I had been waiting for a long time, despite the fact that it might not seem so according to the post here: It seems that I just got back from Amsterdam, and whoosh, I was on holiday again! Only I knew I badly needed a holiday. I was aware that if I didn’t have any break before I started my new job at the MAA, I probably would’ve lost my mind.
As usual, it was a busman’s holiday, i.e. plenty of museums and heritage sites. This post will talk about the aquariums and botanical garden I visited.
I remember that we had to choose from five different topics for the last module (Specialisms) prior to the research dissertation in postgrad. The options were Museum & Knowledge (which I ended up with), Digital Museum, Education, Heritage, and Green Museum. The last option did not receive anyone signing up, and I felt really bad for Prof Unwin, but that was the first time when I learned that “green museum” wasn’t limited to environmental activists and climate crisis issues, but included collection-wise aspects.
When talking about the museum sector, botanical gardens are often included, e.g. The Cambridge Botanical Garden is part of the University Cambridge Museums (UCM). It is because the plant sciences associated with developing knowledge, and to conserve both tangible and intangible assest (in this case, the living plants in botanical garden and the pressed dried seeds and specimens in a herbarium) is as equally fundamental as other types of museum professions. On the basis of caring and protecting living plants, including zoos as a type of museum isn’t an idea so strange. An interesting and simple metaphor I now often use for explaining to outsiders is that a botanical garden is for living plants, a herbarium for the dead, a zoo and an aquarium for living animals, and finally a museum of natural science (usually iconic with a whale skeleton, or even better, a dinosaur) is for the dead, such as taxidermy.
A little sidenote to my postgrad and green museum course is that doing a two-month placement studies at the Leicester Zoo was one of the 200 available posts then. I don’t think anyone chose to spend a summer with zoo animals. Nevertheless, it makes sense to me now.
When I was planning for Copenhagen, I learned that Den Blå Planet (National Aquarium Denmark), an aquarium close to the airport, was the biggest aquarium in northern Europe. I was immediately attracted by the wonderful photos of blue water and the cool sea tunnel and booked the ticket when it was available. It had been probably more than twenty years since I last visited an aquarium.
I had no idea what to expect when I stepped inside, which was probably why I discovered surprise one after another. Indeed, large built-in-wall fish tanks were wonderful, but I appreciated the touch-screen beside each tank that explained what the sea animals were, where to find them, and if they were endangered. That was a great deal information. There was only one short-coming: Some touch screens mentioned an audio guide from the aquarium official app, which I did download, but it did not work at all.
Here are a few features that I really liked during my visit, and I think they are, though not unique in aquariums and zoos, equally functional as traditional education role of a museum.
There were four “shows” that I participated: One was touching sea stars and flounders, with a staff member explaining the species; one was letting the doctor fish eat the dead skin on my hand; one was an hourly feeding show for the cownose ray; the last one was watching the staff feeding the Amazonian pirahnas.
These shows are slightly different in types and they represent how zoos and aquariums engage with audiences. First one is direct interaction with the collections (in this case, living animals) with supervision and demonstration, and the interaction is part of the experience. Second one is similar to the first, but without supervision. In my case, I was playing with the doctor fish while reading the panels about these funny creatures. Third one is a mixture of fundamental animal conservation and education programme, since feeding the cownose rays are behind-the-scene task brought to the front for the visitors. It was also a direct interaction since the explainer gave away little shrimp pieces for kids to feed the ray. Finally, the last one is just as the third one, but without the visitors actually feeding. I’m pretty sure the reputation of pirahnas played a part.
One thing in common is that both staff members and the wall panels were the integral part of the whole experience. I learned a lot more than I expected, especially about the Amazonian pirahnas, that they didn’t really munch on people immediately if a poor sould fell into the water. Contrary to the stereotypical image portrayed by Hollywood movies, the fish are actually afraid of humans since we are larger. They also have natural risk aversement, which is against things that move, so it is unlikely that they would actively attack a drowning human. I learned about these facts by asking the conservator, and she did say that movies had more influence than them. It is exactly like the movie Jaws, which makes people think sharks will pursue swimmers no matter what, despite most cases suggest otherwise.
This might come across more of an independent situation, where the staff members were dedicated to telling people how sea animals become part of huamans’ diet. Whereas in museums, I seldom hear or read that some collections are good for making a house decoration or have high value in the market (perhaps topics alike would appear in marketing meetings, but I doubt that general public would be interested in knowing what decisions were made to produce the souvenirs they take home with!).
When I was poking (gently) the star fish, the conservator, a passionate young man, explained to me that some other fish I had touched were flounders, which were common on dinner plate. I told him that sea urchins were delicious, too in Asia. He agreed and said that such things were important to teach the children, that how their food came from. To be honest, I was a bit surprised by his candor, but really appreciated.
I also recalled reading an article years ago, which talked about how Taiwan “celebrated more seafood culture rather than sea culture”. As an island, and actually, one of the islands of defining status in both Austrolasian linguistic family and Oceanic diaspora, Taiwanese do not have a high literay in respecting and living in peace with the sea. Surely we consume tons of seafood, and most of us, though may not recognise the formal names, are good at distinguishing levels of freshness. Yet seafood is only one tiny party of living amid the ocean. The eagerness of the conservator, who took pride in educating the kids on learning the food source, made me wonder if an aquarium could strike a balance between modern scientific conservation and anthropological understanding for sea/ocean.
Here are some of the photos I took, of things I found worth remembering. Regretably, sometimes I forgot to note what the fish tank label said. The caption is about what I remember.
2. Botanical Garden, 3 Sep 2023
Besides visiting an aquarium, I also went to the Botanical Garden of the University of Copenhagen. Having stayed in the UK and Europe for some time though, I find it interesting how the Europeans emphasise and advertise greenhouses with tropical and exotic plants, which are usually bananas, cocoa, and palm trees. What I mean by “interesting” is that these greenhouses, though after centuries, far gone by the time they were built when anything “oriental” would definitely be a showstopper, are still being considered a highlight for visitors nowadays. I am always amused by the idea how my father would say, that his daughter travels far just to see bananas while she can see them in the garden!
I also feel a bit embarrased whenever I visit any botanical garden or herbarium, because I a) don’t know anything about horticulture or botany. b) am terrible at keeping plants alive. and c) even though I tried to take notes, the Latin terms and many English names never intend to stay in my mind very long. I am a bit worried that I didn’t make the best use of such invaluable resource.
The Botanical Garden, besides featured greenhouses of palm trees and bananas (it was incredibly steamy, so warm and wet that I couldn’t breathe. It was a sign that I had been transformed by the European climate!), boasted its butterfly room. I was not prepared for it; I thought the butterflies were specimens, or we would see them behind glass. I was sorrily wrong…
I don’t like butterflies. There are many things I don’t like that surprise people, and butterflies are one of them. I’m squeamish when seeing them: thin legs, fragile fat body, and I never am able to predict which way they fly towards to. I find them incredibly beautiful, though, especially if I don’t have to duck.
I couldn’t say out loud about how I felt about butterflies, because clearly everyone was amazed, feeling like living a Snow White’s daily life. I also felt a bit sad, because Taiwan used to be called the island of butterflies, and I only got to experience a brief moment of the name in a foreign country.
There was a large part of the Botanical Garden close due to reconstruction and conservation, so I didn’t get to wander around. Nevertheless, it was a wonderful visit. I will have to visit the one in Cambridge (shamefully I still haven’t been there) to compare the two.
It was nice to step out of my confort zone to see what other public educational space looked like. It was a valuable experience, especially the aquarium, as I don’t think there is anything as such in the UK (or maybe I should look closer!).

Copenhagen is unlike other European cities. It was apparent the moment when, exhausted after a 12 hour plane ride and turned away from our hotel for arriving too early, we decided to brave a nippy morning for a stroll around the city.
It was past 8am but the Radshuspladsen, or City Hall Square and “bustling heart of Copenhagen”, and the Stroget, a pedestrian street in the old city, is still eerily empty.
Where are the tenacious tourists? In fact, where is everyone? Are we in the right place?
One of the few souls we saw were these guys standing in the middle of a square, turning a decapitated cow on a spit.
Freezing, we gravitated to the warmth of the open fire like a bunch of hobos.
“That is the biggest lamb I’ve seen,” said the husband, whose brains have obviously stopped functioning in the cold.
“Oh, its a cow…and it will only be ready in a few hours,” says the blond-hair, blue-eyed one casually, like it’s perfectly normal to be roasting a whole cow out on the streets like this. “I’ve been up since last night getting this thing ready so, yeah, it’s just a few more hours to go.”
We might have missed a fine Viking feast but we did end up in Holm’s Bager, an ugly modern bakery which serves perhaps the most exquisite takeout sandwiches in the world. It was also our first time trying tebirkes, or Danish poppy seed rolls.
By this time, the city was coming slowly to life and, with freshly made sandwiches in hand, we continued to Slotholmen, or Castle Island, where the Christiansborg Palace, the Parliament, the Supreme Court, Ministry of Finance and the Borsen — the former World Trade Centre of Scandinavia — all reside. We were content with admiring these fine collection of buildings from the outside (although all we really wanted to do at this point was to go back to our hotel room and hibernate).
Standing there shivering in my cardigan and boots however, I saw more badassery… namely, a bunch of Viking descendants swimming competitively in the river in nothing more than swimsuits and trunks in 12 °C weather.
The Andersen Hotel was a fine place to crash, if not for its flawed check-in process. We were treated to a free wine hour after emerging from a good long nap, and played chess in the lobby while the weather continued to suck.
It was also close to the Skydebanehaven, a public park filled with climbing frames, a sand pit, a wading pool as well as stuff that would’ve been stolen / destroyed a long time ago if this had been another country, like balls and trikes. It was not just better than the city parks in Europe, it was free.
Copenhagen has several castles you can visit, but we decided on Rosenborg Castle because it was supposed to be the most captivating of the lot. And I totally understood why: its owner, King Christian IV, was a lover and fighter par excellence, with his hipster braid and Roman toga.
At his finest hour at the age of 67, after being injured by shrapnel during a naval battle against Sweden, he bounced right back up and continued waging war as if nothing happened. Not only that: he also had the shrapnel pieces removed from his eye and forehead later and made into earrings as a gift for his mistress.
The castle is infused with the personality of its owner: There was the room of mirrors — not to be mistaken for the less hedonistic Hall of Mirrors in Versailles — where he dunked the dingus in; there was the room where he reclined on a throne carved entirely from narwhal tusk; there was the room where he breathed in his last breath at the ripe old age of 70, after fathering 25 kids (with two wives and three mistresses).
Then, there was also the treasury, which looked like P. Diddy or Jay-Z’s personal wardrobe, where you can ogle at his golden crown and various other objects dripping in jewels.
It was hard not to walk out of the Rosenborg without wondering who, really, are these people? Why do they make Chuck Norris look like a pansy? And what do they eat, apart from whole headless animals?
Some of these questions were answered during our visit to the National Museum — which should be renamed the House of Horrors for its macabre exhibitions (see below). It started out innocently enough: we began with stuff left behind by their long dead — but no doubt, once strapping — Viking ancestors, like horned helmets and rune stones proclaiming heroic deeds.
And once you walk further in thinking what a nice, family-friendly museum this is, the museum delivers its sucker punch: bones animals and humans, mummified corpses, the head of a little girl who met a gruesome end — no doubt a victim of sacrifice. Further proof that you don’t wanna mess with these guys.
Then, as if wandering through halls containing dead bodies and decapitated heads weren’t creepy enough, there was also a charming area devoted entirely to old-fashioned doll houses. And a scary Hitler puppet for effect.
The children’s section — supposedly excellent — was closed while we were there but we managed to quell our disappointment by having a go at dressing up in the height of 17th century Danish fashion. Our littlest one, unfortunately, refused to humiliate himself, so here’s the three of us.
We eventually made our way to Christiana, a “free city” that sprung up in 1971, when 700 free-spirited Danes established a squatters’ colony in abandoned military barracks just a stone’s throw away from the parliament. They have survived multiple police crackdowns and skyrocketing property prices to remain standing today, several decades later, as a ragtag community of idealists, hippies, potheads, and artists who formed their own rules and built their own homes.
I was, however, rather skeptical: descendants of possibly the most fearsome people on earth, now enlightened new-age hipsters? Who believe in free love? And who would rather go vegan than a-pillaging?
I NEED TO SEE THESE PEOPLE FOR MYSELF.
And so we went — the kids mesmerized by all the rainbow colors and recycled art around them.
Down Pusher Street we went too, although we didn’t realize until we saw a bags of grass on a cart staffed by a shifty-eyed man.
We went to Nemoland, hoping to get some falafel and hummus but was put off by all the cigarette smoke. So we had Thai food at the beautiful Cafeloppen where the waitress was high-as-a-kite but the food was great.
And then we explored some more. We saw plenty of tourists; other families with young children; a guy, in handcuffs, getting escorted away by three policemen. I was especially delighted to come across a smoky little tavern where a bunch of old Asian grandpas and grandmas sat around, smoking hashish and being all ‘Whats Upppp’ instead of tending to the grandchildren like they do over here. That just made my day.
We ended up in a derelict-looking building that would’ve made any sane person nervous, but was actually home to a really great little art gallery. A group of musicians were inside, playing folk music.
My kids started flailing their arms and stomping around to the tune and, before I could rush over and restrain them like a panicked nurse at a mental hospital, a lady stopped me with a nod and a smile.
“It’s ok. Just let them be.”
And she handed them a cookie each.
She didn’t look like she was ready to take me on with an axe or something. She just seemed very kind, which was so unlike the Parisian lady in Montmartre who burned my son’s cheek with her cigarette and snapped at my husband for not being careful, or the Norwegian ladies who glared at us as our kids jumped around in the back of a stationary car during a ferry crossing.
I felt, at that moment, that we came to the right place. Even if we did see someone being arrested, we came to the right place.
And you know what? Copenhagen may not win a beauty or popularity contest anytime soon, but the people here are something else.
STAY Andersen Hotel Clarion Hotel Copenhagen Airport Sleek, modern rooms a short, indoor walk from the arrivals hall and copious breakfast make this place a great bet for those staying two nights or less. Also located less than a five minute indoor walk to the train station, where regular train takes you right to the city centre in just ten minutes. Early check-ins possible. $$ Generous, good quality breakfast (think smoked salmon, jamon iberico and amazing croissants), free wine hours, comfortable rooms and excellent location in the middle of the city. Unfortunately however, the CONCEPT24, which is unique to the hotel and means that your room is available for 24 hours after check-in, is absolutely useless, especially during peak tourist season. $$$

Previous: San Francisco — Copenhagen Scandinavian Airlines SK936 Flight Report
However short time I have in a city, I still enjoy taking public transportation not to save money, but to experience subways and buses in different countries as much as possible. So I took M2 metro line from airport to downtown Copenhagen. It was a 20 min short ride, but cost as many as 30 DKK ($4.5). Scandinavian price is no joke even to a Bay Area resident like me.
Copenhagen metro: not the best I’ve taken, but pretty comfortable and clean, definitely a far cry from the US ones.
I planned to start from the City Hall at the western end of downtown area, and made my way to the famous Little Mermaid statue in the east, which would cover most of Copenhagen’s central area. That is from the statue of Anderson to the statue to one of the most famous characters he created. As I walked out the metro station, to my surprise, I saw a sea of flags of not Denmark, but Palestine. It was in the midst of the Hamas-Israeli war, shortly after the Israeli army entered the Gaza Strip.
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has always been one that’s close to my heart. Personally having been to both Israel and Palestine, I’ve heard stories from both sides, and attended events of various sorts from both sides as well. So I stayed here to observe for a while, seeing the impassioned crowds waving the flags and chanting the political slogan “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.”
In the middle of chaos, I took some time to walk toward the other end of the plaza to see Mr Hans Christian Anderson, arguably the most famous person every tourist to Copenhagen would come to visit. Anderson sit on his chair with a top hat, looking at the other side, seemingly not paying attention to the ongoing protests on the plaza at all. He seemed to see these quite often and just wanted to chill.
As I decided to leave the plaza and began my walking tour, the rally also ended. So I followed the crowds to the Strøget, the famous pedestrian, car-free street in Copenhagen. The street seemed to be a touristy area with many souvenir stores, many of which were named “Viking” conveniently, and “exotic” restaurants. In retrospect, I really should have had dinner here.
Flyers on the wall were about the Palestine rally I saw earlier.
With crowds still chanting Palestinian slogans, I continued walking down the Strøget, while occastionally left the crowds to explore some stores briefly. A huge pulpit was seen placed next to this fountain, where Quran was played loudly admist the Scandinavian night. Seeing a group of mid-age Danish people sitting on the other side of the plaza hanging out and drinking, I wondered how they thought about the scene. Did they embrace such diversity or else?
Continuing walking eastward, architectures looked more and more modern. Fountains and statues could be seen once in a while. Then a market full of crowds came to my sight. Even thought it was still early November, the Christmas market had already taken place.
I personally can’t stand sitting outside in such a cold weather, but it seemed fitting to the Danish. People dressing in heavy jackets came together to chill, drink beers ,and share sausages and desserts on this Saturday night. The price for everything looked insanely high though. As a sausage cost nearly $20, I just observed the crowds.
I also visited a department store that fortunately was still open. Such stores are good places to observe local lives, so I always make them top on my list when I travel. Everything in the supermarket, from vegetables to seafood, seemed very pricey. Even though I later found my conversion rate was a little bit off, these prices were still way higher than in the Bay Area, which was already one of the most expensive places in the world.
As I walked pass the seafood counter and saw a lady sorting out seafood, a surreal feeling occurred to me. Travel brought me to this random place to encounter this random person, which wouldn’t have had anything to do with my life otherwise.
This is exactly what I travel for.
I planned to have dinner in the department store, but it didn’t really have a food court (only one serving desserts and wine). So I continued walking. Finally seeing Danish flags outside souvenir stores after a while.
This iconic building with all the dazzling lights was also a department store (for some reason I forgot to take any photo inside). I have arrived at the Kongens Nytorv (lit king’s new market) and Nyhavn (lit New harbor) area. This is also where the postcard-worthy photos of the colorful facades and old ships were taken (something along these lines). There was a McDonald right outside the department store, but I didn’t feel like having it as my only meal in Denmark. Big mistake, but we’ll come back to this.
To my disappointment, the facades were not very well-lit, which made them not very colorful. Both sides of Nyhavn were full of fancy restaurants that would probably cost me an arm to eat and a leg to dine inside (seriously $60 for a simple meal?) I was unsure whether these were tourist traps, or just typical Scandinavian prices.
Walking to the end of the harbor, I took a photo of the iconic new opera building across the harbor, under chilling winds. I thought the Little Mermaid, as popular as it is, has to be located in somewhere full of crowds. However the lively vibe I had experienced so far suddenly faded away. I realized it was really just the walkable Strøget area that was lively, and now I had encountered another side of Copenhagen.
Amalienborg was the official residence of the Danish royal family, where the Queen of Denmark resides today! However, it was only serenity that I could experience at night. A few royal guards wearing huge bearskin hats were patrolling the plaza. They would walk from one end of the building to a specific corner, stand still, turn around, and walk back to the original spot, so disciplined and well trained as if they were programmed robots. But as the palace where the head of state resides, I felt the security level was way lower than expected.
So on the plaza in this tranquil night, there were really only the royal guards wearing bearskin hats, King Frederick V on the horseback (he was actually king of both Denmark and Norway, when these two countries used to be one), and myself. I was observing both of them, while both the king and the guards were just going about their day (or night), ignoring my presence.
I was desperate to have dinner at any time, but few restaurants could be found. I made a small detour to a nearby street, where there were Khmer, Thai, and Vietnamese restaurants, presumably opened by immigrants. My experience told me that these places would offer foods at reasonable price. However, they all turned out to be high-end restaurants that cost $40 a meal.
Other restaurants I went to either was closed, or cost even more. I really wondered how an average person got to survive here.
At least I was glad to see the Danish road signs! Whoever plays Geoguessr would recognize this typical Danish signs, screaming Denmark, at first glance.
So I was approaching my destination, the Little Mermaid, walking in hunger and increasingly brutal winds. I realized the statue was located in a coastal park, with no stores or restaurants around as I imagined before. My final shot to not starve would be this seafood restaurant on the way there.
I almost thought the place was closed too, because I couldn’t even open the door as fierce winds blew onto it. It turned out to be a food court with many restaurants to choose from, ranging from seafood, authentic Mexican food, Argentinian grills……. and even Japanese sushi.
I ended up having this poke bowl as my only meal in Copenhagen. The famous Hawaiian and Californian-inspired dish that came with fish, avocado and random vegetables. Seriously it could not be less Danish than this. After I came out from the much needed restroom, I wondered how funny it would be to write about this journey, sharing about the authentic Danish food that Danish people get to eat in their everyday lives. I really should have eaten McDonalds or Burger King, or even the Chinese restaurant I first saw.
But hey, at least I had walked across nearly all of Copenhagen!
After such an authentic Danish dining experience, I went on to see something truly Danish: the Little Mermaid. The coastal park seemed to be a fun place to visit during the day, with good trails to bike if I hadn’t been carrying a 10kg backpack. Few tourists would visit the Little Mermaid in such a chilly night. In fact, only two local Danish dudes were there chatting. They came to me asking for cigarettes, which was indeed very fitting for this setting. Too bad I didn’t have one.
On my way walking to the metro station, I realized I had drunk too much water when I had the Danish delights, and my bladder couldn’t stand anymore. Unlike my dinner, I had no luck this time — absolutely nowhere was open in 10pm; the public restroom at train station was hopelessly occupied forever; however neat and clean Copenhagen’s metro was, it didn’t have any restroom in the station.
I tried to focus on my brain instead of my bladder. At one point I almost had no options but to take metro all the way to the airport, just for its guaranteed public restrooms. The department store and McDonalds in downtown, only 2 stations away from here, finally occurred to me. As I ran out the metro, the former seemed to be closed, but the latter, fortunately, was open.
I ran all the way to the basement, rushing into the restroom, only to see some ladies waiting in line. As I quickly turned back and about to ran out, a lady said “it’s fine! it’s both genders!”
“I promise I’ll eat McDonald next time Im in this city.” I pondered, As I used the gender-neutral restroom.
Walking out of McDonalds, I took metro to Ørestad. This is where I would stay tonight, somewhere with reasonable price and only two stations from the airport. Since my flight would depart 8am the next day, proximity was the top priority.
I walked through the already closed shopping mall and exited via the confusing parking lot stairs to avoid the ruthless freezing winds.
The hotel was a good deal for what I paid in such an expensive city. But my room turned out to be the final room down the hallway. This is very scary and something I would like to avoid at all cost. Legend has it that, the final room down the hallway always……
had the worst wi-fi signals…….took me forever to upload my Strava activity.
And was I only 5 hours into the trip? Why did I feel it’s already been 5 full days…….

I originally wrote this article in Danish for Politiken Byrum. Here’s the English translation.
Copenhagen is about to get a unique opportunity to learn from other global cities when it hosts the C40 Cities Conference. The question is whether a city as smug as Copenhagen is willing to exploit the opportunity. I doubt it.
The C40 network is bolstered by strong city brands with renowned mayors and is trying to act as a counterweight to national governments and their molasses-like politics, with an agenda strong on action. Cities are an absolute key in the fight against climate change but we’re not exploiting their potential near enough. Copenhagen is in the C40 club, since the city’s status quo is on a high level. Perhaps Lord Mayor Frank Jensen might even drag his bike out of the garage for the event. THAT would be epic.
It is clearly an advantage to work internationally in urban planning and design and say that I come from Copenhagen. It gives street cred. In 2007, I coined the word copenhagenize as a way of describing how other cities could be inspired by all the — back then — exciting things the city was doing. The word hit a nerve around the world.
It is quite telling that I came upon copenhagenize rather than something like denmarkification. Regardless of which political block is at the nation’s helm, the state still focuses on motorways and car sales, as though it’s still 1955. They haven’t understood the concept of induced demand — if you make more space for cars, you get more cars. It is hard to see the difference between the different transport ministers. The latest incarnation has recently been in Oslo to “look at electric cars”. We don’t need fewer cars in Denmark. No no no. Just different cars.
For years I have put Copenhagen on a pedestal regarding sustainable development and I have been an eager exporter of inspiration and transferable solutions with Copenhagen as a role model. I’ve worked in over 100 cities and, with my tv-series about urbanism The Life-Sized City — I curate so many amazing things that are happening in cities around the world. For 12 years I have taken hundreds of politicians, policymakers and professionals around my city on bicycle urbanism tours and I have given countless keynotes and interviews about the city. The pedestal, however, is getting wobbly.
Where arriving home in Copenhagen from my travels used to be pure pleasure, it is now often a bit of a bummer. There are simply so many amazing things happening out there in the world that Copenhagen is looking more and more old school. The brand is dusty and tired. Lately I have to answer puzzled questions from colleagues like, “why the hell did you build a Metro instead of reestablishing the tram network you removed in 1972?!” As on urban planning colleague from France put it, “car-centric cities build metros and people-friendly cities build tramlines”.
I live in Frederiksberg, a city in its own right in the heart of Copenhagen. It’s too small to be in the fancy C40 club but brags ad nauseum about being “The Green Heart of the Capital”. Here on the corner of Godthåbsvej and Nordre Fasanvej, where I’m writing these words, more than 30,000 cars groan past my windows. Windows that are consistently dirtier than any other apartment I’ve lived in in the capital. Frederiksberg is building underground parking garages but without removing the same number of street parking spots. Induced demand is a foreign concept to them, too. It’s wild to think that with the current parking licence fees for residents (only about €100 per year) it takes 900 years to pay off one underground car parking spot. Rumour has it the parking prices will increase, but let’s see if they actually rise to a price that makes sense. It costs 50,000 Danish kroner (€6700) just to paint and maintain an on-street parking spot. So the fee should be at least that.
The city is throwing around taxpayer money like it’s going out of style in the form — among other things — of expensive noise reducing asphalt. If you lower the speed limit from 50 km/h to 30 km/h it will give you the same noise reduction in our densely-populated neighbourhoods as the new asphalt — for a lot less money. The Black Heart of the Capital.
I’m an optimist but I’m also an impatient idealist. I simply have to be inspired in my daily work in order to bother continuing. Luckily there is inspiration to be had around the world. If Copenhagen dares to stand up and kick their laurels aside, here’s a quick and dirty list of modern ideas they can learn from.
Former Mayor of Paris from 2001–2014, Bertrand Delanoë spelled it out perfectly: “The fact is that cars no longer have a place in the big cities of our time”. He is far from alone on this. The woman who took over from him, Anne Hidalgo, is trying to continue where Delanoë left off. Mayors around the world have been quoted for similar, modern statements. It is simply the new normal to work towards fewer cars in a city. Okay, maybe not THAT new. Since the 1990s, French cities with over 100,000 inhabitants have been obliged by national law to develop mobility plans that would reduce car traffic and strengthen public transport, walking and cycling. Maybe when the current transport minister is done with looking at those Norwegian cars he could get started on intelligent legislation.
What else do we have? Hmm.
Over the past four years Oslo of all places has removed over 5000 car parking spots and made it impossible to drive into the city center unless you live there. Amsterdam plans to remove 10,000 parking spots for cars between now and 2025 in favour of making the city safer and adding public space. Helsinki is almost proud when they say it won’t be necessary to own a car in the city in the near future. They’re putting their money on MaaS (mobility as a service) instead. Vancouver is trying to turn the transport budget paradigm on its head — money goes to public transport, walking and cycling first and whatever is left goes to cars.
Now it’s getting awkward. Congestion charges. The national government promised us on around Copenhagen a few years and then failed to deliver. They’re a success in Stockholm, Oslo, Milan, London and Singapore and there is now serious talk of implementing them in many cities, including New York and Belgian cities. Are you as tired as me that your tax money goes to benefiting motorists who don’t even live in — or pay taxes in — your city? Shouldn’t we try to get some of that money back? Other cities have done the math.
Soon 85% of all the streets in Paris will be 30 km/h zones and the “30 Zone” movement that started in Germany in 1986 continues to roll. Soon Central London will slow down to 30 km/h like over 150 cities around Europe. Outside my windows it’s 50 km/h — in Denmark’s most densely-populated city.
I can go on. Ljubljana is in the midst of a massive green paradigm shift. Mexico has an official “laboratory for the city” created to think out of the box. Barcelona is developing people-friendly “superblocks” to reestablish life in the streets after the destructive reign of the automobile. Dublin has banned large trucks from the city center. Several cities are rebuilding or expanding their tram networks. Large logistics companies like DHL and UPS have been using — for a few years — cargo bikes for their last-mile logistics in over 75 EU cities.
Just look at Malmö, Sweden. You can literally see it from Copenhagen. They have a policy to strengthen density, they’re working on being the world’s most skateboard friendly city and they’ve built a bike-friendly apartment building without car parking.
Back to Copenhagen. Things are going well. So well that we don’t need to think about doing it better and maintaining our leadership position. World’s best and safest bicycle city — sure, until further notice. Massive investments in climate change adaptation. Super. But think about it. We have so much money that we have lost touch with reality.
The City just completed a bombastic new waste incinerator called Amager Bakke right near the city centre. One of the greatest singular vanity projects in recent memory. Oooh, there’s a ski hill on top! Nevermind that we don’t generate enough garbage to fill it and we have to import garbage from abroad to make it break even.
Is there really talk of a harbour tunnel that will pump more cars into the city when other cities are removing their last-century, fossil fuel infrastructure motorways? No serious action on affordable housing? More car parking spots that will just give us more cars? The same mistakes in the Nordhavn development that we didn’t learn from after the Ørestad and Carlsberg City disasters?
Imagine if Nordhavn was designed to be the world’s most sustainable development — like a huge version of Vauban in Germany — by using the whole arsenal of modern solutions. THAT is leadership. But no, all we have at the moment is a pile of marketing hype about being C02 neutral in 2015. A plan that activates my bullshit detector like never before.
Copenhagen thinks it’s in the boxing ring with the great fighters but in reality the city is merely the hot bikini-clad woman holding up the sign in between rounds. It is time to send copenhagenize into retirement. Personally, I’m more excited to see what vancouverism, barcelonification or osloism — or whatever the next one will be — has to offer up as inspiration.
When the cities of the world come to C40 in Copenhagen, we need to shut up and sit up straight. We need to listen. We need to learn.

📆 Flight Date: 20/11/2022📌 Nyhavn, Copenhagen — Denmark
During our stay in Gothenburg, we planned a 2-day weekend trip to Copenhagen. We hopped on a fast train that took us to Copenhagen in just 3 hours, arriving early in the morning. It was a delightful city to explore and wander around. We wished it were a bit warmer, but unfortunately, the weather was so cold that evening, it had snowed for the first time that year.
Nyhavn is a historic harbour area and one of the symbols of Copenhagen. Built-in the early 17th century, this region was originally used as a trading port. It is renowned for its colourful and distinctive buildings, its atmosphere steeped in history, and its maritime heritage. In the past, Nyhavn was a popular stop for sailors, hosting various cultures over time. Today, it has become a vibrant meeting point for tourists and locals alike, with lively cafes, restaurants, and charming colourful houses.
It was a day when we set out early in the morning to explore the city. While wandering around, I kept an eye out for a suitable place to fly the drone. When we arrived at the famous Nyhavn area, I found an open and quiet space near the river and decided to take off from there. It was an extremely cold day, and the wind was blowing very strongly, making it challenging to control the drone at times.
After taking off, the city looked stunning from above, and I captured a few photographs. Then, I spotted a tourist boat moving along the river towards Nyhavn, and I immediately started recording a video. Slowly progressing alongside the boat, I maneuvered through the streets.
And I took one more photograph of the city.
In my second video, I reversed the process, moving backward away from the river.
In my third video, I kept the drone stationary and, while facing the river, slowly elevated the camera towards the sky.
And finally, my one of my personal favourites is below. In this video, I captured the famous colorful houses and boats by moving the drone parallel to them. Due to the wind, I had to make 2–3 attempts while filming, but in the end, I believe it was worth it.
You can find detailed information about drone flying permissions in Denmark here. Although I have a drone license from the Turkish Directorate General of Civil Aviation, I didn’t possess the required license to fly in urban areas in Denmark. Unfortunately, I flew for a very brief period without obtaining permission. I made sure to stay away from people and buildings during the flight.
The indispensable element of my Northern European shots, the wind, challenged me once again. In fact, I couldn’t feel my fingertips due to the cold for a while after the shoot. Copenhagen was a beautiful city, and the buildings provided delightful scenery.
My point: 9/10
I’m considering adding my past flights here as a memento, so the dates mentioned in the writings I’ve added may belong to the last two years.

Denmark is a nordic country next to its brotherly rivals, Norway and Sweden. The three countries together make up Scandinavia. Like its neighbors, the country is consistently ranked as one of the happiest in the world. And as the first country to recognize gay marriage as a legal entity in 1989 and a place that enjoys one of the world’s lowest income inequality rates, it is progressive and forward thinking.
Copenhagen, meaning “merchant harbor”, is the nation’s capital. It was once home to Hans Christian Anderson, the “Danish Charles Dickens” and author of beloved children’s stories like Cinderella, Thumbelina, and The Ugly Duckling. It is surrounded by the gorgeous Nyhavn River and known for the quintessential Nyrrhaven district or “new harbor” (pronounced “new hound”) that graces the cover of most of Scandinavia’s tourism books. This picturesque area, once the red light district, originally housed sailors and merchants until it was redeveloped to be a cultural hub for Copenhageners and tourists alike.
Nyrrhaven is located in the town’s inner-city. Unlike other European cities who’s historic district is often referred to as the “old town”, this area has burned down twice so citizens don’t consider it to be medieval or old. Over half of this area is pedestrian as it contains the famous Strøget, the first, oldest, and longest pedestrian street in the world (pronounced “stroll” but light on the “l”).
Overall, the city offers numerous things to do and see on a weekend. This guide outlines a possible itinerary, listed below. Keep in mind that this is for groups that love to walk everywhere and remain always on the go. Feel free to edit this to your interests and abilities.
Danish is the main language in the country. English is a close second so it is very easy to get around.
This wasn’t always the case. German was the second language required in schools up until the Germans forcefully occupied the country during World War II. After the war concluded, the country immediately switched to English which has remained the secondary focus ever since.
Denmark uses the Danish Krone (DKK), not the Euro, as its currency. Debit/credit cards are accepted approximately 95% of the time so taking out cash is not necessary. If cash is something you’d prefer to have, visit your local bank before leaving your home country to receive the best currency exchange rates.
An item to note is that all of the Nordics are very expensive in comparison to the rest of Europe. It’s not uncommon to pay $15-$20 USD for a glass of wine or $30+ for an entree. Plan to spend more than normal while traveling around this area.
Most of this outline highlights costs in USD. Know that this is a conversion to make it easier for some readers. Costs vary and everything in real time is charged in the local currency.
Tipping is not expected for restaurants and bars but feel free to tip 10% if the service was beyond exceptional. Tour guides — however — should be tipped at least 10%.
Upon check out, if paying via card, waitstaff will ask you to type in the final amount you’d like to pay into the card reader. This is when you can add any tip, if desired.
The Danish often say, “it’s not rain, it’s humidity.” In other words — it rains quite often in Copenhagen, but not enough to truly dampen a day. From spring through fall, spurts come in and out frequently but are followed by pure sunshine. Pack a raincoat and umbrella for these seasons and you’ll be fine.
Wind is another aspect to consider as strong gusts constantly befall the area. 56% of the country’s electricity is wind generated on any given day, and the government is working with Siemens Corporation to build a wind farm that aims to average 80% in the next several years. Avoid extreme winds by visiting in July and August (but know that August is the most popular month for tourists).
During these warmer months, temperatures range from 60°F — 75°F and dip a bit at night. Most accommodations do not have air conditioning, so keep the window open while sleeping to allow for a breeze.
In the winter, the area experiences sleet, cold rain and very rarely snow, with temperatures around 30°F — 40°F. This season is also offers the least amount of light. Being so close to the North Pole, Copenhagen winter sunrises occur around 9am, with light completely gone by 3:30pm. This is another reason to consider visiting in the warmer months, when the sun is often out from 5am through 11pm.
Note: While planning, consider the fact that most establishments are closed on Sundays and some on Mondays, even in the summer. Things are closed far more regularly in the winter.
Uber is illegal in the entire country, so one must hail a taxi or take public transportation.
Getting to and from the airport is very easy via the train. Purchase a city ticket for around $4.5 USD one way at the kiosk outside airport security before taking the escalator down to Track 2. Trains come every ten minutes and take thirty minutes to get to the city center.
Another slightly faster but far more expensive option to get to the city center from the airport is to take a taxi. The taxi stand outlines two different taxi types — a Danish taxi and a Swedish taxi. This isn’t to indicate the driver’s nationality. There’s more to it. The Swedish city of Malmö is a thirty minute drive from the airport so many travelers fly into Copenhagen to access that side of Sweden. Those taxis are only legally allowed to take guests to that country. The Danish taxis, conversely, can take passengers anywhere in Denmark. That being said, be sure to hail a Danish cab.
Copenhagen is one of the safest cities in Europe as its citizens are known to be religiously law-abiding. Danes won’t even jaywalk! They say if a light is broken on red and Danes are waiting to cross the street, one could come back three days later and see they’re still waiting for it to turn green.
In addition, it virtually has no pickpockets as police successfully cracked down on them years ago. The things to truly be wary of are bikes. In a city of 5.8 million people, there are 15 million bikes — 2.6 bikes for every person and more per capita than the well-known bike haven of Holland. And it’s not the theft of bikes that you should be worried about. In fact, it’s so safe that bike owners will lock their wheel in public but not the bike itself to something like a pole. The real concern is getting run over by a biker! Bike lanes can be found all over town, so stay clear of the lanes and look both ways before crossing any street.
As our tour guide said, the highest crime rate in town is a “small section where police give out the most parking tickets.” So be smart — but know you are safe in this incredible city.
Note: Notice the metal lines on the sidewalk around the inner city? These marks are for the blind — guiding them safely throughout the main areas of town. Another aspect of safety that citizens take very seriously!
Denmark has some of the cleanest waters on earth, so much so that the World Economic Forum declared Copenhagen’s tap water as one the top three in the world. I personally wouldn’t say it blew my socks off, but it was better than Dasani. Grab water from any faucet in the country — even in bathrooms.
When dining out, note that most restaurants charge for tap water — sometimes up to $10 USD/bottle. Bring a refillable bottle to avoid these extra fees.
Fast wifi is available in most establishments.
Because of the high price of living, accommodations are very pricey, even for low budget establishments. In my experience, it was even pricier than places in Norway.
If looking to splurge, book a room at the fanciest hotel in the country — Hotel D’Angleterre — where the Rolling Stones, Winston Churchill, and Justin Bieber have stayed.
A bit cheaper but still exceptional is the modern Hotel Kong Arthur in the outer city. Still very well located, it has gorgeous contemporary amenities, a 24/7 bar, and quiet surroundings. Scandic Palace Hotel is another option.
Avoid all Cabinn Copenhagen Hotels- a Danish Motel 6-like chain that is known for bed bugs. Take it from me; you DON’T want those critters anywhere near you.
Denmark is ranked as the highest of many things, and food is no exception. It has over two thousand bars and restaurants just within the inner city (which has a population of a mere six thousand). Copenhagen has over fifteen Michelin-starred restaurants, including Alchemist, ranked in 2022 as the world’s fifth best restaurant by 50 Best. As our tour guide put it, one can’t go wrong with most restaurants in the entire country.
One of the most quintessential items to try while in the country is a wienerbrød known by most tourists as, laughingly, “danishes”. These doughy pastries, filled with different types of fruits and chocolates, are much better here than in other countries because of the way they are made. They are baked with less sugar (and sometimes pig fat instead of butter) so diners can better taste other ingredients.
Another must-try menu item is a smørrebrød which translates to “butter and bread.” The 300 year-old Danish delicacy is art in the form of an open-faced sandwich typically on rye bread and topped with meats, fish, cheese, and yummy spreads. These dishes are meant ONLY for lunch — so never order them for breakfast or dinner or risk looking like a true out-of-towner!
Although Nyrrhaven appears to be a tourist trap, we were told explicitly by locals that they enjoy meals there as well — and will even sit outside in the winter. Prices seem to be a bit inflated, corresponding more with a tourist vibe, but it is worth having a drink or meal in the harbor. The food is surprisingly good and the views — well — they can’t be beat.
Most people that spend just two days in the city arrive in Copenhagen on the first day in the morning. Considering this, drop bags at your accommodations then head for the first meal — lunch at TorvehallerneKBH, a fresh food market. Filled with smørrebrød, pastries, breads, and coffee — this is a great starting point.
If time permits, walk thirty minutes or taxi ten to the famous Little Mermaid statue on the outskirts of town. An ode to Hans Christian Anderson and his fairy tale of the same name, the statue has been an iconic symbol of the city since 1913. Keep in mind that because of its fame, it is often surrounded by immense crowds — so treat this as a quick photo stop and view of the harbor before heading back to the inner city.
After, catch the 1pm walking tour with a local guide. Typically I suggest doing a free walking tour, but we splurged on this three hour smaller-capacity tour booked through Viator which was worth the price. Our guide Stuart brought us all over the inner city, including the pedestrian street Strøget, Nyrrhaven, and Amalienborg Palace, the home of the royal family. Unlike the White House or Buckingham Palace, this residence offers little security, allowing visitors to walk directly up to the main door and around the courtyard with no mandated security check or clearance. Return here around noon the next day for a peek at the changing of the guards, a much smaller version of the one in London.
The tour will pass by the Round Tower, nothing more than a place for a great $5 view of the city. What’s interesting is that a ramp, not stairs or an elevator, is in place to guide guests to the top. This is because King Christian IV, the monarch who ordered this structure to be built in 1642, was so physically large that he needed a ramp to ride his horse to the roof. He wasn’t able to walk up himself. What a guy.
Across the rest of the inner city, notice old, windowed green cylinders housing mini bars or coffee shops. These were once public telephone booths used by all citizens before it was customary for every residence to have home phones. Copenhageners would place calls to the booths, ask for a specific person that lived nearby, and paid runners would dart to a person’s house to let them know they had a phone call.
Approximately an hour before the end of the tour, the guide allows guests to take a pit stop at either a coffee shop or bar. We stopped at Hviids Vinstue. Built in 1723, it is the oldest bar in the country.
After learning copious fun facts, finish the busy day with a relaxing dinner in a quiet, local part of the inner city on the street Kompagnistræde. This area is filled with great restaurants including Norrlyst and Cafe Søster and wine bar Not Your Usual Wine Bar. Or, bop back to busy Nyrrhaven and people watch on the harbor patio at Nyhavns Færgekro.
Begin the day with coffee and a pastry at one of the many coffee shops in town. Then, head to Rosenborg Castle for a self guided tour at the first time slot — 10am. The castle was once the hunting estate for King Christian IV before being converted into a monarch summer house and now a museum. It is located in the gorgeous King’s Garden Park, which dates back to the early 1600’s and is therefore one of the city’s oldest parks.
The tour takes approximately one hour. Although the castle isn’t the most jaw-dropping place to visit, it is worth going to understand royal life in the 17th century. Not to mention, the grounds are beautiful. Purchase tickets ahead of time to skip the line and secure free tickets for kids. Note that all guests are required to store medium to larger sized bags for free in the entrance lockers.
After, walk twenty minutes to a modern open air food hall for lunch, Broens Gadekøkken, before walking the remaining ten minutes to Freetown Christiania.
Christiania is the second most visited site in Copenhagen. It is a hippy, self-governed community of over one thousand residents with its own rules and laws independent of the Danish government. The area is most famous for Pusher Street — the only road in the entire country where cannabis can be purchased legally — for now. Mayor Sophie Hæstorp Andersen recently demonstrated interest in shutting down the “Green Light District.” Regardless, it remains open for the time being and is an interesting avenue to walk through.
Unfortunately we visited on a Monday — the one day that most places in the community are closed — so we didn’t get to see the vibrancy it’s known for. If anything, we walked away thinking it was a bit grungy and run down. Spend less than an hour here and see for yourself as it seems everyone walks away with a different opinion.
The rest of the day is reserved for Tivoli Gardens, a twenty minute walk from the free-town. Built in 1843, it is the second oldest amusement park in the world and the place where Disney found inspiration for Disney World. Offering rides and games for every individual, it is also known for its gorgeous design, stately grounds, and incredible food.
The park sells several ticket types, with weekday and weekend prices. Below are a few of the many options. See here for other packages.
2. “Ride Pass Mini” // Average cost: $25 USD
3. “Ride Pass” // Average cost: $38 USD
4. “Ride Pass Plus” // Average cost: $44 USD
5. Three-Ride Pass
I went with the vision that I’d only go on a couple rides as I don’t typically spend travel time in theme parks. However, Tivoli is not a normal park. It’s clean, beautiful, and has very few lines in comparison to Universal or Disney, so park-goers can actually enjoy the full experience. My advice? Buy at least the Ride Pass. In two hours I went on over ten rides and waited fifteen minutes at most. For fewest crowds, visit on a summer Monday afternoon. The park opens every day at 11am. Most rides are open until at least 9pm, the park itself closes between 11pm and midnight, and the sun doesn’t truly set until 11pm — so you’ll have plenty of time to explore.
Note: Purchase tickets online to skip the entrance line. Carnival games are separate and not included in the ticket price.
In terms of food, the park has everything from a hotdog stand to a Michelin-star restaurant — another reason that it’s not like every other theme park. We dined at Færgekroens Bryghus, a restaurant on the beautiful manmade lake. The food was pretty good (not my favorite) but the calming views were worth it. The only place I heard was very “ok” was the larger food hall, so we avoided it.
Note: Although I don’t have many listed here, most bars/clubs in the summer close around 5 or 6am.

Nordic countries have many gems waiting for a hungry explorer to discover. The places which surprise though often lie in unexpected corners — food stalls in Reffen or Broens Gadekøkken, offering a taste of home origins of generations who migrated to Denmark decades ago, or refined restaurants which skilfully combine cooking and tradition. There is much more than Noma, Geranium, or Jordnær. For example, Michelin-Green-Starred restaurant ARK is by far my favourite vegetarian destination in the world (and here I mean all 38 countries I have travelled to).
This article is divided into four sections:
Copenhagen breakfast options are poor. If pastry for a morning bite is not enough and you are the type who needs a fulfilling meal in the morning, I have bad news for you.
Quality = money formula is incorporated in The Sixteen Twelves and Riviera, but the rest of the places — Ø12, Sonny, Darcy’s Kaffe, Atelier September, or Wulff & Konstali — are somewhat overpriced, standard in taste, indecently simple eateries.
Let’s start with the places I can genuinely recommend.
The Sixteen Twelves must be squeezed in every tourist’s tight schedule! The cafe serves comfort food, but the savour combinations can surprise even the pickiest foodies! For example, stracciatella and pickled rhubarb, or turmeric pickled egg and goat cheese, or brioche with salted and roasted coconut…Yummy! The drinks vary from mango lassi to turmeric latte so make sure to try one of those.
The demand is ridiculously high, so I recommend arriving at the opening or during the week.
Summary:
🌱 A few vegetarian options.⭐ 4/5 for interesting taste combos and iconic turmeric egg.💸 €20–30/ person
Riviera offers granola, toasts, summer salad, scrambled eggs, and many traditional Danish pastries such as tebirkes (remonse bun with poppy seeds) or kardemummabullar (cardamon bun). It is just good for its price. Scandinavian spacious interior with wooden tables and chairs is warm and welcoming, and there is a terrace for all resistant to cold.
Summary:
🌱 Plenty of vegetarian options.⭐ 4/5 for good quality of morning meals.💸 €20–30/ person
A bustling spot called Ø12 won’t be a local’s first choice, but if one is on lookout for a homelike breakfast and coffee, Ø12 checks all the boxes. I usually take the pancakes with fresh berries and vanilla cream, but there are other options such as avocado on sourdough bread, Benedict eggs, or oatmeal. Fresh juices taste excellent and brewed coffee is good as well. The food won’t leave anyone on a cloud nine but should at least satisfy one’s hunger.
Summary:
🌱 A few vegetarian options.⭐ 3/5 for a regular breakfast.💸 €20–30/ person
Atelier September closes the breakfast list. The food is rather standard in taste, and the portions are on the smaller side. If you suddenly find yourself in the city center and crave a quick familiar bite, this will do. The breakfast covers all the popular positions: pancakes with berries, avocado toast, yogurt with granola, eggs on bread, and so on.
Summary:
🌱 A few vegetarian options.⭐ 3/5 for a regular breakfast.💸 €7–30/ person
Probably one of the top-three restaurants in the world I have been so far is ARK. Vegan to its core, distinguished with a Michelin Green Star, ARK served the hellishly delicious tasting menu with the dish I will probably never forget — a vegan version of Chawanmushi.
As per the authentic Nordic philosophy, the restaurant strives for sustainability, and in my humble opinion, they are doing an amazing job! ARK has its own fungi farm, serves natural wines and creates its magic using only local ingredients!
Along with mentioned above Chawanmushi where egg was replaced with asparagus foam, I savoured burnt cabbage leaves with tomato, camomile, and red wine infusion, caviar made of black garlic seeds, peas and beans with Koji sauce and elderflower vinegar, and the most surprising dessert I have ever eaten — carrot creme patissiere with carrot pieces, coco crisps and rice paper soaked in Calvados and dill oil. I think before, I had never imagined that dill and carrot flavours marry so well together.
Summary:
🌱 100% vegan.⭐ 5/5 for making vegan food perfect.💸 €175 for a menu without wine/ non-alcoholic pairing
Bistro Lupa is a more affordable sister of ARK. It is a vegan restaurant with a won’t-remember-the-next-day interior, but excellent service and tasting menu. I strongly encourage you to add a serving of Lupa’s mushrooms once you embark on a tasting journey. Same as ARK’s, the core idea of the bistro is to use every piece, slice and crumb of ingredients in the dishes it serves. Fruits, vegetables, flowers, and herbs are being served together and each of the products opens up differently, depending on the combination. The amount of food on the tasting menu feels just right and if one goes for a la carte, five dishes for two people is sufficient (plus a portion of milk buns).
Summary:
🌱 100% vegan.⭐ 5/5 for making vegan food perfect.💸 €70 for a menu without wine/ non-alcoholic pairing
Aamanns 1921 is on the pricier side and offers traditional Scandinavian open-faced sandwiches. I was happy enough to have the opportunity to try one of those considered that original recipes always taste either fish or meat.
Two smørrebrøds make a perfect portion for one, and I tried a vegetarian, and a fish option — only to realise that smørrebrød is just not my cup of tea. Aamanns 1921 is worth a try, however, if meat and fish is what you like, head to Restaurant Schønnemann (book in advance!).
Summary:
🌱 3 vegetarian smørrebrøds.⭐ 3/5 for vegetarian options.💸 €40–50 for two smørrebrøds and a glass of wine.
There are many pizza places like Pizzeria Luca or Corsa pizza, but I prefer a place with a more nonchalant vibe — Flere Fugle. It is located in the underground neighbourhood Nordvest, and makes a good stop for lunch before taking a stroll along the rapidly developing area. Flere Fugle offers excellent coffee, but if you want to make an adventure out of the regular lunch time, go for coffee to Kaffedepartementet, and take a look at the The Library at Rentemestervej — a book heaven for kids :)
Summary:
🌱 A few vegetarian options.⭐ 5/5 for the chill vibe.💸 €19–25 for a pizza.
It is difficult to find a bad bakery in Copenhagen (with one exception mentioned in the ‘Eateries which are not there yet’ section). My top pastry shops are probably Skt. Peders Bageri, Flere Fugle, and Riviera. Depends on the area I am in when the sugar craving hits. First one is a go-to for pistachio cruffins, and traditional Danish pastries, last two are responsible for aromatic cardamon buns which are my favourite among all the pastries.
The traditional, the oldest, the Danish one — Skt. Peders Bageri. After a long dispute with a friend we concluded that the cardamon rolls they make are the tastiest in Copenhagen. I can also justify why a pistachio cruffin magically appears in my beg every time I pass the bakery (look for those between 10–13 every day as after 13 they disappear quickly).
💸 €5 for a bun.
Riviera is another decent pastry shop. What is nice about the bakery is that it is very spacious, making it a cozy place for snack and some reading. It also offers breakfasts for those who become hungry once they smell coffee :)
💸 €5 for a bun.
If you are on the hunt for traditional Danish desserts, Conditori La Glace is the right place! A wide range of cakes, candies, desserts, cookies and an excellent tea collection make La Glace a lovely place to sit, reflect, read a book and enjoy the treat (works only if one arrives before the tourists pour in). I always take Kartoffelkager which is best of all (you can get one of those in Sweet Valentine in Torvehallerne as well).
💸 €11 for a slice of cake.
Juno the bakery is a very mainstream bakery, targeted at tourists. Their cardamon rolls are indeed delicious, but not exceptional or different from Skt. Peders Bageri, Riviera or Flere Fugle. If you are on a curious side and strolling around Østerbro — go for it, but consider the lines in the morning and during lunchtime.
💸 €5 is what you will pay for a bun.
The beloved Copenhagen spot Hart Bageri (there are few around the city) makes the best cheesecake in town (and no one can convince me that it’s not true). Their crispy sourdough bread makes an impression as well.
💸 €14 for a slice of cheesecake and a coffee.
Another must-visit bakery is Andersen Bakery. They make sweets, candies, and desserts of all possible kinds. Here you can also grab a sandwich and sip a coffee in the sun.
💸 €14 for a slice of cheesecake and a coffee.
This is the pastry shop I visit every time I am in Copenhagen. Small, cozy, Leckerbaer reminds me of a doll house with doll-like cookies. It is slightly overpriced but serves as an excellent present.
💸 €19 for an 8-cookie box.
I tried a 5-course menu in Høst in June 2024, and to my disappointment I liked only one of the dishes. Even the surprise treats which Høst generously brought didn’t convince me. The food tasted just fine but not enough for that price.
The beetroot with raspberries and goat cheese had an interesting crispy texture and was quite tasty but the rest disappeared from my taste buds’ memory as soon as I left the restaurant. Considering the opinions on the internet, their pescatarian or meat menu is much better, so if one doesn’t have any preferences, Høst might be considered a place worth trying.
Summary:
🌱 Vegetarian 3 or 5-course menu.⭐ 3/5 for nice treats along the meals.💸 €70 for a menu without wine/ non-alcoholic pairing
If I were to describe Theo in two words, they would be salty and hard. I tried a smaller dish, which were potato gnocchi, and a main course — agnolotti with zucchini, lemon, and riccota. Both were quite similar in taste, and so salty, that it was difficult to taste each of the meal components (I didn't feel the sage at all, even though it has a strong flavour).
Summary:
🌱 A few vegetarian options with one vegetarian main dish.⭐ 2/5 for vegetarian options.💸 €50–70 for a la carte lunch.
A place in Torvehallerne called Il_mattarello serves basic pasta made on spot. The word ‘basic’ perfectly describes the pasta’s flavour, and I can reassure you there are better bistros for a pasta or a quick lunch.
Summary:
🌱 One or two vegetarian pastas.⭐ 2/5 for making their own pasta.💸 €20 for a pasta
Mexican street food chain Hija de Sanchez might provide delicious tacos with pork but tacos with kale were far from good. And I am not talking kale here. The meal was extremely greasy, and oil was almost the only flavour on my tongue.
Summary:
🌱 Vegetarian tacos as the only option.⭐ 2/5 for trying.💸 €15 for a portion of three.
Regarding the bakeries I didn’t like. Albatross & Venner in Torvehallerne left me unimpressed. It is definitely not the place to look for Danish pastries.
Regarding the breakfast eateries I didn’t like. Sonny, Darcy’s Kaffe, and Wulff & Konstali are overpriced and not worth your time. The portions often aren’t big enough and should be called snacks instead.
I am always on the lookout for new places, so this story is being updated on a regular basis :)

Posted: 2/8/203 | February 8th, 2023
Copenhagen is a lively, modern, and fun capital perfect for weekend getaways or as a base as you explore the region at large.
It’s a laid-back city with a high quality of living, boasting charming rows of colorful houses, inventive green spaces, inviting canals, and bike lanes galore (there are five times as many bikes as cars in the city, and more bikes than people too).
The Danish capital is very compact and made for walking. And every neighborhood has its own distinct flavor and personality. For this reason, it’s important to have an idea of which part of town you’d like to plant yourself in while here.
To help you decide where to stay in Copenhagen, here are the best neighborhoods — and why I like them — so you can choose the area that best suits your travel style and budget.
But, before I get to the specifics, here are some common questions I get asked about Copenhagen neighborhoods:
What’s the best neighborhood for first-time visitors?  Indre By is one of the most picturesque areas of town and where much of the action is. If you’re new to the city, this is the best place to base yourself.
What’s the best neighborhood for shopping?  Frederiksberg is an upscale neighborhood with plenty of boutique shops and cafés where you can sit back and watch the city go by.

What’s the best neighborhood overall?  Indre By has something for everyone and really shouldn’t be missed!
With those questions now answered, here is a more specific breakdown of each neighborhood — with suggested accommodations for each, so you’ll know exactly where to stay in Copenhagen.
Copenhagen Neighborhood Overview
Indre By, also known as Copenhagen Center or downtown, is probably the first neighborhood most first-time visitors explore when they set out to discover this city. After all, it’s one of the most picturesque areas of town, complete with rows of colorful, centuries-old houses on the harbor, medieval thoroughfares, a castle, the main art museum (Statens Museum for Kunst), Europe’s longest pedestrian shopping street, and even the queen’s residence. Tivoli Gardens, the city’s small amusement park, is also located here.
Indre By, literally “inner city,” or as locals call it, Nyhavn, is the most convenient place to stay for those wanting to pack a lot in on their first visit, since all the main sights are just a few steps away — including Freetown Christiania, the city’s (in)famous commune/micronation.
Best Places to Stay in Indre By:
If you like a dose of sophistication with your travels, book yourself at a hotel or hostel in Frederiksberg, a neighborhood west of downtown. Upscale clothing boutiques, theaters, fancy coffee spots and restaurants, and quiet cafés flank the district’s streets. You’ll also find a quaint park, a diminutive castle, and picturesque canals that are perfect for strolling around when the sun is out.
Best Places to Stay in Frederiksberg:
Northwest from the historical center sits Nørrebro, home to the famed Assistens Cemetery, where you can view the grave of author Hans Christian Andersen (he wrote The Little Mermaid and The Ugly Duckling, amongst many other noteworthy stories). Nørrebro also happens to be the most ethnically diverse district in town: walk down the street and you’ll hear dozens of different languages.
It’s also home to a slew of restaurants and cafés, from great no-frills spots to Michelin-starred eateries. If you’re not sure where or what to eat, come to Nørrebro and you’ll be spoiled with a rich variety of great restaurants.
Best Places to Stay in Nørrebro
There once was a time when Vesterbro, located west of the historical center and nearly hugging the main canal, was a no-go zone, its streets prowled by drug dealers. Some of these elements are still there, but today Vesterbro is one of the hippest places to hang out in the Danish capital. The streets are now lined with cutting-edge art galleries, hipster bars, third-wave coffee shops (emphasizing high quality), and excellent restaurants.
There are not a ton of accommodation options in Vesterbro, but what’s there — and just across the border in neighboring districts — is good for a few nights.
Best Places to Stay in Vesterbro:
Situated to the south, Amagerbro is a sprawling neighborhood with a large residential section. It’s also on Amager Island, which once had the moniker “Shit Island,” because it was the place where the city’s sewage was deposited.
Today, the sewage is gone, and the neighborhood is one of the most sought-after places to reside, as the streets are flanked by cool cafés, restaurants serving elevated Danish fare, and unique shops.

If you visit Copenhagen during the colder months, eating your way through their amazing bakeries is one of the best ways to spend your time (and to gain a few pounds of padding to protect you from the cold). We visited 9 bakeries in 5 days. Copenhagen’s bakeries rivaled the ones I tried in Stockholm (reviewed here). While I loved them all, we agreed there was one clear favorite. The list below is loosely in reverse rank order and rated as good, great, or amazing.

Part two: Getting an apartment
So you’ve moved to Copenhagen (or you’re about to!) and you read my last post, so you know that you need an apartment before you can get set up for absolutely anything else (health care, bank account, nemID, etc.). Here’s what I learned…
First, Set your expectations.It took us over 3 weeks to get an apartment in Copenhagen, and I was working on it every single day. We had to move between two different Airbnb’s because it kept taking longer than we thought. We have both a dog and a cat, and it was the middle of winter so it wasn’t much fun to trek around the city. Hopefully for you it will be faster!
In terms of what’s available here… Many Danish bathrooms are very small, to the point where you have to shower over your toilet (ew). And most do not have bathtubs. Pets make it extra-difficult to find a place. Many buildings are walk-ups (we are on the 4th floor with no elevator). However, there is plenty of hardwood and natural light and Danish modern design sensibility YAY!
Invest in the apps.Almost every apartment rental site costs money. Try a few (Boligsurf and Boligportal are decent) and pay for trial subscriptions, but put a note in your calendar to cancel the subscriptions when they are about to auto renew because they are not cheap. DBA is the equivalent of Craigslist and can have some good options, especially if you are willing to do a short term rental and then find a full-time spot later. However, it’s important to have a permanent address in order to get your CPR number, which is your key to everything else (see my last post).
Prepare for the competition.Competition can be fierce in Copenhagen. Come ready to see apartments with your proof of residency/income/employment, passports, and willingness to pay, just like you would in NYC, SF, or DC. Some places require you to fill out an application, others don’t. Bottom line, if you love it, don’t hesitate. On the flip side, the Danes have a more… relaxed pace, especially now during the summer months, so getting a showing can take time. Keep pushing if you have a good feeling about a place!
A note on agents.If you see an apartment that you kind of like, but it’s already gone, or not quite right, ask the person showing it what else they have on the market. Use them as a filter for similar quality apartments. But, keep in mind that buildings rented out by agents are also more expensive because they get a cut.
Be ready to shell out.In Copenhagen it is standard to pay an extra 3 months of rent on top of your 1st month’s rent as a damage deposit. Some places also charge 2–3 months on top of that as a deposit for the last few months rent. So, you are likely to pay between 4–7 months rent on day one. For a 1 bedroom 15.000dk apartment, that could add up to as much as 105.000dk, or $16,500 USD. As I mentioned in the last post, paying your first payment can be tricky without a local bank account, which first requires you to have a local address (so bizzare). I found Transferwise to be pretty useful for those first few overseas payments.
New vs. old?In Copenhagen, deciding between new vs. old is not the difference between modern luxuries and convenience, or personality and affordability. Some of the new construction buildings we saw had few luxuries, were located on the fringes of town (pretty inconvenient), but were more affordable, while some of the older buildings we saw had no character, or a few modern luxuries and conveniences, but at a much higher price. In other words, don’t be fooled by the age of the building!
In Copenhagen, a 15min bike ride is considered far. The city is really not that big, but I’d recommend choosing just a few neighborhoods that are close to where you want to spend your time, especially for when the weather gets uglier. You can find both expensive and affordable apartments in each neighborhood, though as a general rule it’s more expensive the closer to the center you are. When you start searching, you will see Københaven S, V, SV, N, O, K, etc. These refer to the areas of the town, but not the neighborhoods…
I have not even included Vanløsem Brønshøj-Husum, or Bispebjerg, because I’m assuming that if you’re moving to Copenhagen for a short time, you’d rather be in the middle of things.
K CENTER/CENTRUM
Centrum AKA Indre By: Can be a bit more expensive, not good for dogs, full of tourists, but super convenient to get anywhere. Good shopping, restaurants, scenic canals, museums…
VWEST/VEST
Valby: Families and more affordable housing over one big hill from the center. You can even get a whole house out there, I hear! The neighborhood of Carlsberg Byen, right on the edge of Frederiksberg is in heavy construction, and may be a cool area to check out in the next year or two.
Vesterbro and Kødbyen (meat packing): Can be loud, but also super hip and fun. Home to many cafes and bars and boutique shops. I found it hard to find apartments here.
N NORTH/NORD
Nørrebro: One of the most-multicultural neighborhoods in Copenhagen. A bit more crime, but also a lot of amazing culture — food, art, shops, etc. We spend a lot of time here.
Ø EAST/ØST
Østerbro: Quiet and family-friendly with lots of beautiful old character buildings. Close to “the lakes” (not what I think of as lakes, but beautiful for jogging and strolling) and the best bakery in town. All my friends live here.
Nordhavn: lots of newer construction buildings, right on the ocean! I hear the swimming is great.
SSOUTH/SYD
Islands Brygge: Copenhagen charm, if you want to live right on the water. But keep in mind that everyone else also wants to be right on the water all summer.
Amagerbro: A bit more crime here, but affordable and interesting. A short train or bikeride to the center.
Amager: Further out from the center, but closer to the beach, and the airport. Some areas feel pretty soul-less to me with back-to-back office buildings. But, I’m sure there are some awesome affordable apartment gems out here, and a whole lot of nature.
Christianshavn: Home to many houseboats, and also the famous Freetown Christiania. The neighborhood is just across from the center, and close to NOMA, you know, just in case. For cheaper eats, there’s also the new food hall at Reffen nearby.
Sydhavnen: Here there are A LOT of newer buildings that you can get into quickly, which are not too expensive. But, it feels a bit separated from the city by the railroad tracks, and much of this area is still being developed. Pro: it’s also right on the water.
And finally,
FREDERIKSBERGFrederiksberg is an island (figuratively, not literally) in the middle of Copenhagen. Even though it’s quite central, it’s a completely different byen, or city, which means different regulations, street signs, taxes, etc. It’s quiet and convenient, with lots of old character buildings, boutique shops and a gorgeous park. We love it.
My 5 step process to find the best apartments in any city
Start with what you need (and what you want).Whenever my husband and I move to a new place, we spend an hour or so writing up post-its with everything we’d like to have in our new apartment. Usually it’s based on learnings of what we liked or didn’t like in the last place. Once we’ve written everything that we can imagine (it’s light and bright, there’s outdoor space, a bathtub!), we’ll rank them by importance to our quality of life, debating back and forth until we both feel satisfied that this vision of an apartment is representative of our needs, and then our wants. This way, if only one of us is available during househunting, then we also have a good guide to make decisions with.
Know your budget.Choosing an apartment can be a very emotional process, so having an anchor to return to helps when it’s time for serious decision-making. I like to start with a “spending plan” for how much I think I’ll make and spend in my new city/neighborhood, then determine the high and low end of our rental budget, and clarifying what we would be giving up if you went with the high end. Don’t forget to factor in all the moving costs before, during, and after the move, like movers, new furniture, and damage deposits.
Visualize your ideal.Since I’m a visual person and a designer, I also often make a moodboard of what I want the space to look and feel like. It helps me check whether I’ve found the right place, or just a “good enough” place. My husband and I have been building this Moodboard for our House for the last 5 or 6 years, and I think it’s helped us understand each other’s sense of style.
Start early.Before I arrive in a new place, I get on all the local apps and start evaluating the market to find out what’s available, what would be a realistic price range, and how the neighborhoods compare — Airbnb neighborhoods and people who have recently moved to the city can be a good gut check. Many people told us to start trying to rent an apartment before we arrived in Copenhagen, but I think that’s bad advice, because it doesn’t allow you to…
…trust your gut.Now that I know what I can afford, where I’d like to be, and what’s most important to me, it’s time to let my intuition do the work. If it feels too good to be true, or I have a sneaking suspicion that there’s something off, I try to listen to that warning. After all, this is the place we’ll call home.

It was the day before Onam. I was sitting in the beautiful Frederiksberg Gardens in Copenhagen. It was a beautiful sunny day and all around us families were picnicking, children running around, and dogs dozing. This is what I would consider a perfect afternoon and I was soaking in every second of it. But, in the back of my mind I was also thinking about what I would be doing if I was home. (Currently, we do not have a permanent address). I would be cooking dal for Sambhar and chopping vegetables for Avial; defrosting packets of grated coconut to go into each of the five or six dishes I usually make. As an immigrant (now going on 12 years), cooking is how I feel at home. Cooking is, as some might say, my love language. Vishu and Onam are when that instinct comes out in full force. As much as I am enjoying this Europe sojourn, being in a different place every week and even cooking in new kitchens, not having Sadhya on Onam is a recipe for homesickness.
Home is a complicated concept; but one way I think of it is that home is the place where most of my food memories and cravings are anchored. That day in Copenhagen, we had bought a couple of things from a bakery (or bageri) to eat at the park. One of them was a cardamom bun or kardemommabolle which every Copenhagen food blog I consulted had recommended. As I bit into the beautifully glazed and twisted cardamom bun, nostalgia flooded my senses. Although, I had never eaten a kardemommabolle before, it felt so intensely familiar. That mix of sugar and cardamom and the soft melt-in-your-mouth bread, transported me home to Kerala. For a moment, I was a little girl eating one of those buns stuffed with sweetened coconut, flavored with cardamom. It reminded me of other confections that used this formula, now replaced by cakes and cookies in most Kerala bakeries, whose names I have long forgotten.
Food nostalgia can often hit you in unexpected places and ways. The smell of a particular mix of ingredients hitting hot oil, the texture of a dessert, and even the flavor of something you have never eaten before can bring back memories of familiar foods, places, and people. So why had this kardemommabolle transported me from Copenhagen to Kerala?
Cardamom—elam, elakka, elakaya in Malayalam—is the quintessential dessert flavoring in Kerala cuisine. This is not surprising given that some of the world’s best cardamom is grown in Kerala. Cardamom goes into our payasams (delicately flavored milk-based dessert), ela-ada (rice flour pie stuffed with jaggery-sweetened and cardamom spiced coconut filling that is steamed in banana leaves), and unnakaya (steamed and pounded plantain shaped into beautiful oval shapes, stuffed with sweetened and cardamom spiced coconut, then fried). It is used to flavor spiced black tea or Sulaimani of the Malabar region (which in my humble opinion is superior to the milky cardamom tea of the North). It is also used to flavor breads and cakes that became a part of Kerala cuisine, as a legacy of British colonial presence. When I first moved to the US, before Cinnabon kiosks opened up in Indian malls, I was slightly puzzled by the prolific use of cinnamon in American desserts. In Kerala, cinnamon is very much a savory spice. It is cardamom, and occasionally cloves, that are used to flavor sweet treats, although they are also key in savory dishes such as stew and biriyani.
We also revere cardamom for its supposed medicinal properties. You can pop a few pods into your pocket or handbag and chew on the seeds as a mouth freshener or to suppress nausea or motion sickness. Eladi Lehyam, an Ayurvedic paste with cardamom as its main ingredient is used to treat sore throat and cough, and an ubiquitous item in the medicine cabinets of Malayalis. (As I write this, I can almost recall the metallic methol taste of the Lehyam at the back of my throat). Eladi Thailam, or cardamom oil is used for head and body massages. Thus, cardamom is familiar not just to our taste buds, but all our senses. So how did this “queen of spices” make its way to Scandinavia and into the delectable kardemommabolle?
The Danish had some trading posts in India, including the southern port of Tranquebar, which it held as a colony for more than a two-hundred years. (Danish discourse seem to avoid the term colony and refer to Tranquebar as a trading post, but they did build a fort there). In the heyday of Danish East India Trade Company it had factories along the southern coast including—Edava—a town near Varkala, not far from a part of the Western Ghats known as the Cardamom Hills. So does the origin of the delectable Cardamon bun that transported me to Kerala on that Onam-eve lie in Denmark’s trade with South India?
Online sleuthing tells me that the creation of cardamom bun predates Scandinavian presence in Asia. Although I happened to have my first cardamom bun in Denmark, everyone (on the internet) seems to agree that it is a Swedish invention, where it is known as Kardemummabullar. Before the Portuguese explorer, Vasco Da Gama, landed in Calicut on the Malabar coast—my hometown and the heart of the spice trade at the time—spices were coming to Europe via the Middle East. The spice trade is believed to have started as early as 2000 BCE along the silk route, and was over the centuries controlled by Arabs, Venetians, and Genoans. The demand for spices played a key role in creating the first international trade routes and the European quest to cut out middle men and get to the source of the spices was a driving force of the “age of exploration” or as the colonized like us call it — the colonial era. Spices were making their way to Europe and shaping its cuisines well before Europeans themselves arrived at South and Southeast Asian shores in its pursuit.
One theory dates the arrival of cardamom in Sweden all the way back to the time of the Vikings. Supposedly, cardamom was brought back to the region by Viking explorers who made their way to Istanbul (then Constantinople) sometime in the 11th century. Another theory suggests that cardamom was introduced to Scandinavia by the Moors. This theory cites the appearance of cardamom in Scandinavian recipes in the mid-1400s and the “Moorish” influence of those recipes. This of course does not indicate a specific time or place, and might refer to the Maghreb or Al-Andalus. Irrespective of how cardamom first arrived in Scandinavia, Tranquebar and the East India Companies of other European nations (including Sweden) played a part in it becoming an essential part of the cuisine. This “opening up” of the spice trade in the 15th century made cardamom and other spices, which were previously luxury goods meant for the kitchens of the elite, more accessible to working class Europeans, even as it paved the way for the colonization of South and Southeast Asia.
As I was connecting the historical dots of how cardamom made its way from Kerala to Scandinavia, I realized that I had brought my own cache of cardamom there in the form of my homemade garam masala. One of its key ingredients is green cardamom that my aunt gave me on my last trip to Kerala. I made some lovely (even if I say so myself) Malabari biriyani for dinner on one of my nights in Copenhagen.
Copenhagen’s beauty is in both the grandiose and the mundane. Spectacular palaces sit unpretentiously besides old housing blocks with stunning but understated brickwork; Museums housed in old impressive buildings are surrounded by shops selling Danish-designed furniture and home ware that could give any museums a run for their money; verdant home and apartment gardens that look unplanned and wild are no less aesthetic than the many perfectly manicured royal gardens of the city. As much as I loved everything about Copenhagen, it is not the place where I expected to become nostalgic about Kerala (although, we do consider ourselves more understated and subtle in our aesthetics compared to the rest of India).
Food is an archive of history, cultures, and exchange. Food can bring back memories, and reveal connections in the most unexpected ways. This is probably why Food Studies has emerged as a serious field of research to understand culture, migration, history, and politics. As a seafood lover, I enjoyed the many Smørrebrød (open-faced sandwich, usually topped with seafood) that we had in Denmark. But it did not remind me of the fish curries, fish fries, or other seafood dishes that form an essential part of Kerala cuisine. On the other hand, a humble cardamom bun made me nostalgic and sent me down a research rabbit-hole. I am looking forward to having many more of them when I get to Stockholm next week.

We sent podcast host and self-proclaimed “expert on everything” Markus Herrmann on a road trip across Europe to find out how cities embrace the future of urban space. In this episode, we’re in Copenhagen, a city that is known for its incredible bicycle infrastructure. But the Danish capital has more to offer, eg. an artificial ski slope.
When it comes to urban mobility, Copenhagen is immediately mentioned as a prime example. After all, the Danish capital is considered the European capital of cycling. But apart from two-meter-wide cycle paths, what makes the development of the cityscape, and the mobility associated with it, so special?
If you take a look at the figures on bicycles, Copenhagen’s special position quickly becomes clear. An impressive 45 percent of the inhabitants commute to work, school or university by bike, covering around 1.4 million kilometres every day. According to a study, even more people in the Greater Copenhagen area bike to work every day than in the entire USA. There are five times more bicycles than cars in the city center, and only 14 percent of inhabitants drive a car every day.
It’s clear that with so much cycling traffic, new records are being set. The cycle path at Nørrebrogade, for example, is the world’s busiest cycle path, with up to 40,000 cyclists a day. Not only there, but in the entire city area, about 1,000 kilometers of cycle paths provide the right connection. Of these, 200 kilometers alone are high-speed cycle paths — so-called Cykelsuperstier — which are particularly well-developed and designed to prioritize bike traffic. These cycle paths are three meters wide, and the traffic lights along them are synchronized to create a “green wave” so cyclists don’t have to stop at intersections.
But it’s also the small things that show further thought is being given to cyclists here. For example, rubbish bins are oriented diagonally towards the cyclists, and there are footrests at the traffic lights so that cyclists don’t have to get out of their saddles while waiting.
Those who would like to take advantage of the cyclists’ paradise themselves are best served by the city bikes from the Bycyklen public bike hire system. After a short registration, you can rent one of the e-bikes and start cycling right away.
Bycycklen city bikes already have a long tradition in Copenhagen. In May 1995, the first 1000 city bikes rolled through Copenhagen’s streets. And when Bill Clinton came to Denmark for a state visit in 1997, he received the “City Bike One” as an official guest gift.
As progressive as the rental bike system might be, there have still been some unexpected setbacks. Until recently, e-bikes were equipped with tablets, which not only allowed you to rent the bike but also to view a map and information about the surrounding area. Unfortunately, due to heavy vandalism last year, all tablets were removed from the bikes.
Even though Copenhagen is completely flat and it hardly ever snows, there is one rather unexpected way of getting around: downhill skiing! Since the beginning of 2019, Copenhagen has a new landmark, the “CopenHill”. A ski slope was built on the roof of a waste incineration plant, on whose dry ski slope you can ski almost 100 meters down into the valley.
It is hard to believe it, but the waste incineration plant Amager Bakke inside the urban ski slope is one of many building blocks for Copenhagen’s next big goal: the city wants to become climate neutral by 2025. If it succeeds, Copenhagen would be the world’s first CO2-neutral capital. Since 2009, a multi-faceted plan has been underway to achieve this goal. What starts with rather obvious measures such as solar panels on public buildings extends to the optimization of menus in canteens and kindergartens. Copenhagen is on its way to become a sustainable model for the whole world — not only on the cycle path.
Markus Herrmann is a blogger, author, and member of the successful podcast “Gästeliste Geisterbahn”. For Porsche, he is testing the mobility level of the Back 2 Tape metropolises in Europe.
The project “Back 2 Tape” is a cooperation between the Porsche Newsroom and music journalist Niko Backspin. It follows the tracks of hip hop in Europe. All further information on this project can be found in the Porsche Newsroom.
An important note: Markus’ trip through Europe as well as “Back 2 Tape” were produced before the outbreak of COVID-19. Porsche, Backspin and the involved agencies and artists are aware of their social responsibility and advise against such a trip at this time out of consideration for the health and well-being of all people.

I’m from Brazil and I’ve been living in Copenhagen for 2 years. In Brazil we have more than 2000 freshwater fish species, but Pike isn’t one of them and I’ve always wanted to catch big Pike, after watching on TV how violent this fish is.
Looking for Pike in a lake in the middle of the city (Valby, Copenhagen)
I live 3 km away from an urban lake, so it was the first lake I wanted to try fishing in Denmark. Last year, in 2019, I went there 2 times in the summer and didn’t catch anything, and I considered the lake just dead water.
I wanted to give the lake another try in the summer this year, one year after my last trip to it. It was a Saturday in August and I was immediately greeted by a small pike, caught in a small weightless spinner (known in Brazil as “varejeira”) rigged with a bombarda (a kind of float with weight). My first pike ever! I finally crossed this specie off of my list. But still, far away from the big pikes that I saw on TV. Anyway, on this same day, I ended up catching more than 50 small pikes. It was basically one pike per cast!
The next day, Sunday, I got there after lunch and ended up catching dozens of small pikes and even small perches. I decided to move around the lake, until at 18:00, my friend Ricardo cast a small spinner and hooked a big one, which immediately got off the hook, due to how small the lure was. He agreed on me throwing my big wobbler right where he lost the pike and finally, I hooked the big one!
In my mind, it was huge, because I was used to hooking only tiny pikes! Five minutes afterwards, I cast close to where I caught the big one and I hooked one which appeared to be twice bigger than the previous one! Spot on! I finally found the one I was looking for! Even the previous pike could now be considered “small” compared to this one!
Going Bigger
Afterwards, I went there almost on a daily basis after work and hooked medium to big pikes constantly. I even got a reasonably sized one in an ultralight set with 0.08mm braided line (thin as a hair).
One day I decided to try a “pen toy rod” that I bought from China for only US$ 3 and I hooked a lot of small pikes.
Suddenly, I saw a wave nearby, and it was the biggest pike I’ve ever seem. It was just taking a look at the small pikes that I was releasing, in a place where it’s probably 15 to 20cm deep. I switched to my bait casting set and a bigger lure. Unfortunately it ignored all my casts. I switched more than 10 different lures, until I got it… but my fluorocarbon leader was only 0.35mm and it cut the line. I was hectic. I quickly tied another leader (still 0.35mm) and put a 16cm lure, and then I cast in parallel to the shallow area where the pike was. Unfortunately it was gone, it was a sad 5 minutes for me. Anyway, I decided to keep casting the 16cm lure parallel to the shallow surface, until suddenly, I hooked it! After fighting it, I managed to bring it out of the water!
A very long but thin pike. The head itself was bigger than 25cm. My record pike so far! And to think that it all started with the toy rod that day.
Halloween Night Pike Fishing (Going even Bigger)
As a Halloween challenge, I made my own Halloween pike lure and I went night pike fishing at the same lake! The night delivered 3 big pikes, all above 100 cm, where one of them was a BIG FAT MAMA (big curved belly when you hold it), my biggest and heaviest pike, and I wonder if this one is the biggest in that lake? I ended up getting one with my custom lure and 2 with a Danish lure made especially for pikes.
I can now identify the pikes from my local lake from their patterns and from their scars, and I even started calling them by name, because I caught some of the pikes more than once the past 3 months, that’s also the magic and emotion of catch and release! For me, it’s a very happy moment to release the fish and see it swimming back!
Never underestimate your backyard lake!

Part One: Onboarding
Moving to Copenhagen can be pretty overwhelming, and I found all the sequenced steps to be frustratingly unclear. To help you avoid running around in circles, I’ve put together a step-by-step guide to beginning your awesome new life in Copenhagen.
Each step must be done in order, or you risk wasting a lot of time.
Once you have your proof of residency and an address, you’ve unlocked the next set of tasks.
With your NemID and CPR number set up, you are finally eligible to get your yellow card, and set up your online life.
The following steps can be done with a bit more leisure, but most within 90 days of arrival.
Leaving — If you were to ever leave Copenhagen (and really, who would?) you have to go in reverse order and remove yourself from all these systems. Read more here.

The story sounds familiar: A utopian city where the streets are clean, traffic is orderly, and the people are tall, beautiful, and calm. It’s the stuff science fiction novels are made of…
I didn’t have many expectations for each city that we visited during this trip but I had some thoughts going to Copenhagen.
Some quick backstory:
I’ve grown up to with the American work ethic of the “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” kind. So to come to a country where socialism plays an important part of the governing system, it immediately brought thoughts of lazy dependence on an overtaxed government from beatnik no-doers. I should say that most of my understanding of socialism spews from good ‘ole propaganda-filled American public education. It has led me to believe that socialism is THE anti-American way of living and is often told much like a scary bedtime story to caution wayward capitalist children about the tyranny of the Soviet Union. 👻
In reality, Denmark is not a socialist state but rather it upholds a socialist democratic practice. The objective is not for the state to own the means of production but rather it refers to a political philosophy that supports economic and social policies that promote social justice in a capitalist economy in a democratic way. Most people see this through the way they govern a tax-financed health care service. (Universal healthcare 🚑) Others might refer to it as a social welfare country due to its extensive services for children, the elderly and the poor. Denmark also provides special provisions for universal education, support for unions or collective bargaining, and sensible (ostensibly) government regulation of industry to preserve the environment and health and welfare of people within the jurisdiction of the country. Either way you spin it, the country operates with private and publicly run businesses and Copenhagen is considered to be one of the top ranked best city in the world for standard of living. So with that in mind, I came to Copenhagen with a lot of curiosity for the way everything worked and operated.
Here’s a breakdown of our trip to Copenhagen:
We arrived in the late afternoon of our first day. CPH was quite nice and fairly large. Having flown a lot domestically within the US, it was a night/day comparison to see a privately-owned airport. (As compared to the airports owned by the government much like the Port Authority NY/NJ) Even the bus lines are privately owned in Copenhagen and I was mostly impressed by the clear signage, cleanliness, and on-time reliability.
We decided to purchase the 72-hour CityPass ticket to get around on public transit since it encompassed the entirety of our stay in Copenhagen. (We got in late our first day and left at noon on our last for a total of three days.) Public transit is a bit pricey here. A one-way ticket throughout the 3-zones that the city encompasses is $36 DK or $5.39 USD. So to purchase their $200 DK 72-hour card, it only cost about $30 USD for three days. We didn’t rent bikes this time around but rather walked. If I return again, I would rent a bike for the entirety of our stay since the city was very bike friendly and central to most points of interest.
Our Airbnb was conveniently located just a few blocks from the Nørrebro Station. Thom and I really enjoyed our stay there. Our guests were very welcoming and the apartment was very comfortable. If you follow me on any other social media, then you’d know that I’ve already posted a short video of our stay.
A lot of the time making this video was spent find creative ways to shoot still video without a tripod though. 😝
The location of our Airbnb was absolutely great! Again, we were very close to public transit but also a short walk away from The Lakes, Copenhagen’s Botanical Gardens and parks, grocery stores, and the famous Torvehallerne.
On our first evening, we walked over the Lakes and ate at Thai Pan. I’ll admit that food is a bit pricey in Copenhagen in general, but this restaurant had a great three-course menu that provided us with a lot of leftovers for the next day. They make a super tasty coconut soup with chicken and mushrooms. That alone was well-worth the price and trip!
Also that first night, I received the best email that I could ever imagine:
Noma has an open spot for you and one other to dine on the following day. Would we care to join?
WOULD WE CARE TO JOIN??!! WOULD WE EVER!
I think that I’ll save that experience for it’s own special post since the meal was over 3.5 hours long and consisted of 14 courses and a tour of the kitchen and grounds. Long story short:
It. was. amazing. 😍
The other two days we spent walking around site-seeing. We visited:
One place that we did not have time to see was Tivoli Gardens. I still don’t know if I regret this or if this was something to easy miss. I haven’t been to a theme park since my short visit to Disney World over three years ago. The idea of long lines, large crowds, and rollercoasters just doesn’t appeal like it used to when I was 14. But Tivoli is one of the world’s oldest theme parks and has some beautiful gardens. If I had the chance again, I think that I would go to see and visit the grounds alone.
Here are some shots from our stay in Copenhagen:
Some shots around Christiania. You aren’t allowed to photograph some parts within the free state:
Out and about Copenhagen, including: The Lakes, Botanical Gardens, and Nyhavn:
And that was it! An overall great impression of the city. What really stuck out to me was the overall infrastructure of the city and how well maintained it is. I enjoyed the serenity found in the heart of the city and loved the fact that people were out and about strolling in the parks or by the Lakes late into the evenings. My only criticism is the near-perfect state of everything. There weren’t any brash forms of expression of any kind whether through the city itself or it’s people. It’s of no surprise that a place like Christiania had established it self so long ago. It acts as the only visual protest of all the conformity found throughout the rest of Copenhagen. Even staying in the multicultural Nørrebro neighborhood, I felt that there was a tragic loss of diversity, especially compared to places like Berlin and Amsterdam. (SO many blonde-haired, blue-eyed people everywhere in Copenhagen!)
It’s truly a give and take with this city with this ultimately in mind: High prices for a better standard of living.
My last take: Not to live in, but I would visit again.
This post is a part of a series based on my recent two-week trip to Europe.

In June, the Civic Commons Learning Network in partnership with the Better Block Foundation hosted Civic Commons Learning Journey: Copenhagen, a four-day study trip that immersed learning network members in the public life, policy and culture of the city. Through explorations of the city by bike and frank conversations with local leaders on the work they are pursuing, we considered how the city is building and sustaining public assets that deliver more public value. On our final day in Copenhagen, we hosted a workshop session to distill learning from the two dozen participants representing Akron, Detroit and Philadelphia.
Here are 10 key lessons from the trip:
Copenhagen is known as being one of the most liveable cities in the world. But it wasn’t always this way. In the early ’90s, the city faced bankruptcy. Seeing a bleak future, the leaders of the city came together to create several strategies for change. One of these was to focus on pilot projects. The city began to expand and scale pedestrian street conversions originally built in the 1960s and parking lots that, in the 1980s, had been transformed into public squares. The goal was to create visible changes quickly that would encourage the citizens to come together. Just as important as the pilot projects was following up with permanent investments when the pilots proved successful.
In the ’60s, many cities around the world expanded their freeway infrastructure by building elevated highways. But when this idea was proposed in Copenhagen people protested. In the ’90s, when the city was nearing bankruptcy and had little money to invest, it put the money where it could be stretched — toward bicycling infrastructure.
Copenhagenize, which highlights cycling life in Copenhagen, said that because infrastructure investments of the ’60s and ’90s made it easier to bike, more people started biking. In fact, now 56 percent of Copenhageners use a bike every day. By making bicycling the most convenient option, and by keeping the cycling infrastructure simple and legible, Copenhagen has made biking the easiest, fastest and cheapest mode of transportation. “Copenhageners are just as lazy as you are,” said Morten Kabell, COO of Copenhagenize. “Fifty percent of us only ride a bicycle because the city of Copenhagen has made it fast and easy.”
In Denmark, design is everything. Every single element of every single space has been designed with the user in mind. One small example: trash cans. Each trash can has a lip on the outside for cans and glass. This way, it’s easier for people who need those items to grab them for recycling.
The city has also found ways to maximize its spaces by taking down the fences and designing areas to support a wide variety of activities. An example: a large courtyard next to a marketplace that serves as both a schoolyard playground and common space with a basketball court. During lunch, multiple worlds collide in one cohesive space. And in terms of policy, the city is redesigning all of its schoolyards to be fenceless so they are open and welcoming to the community.
We ended our trip at Gehl Architects, where Mayra Madriz talked through the firm’s approach to building cities, highlighting the importance of design. “Consider urban life before urban space and urban space before buildings,” Mayra said.
Copenhagen’s architecture policy promotes a people-first approach. Chief City Architect Tina Saaby holds position of influence, advising politicians and city administrators alike. When a development proposal crosses her desk, her first question is, “Who is the landscape architect?” She recognizes that the space between buildings is where public life either thrives or fails to thrive.
When a crisis faces Copenhagen, the city’s response often comes in the form of investments in public life. While bankruptcy spurred some of the best bike infrastructure in the world, climate change catalyzed the concept of cloud burst parks. This network of green public spaces mitigates flooding by holding and filtering excess water. They also serve as a natural playscape.
For significant neighborhood-wide investments, the project managers from the city’s urban planning department don’t do their jobs from city hall or in an administrative building downtown. Instead, they work in the neighborhood’s culture house. For example, Eva Christensen and Sia Boensen, project managers in the neighborhood of Nørrebro, lead a diverse team of architects, planners and social scientists who will be based in the community for six years. Their mission involves co-creating a set of projects. Together with neighbors, they’ll reimagine Hans Tavsens Park as a cloud burst park that combines stormwater management with recreation, complete neighborhood-wide transportation planning and develop safe streets. But the city and the planning team see their work as much more than capital projects. The team is also interested in understanding existing social networks and the exploring the connecting between infrastructure investments and building social capital.
Whimsy. That was the one word that kept coming to mind when visiting the various parks and public spaces throughout Copenhagen. Trampolines embedded in sidewalks are just the start. Each park was unique, playful and a reflection of the neighborhood that surrounded it. For example, Monstrum, a playground design company, created the Crooked Houses in the Brumbley neighborhood. The houses can be climbed in and on, slid down and crawled between. They are a near-identical reflection of the neighborhood homes, yet slightly topsy-turvy.
But the parks in Copenhagen aren’t just about kids. They allow for unexpected moments of joy, relaxation and, in some cases, the thrill of fear for all ages. At Folkets Park, for example, a bridge was designed that wasn’t reflective of the community’s needs, so a new designer transformed the bridge into a parkour course. The bridge has self-moderating aspects (such as a second step that is too high for most children to make) to keep it safe while still allowing for a thrill. And many parks offer cafe kiosks for adults to buy a coffee and chat with a friend or a stranger.
From Torvehallerne to Reffen by Copenhagen Street Food, there is no shortage of great food markets in Copenhagen. These sites are serving as on-ramps for entrepreneurs to test their products. They make it easier for vendors to focus on their products, while providing shared services like bathrooms, seating, trash, permitting and marketing. They also happen to be public spaces capable of attracting people from every background, if they keep an eye on price points to ensure they remain welcoming to all. Reffen’s founder, Dan Husted, has proven his concept once before with a temporary food court that gained acclaim. He hopes to do the same with this new concept in a forgotten area. “We decide the primary colors, then we invite the public to paint the canvas,” he says.
Jacob Hartmann is an instigator turned city bureaucrat, and his Sharing Copenhagen mini-grants capture a spirit of “yes” in a way not often seen in municipal government. The grants are tied to the vision for the city and allow everyday citizens to test new ideas for change, from a floating sauna to a pop-up farm to a program that encourages hitchhiking. And when the easy answer is “no,” we can’t allow for that, he works with urban innovators to get to “maybe” — and sometimes asks for permission later. From inside city government, he has developed a program that fosters active citizen engagement in making the city more sustainable, and more fun.
Nearly every city has them: natural features that were once polluted and still carry the stigma of being dirty and unsafe. Just 15 years ago, the water in Copenhagen’s harbour was so polluted that it posed a health risk. Alongside unsexy municipal efforts to make the waters clean, like wastewater treatment plants and a modernized sewage system, the city also made public space investments like the harbour baths, parks and pathways along the water that have drastically changed the use and narrative of this waterfront. Now harbour baths are packed on warm summer days, a bicycle chef uses a harbourside spot as his homebase and a maritime education center cultivates oysters and mussels in the urban waterways.
There are many reasons Copenhagen is studied, imitated and beloved. The bicycling infrastructure alone makes it something to strive for. However, the city is not perfect. No city is. While we experienced many beautiful examples of infrastructure, public space and collaboration in Copenhagen, we were jarred by the discussion of race, immigration and who truly belonged. Or, perhaps, by the lack of discussion. In some of our conversations and experiences in the city, multiculturalism was characterized as a burden, rather than a value. This article offers context for what we witnessed.
It was a stark reminder of why Reimagining the Civic Commons holds socioeconomic mixing as a goal for public space investments. Bringing people of all backgrounds to share in public life and build trust will not happen without intention.
We realized that, while we went to Copenhagen to study and be inspired, our demonstrations cities are inspirational, too. Through their approach to revitalizing and connecting public assets, they are setting a new standard for advancing civic engagement and “creating the welcome.” This realization reflects the value of learning journeys: they create moments for team members to experience, to learn, and to reflect on our shared work with a fresh perspective.

Copenhagen is the best of Europe distilled into one city, the continent at its most perfect.
From the airport, we take the metro, a clean, modern train, glass-walled to let in the pale sunlight. The airport was like this too, not the gray, military aesthetic of Reykjavik where we had a layover, but a space with curves and glass and white paint.
The ride reminds me that I’m back in Europe. Well-dressed people in coats and scarves and shoes that click against the ground step on and off. The train moves with an almost silent whir down tracks that look new but must be at least a century old. Outside, red-brick houses flash by that make me think of England: the same gabled, tiled roofs, the same compactness.
Our hostel is in the Nørrebro district, at the end of a long, connected row of 19th century red-brick buildings. On the way, we pass falafel and shawarma places, cool, dark bars in tiny storefronts, and well-lit cafes where people work on laptops. There’s at least one bike shop on every street so far, and special bike lanes separated from the road where the cyclists breeze by with enviable nonchalance.
The hostel is simultaneously hip and cozy: long wooden tables, old, circular metal lamps shining dark yellow light, and a bar that sells both coffee and beer. Large windows look out onto the quiet street, where a row of parked bikes points down to a 19th century building, mostly brick but renovated to include a glass elevator, and a church on the adjacent block looming against the gray sky.
We check in with the receptionist, who like everyone here looks at once elegant and casual, with blonde hair in a ponytail and the sleeves of her gray sweater rolled up to reveal forearm tattoos. Our room is in a separate building, and we get there by following a trail of sheep painted onto the sidewalk.
Out primal need is sleep, but after washing up, we head out to find food. Yelp suggests a “toast bar” which proves to be excellent, with dark, rich coffee and sandwiches smothered in various melted cheeses. The barista is a guy with a beanie, a beard, and tattoos who talks in a loud, echoing voice and looks like he runs a bike shop part-time. There are a few others in the cafe, but two are on laptops and the other two are a couple who aren’t talking, which gives the room a strange silence. We sit at the window, where a candle drips white wax onto the counter. Outside, bundled up pedestrians walk small dogs. In the building facing us, a guy stands at the window, having an intense cell-phone conversation. Across the street is another cafe, with a black exterior, a dark interior, and a small chalkboard sign advertising pricey lunch specials. To the left is a park with a modernist sculpture of twisted metal bars and a brick apartment building with the words “FREE GAZA” written in large, white block letters.
At one point, the two women working on their laptops go outside to smoke. They leave their jackets inside and stand huddled in their sweaters, breathing out a mix of smoke and cold breath.
From there, we walk down to what I at first think is a river or a canal but later learn is an artificial lake, created back in the Middle Ages. Across the water, the houses have that grand, 19th century look: mansard roofs, symmetrical windows, brick and stucco painted various shades of red and white. They go on endlessly down the bank and remind me of Budapest, but with warmer colors. People walk dogs and linger along the grass and feed the swans. A couple sits on a bench, talking about sex in Danish-accented and perfectly articulate English. I notice that everyone in Copenhagen is as young as we are, as if the city exists only for millennials. Los Angeles by contrast always feels slightly older, a city for tired people in their late thirties and early forties.
We cross the lake at a large embankment, along a pedestrian path separated from the busy street by trees and manicured shrubbery and past a large white pavilion, late 19th or early 20th century, situated along the water. On the other side of the lake, the street becomes H.C. Andersens Boulevard, and the buildings are bigger are more varied. Across the street is a brick building that’s an unfortunate mix of architectural styles — a neo-Gothic crenelated tower centered between two large, gabled roofs, like an orphanage from a Dickens’ novel, 19th century kitsch — and beyond it rise the flat roofs of the 20th century and the shining glass walls of the 21st. We walk leisurely down the sidewalk in these buildings’ shadows while everything breezes by us, the bikes and the cars and the pedestrians walking briskly in coats and scarves, all moving with a comforting urban indifference.
Traffic here is the densest we’ve seen in Denmark, as busy as Wilshire or Santa Monica Boulevard. Somehow, though, it all seems more orderly, less chaotic, as if like everything else here, it too is better regulated.
#
In the center of the city and across from the train station sits Tivoli Gardens, an 1840s-era amusement park supposedly built to distract the country’s population from protesting the absolute monarchy, now bedecked with Christmas lights and related items: trees, gnomes, snowmen, a building lined with several austere Nutcrackers, a wooden reindeer that looks like a Trojan Horse, a strange mirrored wall mounted with polar bear heads wearing Santa hats. There are lots of children about, and the adults are mostly mothers in groups pushing strollers, or young couples enjoying the kitsch. The park is like Disneyland, and was in fact one of the inspirations, though it’s smaller and quainter and less corporate. There are different sections corresponding to regions of the world — some pagodas representing either China or Japan, domed mosques for the Middle East or India, a lighthouse and a pirate ship possibly signifying Europe. It’s only vaguely and benignly racist, and nothing out of the ordinary for the 19th century. Bronze statues from that era are sprinkled throughout the park, including one of the founder, Georg Carstensen, looking proud and dapper with his mustache and top hat.
We stroll leisurely through the crowds, past food stands and stores selling magnets and memorabilia. I buy a glogg, which tastes pleasantly warm on a day this cold, though the best part is getting to recycle the plastic cup in one of the futuristic red kiosks, which lowers my cup down into the void with a mechanical whir and then gives me back 5 kroner. It’s an extremely practical and efficient solution to incentivize recycling, which is probably why the United States would never use it.
In the middle of the park we find an octagonal glass theater, a replica of one built in the late 1800s, which Nazi sympathizers burned down in the 1940s. Out beyond the walls of Tivoli, meanwhile, rises city hall, red brick towers capped with green spires, built in the early 20th century but speaking much more of the 1600s.
In this moment, I feel very close to the past. Like the crenelations on city hall, it feels like a ring surrounding us. Take away the phones and the electric lights and make the coats longer and give everyone top hats and we might as well be in the 1800s when the park first opened. Take away the park and give everyone ruffled collars and we’d be in the 1600s. Only 600 years before that, and we’d all be Vikings in huts.
#
The National Gallery, or the Statens Museum for Kunst, is across the city, though still within walking distance. It’s colder now, so we pull our scarves tighter as we walk down the empty streets. Soon we reach the white stone of Christiansborg Palace, and across the canal from it, along Nybrogade, a row of picturesque 17th and 18th century houses, narrow and built against each other, painted red and white and dark-brown. The sunset above streaks the sky with wisps of purple and brings out the color of each building. Even the yellow construction crane is more vivid and seems a remnant of past centuries.
We reach a small bridge and cross it into a Christmas market selling gnome statues and wooden souvenirs, and food of course. I smell sausages and see mushrooms simmering in a vat of butter. Behind me, the sun dips behind two rows of houses on opposite sides of a canal, and paints the whole scene, including a distant bronze statue, in a cold, yellow light — a sunset-hued cityscape, postcard-perfect, on all sides colors like an artist’s palette.
The city darkens as we move across it, past contemporary shops and dark streets and cyclists. It’s only 4:00, but it feels much later. A languor settles over us, and I remember our lack of sleep.
We reach Rosenborg Slot, Christian IV’s 17th century palace, and we walk across the park behind it, down a path lined with trees whose bare branches meet overhead. The castle looks romantically sinister silhouetted through the trees, but also small, “like a toy castle” K______ says, especially next to the block-long 19th century houses stretching down the parallel street. The park and the castle remind me of Oxford — a small patch of the past preserved despite the various encroaching presents pushing in from all around.
Just past the park is the museum, a grand, 19th century building reminiscent of museums from Britain, built to reflect the glory of the nation, or whatever. We’re both tired and cold, but on the walk up the large steps I feel exhilaration.
Inside, we find familiar European art. There’s a Titian portrait of a gentleman staring thoughtfully off to the left, a painting by a follower of Bosch of tiny figures against a bleak brown landscape, and quite a few Lucas Cranachs — various women with big heads and weird chins, and one work titled Melancholy depicting three oddly shaped infants trying to push a stone ball through a hoop with sticks while a winged woman watches them wistfully and several witches ride goats in a distant corner. But the highlights of the museum are the Danish pieces, a tour through one of the lesser known traditions of European art. In the first room are portraits of Danish royals from the 17th century and 18th century, all painted by the same Swedish-born court painter, C.G. Pilo, and opposite them, portraits of the bourgeoisie by Jens Juel, the most prominent one of an odd-looking middle-class family standing before a plantation. The room’s juxtaposition is perfect, ingeniously displaying the fundamental change of the 18th century, the rise and triumph of the bourgeoisie in all their awkward glory.
The next room has allegorical and historical paintings, and the following room works from the Romantic Era inspired by Caspar David Friedrich. A late-19th century room has some vaguely orientalist paintings of reclining women by Elisabeth Baumann and a wonderful work by Carl Bloch, of a man and two women eating dinner at a table and staring in surprise back at the viewer, their wine carafes tellingly half-empty, a guilty look on the man’s face. I assume his wife must be the viewer, having just caught him in the early stages of what might have become a threesome.
There’s also a beautiful late-19th century piece by J.F. Willumsen, titled En bjergbestigerske (A Mountain Climber), of a woman in a white sweater standing in front of a mountain, her walking stick leaning casually behind her, her cloak hanging lightly off her shoulders, and her hip thrust to the side as she looks boldly into the distance. According to the plaque, Willumsen’s artistic movement was called vitalism, and vitality is exactly what the woman gives off. She is more alive than the inert, distant mountains, a triumph of humanity over nature, her fierce stare made bolder by the vaguely impressionistic style of the piece, the soft colors and the murky brush strokes.
Finally, there’s a room of paintings by Vilhelm Hammershøi: cold, melancholy portraits of empty artist’s studios and solitary women, like sad Vermeers. Everything is cast over in a gray-blue pallor, all bleak, forlorn — how appropriate for the dawn of the 20th century.
We leave around 6:00 PM, very tired now, and buy falafel and shawarma from near our apartment. We eat in the hostel common room, quickly, not talking, plastic bags and foil strewn everywhere. Back in our rooms, we shower and are asleep by 8:00.

Biking in Copenhagen is exhilarating. We sail without much effort along cold winds, over bridges, down through old buildings, along wall-paved, separated bike lanes. Cold air whips at my face and nose and my poorly wrapped scarf comes untangled in the wind, but it all feels glorious moving among the herd of cyclists, not worrying about passing cars, feeling safety in numbers. We stop at an intersection behind a cluster of ten bikes, mostly young people like ourselves, some mothers with babies strapped into tiny seats, a few older men who look fitter than me, everyone leaning gracefully to one side as they wait for the light to change.
#
Christiansborg Palace, the old seat of the monarchy and the current seat of Parliament, is largely a lesser-Versailles, a 20th-century reconstruction of the site’s various older palaces which all burned down. But amidst the standard set of stately and filigreed reception rooms we find the Great Hall, a room whose expensive chandeliers and 18th century allegorical ceiling are belied by the floor tiles’ 20th-century black and white pattern and, the room’s highlight, the 17 ultra-modern tapestries. They chronicle Denmark’s history, from the Viking era to the 21st century, and are done in a self-consciously non-Western style, reminiscent of Diego Rivera’s murals in Mexico City, with vivid, wild colors, bright reds and dark greens and deep purples. We take our time before several of them, using the laminated guides to identify the various figures. Some names I know — the Viking Kings Ragnar Lothbrok and Harald Bluetooth, the Arab traveler Ibn Fadlan, Margaret “the Lady King” of the medieval Kalmar Union — but most are unrecognizable, a rush of history that swirls together in all the bright color.
There’s one tapestry titled “The Future” depicting two men in suits hovering in a nebula of blue and purple, surrounded by floating microbes and crystals and drawings of atoms and solar systems, “the bionic men” as K______ calls them. The irony of course is that Denmark already is the future: a country with safe bike lanes and universal healthcare and free higher education and a minimum wage twice as high as the United States and 5 weeks paid vacation and 32 weeks paid family leave and 85% voter turnout and overall some of the happiest people in the world.

The National Museum has an impressive collection of historical artifacts. We spend most of our time on the bottom floor, amidst the pre-Viking stuff, prehistoric arrowheads and cerated harpoons and burnt animals bones offered as ritual sacrifices. There are large skeletons of an aurochs and an elk, and a grave from 5000 BC with the bones of a 40-year-old woman and her 3-year-old child. The description tell us she survived several blows to the head.
Farther down we reach the Bronze Age, where we find more bodies and objects preserved in bogs or unearthed from barrows: swords, helmets, shields, jewelry, a wooden folding chair from 1400 BC, a tree-trunk coffin from 1370 with the remains of the Egtved Girl, her ragged clothing, bits of her skin and teeth, and a large bronze belt. Later, in the Iron Age we find a metal carriage pulled up from a bog, with large wheels and small decorative details, and following that the Gundestrup cauldron, a large silver bowl decorated with strange non-Viking figures and animal imagery, evidence of Denmark’s early connections with the wider world. Beyond them, finally, is the Viking era, where we find shining swords and shields, drinking horns of various sizes, large rune stones etched with unfamiliar letters, and the remnants of a wooden longboat.
The museum’s most interesting item, though, is the Trundholm sun chariot, from 1800 BC: a bronze statue of the sun pulled along in a chariot by a small horse. The sun is still gilded on one side and shines brightly in the dark museum gallery
I find this evidence of Bronze Age spirituality particularly fascinating. In our modern world the word “religion” has developed such negative connotations, dogmatism, stupidity, intolerance. But everything in this museum, from this chariot to the Early Modern allegorical ceilings on the floor above us to the animal bones in the Paleolithic room, show the need for some kind of religion — perhaps not the ones we have today, that speak of abstract principles of righteousness and morality, but ones like these, of people who viewed the afterlife and the supernatural in the literal terms of their own small worlds, who buried themselves with the physical objects they imagined they might need in whatever awaited them hereafter.
What would we be buried with, I wonder? Our phones perhaps?
#
Later, at the Christiansborg Palace stables, I notice how similar the royal carriages look to the iron age wagon pulled up from the bog.
#
We walk back along Rantzausgade, looking for a place to eat. Signs of Danish coziness are everyone, people visible in windows seated around a table, not bundled up like we are, candles before them, all eating and drinking slowly while relaxing and talking, signs of community, of warmth, inviting from the cold. We see one such group in a well-lit interior, drinking wine around half-empty plates, and I can’t tell if it’s a restaurant or just young people having dinner at home. Because of all the glass walls and big windows, at night every interior becomes so well lit, so easy to see from the street. The lack of privacy feels deliberate, as if as if projecting this image of coziness is part of the charm of the city.
We find a small place, run by a woman who both cooks and takes orders. We sit at the well-lit window, next to the dark street and split a hummus sandwich, vegan chili, and a nice, fruity Danish IPA. Afterwards, K______ goes to sleep, but I stay up in hostel with a pilsner and write. Around me is the same atmosphere I saw in all the windows. A group of Spanish tourists are chatting at my long table, everyone in sweaters rolled up at the sleeves, their scarves and jackets piled on a chair in the corner. A candle flickers in a holder amidst their beers, and mellow music plays from overhead. I feel a pleasant warmth from the outside cold.
#
The buildings on the canal-side streets of Christianshavn are nicer, richer — some are older, painted red and ochre, and some are made of brick, and along the waterfront are a few modern apartments, red stone reinforced with black metal.
Nearby is an 18th century warehouse, a long, beige, brick building, bland, unassuming, rectangular. Now it houses an art gallery and the Michelin-starred restaurant Noma, supposedly the best in the world. Dinner there would have been 2000 KR (roughly 250 dollars) each, for 6 courses. Another tourist couple are taking pictures under the sign. It’s not yet open, and the inside is mostly dark, save for the candles flickering in the window. A white shape, probably a waiter, moves in the shadows beyond the yellow flames.
Beside the warehouse is an old wooden, ship, tied to the dock and resting silently in the water. A man sits on it, eyes closed, so still he’s almost part of the boat. Against the contemporary black steel of the apartment behind it, the ship looks particularly ancient.
The warehouse’s art gallery features an Icelandic artist, whose work deals with water and climate change and methods of measurement. One of the sculptures on the second floor is a ticking clock, which echoes through the bright and empty room.
Because of the new light wood flooring and the white, newly painted walls, it’s hard to imagine this gallery as a warehouse. I try to see the sacks of grain and barrels of herring that would have lined the walls, ready to load onto merchant ships like the one outside — but I can’t. The space seems like it was built not in 1767 but in 2015, as an artistic aperitif for the haute-bourgeois diners of Noma.
#
We have lunch at Copenhagen Street Food — a hipster food market located in a former paper factory — and then bike farther north towards Refshaleøen, an old industrial area that our guidebook recommended, now mostly used for warehouse parties. The ride up takes us off the main road and along a smaller bike path that winds between broad, grassy plains, and past varied and interesting buildings, some contemporary glass and steel, some pre-industrial brick and stone. We cross a small bridge, and a large fluttering Danish flag comes into view, and below it a statue of what looks like a merman holding aloft a smaller Danish flag, angled forward, like he’s carrying it into battle. In the distance is a strange-shaped factory, a square metal hulk with a rounded top, sending darkish-white smoke up into the grey sky. The sun is still hidden, as it has been all day, and the air is bitterly cold, but the sense of adventure is enough to keep us going. Wind whips at my face, my nose is numb, my cheeks stinging, and I can feel the cold through my gloves as they’re stretched across the handlebars — but we’re moving so quickly, flying around concrete roads, bouncing across gravel, following the memory of a Google Map through an unfamiliar landscape, past signs we can’t read, the grey warehouses growing larger ahead of us. Only a few cars pass us, one or two vans, one bus, a handful of cyclists, and so it feels to us as though the landscape is all ours, Denmark a private playground.
We reach the end of a gravel road, where it meets the water. Behind us is the Mikkeler warehouse. Cinder blocks lie stacked outside the sheds and a few old cars sit empty and rusting. Everything is quiet now, and the warehouse windows dark, and no one is about expect the solitary biker who’d pulled up to a building somewhere behind us. We walk our bikes across old metal tracks which run along the gravel next to the concrete barrier separating us from the water. It’s quiet, peaceful, and majestic, to look out across the water at the row of brick buildings, now the familiar skyline of Copenhagen, the grey sky bringing out their pre-modern red. Behind us, the word “Refshaleøen” looms, written in big black letters across a gray factory building.
We take in the landscape for several long moments, our hearts still beating from our bike ride. Evidence of history stands all around us, the 18th and 19th centuries in brick out across the water, the 20th in metal stretching out behind us — but right now, it feels emphatically like the present, nothing else but 21st century, and I don’t wish we were anytime else.
After a moment, a white car turns a corner to our right and approaches us with bright headlights. The spell broken, we mount our bikes and ride back into the city.
#
From there we bike to Nyhavn then up to Amalienborg Palace, where the queen lives. We watch the guards in blue and black doing a march, which makes me think of England and Buckingham Palace. The idea of monarchy seems even more absurd up here.
From there we go inside the large church we’d seen from across the canal. It’s big and grand, but I don’t feel impressed, perhaps because Christianity hasn’t figured so prominently here. It may be the country’s Protestantism, but also probably that the religion in general only reached Scandinavia in the late 900s. It’s been Protestant almost as long as it’s been Catholic, and it was pagan up until almost the Crusades. A thousand years of Church history and tradition don’t even exist here. Warehouses seem better symbols of Copenhagen than churches.
From there, we go to the Danish Design Museum, where we find among other things an exhibit on chairs. “The chair is one of the most culture-bearing objects we ever invented,” the description says. “It reveals everything about the age and society in which it was created.” A folding chair from the 20th century makes me think of the folding chair from the bog we saw yesterday at the history museum — as with the carriages, a consistency from past to present.
From there, we bike up to the Little Mermaid Statue. The sun has almost set now, and to our right over green hills rises a stone church, beautifully backlit against the fading day. We pass though the Kastellet, a star fortress from the 1600s, the walls now mostly crumbling stone. We walk our bikes between quaint red buildings and watch three soldiers conduct a flag ceremony. They look like Boy Scouts rather than grown men.
The Mermaid is naked, like a Greek statue, and very sad, sitting atop a pile of rocks and looking longingly out across the water. It’s 4:30 now, and practically dark. Across the canal, we can see Refshaleøen, where we just were, the black letters written on the gray building. It seems so far to have come in just half a day.
#
Rosenborg Palace is dark and poorly lit, as expected in a 17th century building, and outside the latticed windows rain falls from a gray sky. But inside, the various royal treasures sparkle: gilded chests, fine wooden cabinets, small objects of ivory and amber, paintings ranging from humble landscapes to wild allegories to austere portraits of men, women, and horses, all in all an impressive collection that takes us from the castle’s construction in 1606 under Christian IV to the end of Denmark’s absolute monarchy in 1848. On the top floor is the throne room with antechambers holding the King’s collections of glass and porcelain, and in the basement is the royal treasury, with crowns and scepters and gold rings. The palace’s most interesting object, though, is tucked away in a small glass case against a wall of one of the 19th century rooms: the pen King Frederick VII used to sign the 1849 constitution.
Afterwards, we go to the Worker’s Museum where instead of rooms glorifying individual Kings we find a space honoring the nameless millions of the 20th century. In the central hall where union leaders once met hang the flags of various labor organizations, most of them a vivid, socialist red against the beige walls. In one of the exhibits in the basement, several old union flags have been stitched together into a single red banner, now reading “HOPE NOT FEAR”.
One of the rooms has a small exhibit on Thorvald Stauning, Denmark’s first social democratic prime minister, elected in 1924, and the country’s longest serving PM of the 20th century. He came from a working class background and trained as a cigar sorter before getting involved in politics. We stare at his big, bearded face in some surprise. As we’d just learned, Denmark had still been an absolute monarchy only 74 years before. And now, 90 years after, it’s one of the world’s preeminent social democracies.
If Denmark can change that much so quickly, then why can’t we, the United States, already born as a republic?
#
The only thing that frustrates us here in Denmark is the small window for lunch. It’s 3:00 and we’re wandering Kødbyen, the former meatpacking district in Vesterbro, going warehouse to warehouse only to find that most of the bourgeois restaurants are closed until dinner at 6:00. The fish place our guidebook recommended is open till 3:30, but it looks too expensive. The Indian restaurant does take-out only. A pub serving beer and burgers is open all day, but it looks like something we could find in Los Angeles. Eventually, at 3:30, we sit down in a packed Italian place. Neither of us particularly wants Italian food, but we’re both hungry. After ten minutes, though, the waiters still haven’t brought us menus, so we get up and leave. The waitress gives us an irritated look as we button up our coats.
We eat ultimately at Øl & Brød, a slightly upscale lunch place attached to the Mikkeller bar we were at earlier, open till 4:00. The tables have white tablecloths and the clientele is mostly older, except for a group of six posh guys in their early 20s, all wearing sweaters over button-downs and with the same expensive haircut, like some Danish version of the Bullingdon Club. We’re too hungry to bother converting the prices on the menu until after we order. The food is delicious: 3 open faced sandwiches (smørrebrød) and a savory chicken tartelet filled with gravy.
When the bill comes, we have just enough cash to cover it.
#
One our final day, we wait on the empty platform for our mid-morning train to Stockholm. It was warmer earlier, and even a little sunny — but now the sky is gray again and the temperature dropping.
Now and then a train passes with the smooth sound of sliding metal, and the occasional bundled up pedestrian or cyclist moves by on the street above. But for the most part everything is quiet and almost desolate. The tracks would be abandoned-looking if they weren’t so pristine and well-maintained. But this ghost-town quality is an appropriate way to bid farewell to Copenhagen, as we felt it several times over the last few days, from Nørrebro to Refshaleøen to Kødbyen. As always, everyone must be inside now, staying warm behind the yellow lights.
In looking at all the buildings, I can’t help, of course, but note the mix of centuries: the brick train station of the early 20th century in the foreground, the elegant mansard roofs of the 19th century repeating down along the street, the distant concrete of the late 20th century, and out beyond the floating glass and steel of today.
Dominating the horizon is the ugly SAS hotel, a Le-Corbusier-inspired tower of misguided modernity. There was a brief section on it in the Design Museum, about how when it was constructed in the 1950s, the architect Arne Jacobsen sincerely believed it would be the pinnacle of architectural form, functionalism perfected. It looks even worse here than similar buildings do in the United States, too clumsy next to the elegant brick or the floating glass. But considering everything else we saw, its imperfection is forgivable.

Back in 2014, the news in Copenhagen was that the modal share bikes exploded between 2012 and 2013, from 36% to 45%. A whopping 9% increase in people arriving at a destination in the City of Copenhagen for work or education. That had never happened anywhere before. At the same time, the modal share for motorists fell from 27% to 23%.
We were in the midst of one of the greatest urban transport experiments in the world, and didn’t really realise it.
For years I’ve espoused the benefits of following the simple traffic planning guide at the top of this article. Prioritise the three, inherently inter-modal transport forms on the left — bikes, pedestrians and public transport — and make driving a car a pain the ass. Make it the slower option, make it more expensive and difficult, and you’re on your way to a bright transport future. I call it A2Bism. It’s what every human who has ever lived wants the most: to go quick from A to B. Humans are like rivers — we’ll always seek out the quickest route.
So what happened between 2012 and 2013 in Copenhagen? The City made it a pain in the ass to drive a car. Not on purpose, mind you. The construction of a new Metro line, with 17 stations, was underway and, in a glorious coincidence of bad municipal communication, the city also dug up streets to upgrade the pipes for our district heating. The city was one big squiggly line — primarily for cars. In biannual surveys since the 1990s, a continuous majority of Copenhageners have declared that their primary reason for riding a bike is the fact that it’s the quickest way from A2B. The City inadvertently enabled them to go to the next level, at the expense of car traffic.
Fast-forward to late 2019. The new Metro ring line has just opened. The contstruction hoarding has been removed and roads are returning to how they were before the work began. This great urban experiment is going to go one of two ways. Either the City learns from it and keeps that squiggly line or we just return to the car-centric status quo we started with.
I’ve never been a fan of the Metro expansion. A city this size doesn’t need a metro — it needs tramways like so many other cities in Europe. I don’t advocate shoving citizens underground. They should be on street level on foot, on bicycle and in trams. My colleagues around Europe basically point and laugh when I tell them that we have bus routes with 50,000 passengers a day and the City ISN’T building tramways. The main problem in Copenhagen is that we have so much money and we have delusions of grandeur.
But hey. I guess I didn’t succeed in talking the city out of building the metro expansion. The new M3 line doesn’t go anywhere new. It just spins around in a circle and goes to places that have been easily accessible by bike for over a century. The Metro has been falsely advertising travel times for years. Advertising station to station, but not the first and last mile to and from the station. I sent out a team a few years ago to map travel times using real world scenarios and — no surprise — the bike usually beats the Metro in Copenhagen.
There are more great statistics from the glorious period of 2012–2013. The average bike trip length in Copenhagen rose 35% from 3.2 km to 4.2 km between 2012 and 2013. That means that the oft-quoted statistic about how Copenhageners cycle 1.2 million km a day needed to be upgraded to 2,006,313 km per day.
When the results of the travel survey came out back in 2014, journalists were scrambling for answers. Two researchers at DTU were “surprised”. They were quoted in the Danish press as saying things like, “uh… the City’s new bridges and traffic calming on certain streets seem to have worked. Giving cyclists carrots encourage cycling.”
The detail they forgot was that the new cycling bridges weren’t finished yet, nor was the traffic calming on Amagerbrogade. The Nørrebrogade stretch is from 2008. Cycling rose on that street by 15% but that was BEFORE 2012. Duh. Basically, there hadn’t been much carrot dangling in this city for a few years. So forget about THAT hastily thunk up theory.
It was simply a combination of construction sites and district heating pipes being upgraded. It was a fantastic urban experiment.
In the original feasibility study for the new M3 line, I found an alarming statistic buried in the document. It was estimated that cycling levels in the city would drop by 2.8% after the completion of the new line. Then we saw that fantastic, unexpected rise of 9% between 2012 and 2013.
Can we now expect a drop in the modal share for bikes of 12% in Copenhagen? Perhaps. You read it here first.
Unless, of course, the City of Copenhagen has the cajones to embrace this experiment and use it to finally make The Leap — as described by author Chris Turner — into the future of our city. Expanding and widening the cycle tracks. Reallocating space from falling car traffic to bicycles and public transport. The new BRT route in Copenhagen is a good step. Let’s see how much farther we can go. Designing cities instead of engineering them.
They can listen to me or they can just listen to the simple logic of children.
The citizens have shown us that they will be on our side if we do the right thing.
Otherwise, this rich petri dish experiment will just rot and be forgotten.

Shortly after joining Tymit, I started hearing whispers about KotlinConf’25 in Copenhagen. I’d never been to an international conference before — let alone one dedicated to a language I use every day as a Junior Android Developer. The excitement was real! I couldn’t wait to see what the global Kotlin community looked like up close.
When I finally arrived, I was blown away by the energy. The event was so well organized — registration was fast, the talks started on time, and everything felt super professional. I had been worried that most of the sessions would be too advanced for me, but there was something for everyone, no matter your experience level.
What really struck me was seeing Kotlin’s potential in action. I already knew Kotlin was powerful, but it’s something else to be in a room full of developers from all over the world, sharing their passion for the language. The enthusiasm was contagious — even developers who don’t use Kotlin every day were getting inspired! I was especially surprised to see backend and even iOS developers interested in Kotlin Multiplatform. It made me realize that Kotlin is much bigger than just Android development; it’s a growing ecosystem with a place for everyone.
Attending KotlinConf with my Tymit team made the experience even better. We picked out talks together, grabbed lunch between sessions, and just enjoyed being part of the event as a team. It helped us bond and made the whole trip unforgettable.
The conference started with an inspiring keynote by Roman Elizarov, who walked us through how Kotlin has evolved and teased some amazing features coming soon. The talk that stood out most for our team was “Rich Errors in Kotlin” by Sébastien Deleuze, which introduced a new way to handle errors in Kotlin.
Day 1 Highlights:
Day 2 Highlights:
A lot of talks focused on AI and Kotlin Multiplatform, both of which I’m really excited about. I left the conference full of ideas for side projects and new tools to try at work.
We also got to see Junie, JetBrains’ new AI assistant for their IDEs like Android Studio. We’re planning to try it out on our team, hoping it’ll help us automate tasks and boost productivity.
The Rich Errors proposal especially caught our eye — we think it could make our app even more robust.
Overall, KotlinConf’25 was an amazing experience. I’m so grateful to Tymit for making it possible. If you ever get a chance to attend, don’t hesitate — you’ll come back inspired, connected, and ready to level up!

Copenhagen is my city. I still feel like that, even after having moved (far) away and not lived here for years. It still feels like home.
I’ve walked through its parks with my boys when they were little chubby babies sleeping in warm blankets in their prams.
I’ve cycled along its lakes for a decade on my way to work.
I’ve discussed world peace and literature and art with my friends at its cafes and bars for countless hours.
I know its streets and parks, and museums and galleries like the back of my hand.
And furthermore, it is home to my closest friends.
In other words, this place has a special place in my heart, which is also why this guide and description might be a tad bias. I hope you can bear with me.
I just spent ten days in Copenhagen. And from the moment I arrived, the special Copenhagen feeling seeped through my bones and made me feel at home and eager to get out walk and cycle and sit at the harbor area with a glass of white wine and wind in my hair.

The Danish National Opera House — opened in 2005—is located on a small island in Copenhagen’s inner harbor. It is one of the most technically advanced in the world. It is also one of the most expensive, costing a cool half a billion dollars.
Situated very strategically, the opera house is sited at the end of what is called the Amalienborg Axis in the very heart of Copenhagen, Denmark’s capital city. The Axis is equivalent to the National Mall in Washington D.C. It is a stone plaza that bisects the Queen’s residential compound, terminating at the Marble Church, the largest in Denmark, and a holy shrine. Directly opposite, and clearly visible across the harbor, sits the Opera House.
The bulk of the money to build it came from the A. P. Møller Foundation, who controls the enormous fortune of the founder of the gigantic Danish shipping company, Maersk. Møller himself has a reputation for being imperious and heavy-handed.
The imposing facade of the very Danish Modern glass and concrete Opera House looms over the harbor. It was designed by the prominent Danish architecture firm, Henning Larsen. Like most established architectural design firms, Henning Larsen is big and conservative, but not that conservative. As the story goes, A.P. Møller arbitrarily overrode some of Henning Larsen’s design decisions, and this did not please the architects. Møller’s ham-fisted meddling with the architect’s design is at the heart of this story of Danish rebellion.
Less than a mile from the Opera House is the autonomous neighborhood of Christiania, encompassed entirely within the city limits of Copenhagen. Formerly an Army barracks, Christiania was abandoned in the late 1960s only to be occupied by hippie squatters in the early 1970s. The authorities never bothered to kick them out and left them to their own devices, so they established their own informal government and rules. It’s home to several successful businesses like the eponymous cargo bicycles that are ubiquitous in bike-loving Copenhagen. Today, the community is home to about 850 people, most of whom are artists, craftsmen, performers, and other creative people who, like their hippie forbears, lean to the left politically.
Christiania, though, is famous for marijuana. For more than 40 years the Copenhagen authorities have turned a blind eye to widespread pot selling and smoking as long as it stayed within the boundaries of the former army base. Christiania residents confine pot sales to one short avenue, often called “Green Street.” Photography on Green Street is strictly forbidden, and brandishing a camera might get you summarily escorted out of town by a dozen offended citizens. Even though Christiania now has its own government, commerce, mayor, and many respectable full time residents, it remains a bold counter-culture statement right in the heart of conservative, Christian, Copenhagen, a living symbol of tolerance and independence. Christiania also proudly flies its own flag, which is orange with three yellow circles in a horizontal line. More than anything else, this iconic flag represents the anti-establishment spirit of Christiania.
The imposing Opera House, on the other hand, is an important civic building representing traditional values and the triumph of global trade and capitalism. But even vastly wealthy, self-important capitalists need to hire creative people, and it is unwise to abuse them, as A.P. Møller learned.
Long after the industrialist Møller forced the unwanted changes on Henning-Larsen’s design, and long after he innocently approved the lighting plan, which included the installation of three gigantic round chandeliers in the auditorium foyer, it gradually dawned on the good citizens of Copenhagen that the Henning-Larsen architectural firm had got the last laugh. At night, after it gets very dark, the entire Opera House glows a certain shade of orange, and the three giant round chandeliers shine a certain shade of yellow, all in a horizontal line with a characteristic spacing, all clearly visible from the Marble Church, the Amalienborg Axis, and the Queen’s Palace. It’s a gentle, subtle, anti-establishment gesture of defiance to those with more dollars than sense.
Heartwarming, isn’t it?

The Liberators: Unleashing Organizational Superpowers

Last week, we visited the LEGO Group’s office in Copenhagen. Where the office in Billund is hard to miss, the one in Copenhagen is nicely hidden in the city center. It reminded me of Harry Potter searching for platform nine-and-three-quarters. 😄
One reason for our visit was to gather feedback from real users of our product, Columinity. We can look long and hard into our crystal ball to search for clues about customers’ experiences or ask them instead. With 150 active teams, it shouldn’t be too difficult to find someone using it. 🔎
During our session, we focused on talking with various Agile Coaches using it to support their teams in continuously improving based on scientific insights and evidence-based feedback.
We *almost* started a classic open discussion (the horror 😱)…
Luckily, the idea of running a lightweight version of the Liberating Structure “User Experience Fishbowl” came to mind. This seemed to make sense, given our goal of collecting real users’ experiences. 🤔
The flow was simple:1. A small group of Agile Coaches positioned themselves in a circle in the center. For about 10 minutes, they started talking about their experiences using Columinity. 2. At the same time, Denny de Waard, myself, and a few others were listening. Whenever a question came to mind, we threw fish food (representing the question) into the bowl. Christina Mumm had the brilliant idea of using LEGO bricks as “fish food.” 🐠 3. After 10 minutes, we flipped roles. The users became the listeners, and we (the original listeners) positioned ourselves in the middle and shared what we noticed in the first round. What experiences stood out? What did we like, surprise, and maybe even worry about?4. For a final time, the users returned to the center of the fishbowl and continuously shared new thoughts and experiences. 5. After roughly 45 minutes ⏰, we closed the UX Fishbowl.
I considered it a valuable experience. It resulted in lots of feedback we can use to improve the use of our product. It was also an excellent (IMHO) example of how you can use Liberating Structures in a lightweight manner without any preparation.
Now, you probably think:
“Hey, why haven’t you included real-life pictures? Did it actually happen? Or are you just making things up here…”
Fair point. You’ll never know, but it’s a nice story, right? 😃
Additional thoughts by Christina Mumm — Agile Coach Competency Lead at the LEGO Group:
“This is not only modeling the value of Liberating Structures ;) It’s about deliberately creating opportunities for necessary conversations across any divide. In this case, we are choosing to close the gap between internal and external (customer- vendor). Working as one team brings value to everyone much faster. Why would we want to keep a distance? I hope we can inspire others to do the same by walking the talk this way.”
Whether it happened or not, why don’t you try this yourself? If you already have used UX Fishbowl, how did it work for you?

Last week I went to Copenhagen, Denmark. It was my first time traveling outside the country since the trip I took to Italy with my friends Corey and Amanda in 2018, a vacation booked when at least two-thirds of us were in the throes of romantic angst. On that trip we drank a lot of Aperol spritzes, ate arancini from a beachside stand most mornings we were in Sicily, and had the best pasta of our lives in Rome. Due to a language mix-up we also accidentally ordered seven sandwiches instead of a charcuterie board. It was a great vacation and I returned to the United States more tan and improbably more relaxed than I had been before. (I had not been relaxed when we left.)
This trip to Denmark was not a vacation but a trip for work. The startup I work for has an office in Soho, where most of the business functions of the company operate, and another office in Copenhagen, where our design, product and engineering teams are located. In the spirit of the company value of hygge and togetherness, I boarded a plane at Newark headed for Copenhagen last Sunday evening. Though I intended to knock myself out and sleep for the entirety of the 8-hour flight (I had a vision of landing in Copenhagen at 7 am local time, looking and feeling fresh as a daisy and invigorated by a good night’s sleep) Scandinavian Airlines had other plans for me — namely, feeding me two large meals throughout the…

I recently returned from a two-week trip to Europe, and I obviously spent a lot of time observing pedestrian and bicycle culture and infrastructure. Rather than simply envy our neighbors across the pond for their walkable and bike-friendly cities and believe that we Yanks could never match their high active transportation mode shares, I was constantly thinking how I could translate my experiences and observations into on-the-ground change here in the U.S. I also realized that we have some progressive transportation infrastructure on our own soil to be proud of.
We first made the pilgrimage to Copenhagen — the Promised Land for many Americans in the bicycle/pedestrian profession… And it lived up to the hype! The comprehensive network of physically separated cycle tracks was incredible and refreshing, of course, but I was more impressed by how easy it was to walk around the city. Several of the major streets were actually pedestrianized, with motor vehicles prohibited. While some examples of this concept exist in the U.S. — including Santa Monica’s Third Street Promenade — they feel rather manufactured and not organic.
Even with the dreary weather, we were sad to leave the playground of Copenhagen. But Paris was awaiting us! I had a mental image of Paris as the small, charming town along the river that is shown in films and travel magazines. However, I was immediately made aware of the city’s sprawling size and wide, auto-clogged boulevards. In a way, I was reminded of my hometown of Los Angeles, except that Paris’s Metro system blankets the region. In a flip from my experience in Copenhagen, I had gone to Paris expecting a walker’s paradise, but instead saw a budding cycling haven. The city had already squeezed cycle tracks along many of the major boulevards, and the famous Vélib’ public bicycles were as common a sight as sidewalk cafés and baguettes. The bicycle network appears set up to help Parisians close the “first mile/last mile gap” that often exists in a trip using public transit. I would love to see Los Angeles and other U.S. cities with mass transit networks pursue a similar course.
Finally, we ended our vacation by hanging out in the pedestrian paradises that are old Spanish cities. Barcelona, our first stop, was seemingly built to make walking a pleasurable experience, with interesting side streets, promenades, and commercial districts around every corner. Barcelona and other Spanish cities like Granada and Toledo also make good use of shared streets, or woonerfs, to make streets safe in constrained neighborhoods.
Finally, the many plazas and parklets in Spain’s cities were a never-ending source of resting space and excellent people watching.
Although very different in many ways, Los Angeles can and should follow the lead of European cities by creating safe and pleasurable spaces for people to walk or bike and be outside enjoying our near-perfect weather. And I’m proud to say that the LA region is beginning to seriously take on that mission. Both Long Beach and Temple City now have cycle tracks. LA County Metro is planning a regional bike share program. And through the LA Department of Transportation’s People St. program, several plazas and parklets have been created or are planned for previously underused road space. I’m excited that our leaders are beginning to push for progressive changes to restore some balance to how we move around our own cities.

If you are visiting that part of Europe that is carbon neutral and scores high on sustainability, you’ll be rewarded with a perfect, clean, and green getaway like Copenhagen. From the perspective of someone like me who is an advocate for sustainable travel, their endeavors to protect the environment are laudable. I had the privilege of visiting the beautiful, bike-friendly capital of Denmark, endowed with a rich history and culture. It had long been on my bucket list and finally, the dream was fulfilled. Copenhagen was everything that I hoped for and more.
We could manage to set aside only 3 days out of our 20-day Europe itinerary and to make matters worse the weather Gods were not on our side. The day we landed was bright and sunny, but incessant rains dampened our spirits on the main day that we were there and had reserved for sightseeing. However, we refused to let the gloomy weather get us down and made the most out of our time in the city.
Copenhagen has something for everyone. From world-class museums and art galleries, centuries-old castles and palaces, and delicious food, to charming shops, cafes, and entertainment parks.
For history buffs Christianborg Palace and the Rosenberg Castle would be fascinating, giving a walkthrough the lives of Danish royalty. You may feel like skipping them if you’re there for a short time, but these grand places are worth a visit. We too were in a dilemma whether to go inside or miss it, but finally, it was a yes from everyone, and it was a great decision.
The center of the Danish Parliament, the Christianborg Palace may not have attractive exteriors, and you may not be much impressed. But once you step inside you’ll find the opulent interiors awe-inspiring. From the decor and chandeliers to the furniture and artwork, a glimpse into the lives of royalty was fabulous.
The most famous touristy spot in Copenhagen is Nyhaven. Once a 17th-century fishing village, is now a dazzling waterfront entertainment zone, with a string of cafes, restaurants, and brightly painted houses. An amusing anecdote about the reason behind these vibrantly painted houses is so that the owners recognize their homes after returning drunken in the night from the bar.
You’ll also come across centuries-old iconic wooden ships at Nyhaven, taking you back in time. It’s a pleasure to walk beside the canal and enjoy the views. There are coffee shops with fireplaces that provide hot drinks and offer a haven from the chilly winds outside. Must try is the crispy, layered Danish pastry, which is delicious.
The Little Mermaid — based on a fairy tale written by a Danish author, this bronze statue of the little mermaid sitting on a rock is situated by the waterside at the Langelinie promenade. This is a great photo spot full of tourists.
Another Copenhagen highlight is a guided boat tour of the canal. Find significant historical landmarks on this tour as described by the guide, while admiring the beauty and listening to engrossing tales from the past. The witty incidents narrated had the audience enthralled. It was interesting to know that the author of the famous story the `Ugly Duckling was a resident of Copenhagen too.
Something that is unpredictable in Copenhagen, like most of Europe is the weather. Our canal trip was therefore interrupted by showers, but thankfully the boat had a glass roof so we could still take in the scenery. Considering the erratic weather having raincoats and umbrellas with you is a necessity. Even though it may mean hauling heavier bags, it is preferable than getting drenched in the midst of your vacation.
Several modern and historic museums dot the city. We decided on the Design Museum, having a very contemporary vibe and numerous masterpieces on display.
“Sail while the breeze blows, wind and tide wait for no man” — Danish Proverb
Impromptu plans are what make holidays enjoyable. The museum was on the waterfront, and from the terrace, we located a ferry point. Just as the last of the ferries was about to depart in the evening, we hurried and got on to it for what turned out to be an adventurous ride. Though there wasn’t any specific agenda, and the program was made on the spur of the moment, the sunset boat ride was worth it. And doubly so, it was absolutely free.
Getting around is quite easy in the capital of Denmark. Though there are various modes of transport, like, metro, bus, cab, or even ferry, using a bike is common. Specific tracks on the sides of roads, make it so convenient for cycling. It not just saves fuel but keeps the surroundings free of carbon emissions. Walking around on foot appeals to some as well.
Staying at the centrally located Mayfair Hotel was a pleasant experience. Not only were the rooms comfortable, the food and ambiance nice as well. As much as we wanted to, because of a shortage of time, missed going to the famous Tivoli Gardens. Probably, a sign that we ought to come here again.

In the ninth grade I came across bioplastics, plastics derived from renewable biomass, for the first time. Since then I have spent hundreds of hours researching the space and coming up with an idea for a bioplastic made from duckweed. The thought process was that bioplastics today generally come from biomass like corn, potatoes, sugar cane, etc. but these take up acres of land to grow and need to be consumed by humans (especially with the rise in climate change causing a shortage in food supply). Thus, duckweed, although possessing a bit of an odd name, has been a large focus of mine for two years now.
Shortly after I discovered bioplastics, the CEO of Pond Biomaterials became a mentor of mine. Pond is a startup based out of Denmark and I have been working with them (virtually) for these two years. This summer, though, I finally got to come to Denmark in person and Pond set me up to work in three labs across Copenhagen for five weeks, including Novozymes, the Technical University of Denmark, and the University of Copenhagen.
The reason for three labs instead of just one is that to build this project requires work in many different areas of science, including microbiology, biochemistry, and chemistry.
Below, I will go over what I worked on in each lab as well as my biggest learnings / takeaways.
Novozymes was the first lab I worked in. This is a private company, and the world leader in industrial enzyme production. I had never worked on my project in a lab that was not in a university, so this was a very different experience. I worked closely with Ulla Rosenberg and Kim Borch, two individuals I am incredibly lucky to have met. I always had help in the lab and the support was unreal. My days were usually 9–11 hours long but there was always someone by my side sticking it out with me and it was honestly so much fun.
For the first week I worked on an optimized enzymatic procedure for the duckweed. We experimented with different parameters and got the highest glucose concentrations I have seen out of my duckweed. I learned a lot about enzymes themselves, dilution series, and how to run an assay.
The next few days, I worked on fermenting the sugar solutions where I was in the microbiology lab with Robin Dorau trying to produce lactic acid. Some of the things I learned about were buffering capacities, measuring the optical density of bacteria via a spectrophotometer, and how to ensure the bacteria had enough nutrients. We ended up getting very high lactic acid concentrations, although I also learned about some other compounds present in my mixtures that have led to more discoveries about the duckweed and experiments themselves.
We were working large scale, with hundreds of grams of duckweed, so we had to be innovative with our setups. It doesn’t matter what lab you are working in: you always have to do some improvisation. Here are some examples of us simply having to figure it out:
1.) We had to have our samples stirring at a certain temperature for the enzymes to optimally operate, however our system kept dropping in temperature. In order for the setup to be self sufficient, we improvised and used aluminum and towels for insulation, and poured boiling water into the tub our samples were in. It worked like a charm, but definitely looked a little interesting.
2.) Another scenario where we had to just figure it out was when our samples would not filter prior to fermentation. I have been working on a smaller scale in Ottawa so although filtering was an issue I wasn’t on as much of a time crunch and had less material to work with. What we ended up doing was going to the brewery lab and their pressure filters (used for beer) worked perfectly. This taught me another valuable lesson, which was the importance of interconnectedness and asking others — even if in a completely different space of work — for help. Working at Novozymes was so unique because there are so many individuals working on different things and yet everyone can help each other, even a beer brewery lab and a biotech lab.
One more valuable lesson for me was to not always trust the results you get. When we did colorimetric analysis (basically determining the concentration of a chemical compound using a colour reagent) we got very low lactic acid concentrations which was honestly very disappointing because I never would have expected my results to be in this ball park. Later, though, we ran an HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography, a method that is much more precise) and our results were over 20x higher than we had initially thought. This really changed the next steps that had to be taken, so it’s important to ensure that when doing a test like an assay or something generally less precise (usually because they are easier and cheaper) they can have large margins of error in the results they yield.
The second lab I worked in was at the Technical University of Denmark, DTU. Here I was working on something I had never done before: the separation of lactic acid from the fermentation mixture. This process was quite difficult and was certainly not a success, but I learned a lot about purification technologies and namely, their complexity.
My biggest takeaway was to not underestimate how much time something new can take. I would have figured I would have learned this by now but it’s easy to have too high of expectations in science. Since I had never worked on the purification side of things before, I did not fully comprehend the difficulty of it until I tried it out. Researching and ideating is one thing, and actually doing it is something else entirely! For example, we attempted something called an azeotropic distillation on my first day (see the photo below) which theoretically should have worked quite easily but in fact did not at all. Even removing the water without evaporating other compounds was hugely complex and when I researched what to do, I was greeted with hundreds of research papers.
Thus, I learned something else that was very important which was to keep my solutions as clean as possible. What I mean by this is that in prior steps to the purification I am adding enzymes, buffers, extracts, etc. to my mixtures, but I have to in reality remove everything to get pure lactic acid at the end. When working on prior steps it is very important to keep in mind the end goal and future steps that must also be optimized for.
Another takeaway was to utilize online videos for the use of analytical equipment because there is so much online that can help. I had to be much more independent in this lab, and through a video I learned how to do infrared spectroscopy which was very helpful.
I had a hard time coping with failure at this lab overall but it offered many insights into what comes next in this project, as this step will be the key to producing the bioplastic and will be a challenge on its own.
Finally, I worked at the University of Copenhagen with Peter Ulvskov, a professor in plant biology. This tied more into what I had been working on at Novozymes, but instead of optimizing the enzymes being added to the biomass we were working on what could happen even prior to this: cell wall degradation, mechanical methods of breakdown, etc. Honestly, I found this so much fun and full of learning. I truly got to understand the duckweed to a greater extent, like what exists in it that may inhibit bacterial growth, what polysaccharides it contains, and how the starch granules behave. For the first time I got to look at the duckweed under a microscope — microscopy was actually key in my work at KU. For example, before degradation of the cell walls, we could see the starch granules stuck in the duckweed cells (left image, where the granules are dark blue) and then after we could see the granules released from the cells (right image).
Something else we worked on was the removal of pigmentation from the duckweed to explore how this may hinder future steps in my procedures (see the below picture, where the rightmost beaker contains a much lower content of chlorophyll). I found I was looking at duckweed through a different lens because of how much unique experimentation I got to do at the university.
Likely my biggest takeaway was the significance of writing absolutely everything down and taking many pictures. This is of course something I have always had to do in the lab but Peter put a lot of emphasis on organization and I came up with a much better system for taking notes, keeping track of which photos are which, etc. It can be easy to recognize what a microscopy image is showing a few minutes after you’ve taken it, but a month later, the importance of that image to you may be gone.
My second takeaway was to keep in mind everything that is required for each part of my project and look at how this may translate to a real world protocol. For example, when we were grinding the duckweed we made sure to use equipment that could be scaled up easily as opposed to only something that works small scale.
Another one of my learnings was the importance of going back to the very beginning — the foundations of a project — because this is where the most improvement can transpire. Breaking down the cell walls to a greater extent was not helping me in the purification of the lactic acid, but eventually it could help me get more lactic acid to work with by creating improvements in glucose yields. Every step holds weight.
All in all, getting to spend time in Copenhagen was such a neat experience and I am so grateful to everyone who helped me. I also felt that I became a more independent person as I lived alone for around five days which I have never done before! Getting to meet my supervisor Martin from Pond was a huge highlight, as well as exploring the wonderful city (and the crêpe stands👩🏽‍🍳).
Thank you so much for reading this! I’m a 17-year-old learning about where sustainability meets technology, and am the author of the “Chronicles of Illusions” duology. If you want to see more of my work, connect with me on LinkedIn, Twitter, or subscribe to my newsletter!

Name: Malene Sabinsky
What do you do all day? Boss people around and talk very loudly– no really, that’s what project managers do. *laughs*
Hometown: Copenhagen, Denmark
Hunting territory: Copenhagen and beyond
Can you tell us a bit about the difference between the street art in you town compared to the rest of the world? As in, what makes your town really stand out!? I don’t know if there’s a major difference, as a lot of international artists have made pieces in Copenhagen too, but of course the local artist make it completely unique.
Where do most artists get there inspiration from in your town? That would be unfair of me to answer, as I don’t know.
Is there more currated or illegal work? The murals are mostly curated, but there is also a fair bit of illegal activity
What is that one artwork you need to see in your hunting territory? I have to cheat and choose two: DALeast because I cycle past it everyday, and never tire of looking at it. Copenhagen, for me, wouldn’t be the same without it now. And ‘Creativity is Freedom’ by Danish artist Don John. I really love his work, and there are so many great pieces by him around town.
Who introduced you to the street art scene? Nobody did. I am still waiting for my official introduction :-)
When were you infected with the hunter virus? I’m a newbie really *laughs* I’ve had an interest for at long time. I lived in London for many years, and it’s hard not to notice and appreciate street art when living there. But it didn’t actually become a real (active) passion until summer 2015, when i saw the Surface exhibition by Danish photographer Søren Solkær in Copenhagen. And alongside this, I followed the creation of new murals for “Outdoor Surface” (the DalEast piece being one of these).
My hunting kit includes: It’s a very simple kit: bicycle, iphone, headphones and wind in my hair.
When you are out shooting, how much of it is instinctual versus planned? With increased passion comes increased planning! Of course I still stumble upon new pieces when on general eplorations, but mostly I plan to go to a certain place, because there is something specific I want to see.
Do you take photos more for yourself, or for others? Mostly for myself, but I don’t mind sharing :-)
How would you define your style in taking photo’s or writing a (instagram) post? Lacking style in general! I’m not a skilled photographer, so it’s a good thing the art speaks for itself. The same goes for posts. I’m too impatient to write a lot, so an artist credit and an emoji tends to suffice.
Who are some of your favorite classic photographers, and how did they influence you? I like a lot of photographers: Cindy Sherman, Martin Parr, Nan Goldin, William Eggleston, Andreas Gursky etc. And of course I have to mention both Søren Solkær and Martha Cooper, for combining the art of photography and street art. They haven’t influenced me in any particular way, I just admire their skill and art.
What is your biggest challenge of being a hunter? Too much rain, and too little time.
What is the best piece of advice I can give to newbie hunters? Be curious and open-minded. Credit artists where you can , they deserve it. Do it out of passion and interest, not the likes.
Or ignore all that, and just download the app and get yourself a bicycle.
Can you tell us the most exiting hunter story? Any close calls with getting your equipment robbed or caught by the police? Haha, no close calls at all. I’m too well behaved.
I will share a non-exciting, but vivid hunter memory with you though: I was touring California (and beyond) with my two kids a few months back, and when we stopped over in Vegas, we had to go hunting. I had no connection on my phone, so my son got the job of navigating using the Street Art Cities website (see, it’s so easy even a kid can use it!). After some time with no results, I was getting pretty hot and bothered, but suddenly my son stops and points. And I very loadly exclaim: “Woaw, Martin Whatson”. The look of pride in his eyes for having found it, combined with the beauty of the wall, was just priceless.
My most recent discovery in the street art scene is: Not so recent, but during the summer I found some great stencils in Copenhagen, there are four really close to each other. I haven’t found any more across town, and don’t know anything about the artist, apart from the signature ‘Jochum’. I’m dead curious, really like the pieces, and want to see and know more.
Name a few artists you like to follow and why. These artists are all Danish, have their very own style, are super talented, and can be found around the streets of Copenhagen:
Do you collect art books, T-shirts, and other things? What’s the most valuable item for you? No, I’m not much of a collector as such, but I’m dead chuffed with a small piece by Tankpetrol, I bought and just received in the post the other day.
What is your favorite location fellow hunters should definitely visit? Don’t miss a visit to Bolsjefabrikken where local artist make new pieces all the time, cruise down Rentemestervej — possible the one street in Copenhagen with the mist murals. And of course Christiania — for art and the rest — but don’t pull out your camera on pusher street unless you specifically are collecting “exciting hunter stories”.
What are the benefits you find being part of a street art collective? Having found so many people with the same passion and so many of whom are very knowledgeable, and great photographers. I will start inviting myself for coffee and tours when I travel, so be warned.
Last but not least. What is the most valuable thing about Street Art Cities? The app is fantastic. It’s a great resource when travelling.

I remember seeing the term Hygge for the first time while looking for Airbnb experiences in Copenhagen. A quick google search showed that Hygge meant “a cozy quality that makes a person feel content and comfortable”. It gave me the image of resting by the fireplace on a cold winter’s night, which didn’t feel too relevant for my upcoming summer trip, so I kind of forgot about it.
When I was in Copenhagen, I remember feeling occasional waves of inner joy, in a “just glad to be here” kind of way. It was otherwise sublime and hard to describe, and even harder to attribute the cause. I didn’t try to analyze it too much — after all, I was on vacation and taking in the idyllic vibes of a Danish summer.
On the metro to the airport, we zoomed past a father and his child running through some grassy expanses with the backdrop of the sea. I remember feeling a sense of delight and ease, and recalled the term Hygge; that’s when I realized I had profoundly learned what it meant during my trip.
I won’t try to describe what Hygge is; I reckon you have to experience this for yourself to understand. But I’ll tell you some things when I was in Copenhagen that brought me Hygge, and also some that did not.

Can London follow Copenhagen's heat networks example?
All London boroughs are working to reach net zero, and decarbonising how we heat our buildings is a crucial part of that journey. One key solution here is the implementation of heat networks. These currently exist in pockets of London, but we must introduce new networks and connect more households to help us towards net zero.
In May, London Councils and The Danish Embassy in London worked together to take a group of London borough officers to visit the Greater Copenhagen area, a world leader in heat networks. The visit was funded by the State of Green (a not-for-profit, public-private partnership between the Danish government and the country’s three leading business associations) and provided valuable insights into Denmark’s successful adoption of heat networks and offered lessons that could be applied to our decarbonisation efforts in London and across the UK.
Denmark has made significant progress in adopting heat networks, with over 64% of Danish homes currently heated through this system. This figure is expected to rise to approximately 72% in the near future. Denmark’s’ heat network journey began in 1903 with the installation of the first district heating (DH) plant.
However, it was the 1970s oil crisis that triggered a rapid expansion in the use of coal-powered district heating, which was followed by the introduction of natural gas. Over time, Denmark has shifted towards incorporating energy from waste and biomass, and is actively exploring various waste heat sources to further reduce emissions — as we know London boroughs like Islington are also doing.
The Greater Copenhagen Heat Network
The Greater Copenhagen Heat Network stands out as an impressive example of a large-scale district heating system. It supplies heat to approximately 500,000 households — with almost all houses connected in the inner municipalities of the region. It relies on various heat producers, including combined heat and power (CHP) plants, waste-to-energy facilities, and reserve and peak load plants burning fossil fuels. The network also incorporates heat storage systems to ensure efficient and reliable distribution.
What did we visit?
During the visit, we had the opportunity to explore different aspects of Denmark’s heat network infrastructure and solutions. We learnt about the background of heat network development in the Greater Copenhagen region and witnessed initiatives such as the District Cooling system in Copenhagen, a large waste-to-energy facility in Roskilde, and the consumer-owned Greve Municipal District Heating company. We also observed smaller-scale innovative solutions, such as a Danfoss project to capture and recirculate heat from supermarket refrigerators in Energy Lab Nordhavn.
We gained insights into energy-renovated social housing and a low-temperature heat network in the Municipality of Albertslund. We also saw an exciting new heat pump system being installed to that extract energy from drinking water in Frederiksberg, in the heart of the city region of Copenhagen.
We learnt about the vital role of local government and municipal companies in planning, financing, developing, and operating heat networks in Denmark. The experience showcased the importance of effective and resourced local government to drive collaboration among stakeholders, all underpinned by strong regulation which gives price certainty to consumers.
We also learnt how heat networks have been expanding rapidly in response to global energy price increases, and that demand is higher for houses on heat networks.
The visit highlighted both some key differences and similarities between Denmark and the UK in terms of how we heat our buildings. However, both countries share similar climates, building characteristics, and ambitions for achieving net-zero emissions so sharing knowledge will help us both. We were happy to learn that the UK government is actively working with the Danish government to develop UK heat network policy, with a focus on introducing heat zoning which will help increase the uptake of heat networks.
This visit to Copenhagen offered valuable insights for London’s decarbonisation efforts. The Renewable Power for London Programme will be incorporating these as part of its Decentralised Energy workstream to help London Local Government accelerate our transition.

Before you actually begin your dream journey, your Copenhagen Trip Planner is here. Copenhagen is the largest city in the country and also the capital of Denmark. Sitting on the two coastal islands, Zealand and Amager, this beautiful city is full of historic attractions. Consulting your vacation guide can be a good option if you do not want to miss any particular places of interests here. Every year a huge number of tourists visit this city which still possesses a distinct touch of European culture. Copenhagen is packed with various great attractions and tourist spots. Here are some of the best places that you can include in your travel planner if you really want to make most of your time here.
Among the various interesting places in the city, including Christiansborg Palace in your Copenhagen Trip Planner as top priority can be a brilliant idea. Located in central Copenhagen, on a small island, this palace is still used by royal families as the seat of Danish Parliament, Prime Minister’s office, and Supreme Court. Boasting more than 800 years of history, this palace has plenty of attractions to offer you, such as the royal reception hall, the Chapel, the Ruins, and the Royal Stables. The tallest viewing platform of the city is in this palace which offers an excellent panoramic view of this beautiful city.
Tivoli Garden is basically an amusement park in Copenhagen and is a must visit for all tourists. Founded in the year of 1843, it is known as an international attraction and also a national treasure of Denmark. With more than twenty types of different rides, various cafes and restaurants, Tivoli Gardens has become an absolute wonderland for the visitors. It is also the second oldest functioning amusement park in Denmark.
Your trips to this Danish capital may remain incomplete if you do not add a visit to the Little Mermaid in your Copenhagen Trip Planner. Made of bronze and granite, this sculpture was a gift to the city from the Danish brewer C. Jacobsen. Apart from being the city’s most famous tourist attraction, it is also the official emblem of the city.
If the history and culture of a new city are something that truly interests you then your journey guide may suggest you visit the National Museum of Denmark. You can find exhibitions from almost all the different periods and ages here. Exhibitions from the Stone Age, the Middle Ages, the Viking Ages, the renaissance period and modern Danish history are perfectly displayed here.
Nyhavn Harbour can also be there in your travel plan. At the very end of the harbor, you can witness the anchor which is kept there as a memorial of those Danish sailors who lost their lives during World War II. With the brightly painted houses by the harbor and the museum ships, this place happens to be the most featured one in the photographs, describing the city.
If you have not yet included Bakken in your Copenhagen Trip Planner, then it’s high time that you would. Being the oldest amusement park in the world, Bakken is a wonderful green area where you can enjoy various exciting adventure rides. In the entire Scandinavia, it is the only amusement park that has more rides than any other in the country.
By including these most-visited places of Copenhagen in your vacation plan, you can have the most unforgettable experience in your life. Let’s keep your Copenhagen Trip Planner with you as your best guide and start exploring the majestic city Copenhagen.

It only takes me about four days in Copenhagen before I start Googling “Copenhagen apartments for rent” and “Can Americans buy property in Denmark?”. I love how easy it is to walk everywhere, how stylish it is, how friendly the people are, and (of course) how delicious the food is. We planned our trip to Europe around dinner at Noma. While Noma was worth the pilgrimage, it was far from the only good meal of our trip. Here’s my recap of our Copenhagen dining adventures.

There’s a particular kind of focus that lives in voiceover. Not just technical — emotional, too.
As an actor, I’ve found something grounding in the simplicity of sound: a way to stay close to character, even between larger productions. Whether for narration, commercials, or more character-driven work, I approach VO as an extension of acting, just pared down to its essentials.

I’m a New York City girl.
I grew up in the neighborhood of Washington Heights, the area of Manhattan north of Harlem.
On the street I lived, everyone knew everyone. Apartment doors were often left open so kids could run back and forth. If we were out late —which meant once the streetlights were on — we’d be told by an adult, any adult, it was time to go home.
Home for me was on the fifth floor of a tenement building. And our apartment stood out in that drab building because our windows were covered with climbing blue morning glory my father planted every spring.
Those flowers were a bright spot on an otherwise colorless city street.
It’s years since we were back, and this summer it was a trip down memory lane when my husband Billy and I visited “the City”.
Billy grew up in Greenwich Village. Long the home of artists, his father, the abstract expressionist painter Harold Anton, had among his contemporaries, Jackson Pollock, as well as the…

ISRAELS PLADS
Copenhagen, Denmark
Introduction
Israels Plads is an urban plaza situated in Copenhagen, Denmark. It was conceptualised by Sweco Architects and Cobe in 2007 when the Copenhagen municipality invited Danish architects to reconstruct Copenhagen’s largest public square, which had fallen into disrepair as a derelict parking lot. [1] This essay will analyse the aftermath of the project to determine how successful the architects were in terms of heritage integration, user experience, and inclusivity.
Copenhagen is the capital and most populous city of Denmark. It was previously a Viking fishing village, and became the capital in the early 15th century. Since the early 2000’s Copenhagen has seen some strong urban and cultural development, led by the Copenhagen Municipality, through investments in its institutions and infrastructure. Israels Plads is one such urban regeneration project.
According to Cobe, the idea of transforming Israels Plads was to celebrate the significance of the history of the square, and to revitalize it, by turning it into a “vibrant, diverse plaza for leisure and sport, used by all kinds of people.” [7] Right from the get-go, we see that the architects placed a lot of importance on heritage integration, user experience and inclusivity.
The new site consists of an underground car park, with two blocks of buildings (a retail park and a private educational institute) to the North-West and South-East, along with two large market halls (“Torvehallerne”, which opened in 2011 and quickly became very popular, currently housing numerous cafés) to the North-East. The Plads also provides a link to a massive park (“Ørstedsparken”) to the South-West (Fig 1), acting as a transition from the bustling city to the serene park. [7]
Figure 1 Israels Plads seen as an urban carpet (Cobe, 2014) Edited by author
Above the underground car park, the plaza acts as a multifunction space, housing a large playground, sports arena, skatepark, and areas for people-watching. At the centre of the square is an “egg-shaped area” (Fig 2), used by nearby schools as an extended recreational zone for all age groups. [2]
Figure 2: Landscaping Plan of the Site (Cobe, 2014) Edited by author
History
The space has historical significance dating back to the 13th century when Denmark built their stone wall fortifications and established a central plaza at this spot, where the city ended in a ring of protective ramparts. During the city’s extension in the late 19th century, with the demolition of the old city walls (that were now outdated defence mechanisms), the site became a vibrant market square. Israels Plads is placed on top of these historic ramparts (Fig 3).
Figure 3 Diagram of the city’s old fortifications, and Israels Plads’ location relative to the ramparts (Cobe, 2014)
According to Zerlang (2008), the square served as a starting point and meeting point for the forces of modern life [1], since its inception in the 1870s (Fig 4) and its renaming in 1968 as “Israels Plads”, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the “rescue of the Danish Jews”.[3]
Israels Plads was previously the home of Grønttorvet (1889–1958), a major market for fresh produce known for its special atmosphere (Fig 5). Due to the increase in traffic around the market and growing logistics needs, the market was relocated and the once-bustling square degenerated into an inner-city eyesore and occasional parking lot (Fig 6). [2]
Figure 4: The site being used as a market in 1889–1954
Figure 5: The Food Market, around 1990 (Copenhagen by Design, 2015)
“The plaza used to be empty, especially in the evening, and there were a lot of drug dealers” — Hans Peter Hagens (Architect of the Torvehallerne, adjacent to Israels Plads) [13]
Figure 6: The site’s usage as a parking lot in the 1950’s — 1990's
City Scale
The main reason for the decline of Israels Plads was the city and traffic planners’ inability and unwillingness to put city space and city life high on their agenda. Attempting to ensure the best conditions for car traffic, along with the mismanagement of the city-planning sector has led to multiple public squares such as this one being converted to dingy parking lots, teeming with crime and making the city unsafe, unsustainable and unhealthy. [4]
Jan Gehl, in his book “Cities for People”, criticises the Copenhagen municipality, for putting a low priority on public space, pedestrianism and the role of city space as a meeting place for urban dwellers. However, in recent decades, the government has realised its folly, and started reversing its erroneous moves by restructuring their street network, removing driving lanes and parking places in a deliberate process to create better and safer conditions for bicycle traffic. [4] The city of Copenhagen has a goal for its residents to “spend 20% more time in public spaces by 2025,” [7] and Copenhagen’s bicycles now save 90,000 tons of CO2 every year. Gehl notes that “[Copenhagen] has significantly improved conditions for life in city space in recent decades. Pedestrian traffic has grown, and the number of recreational optional activities has swelled.” [4] It is important to note that Gehl uses the term “optional” to describe activities that can only be done in good conditions, as opposed to “necessary” activities, such as going to school/work and grocery shopping, which have to be done regardless of the weather conditions. One by one the parking places in the city centre have been turned into squares that accommodate public life. [4]
Figure 7: The new and improved Israels Plads (Cobe, 2014)
Recent Developments
A change was triggered in the area of Israels Plads, due to the decision to erect the two market halls (Torvehallerne) on the site, evoking the “aura of the old vegetable market”. [2] The council’s brief for the reconstruction of Israels Plads demanded that the design concept should relate itself to the “history of the square, to the architecture of the surrounding houses, to the Ørstedspark at the southern end of the square and the Botanical Garden and the market halls at the northern end of the square”. [1]
The winning submission by Cobe and Sweco Architects envisaged a “flying carpet” spread across the entire square, where the cars would be “swept under the rug” with underground parking and organically shaped areas that are punched out of the surface to provide a variety of public recreational functions (Fig 7 and 8). [2]
Figure 8: The layers of Israels Plads, as envisioned by Sweco Architects and Cobe (Cobe, 2014)
User Experience
Zerlang (2008) declares that in the modern city, experiences are staged, and architects increasingly treat urban space with the eye of a scenographer. [1] Understanding that the consideration for the individual and their experiences presents a major challenge for modern urban planning, the question of “experiences” had a very high priority in the commission. The Council added a demand that the concept should consider the activities on the square, and also the pre-existing activities of the school children from the Zahles Skole (adjacent to Israels Plads), and the potential activities of the new-arranged square. [1]
The transformation of the public square focuses on its revitalisation as a living urban space [2]. Gehl (2010) urged urban planners and architects to reinforce pedestrianism as an integrated city policy to develop “lively, safe, sustainable and healthy” cities. He also ascertains that it is equally urgent to strengthen the social function of city space as a meeting place. [4]
Israels Plads provides a cohesive structure that offers “short walking distances, attractive public spaces, and a variation of urban functions”. These elements increase activity and the feeling of security in and around the space. [4]
Studies from inner-city shopping streets in Copenhagen show happenings, events and building sites where we can watch people perform, play music, etc. attract far more people to linger and watch than shops along building facades. Studies of benches and chairs in city space show correspondingly that seats with the best view of city life are used far more frequently than those that do not offer a view of other people. [4] The seating areas in Israels Plads are positioned so that people-watching is facilitated. The sloping sides of the sunken playing field can serve both as a barrier and as seating. [2] Wedge-shaped staircases at the western and eastern corners of the square offer a good view from an elevated position (Fig 9). [2]
Figure 9: Users seated on the wedge-shaped stairs, enjoying a sunny day (Cobe, 2014)
“The plaza has opened up to the historical landscape next door. The tree and water elements of the park are echoed on the plaza surface, and circles have been cut out to accentuate the big trees standing on the transition between city and park” (Fig 10) [7]
Figure 10: The cutouts on the plaza used to accentuate the trees. (Copenhagen Design News, 2020)
The cut-outs feature round bench formations underneath the trees, where people can observe the life unfolding on the plaza, a pre-requisite for Gehl’s ideal public space (Fig 11). The localised light zones of areas sheltered by trees also create an intimate setting for groups of people to gather and enjoy the night. The overheads and multiple sources of illumination, according to Schaack (2018), allow for visibility and facial recognition, which is crucial for users to trust their environment and the people using it. [3]
Figure 11: Round bench formations, ideal for people-watching (Copenhagen Design News, 2020)
Cobe’s founder, Dan Stubbergaard appreciates that Israels Plads has become a public meeting place and a playground for three different schools all year round. [7] It also helps that the design incorporates skateable aspects into the architecture of the space. Activities such as skateboarding, basketball and scootering are encouraged, which invites a lot more schoolchildren into the space. [11] Even the lighting is optimised for play. Four different lighting systems illustrate the complexity of the space at night. One of them illuminates the centre of the plaza to answer the need for visibility of sports users, basketball players and skateboarders. [3]
Figure 12: The public uses the Plads even in unfavourable weather conditions (Cobe, 2014)
Heritage Integration
“[The plaza] has a sculptural expression that refers to its historical past as part of the fortifications” [3] “Along the facades, a band of traditional Copenhagen pavement with granite slabs and Nordic cobblestones runs around the square (Fig 13), connecting the granite plate to its surroundings.” [8] These material choices are a throwback to traditional Danish building methods, and also match the colourful historical facades from the 18th century.
Figure 13: Nordic cobblestones and demarcation strips around Israels Plads (Copenhagen Design News, 2020)
The square itself often became the scene of political demonstrations in the 1880s [1] Similar to the 1880s, the square is still used for political demonstrations. In May 2019, the Revolutionary Antifascists group, organised a demonstration at the Israels Plads. [9] More recently, in October 2021, students of the University of Copenhagen assembled at the Plads to protest the University’s investment in Pro-Israeli companies that are involved in the demolition of Palestinian homes and building the Apartheid wall [10]. It is interesting to see how the Israels Plads’ usage has differed only very slightly from its original uses before the 1950s. Copenhagen also hosts WorldPride, the international festival celebrating the LGBTQ+ community, and one of the parades goes through the Israels Plads. [12]
Inclusivity
“This is where children play during recess, where friends meet for a beer after work, and where Copenhageners meet for flea markets (Fig 14) on Saturdays” [7]
Figure 14: The Flea Market that opens up on the Plads on Saturdays (Cobe, 2014)
An issue that I came across quite often when researching the inclusivity of such spaces, is the prevalence of anti-homeless architecture and exclusionary design, whether on purpose or a subconscious choice. A space such as this cannot be celebrated for its inclusivity, if it does not support ALL its citizens, including the homeless, individuals struggling with addiction, and the unemployed. Israels Plads has round benches with metal dividers (Fig 11), making them uncomfortable to sleep on, while the long tiered seating (Fig 9) lacks privacy and is open to the elements, which discourages anyone from taking refuge overnight. [15]
This goes against the policies of Jan Gehl’s “Humanist City” [4], pushing Copenhagen’s most vulnerable citizens out of the public space. Nina Hoegh (Director of Projekt Udenfor (Project Outside)) agrees, stating that catering urban design exclusively to the needs of the middle class in this way sends an implicit message about whom the city values. [15] Public space should be accessible and welcoming for all, without privileging one person or group over another. [16]
“Homelessness must be eradicated, but this process won’t happen overnight. Public places need to design for this reality, not ignore it” [16] Therefore I affirm that the architects of the Israels Plads have not been successful in their efforts to make the space inclusive.
Purpose Fulfilment
The architects have designed a method of directing cloudburst water into an artificial creek, which leads to a large water reserve in the adjacent park. However, their wish that the creek is an aesthetic and pleasant water feature during all other times did not come true, as the “creek” is almost always dry (Fig 15), and may be a hazard for a skateboarding student, or a person with a vision impairment. [7] The Danish Design Review also noted that the fountains and water channel at the park end are rarely running. [14]
Figure 15: The “Artifical Creek”, currently dry (Copenhagen by Design, 2015)
Despite its shortcomings, the plaza does serve as a new public space adding to the social and environment of Copenhagen, while fulfilling the still-existing demand for car parking in the city. The design of the space follows the policy of Copenhagen to be a sustainable and user-friendly city by connecting to the neighbouring park and food market, offering a recreational space with seating areas and sports facilities. [3] Israels Plads has accomplished its goal of being a multi-use space, seeing that it serves as a schoolyard during the daytime, a public basketball court and skate park during the afternoon, a “dining room” in the evening, and a flea market during the weekend. It is quite difficult to design a space where there is minimum clash between these activities, yet Cobe and Sweco Architects have managed to do it.
Figure 16: A Google Earth capture of the site by the author
Some of these new and old car-free squares seem deserted while others teem with life. The difference comes down to the fact that some squares have only been designed to “ferry” pedestrians across, while others seize the opportunity to provide an experience, so that people combine walking and staying in the area. Studies show that the latter type of square registers an activity level of between “10, 20, and sometimes 30 times higher than transit squares” [5] There is no point in having a sheer amount of space if it is not correctly designed, and this is why I believe Israels Plads has been so successful in attracting the populace of Copenhagen as a public space where children can play, adults can people-watch, and almost everyone can enjoy.

Let me start by saying, I'm a huge fan of the S-train network in Copenhagen, Denmark, and especially for the simple and direct communication the transit map of the network provides. The design of the existing map is clean and simple. But it still has in my opinion some flaws and are missing some vital details.
So I have tried to make my own revised S-train map for Copenhagen, based of course on the existing map of the network. With tweaks and improvement to make it easier to navigate as a user.
Just want to see the new map, jump straight to it here.
If you want an in-depth analysis and understanding of the Copenhagen transit map and network and what it looks like today:

Copenhagen surprised me in the best way. It’s not loud or flashy, but quietly brilliant — measured, functional, and full of life in subtle ways. It might not be for everyone, but for me personally, this was the best city I’ve visited so far.
Here’s a breakdown of my impressions, what’s worth seeing, and what (and where) to eat.
Copenhagen feels like it was designed for a self-contained urban human — someone who values clean lines, efficient systems, and doesn’t need the sun to be in their top three happiness factors.
It’s expensive, but everything you get feels fair. There’s no sense of being ripped off — just a steady, Nordic standard of quality. English is almost a second official language, spoken equally well by both the young and the old. That stood out and made everything smoother.
The people are polite, helpful, but emotionally reserved. Not cold, not snobby — just calmly distant. The city itself is beautifully quiet: no diesel engines, no honking, no chaos. Cash is barely accepted, tips are not expected, and digital payments are the norm.
Public transport is flawless — fast, clean, reliable, and not overcrowded. The metro system especially impressed me. The cycling culture is on another level: wide, protected bike lanes on both sides of the street, and visibly fewer cars and parking spots than in Zagreb.
It’s not as immigrant-friendly as, say, London, and that affects the atmosphere slightly. Still, Copenhagen delivers a kind of living standard and order that’s rare anywhere else.
Home of CarlsbergMore than just a brewery tour. This place ties together Danish beer, scientific progress, and art collecting. Jacob and Carl Jacobsen — father and son — are the central figures here. The father was a master brewer, the son added branding finesse and a love of the arts. They even established their own science lab, where in 1883 they solved the problem of “beer sickness” (a sudden souring of beer) by isolating pure yeast. Today, they’ve created a keg that triples shelf life. The visit includes a tour and beer tastings.
GlyptoteketA stunning museum founded by the Jacobsen family, housing collections of Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Danish, and French art. My favorites were the sarcophagi, the mummies, and The Prodigal Son sculpture. The building itself is a piece of art.
Tivoli GardensThe second-oldest amusement park in the world and the inspiration for Disneyland. It’s charming and atmospheric, though pricey. I took my first and probably last rollercoaster ride here. Worth it for the vibe alone.
Danish Design MuseumDesign is taken seriously here — from childhood education to everyday product aesthetics. We saw an exhibition on the development of Irma, a 137-year-old supermarket brand that brought graphic design into daily life. Another focused on natural, innovative materials (chairs from mushrooms, lamps made from cow intestines, dresses from milk-industry waste). Unfortunately, the furniture design exhibit was closed for renovations.
NyhavnA classic Copenhagen postcard: colorful houses along a canal, boats bobbing in the water. It’s a bit of a tourist trap, but still worth seeing — especially if the sun comes out. HC Andersen once lived in one of these houses while writing his first fairy tale.
Freetown ChristianiaA self-declared autonomous neighborhood built on former military land. Around 1,000 people live there — hippies, artists, and others drawn to alternative living. It’s more a sociological curiosity than an actual utopia. Don’t expect magic, but it’s interesting for a short visit.
Rosenborg Castle & KastelletRosenborg is a small Renaissance castle built by Christian IV in the early 1600s. It’s beautifully preserved. Nearby, Kastellet is a pentagon-shaped military fortress, still in use today and perfect for a peaceful stroll.
Food in Copenhagen is pricey. Meals range from 110 to 250 DKK (€15–€34), pastries from 40 DKK (€5.50), and craft beers between 60–80 DKK (€8–€11). But the quality makes it worthwhile.
Here’s what stood out:
Gasoline GrillNamed one of the top 27 burgers in the world by Bloomberg — and the only one from Europe. It’s served from a small former gas station with four cheerful employees. Probably the best burger I’ve ever had.
Juno the BakeryThe cardamom bun here genuinely moved people to tears. The founder is a former Noma chef, and it shows. The almond croissant and pain au chocolat are also top-tier.
Format Café (inside the Design Museum)New Nordic simplicity done right. The carrot soup with tarragon oil, cream, almonds, and sourdough was exceptional. The open sandwich with chicken, beetroot, capers, kale, horseradish, and a mystery cream was surprisingly rich and complex. Easily one of the best meals.
SeksA stylish brunch spot. The chive-and-pepper omelet was solid, the apple pancake with cream excellent, and the Moroccan green tea unforgettable. Small portions, though.
Warpigs BrewpubTexas BBQ in a Danish setting. Three meats (smoked pork, beef, spicy sausage), mac & cheese, beans, slaw, and on-site craft beer. Heavy, indulgent, and very American in vibe — but worth it.
Broens Street Food MarketGreat spot on the docks. We had organic fish & chips with an IPA under the sun. Simple, fresh, satisfying.
Sankt Peders BakeryThe oldest bakery in Copenhagen, open since 1652. Try the Wednesday cinnamon roll — sold only on Wednesdays. They make up to 4,000 in a single day.
Absalon FolkehusetA unique community lunch in a converted Lutheran church. We had rice with spinach, almonds, coriander, and a peppery sauce. At just 60 DKK, it was the cheapest cooked meal we found — and still delicious.
Pølser Hot DogsThe Danish street food staple. Tried two: one at Carlsberg and one at John’s Hotdog Deli at the main station (Bourdain-approved). Both were solid, nothing mind-blowing.
GRØDA porridge-focused mini-chain. The classic version with apples, cinnamon, roasted almonds, and caramel was pure comfort food.
Pico PizzaStandard, good pizza. Clean, consistent, and just what you need after a few fancier meals.
Copenhagen isn’t trying to win you over with flash or charm. It doesn’t need to. It simply works — quietly, confidently, and beautifully. It’s a place that respects both the individual and the collective experience. For someone who appreciates subtle details, structure, and thoughtful living, this city delivers on every level.
Without exaggeration, this is the best city I’ve ever visited — but I’d never move there, unless the sun files for residency too. 😆

Welcome to the United Nations Career Journey podcast where we interview colleagues working for the United Nations all over the world. Our conversations explore their fascinating career paths, what career satisfaction means to them and how they keep learning and developing on the job. My name is Alessia and our conversation today is with Paul Anderton from the United Nations Development Programme in Copenhagen in Denmark.
Welcome to the Career Journey Podcast, Paul, thank you very much for joining us. And it’s a pleasure to have you as our guest speaker today. Would you like to introduce yourself?
Hello there Alessia. Greetings, everyone. Yes, certainly. Thanks so much for having me. My name is Paul Anderton. I’m originally from the United Kingdom, but I’ve lived and worked in 11 different countries in my life now, including the last three years here in Denmark in Copenhagen. I am an international servant, international civil servant with the UNDP. As you just mentioned, I work as an HR manager for the Leadership Development team in the Office of Human Resources, in the UNDP’s Talent Development Unit. That would do is as a starting point. So back to you, Alessia.
Yes, thank you, Paul. That’s really interesting that you lived in 11 different countries. And so how did you become interested in this field?
I think when I go back and look at the course of my life, something fairly major changed for me when I was nine years old, when I moved from a small village where I was living in England, a small village that had more sheep than than people actually, that was very homogeneous. And because of my father’s work, we moved to Brussels in Belgium, one of the most international cities in Europe. I went to an international school, and all of a sudden, I went from going to a small rural primary school to a big international school, where I was sitting next to a boy from Tanzania, and a girl from Venezuela, and a boy from Bangladesh and a girl from Japan. And that really had an impact on me at that young age, and really made me interested both in travelling the world and seeing other places, learning, made me intensely curious about the world. And also made me passionate about the feeling of connectedness, the feeling that all of these different people in all different cultures around the world, we are all interdependent, and that an organisation like the United Nations really has an important role to play. And eventually that will be something that I will be able to, to contribute to. So, I guess that kind of international perspective was something that was influencing me from quite a young age, which I maybe didn’t realize so much at the time. But when I look at the kind of the path that my life took, both in terms of the places I ended up working, which includes Japan, and Zambia, Mexico, Nepal, I feel very lucky, very grateful for the possibilities that opened up for me to, to go to these kinds of places have an international career. And, you know, try to make the most of that, including my time here at UNDP.
Wow, thank you, Paul. That’s a really interesting story. I also went to an international school in my life here in Rome, and I do completely understand you when you say that you were sitting next to someone from Japan, someone from Bangladesh, I also had that experience. And it definitely gave me a bigger perspective of things of my life as well. So what does a typical day or week look like for you in this job?
So yeah, so maybe I should talk a bit more about what my job actually is. So as the manager of the leadership development team at UNDP, we’re overseeing all of the internal learning and development opportunities for UNDP’s leaders at all levels, and people managers, and that covers quite a wide range of of activities and programmes that we’re doing - obviously, a lot of online content, but also organising things like retreats, meetings and get-togethers. I would say that the one thing when we talk about a typical week is there is no such thing. There’s constantly different things that are being worked on, different projects, different initiatives. We have a really substantial work portfolio that we work towards with all the different leadership groups within UNDP. That’s Resident Representatives, whether it’s team leaders in country offices, keeping all those going while at the same time, UNDP is never shy to say okay, here’s a priority that we now need to give to you, whether that might be a Women’s Leadership Programme, or something related, due to inclusion of people with disabilities, so that variety is fascinating. The other thing that I think is absolutely essential for doing the job that I do is the kind of the communication and delegation with my team. So I’d say that the anchors are, in this, pretty variable and changing work schedule, the anchors are the regular team meetings, and one-on-one meetings I have with my team meetings. We have a distributed team, so we have a couple of people working with us here in Copenhagen, others who are located in other time zones and other parts of the world. And so therefore, it’s really important for us to have regular check-ins, to get on the same page in terms of what the work priorities are, who is doing what, who’s accountable for what, and I very much enjoy that part of the role as well, the people management, the getting to know other people. I found that the United Nations and UNDP in particular is a fascinating workplace, the people who work here are really interesting, have all kinds of fascinating stories. And I find that the best way that that we can kind of come and work together is to share those components of ourselves with each other that we’re most passionate about. That really elevates the team as a whole, and gets us motivated, even when we might be overwhelmed with a certain project or feeling tired, because we do we do have a lot of responsibility and a lot to do.
Okay, thank you. Wow, that was very descriptive and very useful for our listeners. And so what specific tools have been useful for you to develop career wise?
So in terms of tools, I was thinking, it’s in my career, it’s probably been less about kind of technical training or specific certification, so to speak, and more about kind of mindset and approach. So I think that some of the things in my career as a whole that have really helped me get to the point I am today includes things like agility, so being able to move from one thing to another, having, I guess, the self confidence that if I’m trying something that’s new to me that I can kind of fall back on the core skill set that I’ve kind of built up over time to get me through that, as well as the network of colleagues and others who can help me either with information or tips, mentor me through certain things to get me somewhere else. And when I was thinking about the idea of a career journey, my career — I don’t usually think of it in those terms, because it hasn’t ever really been kind of mapped out or planned to any great degree. The basic philosophy has been on my approach has been to be open to the opportunities that have come my way trying to follow my passions, which as I mentioned, have been around travel or around being an international civil servant. Also about international development work, that’s what my master’s degree is in, and I spent several years working as a development project manager and humanitarian worker before shifting more to an HQ role at UNDP. And that’s kind of incorporated some of the other skills and I guess, the different job titles that I’ve had over the years, all of those things have contributed different bits of pieces into the professional that I currently am. So I mentioned working in humanitarian worker in Zambia, Uganda in the past, but over time, I’ve also been a teacher, the university lecturer I’ve even though the short term jobs that I’ve had, whether that’s volunteering, I’ve done quite a bit of volunteering my life particularly with with refugees with the Red Cross, an International Rescue Committee, but also part time jobs as you know, things like a driver, a librarian, even a movie projectionist back in the day… All of these things have, you know, added little components into both my kind of my bank of experiences and skills, and also the way that I go about my job. So I mentioned kind of agility and moving from, from one thing to the next thing. Curiosity is also something that has been really important for my career, because that has meant that I have looked to keep growing and taking on different challenges, expanding the repertoire of things that I can do or will go put my hand up to take on. And in our team, the Talent Development Team here at UNDP, we often talk about the growth mindset, the idea that we’re constantly growing, we’re constantly evolving, we’re all on a continuous learning journey, where it’s not the case that — okay, after school in university, that’s it, your learning is done and you put it away. That’s not the way the world works. It’s not the way that work itself works. So, so that curiosity, agility, the growth mindset to keep trying new things. And I think, also important has been a willingness to take a few risks along the way. I kind of mentioned growing up in a small village in England, when I was young, I was pretty shy, I was not that confident. And I wouldn’t have dreamed, actually, that I would have taken on as many different things as I have done over the course of my life, taking chances to go and study for a year in the USA, where I didn’t know anyone, taking a first job after university in in Taiwan, part of the world where I didn’t speak the language, I didn’t know anyone, I have no idea what to expect. But it was a part of this…this kind of growth experience, and, led in all kinds of interesting directions.
Wow, that was really inspiring. I feel very inspired by that. Especially follow your passion. I feel like nowadays, it’s getting very competitive now, when you are in the search for jobs, but I do agree, follow your passion, agility, take risks, everything you mentioned. It’s nice to hear it once in a while. I feel like some people tend to forget, because of a lot of pressure in this in this environment with the job searching and stuff, especially after the pandemic, when you graduate as a student.
And I have to say as well, I can kind… in looking back, you tend to look at the highlights. There were plenty of lowlights along the way and plenty of moments of ‘oh my god, what is my next job gonna be’ or ‘what happens next’. And particularly when I think about my UN career, I’ve had every variety of contract there is, including being a pro bono volunteer, part time consultant, full time consultant, temporary appointment. I eventually got to a fixed term appointment, that was then abolished as opposed to, so went back not to having a post. I’ve gone through a team relocation, so all of these things are also happening, as well as along the way moments of great uncertainty about what what is the right thing to do? And where, where should I be, where should I be moving? And I do kind of see, not not just my career, but for all of us, our lives are a little bit in… in chapters that are being written as we go. And when you kind of look back at some of the completed chapters, it’s only then you can kind of see how everything came together. And I do sense that the moment that kind of the uncertainty and the questions that particularly young people have about, okay, what is our future going to look like? What kind of jobs am I going to have? What do I think about far from my career? It’s getting more and more challenging. And I think about that, in particular for for my daughters who are eleven and nine, so they still have a ways to go in their own education, but say, in 15/20 years from now, what the job market so to speak might look like is really hard to see. The speed at which the types of jobs that people are doing, or the jobs that people have, they’re just changing so rapidly. And that I think takes me back a little bit to what I was saying about being agile, being willing to change, and trying to build up your self-confidence that actually no, I will, be able to ride these waves and get someway good. And of course it helps a great deal ifunderneath that, the work that you’re doing or the place that you’re working connects to what you’re most passionate about.
Yes, yes, exactly. I agree with you. Overall, everything does move pretty fast, especially the market right now. But we’ll see, I guess, c’est la vie.
I think taking time to kind of really analyze and understand that for yourself. One thing I see that sometimes trips people up is that they might have certain expectations about what they think the world of work should be, or they joined a particular organisation and they have a certain idea — this is exactly what is gonna happen when I get there — And then maybe that’s not quite the reality. So I think the more research you can do, or the more analysis or reflection you can do, both in terms of the work and the job that you’re going into but also in terms of yourself and what you need or what you want to have in your career, that’s really going to help so. So take some time for self-reflection for analysis, and it might be that you see certain jobs where you think okay, well the job looks good, but actually, I’m not sure I fit in that organisation or vice versa, that’s an organisation I want to work for. But is that what they want to be doing? It’s not straightforward at all. And yeah, it’s something that yeah, I myself, I’m still in the middle of. You know, I’m mid career, I’ve probably got 15/20 years to go until until I’d be able to retire. So I’m also surfing the wave.
Yeah, you’re right. I think self-reflection comes with any age. But it’s definitely something that one should do once in a while, you know, especially when it comes to work. And just, overall, how you’re feeling with your job and what you want to do next.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, so one more question, which I believe it’s very important. What role does networking play in your career?
This is an interesting one, because I was thinking back to especially when I first joined the UN, I think I had a vision of networking that is quite different from how I see it now. Because back then, I had quite a hard view of of people who I saw as ‘networkers’. I thought that they were being a bit mercenary, maybe in terms of okay, to network, I need to find the people who are going to help me move up in my career, the people who are going to give me backing or information that’s going to get me a promotion, or get me where I want to be. And that all felt a bit inauthentic. And I think, certainly there are some people who take that approach to networking. But the way that I understand networking now, and how I’d recommend other people who maybe think more like me about it, who maybe don’t feel comfortable with that more aggressive approach to networking, is that really, networking is a long term thing. It’s something where you’re looking to make connections with people. And for me, I feel most comfortable when it’s authentic human connections in the workplace. And I mentioned before being curious, I am constantly curious about my colleagues, in terms of how did they come to UNDP or whichever partner we might be working with, what drives them? What are they passionate about? What do we have in common? And that I think helps the the immediate working relationship. But it also gives you this network of people who, in the future, they might come to you with a question you might go to them with something you want to ask about, there might be just kind of shared information, or just an awareness of, oh, okay, I know that person who’s really good at X, Y, and Z. I’ve got this one thing where I need some help with X, Y, and Z, I’ll just check in with them. And it kind of goes in both directions. So I guess my second recommendation would be not to see networking as something that you have to do to progress in your career, so much as something that can actually be an enjoyable human part of the work experience. We spend so much of our daily life at work, and one of the things I most appreciate about working in the UN is the incredibly diverse and interesting workforce that we have. That’s something that’s both meaningful to me and I think that’s been important in the work that I do and what whatever comes next. And one last thing, because it’s kind of, slightly off to the side, in terms of, of networking. I’ve been quite an active user of LinkedIn. And that’s something where you’ve got some virtual networking at play, which obviously, is not the same thing as what I’ve just been talking about. So on LinkedIn, you’ll have connections to some of your teammates, or people that you work with, or people that you know pretty well, then there’ll be looser connections to maybe people who are in your organisation, but you don’t know, or people who are outside your organisation in other places. And then there’s also connections to sometimes really random group of people who you have no idea who they are. But in that virtual space, there’s a different type of networking going on. And for me, the way that I use LinkedIn is pretty much in three ways. So one is to, to kind of help show the work that I do and the work that my team does to give to kind of highlight what it is that we’ve actually been working on, which can also help me as well in terms of remembering what we’ve what we’ve done over the years. Also, I think LinkedIn is very good in terms of being a good advocate for UNDP itself and for the UN itself, because there’s plenty of posts from different parts of UNDP or the UN system, in terms of the the good work that we’re doing, and I think anyone who works in the UN system, it is part of what we should be doing — helping to support and promote the UN values, you know, the amazing work that we are doing. And then the last thing is also in terms of some of the people who are looking for work themselves. So I regularly reshare links to job vacancy announcements or interesting career opportunities within UNDP or elsewhere that I think that people will find value in. So those are kind of two different strands of networking. I hope that makes sense.
Yes Paul, it completely does. I believe that when I started this internship, I think that the networking has given me a bigger perspective in the way that I network with my colleagues to enjoy the relationship and to get to know them and to understand where they’re coming from, what their values and missions are. This has been really nice, and I don’t know Paul, if you have anything else to say?
So thank you so much Alessia for having invited me to take part and thank you to anyone who’s made it to the end of this this interview. I appreciate you listening!
Thank you so much for coming and thank you all for listening. We hope our conversations will inspire you to keep learning and advancing in your careers. And make sure to share this episode with any social platform you all have. We will see you all for the next time!

What a weekend. I just had the pleasure to explore Copenhagen in Denmark for a bit. I took lots of photos with my beloved Fujifilm X100V and the conversion lenses. In this little article, I will share some of my favorite shots & spots from this trip.
All the photos you’ll see, have been edited with my presets. If you’re interested, you can get them here: www.chrisperkles.at
We arrived at a Wednesday night in the capital of Denmark, and we stayed in the Huxley Hotel in the center of the city. The location of the hotel made it easy to get everywhere by foot.
We started the first beautiful sunny fresh march day at Nyhavn, since it was next to our Hotel. The good thing was that on a Thursday morning, it was not too busy, and we could find a good spot for breakfast close to the water and in the sun.
After having some good brunch, we walked towards Kastellet along the water shore. Spotting some nice architecture and beautiful views.
Kastellet is something special. For me, as an old Stronghold gamer, this was very pleasant to see, how the castle was shaped and still used today.
After the castle, we walked back towards the center and checked out the Frederiks Kirke and Schloss Amalienborg. There we enjoyed a parade from the oldschool military.
Next on our list was Schloss Rosenborg and the attached garden. Since it was March, the garden was not that pretty because nothing was blooming. But the small palace was impressive.
Feeling: Hungry. So let’s get some food. In the area of Schloss Rosenborg, we found a place called Brdr. Price. Food was delicious, service was great and the location very pretty. 10/10 recommend.
Back on energy, we headed towards the Botanical Garden, but we’ve been too late, it was already closed. So the replacement program was the Rundetarn, an observatory with a beautiful view over Copenhagen.
That was the closing of our first day here. We spent a nice evening having some dinner and relaxing.
New day, new luck. We started the day with a quick breakfast and then heading towards the botanical garden again. This time we were on time.
In the evening we walked through the city, checked out some stores and just had a good time.
After all, this was a very beautiful trip, with some great food and beautiful weather. I can recommend copenhagen to everyone, but consider, that town is expensive as hell. The food compared to Austria is at least 50% — 100% more expensive. If you have any questions, send me a message on Instagram or leave a comment here.

Welcome, wanderlust-driven adventurers, to the enchanting city of Copenhagen! Nestled on the scenic shores of Denmark, this vibrant metropolis boasts a mesmerizing blend of rich history, modern design, and irresistible charm. I would always stop by Copenhagen if I needed to fly from the Kastrup Airport. It is the coolest capital in the Nordic country in my opinion. In this article, five must-do experiences will be unveiled. So, grab your sense of adventure and let’s dive into the heart of this magical Danish capital!
Escape the hustle and bustle of the city and find tranquility amidst the lush greenery of the Rosenborg Garden. Located in the heart of Copenhagen, this expansive park is the perfect spot to enjoy a leisurely picnic surrounded by natural beauty in the typical Nodic summer afternoon. Spread out your blanket on the soft grass, bask in the warm Danish sunshine, and savor a delicious spread of local treats, a nice Danish sandwich will be a great choice.
The garden’s meticulously embedded flowers, tranquil ponds, and majestic trees provide a picturesque backdrop for your picnic. As you indulge in your culinary delights, take a moment to admire the stunning Renaissance-style Rosenborg Castle, which stands as a guardian over the garden. Whether you’re seeking a romantic escape or a peaceful retreat with friends and family, picnicking in the Rosenborg Garden is an absolute must-do in Copenhagen.
Step into a world straight out of a Hans Christian Andersen story at the iconic Tivoli Gardens. This whimsical amusement park, dating back to 1843, exudes an atmosphere of wonder and nostalgia. Stroll through enchanting gardens, take a thrilling ride on the roller coasters, and enjoy live performances by talented musicians and actors. As dusk descends, Tivoli transforms into a mesmerizing wonderland of twinkling lights, with charming food stalls offering delicious treats. Tivoli Gardens truly encapsulates the essence of Copenhagen’s charm and should not be missed.
For those seeking retail therapy, Strøget is an absolute must. This bustling pedestrian street stretches across the heart of Copenhagen and is one of Europe’s longest shopping streets. Lose yourself in a retail wonderland as you walk by the high-end boutiques, trendy international brands, and Danish design stores one after another. But Strøget is not just about shopping — it’s a vibrant hub of entertainment, with street performers, charming cafés, and historical landmarks along the way, like Round Tower, City Hall and the Parliament building. Take your time to explore the side streets and hidden courtyards, where you’ll stumble upon unique treasures and delightful surprises.
At the end of the pedestrian street, you can see the most colorful corner of Copenhagen, Nyhavn. It gives you a chance to embrace the picturesque waterfront district that perfectly captures the city’s allure. Its vibrant row of colorful 17th-century townhouses will transport you to a time when sailors, artists, and dreamers roamed these very streets. Stroll along the canal, admiring the quaint boats floating on the water, and indulge in the delectable Danish pastries at the local cafés. Nyhavn is a haven for photographers, and you’ll find endless photo opportunities at every corner. Soak up the lively atmosphere, raise a glass of Carlsberg, and toast to the beauty of Copenhagen.
Prepare to enter a world within a world at Christiania, an autonomous neighborhood that defies convention and embraces its own unique spirit. Founded in the early 1970s, this self-proclaimed “freetown” is a haven for artists, musicians, activists, and free thinkers. Meander through the colorful streets, adorned with vibrant murals, and immerse yourself in the eclectic atmosphere. Discover artisanal shops, organic cafés, and offbeat music venues. While Christiania’s unconventional nature may not be for everyone, it offers a fascinating glimpse into a subculture that celebrates creativity and alternative lifestyles, concurring with a typical hedonist Danish image.
While you’re around the neighborhood, why not visit the top of the Vor Frelsers Kirke? From there, you can look over the whole city, with everything under your eyes. The church also preserves the oldest pipe organs in Copenhagen.
In Copenhagen, where fairy tales blend with regal history, a visit to both Amalienborg and the Little Mermaid promises a captivating journey through time and folklore. Begin your royal escapade at Amalienborg, the present royal castle and residence of the Danish royal family. Marvel at the elegant architecture as you explore the majestic palace complex, composed of four identical rococo-style palaces surrounding an enchanting courtyard. Witness the Changing of the Guard ceremony, where soldiers in their distinctive bearskin hats create a scene straight out of a storybook.
From the regal splendor of Amalienborg, venture to the tranquil shores of Langelinie to meet the iconic Little Mermaid. A short stroll along the promenade leads you to the petite bronze statue perched on a rock, gazing longingly into the sea. This beloved symbol of Copenhagen, inspired by Hans Christian Andersen’s enchanting tale, captures the imagination of visitors from around the world. If you are lucky, you may see swans along side with the mermaid, making this walk even more fairytale-like.
Copenhagen, with its blend of history and creativity, is a destination that promises to captivate every traveler. It is a perfect choice for those who come to visit Scandinavia for the first time. Whether you find yourself lost in the whimsical world of Tivoli Gardens, savoring the colorful sights of Nyhavn, or immersing yourself in the bohemian allure of Christiania, this enchanting city will leave an unforgettable mark on your soul.

My perfect day in CPH starts in Vesterbro, my favorite neighborhood in the city. Formerly a blue-collar neighborhood, it’s known for its hipsters, dive bars, and murals, so I feel right at home, thinking of the Mission District in San Francisco, my second home I left behind.
The main drag, Istegade is grungy and chic in turns: Central Station where Istegade begins crawls with junkies and hookers. Early in the morning, that area is fogged with old cigarette smoke and the clouded eyes of unseeing street-walkers. The Danes are modestly boastful about this last bastion of filth in their practical little city, and the fact that they invented the concept of modern porn as we know it.
My morning begins with pastries. I lived in Paris for years, but I might go out on a limb and say that the Danes’ pastry and bread-making skills are on par if not slightly above the French in general. Near the end of Istegade is BRØD, where a sandy-haired young Viking stands behind the counter and gruffly hands over fresh-baked bread, steaming heft and wholesomeness in his likeness.
One of the things you must do to fully enjoy CPH is rent a bike. The bike roads are so well-paved, the city so level, and the air so crisp, it’ll make you wonder what you did to deserve this bliss. Ride down the suspended bike-only bridge by Fisketorvet mall, and head to the docks for a canal tour, preferably one where they give you warm wine, or gløgg. (I swear I’m not choosing all of these words based on the funky-looking Danish “ø,” which is called a Faroese, you nerds.)
During the tour of the Copenhagen canals, you will learn many things about this watery city, like how it was founded in 1167, about the illustrious reign of King Christian IV, and their near-constant naval humiliations. But the most impressive of all is the newly built power plant, Amager Bakke, which imports waste from neighboring countries to generate energy. The smoke produced from the plant is 95 percent water, with which they aim to recreate the freshness of a mountaintop near the plant’s chimneys where the world’s largest man-made ski slope starts. If that is not doing the MOST good, I don’t know what is.
Back on land, it’ll be time for lunch. Torvehallerne is a fresh food market that delights the senses of food-obsessed world travelers and Copenhageners. Definitely have the smørrebrød, which is dark rye bread covered in all good things like smoked salmon, roast beef, or shrimp, smothered in aioli, nuts, and dill. After that you could check out the Design Museum, one of the best of its kind. But the mother of Danish design and supreme engenderer of material covetousness is Illums Bolighus downtown, the most spectacular design and living store I’ve been inside.
By the time I’ve had my fill of looking at pretty things I can’t afford it’ll be around 3 or 4pm, when people get off work. Yes, you heard me right. It’s time for a drink. A Danish friend told me Denmark has the highest per-capita consumption of coffee, ice cream, and beer. I didn’t check these facts, but I believe him because he’s a doctor.
Whatever you choose to drink, make sure to have a good view of the street to watch the commuting Danes. Other than the fact that they are ridiculously good-looking, one thing struck me as particularly notable: the amount of blond-haired children in the street accompanied not only by their beautiful mothers, but invariably by their fathers as well. Truly, I had never seen a city where so many men were catering to their children. This is the first place I’ve ever been where having kids and taking care of them isn’t emasculating for men or akin to career suicide for women. It was almost as though toxic masculinity had been wiped out. Maternity and paternity leave is mandated by law, and not a miserly few weeks for the mother only, but a whole year, that’s fifty-two weeks of paid leave to be shared between the parents. The government takes good care of its citizens.
Coming from San Francisco and Seoul, where none of my career-driven girlfriends dare having children until they are settled and secure well into their mid-thirties, I suddenly had the creeping suspicion that the rest of the world had got it all wrong. The Danes had figured life out. Everyone was well-fed, a feeling of wholesome well-being permeated the city with the brisk salty air coming off the Baltic Sea.
This was the ideal socialist Utopia, or the closest thing I’d ever seen. The possible future of feminism and mankind invigorated me. But looking around, my heart sank. No one here looked like me. People of color were rare and far in between: I would never belong here. I would always be considered a tourist, or worse, a Thai masseuse.
The Danes are kind but insular people who are sometimes described as cold by expats. Their days and weekends are filled with family picnics and parties that outsiders aren’t invited to. What they have, their culture, their practical sensibilities and husbandry of their surroundings, their dedication to the good life represented by hygge are treasures that should be protected.
But CPH is where one of the worst housing crisis in Europe is taking place for students, newcomers, and immigrants. Denmark receives less refugees per capita than any other Western European country excepting the UK. It is a far cry from what Denmark’s neighbor, Sweden is doing. The future and health of a city can be judged based on their treatment of outsiders, people who aren’t from there who want to move there. And it struck me as sad that some nationalists might cite Denmark as a good example to close their borders to people in need.
When I am about to be depressed by my own thoughts, it’s time to head to Christiania. Christiania Freetown is the jewel of Copenhagen, a radical morsel of prime real estate that hippies took over in the 70s smack-dab in the middle of the city. Until quite recently they didn’t pay for electricity or taxes, operating under their own laws. Before sunset is the ideal time to go there to check out the architecture, which is a euphemism for the only place that sells weed in the open in Denmark. Sit on the outdoor benches or by the water with a beer in hand and feel that brotherly love seep back into you.
When it becomes too cold to sit outside, I would head back towards Vesterbro to Kødbyens, the meat-packing district filled with restaurants and nightclubs to continue the night until the sun comes up. As I creep back home in the morning, the streets are quiet and subdued, foggy and windy like no one lives in this sleepy town. There is none of that anxious energy that makes a big city spin, spin, spin. Bukowski’s saying, “Find what you love and let it kill you,” is not a phrase that goes down well with the practical Danes nor with the soporific comforts offered by hygge.
And I love CPH because it helps me imagine a different life where I don’t have to kill myself for my career, or tamp down every instinct until I make something out of myself. If only one could belong here.

Have you ever arrived in a city so tired from traveling, but somehow the energy of the place wakes you up? That’s exactly what happened when I landed in Copenhagen…
We got to Copenhagen on Friday morning after a ridiculously early 6 AM flight, and we were dead tired. We didn’t have any time to lose so we set out for the hostel. We took the train to Steel House, which was hands down the best hostel we’ve been to yet. It had everything — pool, gym, cinema, you name it. We dropped our bags and headed to the city. Upon arrival we stopped and listened to a singer on the streets, it was super cool to see him perform.
Locating the Streets and Gasoline Grill
Copenhagen has an atmosphere that makes you just want to walk around. We walked around the streets, dropped by Rosenborg Castle, and let the city reveal itself. Somewhere along the way, hunger caught up with us, and we went to Gasoline Grill, which serves famous burgers. The burger was just what we needed and it set the tone for the day.
The Old Irish Pub and Barkowski’s
We continued walking and ended up at this place called “The Old Irish Pub,” where they had a live band playing. The atmosphere was just right with a good energy. We sat back, listened to the music, and just absorbed the atmosphere. It was a mix of locals and tourists, and it felt like one of those pubs you find on a college campus.
We finally checked into the hostel at 3pm and freshened up to then head back out into town. This time we headed to Barkowski’s, a restaurant/bar that was full of people. We had heard that they heard pull tables but didn’t see them at first sight. After an urgent search we headed downstairs to the basement and found the pool tables and asked some locals if we could play them. They were excited to play “The Americans” and spoke great english. We ended up beating them in a best-of-5 series and it felt very good to win. We hung out for a little while longer and listened to the jazz/rock that was playing, then called it a night.
CopenHot and relaxing, and partying at Rumors
The next morning, we were ready for something entirely new. We went to CopenHot, where they have hot tubs right on the water. It was busy, but in the best way possible — people were just hangin’ out, relaxing. We even did the ice plunge for a bit. The cold was terrible but the instant jump back into the hot tub made up for it. The soft music in the background made all this feel ultra peaceful. It was just the reset we needed.
Then we were hungry and went to War Pigs to get BBQ. As someone who is from Texas, I can vouch that it was some of the best BBQ I had had. The mac and cheese was phenomenal and it paired just right with the pulled pork sandwich. It was the ideal way to finish off a relaxing morning, and I would eat in again in an instant if I could.
We napped briefly, then prepared for the evening. We headed to The Jane, a former library turned bar. The music was just what you’d expect if you were in a library listening to music. It was definitely a first for me and it almost makes you feel like you are in a library. It had books on the walls and the lighting was very dim. It was a very mellow vibe.
Though that changed pretty quickly… We then headed to a club called Rumors. It was all EDM and sing-along tracks here, and the atmosphere was on a whole different level. People were dancing in what looked like a pit.. The music was blasting, and we got to feel what its like to almost be at a concert in Denmark. We met some locals, danced and then called it a night to end our trip.
The Copenhagen Vibe
By the time we got back to the hostel, I had concluded that Copenhagen somehow felt like Amsterdam — the buildings, the bars, the surprises around every corner. There’s a sense of never having any idea what’s gonna happen next and what place you will end up in. Everywhere we went was somewhere completely different and somehow we had a great time everywhere we went. And honestly, the music in this city ended up shaping the whole experience. It was the soundtrack to it all, establishing mood and rendering each moment a little more memorable.
Thanks for reading! If you enjoyed this post, make sure to follow my account for more travel stories and insights. Stay tuned for next week’s adventure .

After a long, dark, freezing, and often soul-crushing winter, Copenhagen slowly begins to come alive in April. It’s green and beautiful with colorful flowers all over the city.
And right in the middle of so many colors, when the cherry trees blossom, their delicate white and pink petals create a stunning contrast against the lush green grass and the clear blue sky.
Copenhagen is full of cherry blossom trees. You see them everywhere. They are in the gardens of tall buildings and standalone houses, in playgrounds, near water bodies, and even lining the roads.
This was quite surprising for me during my first year here. I always pictured Denmark as people biking through the streets, taking icy dips in the sea, and sipping coffee with Danish pastries in cozy cafés.
But cherry blossoms?
That was something I never expected.
This was one of the sweetest surprises that Copenhagen, the world’s happiest city, has given me.
I’ve travelled to over 20 countries, some just once, others many times, but Japan has always remained a dream. Though I have planned many times, a trip to…

Overview
Schrödinger’s cat was a thought experiment proposed by Erwin Schrödinger in a discussion with Albert Einstein in an attempt to illustrate the insufficiencies of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. The experiment questioned the validity of superposition and posed the largely unsolved question of at which point a superposition collapses into one of its possible states.
Superposition — Young’s Double Split Experiment
Superposition plays an essential role in the Copenhagen interpretation and thus Schrödinger’s thought experiment. It is the ability of a quantum system to simultaneously exist in multiple states until observed. The idea is demonstrated by Thomas Young’s double-slit experiment, where a beam of light is aimed at a barrier with two small vertical slits. The light that has passed through the slits is measured on a photographic plate. When one of the vertical slits is covered, a single line of light is observed on the photographic plate on the side of the uncovered slit. If both are left uncovered, however, rather than two lines of light, there are many more on the photographic plate. In route to the photographic plate, each photon exists in a state of each of its possible trajectories, demonstrating a concept called interference, which is essentially the superposition of waves.
In an attempt to further analyze the trajectories of the photons, experiments have been conducted to track their paths. Doing this, however, seems to disrupt the superposition of the photons, creating what would be expected by classical physics on the photographic plate, two lines of light mirroring the slits in the preceding barrier. It appears that the superposition of a particle can not be directly measured; its effects (interference) can only be observed.
Schrödinger’s Cat
Schrödinger’s Cat is a thought experiment that was proposed by Erwin Schrödinger in a discussion with Albert Einstein to highlight the seemingly ridiculous nature of the concepts of superposition used in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. The Copenhagen interpretation briefly states that a quantum system remains in a state of superposition until directly observed by the outside world. When observed, the superposition collapses into one of its possible states. For example, when the photons in Young’s double-slit experiment were measured, they collapsed into one of their possible trajectories, creating two lines of light.
Schrödinger, attempting to disprove the practicality of superposition, proposed a hypothetical in which a larger system was dependent on the superposition of a quantum particle. Schrödinger suggested that if a cat were placed inside a sealed box with a radioactive particle and a flask of poison and the poison was only released if the particle decayed and released radiation, the mortality of the cat would be subject to the state of the radioactive particle. Because the Copenhagen interpretation states that the radioactive particle is in a position of both decayed and not decayed, the cat, by extension, will be in a position of both alive and dead until observed by the outside world. The goal was not to propose the practicality of simultaneously dead and alive cats, instead the thought experiment emphasized the unrealistic implications the Copenhagen interpretation had at a larger scale.
The thought experiment had brought to light a question that is still largely unsolved today: “At what point does a particle stop existing as a superposition and collapse into one of its possible states?” The Copenhagen interpretation had assumed this would happen when an observation of the superposition takes place.
Von Neumann Interpretation
In response to the flaws of the Copenhagen interpretation, John von Neumann proposed the idea that the radioactive particle is observed by the device that detects radiation which is subsequently observed by the controlled flask holding the poison. The point at which the superposition of the particle collapses is not significant. The only point at which the superposition must collapse is when there is a conscious observer. Even this interpretation, however, has been rejected by a thought experiment proposed by Eugene Wigner called Wigner’s friend. Other interpretations include the ensemble interpretation, relational interpretation, and transactional interpretation all with the common goal of identifying at which point a superposition collapses, a question posed by Erwin Schrödinger’s famous thought experiment: Schrödinger’s cat.

“Jonathan just tested positive for Covid here this morning.” My son Dan called me from Copenhagen with the bad news. And he called just minutes before I was to fly there for a long-anticipated visit to Copenhagen, to visit Dan and his family. I was devastated. I knew it would be crazy at age 87 to head off to Copenhagen when someone in the household there had Covid. I canceled.
I had been reading and talking about Denmark for weeks and I found myself continuing to do research and hold forth on Denmark. And now, dear readers, I want to share some of the amazing information that I have learned and to tell you why what is going on in Denmark matters to each of us. Even if we never go there.
Denmark has been ranked as the best place on earth to live and also the best of all countries in terms of quality of life. It has been named as the least corrupt country in the world and number one in terms of protecting the environment and gender equality. It has been ranked the 2nd happiest country on earth, (after Finland) for…

Alright. I have completely fallen in love with Copenhagen. If I were to do college again, I would study abroad here… in the summer ; ). It’s seriously such a magical place — the parks, the bike lanes, the zero noise pollution, the food, the “hygge”… I could go on. Copenhagen is considered one of the happiest cities in the world, + I can totally see why.
Pro Tip — Bike… everywhere. Literally, everywhere.
1] Mad + Kaffe: MUST. HAVE. BRUNCH. HERE. They serve brunch until 12:30 every day. Wow. I can’t believe a spot like this is not in Chicago yet. This has been voted “best brunch in Copenhagen.”
2] Wulff + Konstali: Another — MUST. HAVE. BRUNCH. HERE. They serve brunch until 3 PM [even better!]. Go to the one on Ameagerbro, so that you can go to the beach after!
3] Grod: We went here for takeaway dinner, but I wish I could have come for breakfast! Everything is porridge based… sounds weird but it’s SO GOOD.
For Next Time (Brunch) — Baryl, Social, Bowl Market, Cafe Det Vide Has, Moeller Kaffe + Kokken
Coffee — Coffee Collective, Original Coffee, Statement Coffee, Prolog Coffee Bar
Bakeries — Sankt Peders Bageri [cinnamon rolls on Wednesdays! ++ Copenhagen’s oldest bakery!], Leckerbaer, Isoteket, , Juno The Bakery, Lilli Bakery, Hart Bageri, Meyers Bageri, Bageriet Brod
Sweets — Nicecream, ISTID, Social Foods, Granny’s House [in Torvehallerne]
1] La Banchina: Hands down favorite spot in Copenhagen for a few reasons: the food is incredible [apps = bread + olive oil, olives, + almonds… + then the starter, fish, vegetable, + dessert change every day!], THEN after dinner: jump in the water… + then warm up by the fire + SAUNA. They are also open for breakfast, which is probably so dreamy too.
2] Organic Boho: We stumbled upon this place on our way to Christiana [the hippy town] + WOW, obsessed. Get the burger with tempeh, + THE LOVE PLATE [my fav]. They have tons of beautiful drinks too — juices, smoothies, + rainbow lattes ; ).
3] 42Raw: I love that so many spots in Copenhagen have easy “takeaway” options. We ordered takeaway to bring on the Go Boat: acai bowl, green bowl [“this almost tastes too healthy” — Isaac], salad of the day, + chocolate PB cup. The sweet potato fries looked bomb, too.
4] Neighbourhood: Organic pizza + cocktails… what more do you need? Oh, + TRUFFLE POPCORN. Make sure to get the burrata love pizza.
5] Sprod: You know a place is good when they don’t have an English menu. We ordered the chicken sandwich to split as a snack… + then instantly ordered another one. SO YUM.
6] District Tonkin: This place has the “best banh mi in Copenhagen” + it lived up to the hype . Chicken lemongrass banh mi + pho = winning combo.
7] Souls: This won the most sustainable restaurant in Copenhagen, AND best vegan restaurant — so definitely go. The warm potato salad was liiiiiife. ++ the summer lemonade.
8] Aamanns Deli: A trip to Copenhagen is not complete without trying a smorresbrod. There’s a few Aamanns, depending on the experience you want — I liked the deli because you can eat it in the restaurant, or easily choose takeaway + bring it to a park!
9] Kodbyens Fiskebar: MUSSELS : ) This was the fanciest restaurant that we went to [on our last night]. It’s in the Meat Packing District… we hopped around to a few places — staying at each place for an hour while ordering: drink + one item from the menu to share, what we call #AppyHour.
10] Smag: The BEST salads + sandwiches, oh my gosh. Go before a picnic!
For Next Time — Morganstedt, SimpleRaw, dop, Bollyfood, WEDOFOOD, Gro Spiseri, Ma Poule [duck sandwich is apparently amazing], Kaf, California Kitchen, Mahalle CPH, Plantepolsen, Barabba, Amass [$$$$], Kadea [$$$$], Noma ; ) [$$$$ — named the best restaurant in the WORLD]
Markets — Copenhagen out did themselves with all the markets here. Like, WOW. Trovehallerne is obviously a must… make sure to get Smag, GROD, a chocolate peanut butter brownie from Granny’s House. Other fabulous markets are The Bridge Street Kitchen, Reffen, Rebel Food, + Tivoli Food Hall.
1] Mikkeller + Friends: Apparently the best spot for beer in Copenhagen.
2] WarPigs: Go for the beer, stay for the MEAT. Omg, literally — the brisket was to diiiiie for. *Make a stop here during #AppyHour.
3] Noho: Funky cocktails + hip vibe. *Make a stop here during #AppyHour.
4] Grab Wine… Literally Anywhere: Drink in a park, on the streets, by the lake, etc. It’s open container law!
For Next Time — Sidecar, BRUS, Baghaven, Himmeriget, Lidoeb, Malbeck Vinbar
1] ALL. THE. PARKS: Faelledparken, Svanemoelle Beach, The Citadel, Frederiksberg Gardens (*probably my fav because you get a shot of the zoo in the park + can see the elephants!), Superkilen, King’s Garden, Botanical Gardens… + more. If I lived here, I would spend every day in a park. They are all so gorgeous + unique. You must visit them all!
2] Walk Down These Streets:
3] Go Boat: We chose this over the Canal Tour [if I had time, I’d do both!] — you rent a boat to drive… yourself… with no experience required! Aha. It’s right next to the Islands Brygge Harbour Bath, which you should definitely go to on a sunny day. *Book ahead of time!
4] Tivoli: Copenhagen’s second oldest amusement park, + right in the center of town. It’s definitely worth a stop.
5] Visit The Cemeteries: Sounds creepy, but this is also a must. Vestre Cemetery + Assistens Cemetery are incredibly beautiful.
6] Christiania: The hippie commune — the only place hash/weed is legal in Copenhagen. Super funky to walk through... most people built their homes themselves! Couple things to note: I wouldn’t go there at night, no photos are allowed, + no running.
7] Shop Vintage: Check out this guide for the flea markets!
8] Wellness: I wasn’t able to test any of these out, but I heard great things about: YO Studios, NOR Nordic Health House, CopenHot, Hot Yoga CPH.
We stayed at Hotel SP34— incredible free breakfast every day, in a great spot in town [a bike store is like two seconds away… or you can rent bikes at the hotel], + WINE HOUR EVERY DAY! Also, there are a few other hotels close by in the same collective, so you can go there for wine hour, too ; ). Check out Brochner Hotels. / *One thing I will say is the room we booked was TINY.
There are so many components within Copenhagen that I want to bring back to Chicago — particularly BIKE LANES. ++ how they do brunch… + all the parks. I’m in loooooove. Please visit!
What did I miss? Let me know!
++ Elisabeth

Copenhagen, Denmark, has a unique and interesting transit system. When looking at it at first, most will just see the S-train network, that by any means is not the largest one in the world. But it’s a quite effective network. And when combined with the metro that got added to the Copenhagen transit network back in 2002 when the first 2 lines opened.
The S-train network has been running since 1934. It was the vision for the network, even before it was born that it should be 100% electrified. And it has been, from its start until today, it has only been running on electricity. This vision was part of some earlier work done by The Electrification Commission of 1926, that wanted to electrify many of the commuter rails in and around the suburbs of Copenhagen.
The first line opened the 3rd of April 1934, and ran from Klampenborg via Hellerup and Vanløse and terminated at Frederiksberg. This exact line is now defunct and does not exist in today's network. Along with a timetable…

My interest to explore Copenhagen stemmed from the immaculate design culture that I had heard of . In the quest to explore the origin of hygge life we left for about week’s adventure to Copenhagen.
Fun Fact: The Danish Royal Family holds the title of the oldest monarchy. If Queen Elizabeth visits she will need to bow down to the Queen and King of Denmark.
2. Food & Drink: During my visit, the surprising find for me has been the refined food scene here. Unlike other cities, I did not go here with a focus on devouring food all day but I was pleasantly surprised by the offerings. It could be the influence of René Redzepi’s Noma, which is seen as one of the best restaurants in the world potentially attracting a lot of culinary talent here. Although, I could not get reservation at Noma these are some restaurants that left me wanting more:
Similarly for drinks some spots to check out are:
3. Fashion & Art: When I travel, I love to check out local stores that depict the local style. For sartorial trends street style was definitely trending in the city. Most of the stores I went to showcased unisex easy to wear style. Some stores that were interesting to check out are:
You cannot leave Copenhagen without checking out the best in class design stores. Some to check out are:
4. Must see: As mentioned, Copenhagen is a beautiful city. To understand its past and present I would recommend you to check out these spots, which span all over the city and gives you a good idea on what Copenhagen is all about.
Nyhavn: Street with beautiful colorful building. Great for an evening stroll.
Garden Royal: Close to Aamann’s great to catch a break here and check the rose garden.
Supekilen: For all the reasons listed above highly recommend to check this out. Although a bit away from city center.
Freetown Christiania: This is a free commune which operates as a local body without any governance from local government. It is an interesting oasis in the middle of the city , which is worth checking out.
Nyboder houses: Built in 1757, these houses have lasted several city fires and provides a little flavor of the past.
Church of Savior: This church gives a great aerial view of the city. Worth climbing up the 700 stairs to check out the cityscapes.
Design Museum of Denmark: This museum provides Danish sensibility and evolution from everywhere across fashion, architecture, furniture.
5. Tips & Tricks: These are some quick tips that I wanted to leave you with while planning your trip.

I just got back from my two-week trip across most of Northern Europe. This is my third trip back to Europe. (My first was a summer abroad in Italy nearly 8 years ago and my second was another two-week trip in 2014 where we explored Dublin, London, Amsterdam, and Paris.) I daresay this was the best so far! Thom and I visited Stockholm, Copenhagen, Berlin, and again, Amsterdam this time around. In order to share our experience and to create a living record of its details, I’ve decided to write across a few posts on each city and its adventures. This first post serves to detail our overall travel plans, information on flights/places to stay, tips on light packing, and general advice for good travel. I should mention that I’m not an expert on any other these things but it’s worth sharing the little knowledge that I gained before, during, and after this trip.
To begin with, here are a few starting facts about our trip:
Let’s begin by discussing budget flights. Nine months before this vacation even happened I found some non-stop flights from Oakland to Stockholm for $600 a person. These flights kicked off the entire trip and made everything possible. I recall the very first time I ever flew to Europe. (Which was 8 years this summer!) It was to Genoa, Italy from Buffalo, NY. That flight had three stops (Buffalo to NYC, NYC to Frankfurt, and Frankfurt to Milan) and one train (Milan to Genoa) in order to get to my destination with a total of over 20+ hours at a hefty price of $1500. (Thanks Aer Lingus! 🖕) So to come across a flight that was only 10 hours and non-stop to my choice destination, it felt like fate...
Doesn’t that last sentence feel so inspiring? Statements and facts like those are the gold and shiny wrapper on the cheap bar of travel chocolate. Here’s the nitty-gritty of budget flying:
With some of the add-ons and extra taxes, our $600 tickets actually came to $711.30 a person. Our in-between flights from city to city were around $50 a person. (As compared to a train from Berlin to Amsterdam which was $120 a ticket.) In the end, you have to deal with the minor annoyances for that 💰deal.
Let’s move on to transportation.
Thom and I took public transit for the most part. (I’ll discuss the bicycling and Uber rides a bit later in some of my city posts.) For us, it’s a fun challenge learning a new city’s public transit. And unlike American public transportation, European public transportation is fast, convenient, and very, VERY reliable. Upon arriving at the Arlanda Airport, which is located just outside of Stockholm, we took the Arlanda Express Train that runs directly to the city center in just 20 minutes. (As compared to my 1.5 hour MUNI and BART trip to Oakland International Airport. 😑) Out of the four cities we visited, Berlin boasted the fastest and most reliable transportation (dat German innovation) with Amsterdam coming in at a close second. (Trams, trams everywhere!) All the trams, trains, and buses that we took were clean and clearly marked. My only complaint was the summer heat which was especially felt in the enclosed and non-air conditioned trains.
I plan to discuss each Airbnb in detail for each city post but in general our decision to use this service came from a few points:
Finally, let’s talk about packing. Much like my last Europe trip, I took a single backpack and personal bag with me. That was it! Now that this trip is over, I can say, quite proudly, that it was the best decision that I made for packing. After each city we visited, Thom and I both got a little better at packing our bags. It was a very efficient way to travel, IMO.
Here are some pros:
I admit that there are some cons involved with this kind of packing. While I can pack a mean bag, it doesn’t exclude the fact that the weight gets to you…no matter how light. If you’ve ever landed at an airport and took public transit into a city, the transfers mean a lot of walking between terminals and stations. The weight of the bag can cause a lot of stress on your neck and shoulders. Even this year, I packed a bag that weighed about 8 lbs total and after a while, say 20 minutes of walking, it can really push down on you. I should mention that my bag isn’t meant for hiking or true backpacking and therefore isn’t super ergonomic. I’m sure if I had chosen a small hiking backpack, my experience would be different. The bag that I took is just an everyday backpack for commuting which is why long walks with a lot of weight can easily become a small burden.
Backpacking can also force you to make some crucial decisions as to what you pack. One small error (should I bring a bathing suit?) and you’ll be forced to carry that item throughout the entire trip with much resentment. The last time we were in Europe, it rained for most of the trip. Thom brought an umbrella this year. He never needed it! 😂 🙃 Lessons learned.
A few surprising things that we did bring this year are:
I’ve only really traveled internationally in the summer months so packing has always been dictated by the warmer weather. I took mainly dresses with a single pair of jeans and shorts. A few shirts to mix it up and a hoodie with a jean jacket for cooler evenings/days. I took a pair of black flats since they’re so versatile and my Keds for comfort as I walked/biked everywhere. I kept toiletries to small sizes and bought anything else that might have run out.
Thom and I failed to exchange any currency prior to the trip. But I would recommend making that order with your bank if possible since ATMs abroad will charge you a fee for any withdrawals. Also, make the obligatory call to your bank letting them know that you are traveling abroad so that they don’t lock your card and account.
A kind co-worker provided us an extra SIM card and we had another already from past trips, so this year we both had data/service for our phones. Thankfully our SIM cards were both purchased in the Netherlands with Vodaphone. These cards worked in all the other countries we visited and we didn’t need to purchase new cards along the way.
Finally, I’ll add that we obtained Global Entry prior to the trip. It made entering the US very easy and fast when going through customs. If you are a frequent international flyer, consider getting Global Entry. Global Entry includes TSA PreCheck. So if you fly around the country frequently (which I do), it’s very convenient and handy for jumping those long security lines.
This post is a part of a series based on my recent two-week trip to Europe.

The Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics Is Not Idealist in Nature,https://medium.com/paul-austin-murphys-essays-on-philosophy/the-copenhagen-interpretation-of-quantum-mechanics-is-not-idealist-in-nature-797779e86290,"Sign up

The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics — and even quantum mechanics generally — has been both loosely and strongly associated with the philosophical position of idealism (see here).
Of course, there are almost as many varieties of idealism (from subjective idealism to absolute idealism to pluralist idealism) as there are idealists. So this isn’t the place to run through all of them. In any case, the kind of idealism I have in mind will become clear in this essay itself.
So take as an example the following passage (written in 2005) from Harry Nielsen:
“ Almost unbelievably perhaps, [the academics who developed quantum mechanics] chose to interpret the strangeness of quantum behaviour by denying the existence of physical reality. And as a standard textbook interpretation of quantum mechanics, physicists have been taught for the last 80 years that physical reality therefore only exists as a result of the act of observation. This is the ‘Copenhagen interpretation’ of quantum mechanics, developed in the late 1920’s by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. To quote Heisenberg: ‘I believe that the existence of the classical ‘path’ can be pregnantly formulated as follows: The ‘path’ comes into existence only when we observe it’.”
The passage above doesn’t actually mention “idealism” — yet the general gist seems to be that the Copenhagen interpretation is idealist (or at least subjectivist). And it isn’t at all odd that this writer thought this way about this interpretation of quantum mechanics.
So it’s important to stress that the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics is not idealist. Or at least the Copenhagen interpretation itself can be interpreted as not being idealist. That said, it is difficult to explain why that’s so. Indeed not many physicists — or even philosophers — have fully clarified why that is so.
Finally, there are stronger arguments which assert that quantum mechanics — if not the Copenhagen interpretation itself — is entirely subjectivist in nature. Yet there are clear differences between subjectivism and idealism. Indeed, Harry Nielsen’s words above can be interpreted as only claiming that the Copenhagen interpretation is subjectivist, not idealist.
Various philosophers (such as Karl Popper) have also argued against those who claim that quantum mechanics is subjectivist , let alone idealist (see Popper here).
It is therefore convenient that there’s a short and simple passage (as quoted in Karl Popper’s The Logic of Scientific Discovery) from the Austrian physicist Arthur March (1891–1957) which perfectly clarifies this issue.
Firstly, Arthur March makes an explicit anti-idealist statement. (It’s not clear if that was his main intention — indeed, it probably wasn’t.) He wrote:
“Naturally nobody is so mad as to assert that a body ceases to exist the moment we turn our backs to it [].”
[March was referring to quantum bodies such as particles; not cups, trees or human beings.]
An idealist, on the other hand, would argue that
a body ceases to exist the moment we turn our backs to it.
And that’s because, to an idealist, “a body” — and everything else — only exists in the individual mind or in some kind of collective mind. Thus, it does indeed cease to exist when “we turn our backs to it”. (Unless, that is, it still exists in the mind of God — as with Bishop Berkeley immaterialism, in some other being’s mind or in a collective mind.)
Arthur March, on the other had, stated that it is “mad [] to assert” that idealist position. Yet March did preface that phrase with the following words:
“One may say perhaps without fear of being misunderstood [] that for the physicist a body has reality only in the instant in which he observes it.”
It’s worth noting the phrase “for the physicist”.
This isn’t an expression of a philosophical view or even of a layperson’s position. As a physicist, March was speaking entirely as a physicist.
So even though it may be problematic to stress observation alone, this is still the stress of a physicist qua physicist. And, almost by definition, a physicist is only concerned with the observations of — and experiments on — a (in March’s word) body.
Thus March, qua physicist, stated that the
“[body] does cease, in the moment, to be an object of inquiry for the physicist”.
Why is that?
It’s
“because there exists no possibility of saying anything about it which is based on experiment”.
March’s statement above is true by definition. That is, what comes before the experiment can’t actually be part of the experiment. Or if someone does “say[] anything about it”, then what he says can’t be based on the experiment, and is therefore not itself physics. Indeed, even the mathematical formalism and/or the wave function required for the experiment has nothing to “say” about any bodies before the experiment.
The wave function has just been mentioned.
Thus, the standard interpretation of the wave function is that — in itself — it has no physical interpretation. It is purely a mathematical function. A tool. Something physicists use to do things with. Of course, it can then be given a physical interpretation.
Take the Schrödinger equation.
This doesn’t tell us what the wave function is — other than in purely mathematical terms. The physical meaning of the equation — i.e., what entities, etc. are posited — is a product of the interpretation of quantum mechanics the physicist adopts.
And even when physicists do “guess” at the (as it were) before-observation, that too is only a use of the wave function; which, again, is a large abstract mathematical object made of smaller mathematical objects.
So, basically, Arthur March, qua physicist, wasn’t interested in what might have been the case before the experiment. And, presumably, he wasn’t that interested in what was the case — i.e., in the experimental area — after he took off his white coat and packed up his bags to go home. Alternatively, if he was interested in both the before and after of the experiment, then it was as a philosopher or a layperson, not as a physicist.
As hinted at in the introduction, it’s at least partly understandable that some people see the Copenhagen interpretation as being philosophically idealist in nature. In the passage in the introduction, for example, Harry Nielsen quoted Werner Heisenberg.
So I’ll help Nielson’s cause along by also quoting Heisenberg stating the following:
“[A]n ‘objective’ physics in this sense, i.e. a sharp division of the world into object and subject has indeed ceased to be possible.”
Such passages from Heisenberg and others have provided grist to the mill for various idealists, mystics, New Agers and whatnot. Yet even here (on my reading of idealism at least) an idealist simply can’t make any distinction at all between “object and subject”. (Of course, it’s possible that the word “object” can be defined in such as way that it squares with idealism.) That’s because (to an idealist) literally everything is in the individual’s (or experimenter’s) mind. (Either that, or everything is in a collective mind or in the mind of God.) In other words, there is simply no object in idealism — we only have a subject or subjects.

Here is my usual guide to Copenhagen for tourists who enjoy the culinary side of life and want to visit Copenhagen for the first time.
In general I tell Taxi to use taxa.dk +45 35353535 or use Donkey bikes with app or use the electric scooters.
Packing: Copenhagen is rainy and windy and chilly. Check weather forecast. Plenty swimming opportunities, so bring a towel and swimwear if you want to swim.
Inner city: This is the old town of Copenhagen. Think small streets, alleyways, and historic squares. The main (shopping) streets are Strøget and Købmagergade. Sights to see: Parliament (Christiansborg) and the Round Tower (Rundetårn). You will find two good wine bards here: Ved Stranden 10 and Den Vandrette as well as restaurant Musling.
Christianshavn: An old residential neighborhood full of canals and colorful houses. Sights to see: Cathedral of Copenhagen (Von Frue Kirke) and the Freetown Christiania. Try Rufino’s delicious pasta if you’re in the area or grab a beer at Barr in the evening sun. Restaurant 108 is also located here.
Vesterbro: The area is full of hip cafés, bars, galleries, music venues, and restaurants. The main streets are Istedgade and Sønder Boulevard. Sights to see: the meatpacking district (Kødbyen), where you can pick up Rosio Sanchez’s delicious food (ex-Noma) at Hija de Sanchez, enjoy coffee at Prolog or dine at Fiskebaren. Also, check out Rosio’s new opened place Sanchez on Istedgade.
Nørrebro: This area is often described as the most diverse part of Copenhagen. You’ll find vintage clothing stores, antique shops, café’s, and authentic Danish bodegas (bars). The most interesting streets are Jægersborggade, Stefansgade, Griffenfeldsgade, Guldbergsgade, Nørrebrogade, Ravnsborggade, and Blågårdsgade. Swing by Bæst for pizza if you’re near Guldbergsgade.
Østerbro: in an old bourgeois, residential neighborhood. Among other things, you’ll find Copenhagen’s largest park, Fælledparken, here; interesting streets: Østerbrogade, the stretch closest to The Lakes (Søerne) and Nordre Frihavnsgade. Sights to see: Kastellet (an old family fortress), Svanmøllen beach, and Juno Bakery.
Amager: Copenhagen airport is situated here. You can reach the inner city by metro in 17 minutes. Islands Brygge is worth a visit — and a swim! Sights to see: The wild landscape of Amager Fælled, Amager Strandpark (the beach), and Helgoland (a traditional sea bathhouse from 1913, that is open for everyone during the summer months).
Refshaleøen: This is the area of Copenhagen where a lot of top restaurants are based. Recently, the peninsula has been in constant development. Check out restaurant Amass, LA Banchina, and Lille bakery.
Restaurants, bars, and coffee shops:
Here, we have composed a small list of our favorite restaurants in town. We’ve also added our favorite wine bars, coffee spots, and hang-outs.

When people hear ‘Danish,’ they typically think of Danish pastry, a multilayered sweet pastry with various fillings like cheese or a berry sauce. Or they think of Danish cheese.
From the moment I landed in Copenhagen, locals and people from my program told me to try the numerous famous bakeries in the city. Of course, as a foodie, I couldn’t say no.
But what I didn’t realize was how central of a gathering place bakeries are for Copenhageners (is that what they call them?). Their fast-paced life accompanies grabbing a pastry and cappuccino on their way to the office, or as a casual meet-up spot for friends as they get off work around 3 or 4 pm.
When I look back via camera roll at the delicious, warm, and fluffy pastries I tried, it evokes more than longing to have the level of freshness and quality these pastries have at an affordable price. It sucks me right back into highs and lows during my study abroad, new friendships blossoming, and lessons learned.
Here are five moments (and pastries) I am happy to share from my study abroad experience in Copenhagen:
A week into my stay, I found myself wandering through the streets near Kongens Nytorv, the city center filled with people, shops, and the famous Nyhavn canal. I was walking home after a class excursion feeling hungry and exhausted.
I was still figuring out public transportation (bus or train?) and I had unsuccessfully made any plans with new friends.
The homesickness and loneliness were starting to sink in.
I stumbled upon the nearest coffee shop, Farumhus, which translates to “farmhouse.” I walked in and ordered the Kanelstang, a cinnamon Danish pastry but elegantly twisted in various ways, depending on the bakery.
The place was about to close, so the lady ringing me up offered me an extra pastry for free. her kindness was a small act but stirred a few tears for me, sprouting a tiny sense of belonging in this new country.
Biting into the Kanelstang felt like a warm hug as well, with the generous layers of cinnamon and the intricate swirls, perfect for ripping pieces as I sat on a bench and people-watched for the evening.
I’ve been to this bakery twice during my stay and both times were with new friends I had made. My Food and Identity professor recommended this bakery, located in the Meatpacking District, to our class after a field study in the area.
My friends and I sat outside the bakery in Enghave Plads: this utopian park area where families, friends, and children gathered to chat, play, and spend time together. How I long for areas like these in the US. It was a great area to break the ice over delicious treats and get to know each other more.
As an Indian, trying a cardamom bun was absolutely out of my comfort zone. But strangely it’s a popular pastry option in Copenhagen. But the lemon tart was gorgeous. A light and fluffy meringue, with the tart lemon flavor, dare I say — it’s almost better than a key lime pie (shocker! as a Floridian.)
I was well into my study abroad and just completed my second session. Life was good, I was finally getting used to navigating the area, and made some good friends and memories. But I was longing for one of my favorite moments of my stay: my partner visiting me.
I purposely avoided a few attractions and restaurants to try when he got here, which included Skt. Peders Bageri, which translates to St. Peter’s bakery. A cozy bakery that hails as one of the oldest in Copenhagen, they’re known for their Wednesday snails (cinnamon rolls) that I regretfully did not try. I know nothing about authentic Danish food, but this certainly felt what ‘authentic’ would be.
I tried their plain croissant which was indubitably the BEST croissant I’ve had in my life (I think about it often..) and had to snag a blueberry pastry (pictured) as I saw a worker carry it out fresh from the oven.
Even trying my partner’s picks of pastries, every single item here was divine, fresh, heartwarming, perfectly sweet, with golden flaky crusts. This certainly ranks as the best bakery I tried on this list.
When I was down to a week left in Copenhagen, my friend and I scrambled to try the missing bakeries like Juno (pictured left), famous for its cardamom bun. This was the only bakery I waited an hour in line for. Would I say it was worth it? Maybe, if they had more options available.
But Juno sticks to what they do best and people line up for it, fostering this humming excitement waiting in line as people socialize — standing, sitting at tables, across the street if there’s no room — it feels like a hidden pocket of hygge [hue-gah], the epitome of Danish comfort and coziness.
I really was on my croissant high, trying one in both places, searching for a crust so flaky a knife would scrap across beautifully, a hint of sweetness and saltiness, and the soft multitude of layers inside.
After a long day of souvenir shopping my friend and I sat at Original Coffee, located in the heart of the Strøget shopping district. It’s located on the top floor of Illum, a department store, and serves as an excellent place to look at the city and reflect on the city.
We thought back on everything we got to experience and do, what we learned, whether would we even come back to Copenhagen, and when? What about a different place to study abroad? It certainly was a wistful atmosphere as we enjoyed our last few days being abroad.
My last ‘Danish’ meal before I headed to the airport to fly home, Joe and the Juice is the only place on this list that has a location back in the US. Their pricey smoothies and juices, along with the default Danish pastries, are available on every other corner of Copenhagen. They’re delicious and healthy. It’s no surprise that they’re one of the top food chains in Denmark.
Yet, it had me feeling nostalgic. Before coming to Copenhagen, I had heard and seen this chain but passed it off as a pricey, overly healthy spot that wasn’t worth going to.
However, coming to Copenhagen shook up my perspective on things, and now I was willing to try the very same spot in its original country. Studying abroad pushed me to try foods, and seek out places I would never go to back home. In Orlando, I’m so used to going to the same few spots, complaining about nothing new to do, and sending myself in the loop of my weekly routines.
But when I was in this brand new city, I was wide-eyed, ready to explore, and curious about each corner, hidden gem shawarma spot, an interesting castle, or nature an hour’s ride away.
I just hope to carry this newfound excitement in exploration as I explore my city and reminisce about my summer studying abroad in Copenhagen.

The unique mix of one-man play and opera was in town. The always charismatic John Malkovich came with disturbing confessions, the sopranos Chen Reiss and Susanne Langbein sang beautiful opera arias, and the Vienna Philharmonic played Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Vivaldi to make sure to deliver an unforgettable experience.
The Story
The story is about Jack Unterweger, the serial killer, the writer; the unloved child.
He murdered prostitutes and was sentenced to life in prison. In prison, he started to write poems, plays, and short stories and eventually earned literary respect. Two Nobel laureates in literature (Günter Grass and Elfriede Jelinek) were campaigning for Unterweger’s release because they believed that he was the proof that even the most repulsive people can be converted through art. His biography called Purgatory became a bestseller. Convinced that he was a changed man, he got released on parole. While he was invited to talk shows and other events, he still strangled and murdered prostitutes in Vienna, Graz, Prague, and Los Angeles. The FBI caught him after two years, and after being sentenced again he killed himself in his cell.
This play is meant to be his second biography.

(a to-do list at the bottom)
A city that mostly moves to the rhythm of cycles. With 350km of bicycle tracks, it’s a city where legs and bicycles are synonymous. Silences and blank expressions can be easily mistaken for snobbery, while in fact being softness, simplicity, and kindness of the locals. The cinnamon swirls are sweet and the coffee is strong, old guys play chess in Wednesday evening clubs and old ladies bike by faster than both of us.
I was educated on what makes a city truly ‘emotionally intelligent’ by the architects of a smart city, and something they said that has become my rule to observe was that — a city is not defined by the buildings it has or makes, its energy is defined by the spaces “between” those buildings. Copenhagen is a city where urban development has been based on and around its nature and green cover- that’s really the true beauty of this place. They make it easy to carry luggage without using cars, to walk, bike to work or run back home through lakes and gardens without worrying about traffic or breaking rules. It is truly a sustainably intelligent city.
Areas in Copenhagen are spread out wide, and very self-sustained in terms of food, coffee, parks and culture. Someone living in Frederiksberg doesn’t need to come into Indre-by and someone in Christiania has no actual need to go into Vesterbro. While I loved the neighborhood local vibe of Norrebero and Frederiksberg, I did feel like my eventual place of stay around HC Andersons Boulevard. From airbnbs to eco-hotels, the average rate in Copenhagen doesn’t vary too much if you’re a last-minute nomad like me but I highly recommend at least 2 days in the hotel I stayed in (details at the bottom)
Eat & Drink- only my 2023 favorites, in no way exhaustive :)
Stay- my personal favorite is the Manon Les Suites Hotel — an eco hotel with the best of comfort meets conscious in a central location. If you prefer an Airbnb, check the ones around Norrebro and make sure you check step free access.
Getting Around- Rent an e-bike but not from a hotel.
Yoga - I’ll always check out yoga studios in every city as a personal rule and my favorite one here was ‘Rive Gauche’. The weekly pass makes it easier on the pocket than a one time pay.
Places to Run/Walk- The Lakes, Rosenborg Gardens, Frederiksberg Garden

Grundtvigs Church was erected in commemoration of the great Danish priest, poet, and reformer N.F.S. Grundtvig (1783–1882). This monumental church is referred to in modern terms as a gothic cathedral. Master builder and architect Peder Vilhelm Jensen Klint (1853–1930) died before the church was finished. The task was entrusted to his son architect and designer Kaare Klint (1888–1954), who completed the building of the church in 1940. Kaare Klint has also designed the chairs for the Grundtvigs Church — a chair made of beech wood with wickerwork seat — a Danish furniture design classic. Despite its massive size, the church seems to exude an atmosphere of calm contentment. Perhaps it is the appeal of the regular yellow brickwork forming the sole decoration of the church.

Conceived as an iconic building, which create awareness of cancer without stigmatizing the patients. Designed as a number of small houses combined into one, the center provides the space needed for a modern health facility, without losing the comforting scale of the individual. The houses are connected by raised roof shaped like a Japanese paper art origami, which gives the building a characteristic signature.
Nørre Allé 45, 2200 København N, Dinamarca
The close coexistence between private and communal spaces, often separated only by a thin door, makes this hall of residence quite unique. In fact, the dialogue between individuality and communality forms the very basis for the architecture and layout of Tietgenkollegiet.
Tietgenkollegiet was the result of an architecture competition organised by the Nordea Denmark Foundation with the intention of building a visionary version of the hall of residence of tomorrow. Lundgaard and Tranberg’s round building won the competition. On both the architectural and metaphorical fronts, it is all about inclusion, community and equality.
Rued Langgaards Vej 10–18, Ørestad North
Built for The Medical Association housing scheme and initially were known as Lægeforeningens Boliger. These well-built but relatively inexpensive houses for poor families were some of the first social housing in Copenhagen and were built on the initiative of doctor Emil Hornemann as an immediate and practical response to a cholera epidemic in Copenhagen in 1853.

Cirkelbroen
Cirkelbroen celebrates pedestrians. It reflects the daily life and intimacy that you find around the canal in the Christianshavn neighbourhood, its houseboats and sailing boats, the unique life on the ramparts. Copenhagen’s harbour was once a centre of maritime activity, and Cirkelbroen is a testimony to that history. While working on the bridge, I remembered the fishing boats I saw as a child in Iceland. In the harbour, the boats were often moored right next to each other, and it sometimes seemed that you could even cross the harbour just by walking from boat to boat.
Christianshavns Kanal, København K
The Kalvebod Waves
When addressing this infamously gloomy and desolated side of the harbor, the architects put their focus on two major design aspects: to create urban continuity and to locate the new structure on the sunny spots in the water.
Facing Southeast, the quay has fantastic sun conditions until the early afternoon, but to attract the public after working hours the architects needed to study the course of the shadows casted by the huge buildings along the promenade. The two new main piers are located in the shadow-free zones and programmed as active islands on the water. The project then re-connects those islands to the urban network and to makes them blend naturally into the city’s infrastructure. Two bridges link the tip of the main piers back to the old quay, creating two inner water-basins for watersport activities.
Superkilen
Superkilen is a park that supports diversity. It is a world exhibition of furniture and everyday objects from all over the world, including benches, lampposts, trash cans and plants — requisites that every contemporary park should include and that the future visitors of the park have helped to select. Superkilen reattributes motifs from garden history. In the garden, the translocation of an ideal, the reproduction of another place, such as a far off landscape, is a common theme through time. As the Chinese reference the mountain ranges with the miniature rocks, the Japanese the ocean with their rippled gravel, or how the Greek ruins are showcased as replicas in the English gardens. Superkilen is a contemporary, urban version of a universal garden.
Radio House
Politikens Boghal
With two floors filled with books written in Danish and English, Politikens Boghal is fairly-often considered one of the top choices for book lovers in Copenhagen. The warm bookstore associated with Politiken, one of the largest newspapers in the country, has been welcoming locals and foreigners since 1915. On its selves, visitors can find old and new releases of everything from fiction and poetry to nature and hobby books. Moreover, special events such as concerts, speeches, and presentations take place regularly throughout the year attracting the city’s intellectual crowd.
Politikens Boghal, Rådhuspladsen 37, Copenhagen
Cinnober Bookstore
Cinnober has been standing in the heart of the city center for approximately 10 years. Its founders, Ulla Welinder and Morten Voigt, have a great passion for graphic design and illustration. Therefore, a big part of their book selection consists of magazines and books that showcase the best of design, architecture, and art. Make sure to stop by while exploring the area around the Round Tower and rummage through the bookstore’s collection of local artists’ prints and paper products. Visitors might even find a special souvenir to take back home.
Cinnober Bookstore, Landemærket 9, Copenhagen
Palermo Hollywood
The colourful tropical storm that is Palermo Hollywood is the brightest workspace and concept store in all of Nørrebro. Its a modern mash-up, where art and pop culture, sensuality and seriousness, fun and quality — and especially GOLD & GLITTER — go hand in hand. The shop stocks contemporary english books from modern feminism to colouring books, stylish stationary and selected fashion accessories. Pop on down and feel the vibes the girls are bound to make you smile.

My brother, who’s a volunteer, greeted me in pink sunglasses, with a big smile, and an “I haven’t slept yet”. It’s Saturday, 9.30 at Ungdomsøen. In the short distance, I heard an intense bass blasting into the greyscale sky.
We dropped my bag at the camping area. Spending time at major festivals throughout the summer made me notice how clean it was. Despite me arriving four days into the festival, no trash was lingering around, no broken pavilions, no lonely crying.
As I got a tour around the island, I started to understand why there seemed to be an invisible cloud of respect and love. No brands were screaming their logos into my face, no careless investors were occupied with my amount of money. When you build with a pure heart, you attract pure hearts and pure behaviour.
It’s 11 in the morning. At Astral we sat down for a moment. Platforms vibrating with the music were occupied by sleeping cuddles, stretching bodies and tired dancers. The ambience sound playing was in my head the sound of the universe. The projections on the walls allowed my imagination to be imagination, as I closed my eyes and landed on planet Kune.
Close to noon, I understood that time is irrelevant. 15 people were dancing to an after-hour groove at Space. The atmosphere was uplifted, yet exhausted. A magical mix. At Vessel, the sound was fast, edged and deep. Several people came to say hi, saying that they haven’t seen me all week. As I explained that I just arrived, I was greeted with hugs, smiles and “please enjoy”.
I sent my brother to sleep, agreeing to meet again at night. At the harbour, I asked about the food, as I started to feel hungry for lunch. There’s no third-party involved, all food was thought and created at and by the festival.
People arrived at the same destination for a bite. Some before finally going to bed, some for a wake-up meal. They all smiled at me.
I spent the daytime napping, walking around, talking to people. In Copenhagen, I am so used to introducing myself with my job, my place of living. My commercialised existence. Here, no one cared about my fancy title, yearly income or place of birth. I met Daniel from Romania, Ash from Australia, Olivia and Lukas from Denmark, Toni from Hungary, Anne from France. English was default, as the world united on a small island in the middle of Øresund.
As the night sat, a few hours of sleep had done wonders to the face of my dear brother. He and his girlfriend gave me a tour around the many tunnels before we grabbed dinner in the kitchen. Tomato soup and a Moroccan stew warmed me up as my body was thankful for a fresh and homemade meal made with love and appreciation for its ingredients.
A beer and a drink later, I found myself in front of the speakers at Space. The darker it got, the more magical it all seemed. The stage was sculptured in wood as visuals reflected, played and enhanced the artwork. I couldn’t stop looking, moving, smiling.
I have spent many years feeling awkward, feeling wrong, feeling like the one on the outside. As if I was born on the wrong side of the glass, peeking in on the many people moving their hips, choking alcohol and aggressive consumption culture. I spent the summer missing Copenhagen 10 years ago. Back when Saxons, KB18, Christiania, Ungdomshuset and pirate parties were dominating the underground with heavy drum N bass, dubstep, techno, jungle and everything between and outside. But there, in front of the Space speakers, I finally felt like I did 10 years ago, I felt like I was on the right side of the glass.
At Vessel, I arrived at a deep and evil sound. The screens reflected my inner stage, as I let go. Of whatever was on the mainland, whatever was in the world, whatever was on my worried mind. I no longer cared for time, schedules, work or hate. All I cared about was dancing with people who like me, gave up modern slavery for a moment, only to be slaves of the bass. And damn, that bass deserved my soul.
The night was a pendulum between Space, Vessel, Amphi, Astral and water views. I got lost several times, but it didn’t feel like getting lost. I noticed how the clean behaviour continued into the dark. Trash was being sorted, pocket ashtrays used, water drank. Once in a while, someone in a red Kune-shirt asked me if I was feeling all right, they were the safer space guards. The funny thing is, that a small island with young people and 24 hours music sounds like a recipe for chaos and uncontrolled madness — but never have I visited a festival where I felt safer. People knew what they were doing, and did it with respect. For each other, for Kune and for themselves.
As the sun peaked above the horizon, I started to feel my sore feet at Vessel. We sat down, a random group of people. We shared a moment. Thoughts and ideas were aired, and I understood, that this is the place where the ‘angry young people’ smile. Not because they party, but because they feel free to let dreams touch reality. I came down, feeling like I landed on a soft pillow of utopian hope.
Thank you, Kune. Your revolution is heartfelt, honest and kind. I’ll carry it with me until I’ll see you again next year.

By Kai Chen
I studied abroad in Copenhagen last semester through DIS Copenhagen. Copenhagen is gorgeous! The colorful buildings, the cozy cafes, and the endless green spaces all make for the perfect European vibe. As soon as I got off the plane, I knew I was in for an incredible adventure.
As someone who is passionate about foreign languages, I was stoked to dive headfirst into Danish culture and start learning the language. The Danes are all about hygge (coziness), and the language has fun words and phrases you won’t find anywhere else. Plus, the locals were super patient with my attempts to speak Danish and were always down to teach me new words, as is the case with pretty much everywhere else I’ve been to in Europe.
Taking economics classes in Copenhagen has been a unique and enriching experience. One key difference between these courses and those at Duke University is the practical approach to learning in Danish economics classes. Through field trips to France and Belgium, I saw firsthand how economic principles are applied in real-world contexts. Traveling to those countries as part of one of my economics classes gave me invaluable insights into different economic systems and policies and how they impact societies. This hands-on approach to learning economics allowed me to directly apply the knowledge I gained in class and see its real-world implications, a departure from my classes at Duke that did not typically involve field trips. Another notable distinction was the informal relationship with professors in Denmark, as I could address them by their first names, creating a more relaxed and approachable learning environment. This unique blend of practicality and informality in my economics class in Copenhagen has broadened my perspective on the subject and enriched my overall learning experience.
But the best part? Getting to travel all over Europe! Copenhagen is such a perfect home base for exploring other countries. I hopped on trains and planes to visit cities like Hamburg, Amsterdam, and Paris. It was amazing to see each culture’s differences through their architectures, and I love to explore those cultures through their nature, and oftentimes, museums as well.
Back in Denmark, I loved exploring all the cool neighborhoods of Copenhagen. From the hipster vibes of Nørrebro to the quaint streets of Christianshavn, there was always something new to see. And the food? Don’t even get me started. Danish pastries, smørrebrød, and hot dogs (yes, hot dogs) were some of my favorites.
And let’s not forget about the people! I made some of the coolest friends during my study abroad program from all over the world. We bonded over our love of travel, languages, and hygge, and we still keep in touch today.
Overall, my study abroad experience in Copenhagen was one for the books. I got to immerse myself in a new language and culture, travel Europe, and make lifelong friends. If you’re into languages and travel like me, I can’t recommend studying abroad enough!

This project is an international and interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers, artists, and educators for a meaningful, fair, and forward-looking participation of youth in sustainable spatial planning processes.

In the beginning of March 2023 we met in Copenhagen for a 3-day WP4 workshop focused on the ongoing development of our PwY decision support tool (DST) that is a deliverable of the Working Package 4. During these days, members of the Swedish team from Södertörn University met with colleagues from Copenhagen University for hands-on activities meant to advance our project on selected aspects of the decision support tool.
Image: collective activity for identifying relevant stakeholder and methods.
During these three days, we revised findings from WP2 and WP3. Work package 2 focuses on the study of current challenges and opportunities planners and other professional face in Sweden, Netherlands and Denmark in relation to the involvement of youth in spatial planning. Work package 3 focuses on testing, exploring and piloting with different participatory methods and it seeks to understand if and how these allow youth to participate in meaningful ways. In this sense, WP4 and its deliverable, the decision support tool, brings all that research insight together in an integrated way.
Image: Sofia Lundmark facilitating an activity for the workshop.
The workshop was facilitated by our team collaborator Sofia Lundmark, Senior Lecturer at Media Technology Department at Södertörn University. Sofia use methods from design studies to facilitate the sessions and led us over key questions.
Our project team is a combination of collaborators with different scientific backgrounds and experiences who are connected by an interest in interdisciplinary approaches to sustainability and urban planning. This diversity allows us to borrow tools and perspectives from each other’s discipline, stay fresh and be creative. This is particularly important when developing and designing a tool meant for use in different national contexts and by different stakeholders.
But what is the Planning with Youth decision support tool and whom is it meant to support?
Decision support tools are a compilation of information and data organized in a systemic way meant to assist professionals with their day-to-day work. A DST does not give a final answer as such but gives access to needed information and data for the professional to consider and use in decision-making processes on a given matter.
Planning and urban governance is a field with many decisions support tools and systems. But very few are developed in the context of youth and children participatory processes. Our objective is to contribute with a new tool for planners and practitioners to use when needing to prepare and delivery participatory processes that are meaningful for children and young people.
The DST will provide planners and practitioners with key information about methods for involving children and young people in participatory planning. We envision for the PwY tool to become a useful instrument. For the Swedish context, this is particularly relevant considering that from 2021 and following the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child, planners are obliged by law to include children and youth in participatory spatial planning processes. You can read more about the Swedish context and its challenges in this article produced by members of our team.
Furthermore, even in countries that have not enforced the inclusion of youth in urban planning, this remains an ongoing and necessary challenge that aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Ultimately, we hope that by using the DST urban planners will get the support they need to create (with youth) cities that are more democratic, sustainable and accessible and reflect the needs and uses of the entire population.

Stay tuned for more on our upcoming decision support tool!

Copenhagen inspiration from one friend of a friend to another
I recently booked a weekend in Stockholm to visit some friends who’d moved there. To make the most of being in the area, I added a few days somewhere I heard people consistently rave about: Copenhagen.
▶️ Instagram Highlights️️▶ Copenhagen Google Map▶ Visit Copenhagen Official Website
I put up a call for tips on my Instagram right before going and received so many wonderful tips that I felt I should make a guide linking it all together. The result is a combination of the top things recommended, with a bit of Stubborn Travel curation and personal favourites. I hope it can help as a quick planning aid to this delightful city, home to the happiest people on Earth.
A huge thank you to the awesome travellers and locals who contributed, especially Amalie, Courtenay, James, Nina and Caitlin.

Welcome to the United Nations Career Journey Podcast, where we interview colleagues working for the United Nations all around the world. Our conversations explore their fascinating career paths, what career satisfaction means to them, and how they keep learning and developing on the job. My name is Petra, and today, our conversation is with Iina Paarma who works as a Chief of the Talent Development Unit at the UNDP’s Office of Human Resources based in Copenhagen, Denmark. Welcome to the Career Journey Podcast Iina, it’s good to see you. And thank you very much for joining us. It’s a pleasure to have you as our guest speaker on the podcast.
Hi, Petra. Thank you. It’s my pleasure to be here with you today.
Thank you again. And could you introduce yourself to our listeners?
Absolutely. So, my name is Iina Paarma. And as Petra said, I’m the Chief of the Talent Development Unit at UNDP. I’m also a proud mother of two children. And I grew up in Finland and sometime in my early teenage years, I started dreaming of an international career in international development.
Lovely, thank you very much. My first question that I want to ask about your career is how did you begin your career? It can be internships, or maybe first job, so what was the start of your career?
Well, during my studies, I did have a chance to do an internship in my home country’s representation office in Vienna, in Austria. And I also studied one term in Geneva, as an exchange student during my master’s studies. And another one actually in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. But after completing my master’s degrees, I actually landed a job in the private sector, and then actually another job in the private sector. But somewhere during those years, I did realize that the sort of the dream to be part of the UN, or the international community, had actually never really disappeared. And so, I started applying for jobs in different international organizations. This was already around the time when I was approaching 30. It took it took almost three years, but then late 2012, I got my first assignment with UNOPS, actually here in Copenhagen, and I spent a number of years in that agency. And then, in 2017, I joined UNDP, in New York City after having applied for a position that I found on UNDP Jobs site.
Thank you for this introduction, Iina. And how was the transition into getting into UNDP, after spending time in the private sector and also in another UN organization? And also, which specific tools have been useful for you for this transition, and during this transition?
Yeah, I mean, when I joined the UN, then in 2012, early 2013, that’s when I was coming from the private sector, and I joined UNOPS in Copenhagen. So that transition wasn’t actually that, you know, that big one. It was really a dream to come true. But in terms of specific tools that have been useful, I think, first of all, I’ve tried to do my job as well as I only can. And secondly, you know, I have hopped on every opportunity that was given to me. And early on in the UN, in UNOPS, I also had fantastic bosses who believed in me and took me to meetings, and, you know, let me job shadow them. And that has been incredibly powerful, and I am really, forever grateful for this. And it was a pivotal steppingstone for me to be able to be sort of, on-the-job mentored by my people manager early on in my UN days. Then in terms of tools in general, I mean, I learned incredibly much from interactions with others. So, in that sense, the transition to the UN wasn’t a difficult one, it was a fascinating one.
That’s very good to hear. And I think these points are can be very useful for someone who is trying to look for maybe inspiration or ways to do that step to get into the UN system, but also just career tips in general. So, thank you so much for, for sharing those. So, your role as the Chief of the Talent Development Unit, could you explain a little bit to our listeners what is it about, what are some of the tasks that are a part of your daily job?
Yeah. So, you know, UNDP, we’re a big organization, we are close to 20,000 people in 170 countries. So, this role is really to lead the Talent Development Unit that focuses on leadership development, people manager development, career experiences, capability development. So, we have the three sort of main components in the unit. And overall, we are catering for the talent needs of the whole organization. We are really looking at talent development and learning as something that happens in the flow of work. It’s, it’s not a one-off sort of exercise, it’s sort of part of our DNA as an organization. We believe that creating a learning organization is something that is embedded in every aspect of the organization. And UNDP puts a lot of effort in talent development, we see that as a catalyst for organizational performance, for sure. But also, people’s careers, their career development, and their professional development.
This is great, and working with learning and talents, that must be something very rewarding for you as well, to help the people to develop themselves. But I would like to ask you my next question, and that is, what do you like the most about your role? What aspects of your job of your current job bring you career satisfaction?
I think for me, I am a people person. So definitely teamwork and learning from others. And the fact that I do feel very privileged to have the opportunity to work with people from all over the world, it is extremely rewarding to constantly, you know, develop oneself as one hears about other people’s perspectives based on their backgrounds, you know, be it educational, or cultural, or other backgrounds. The UN is also a big part of my identity. So, so serving this greater purpose of the UN is something that brings me enormous satisfaction. So then when I think about the current role, our team is not in the frontlines of international development. But what brings us satisfaction is the fact that we can develop the ones who are closer to our beneficiaries. And we can see that directly translated into better results on the ground.
That sounds great. And I think this is something that is a big motivating factor for many people working at the UN. And you also mentioned that it was your dream, when you were younger, that, you know, you really wanted to work for the UN. So, it’s actually great that it’s now a part of your daily motivation and career satisfaction. On the other hand, what are some of the more challenging, perhaps, aspects of your job? Or something that you need to continuously work with? Could you just share some of those with our listeners?
Yeah, you know, I think in terms of challenges, this is a global organization that’s present in 170 countries like I mentioned, and this means that someone is always awake, and the work never stops. So, I would say, you know, UN colleagues in general are very committed, you know, hardworking people. So, it’s very easy to sort of get into that sort of ‘someone is always awake’ mode. So, I would say that what I’m trying to learn is to manage myself in such a way that I allow enough time to rest and recharge, so as to be the best version of myself in the workplace.
That’s very good to highlight because I think this topic is very important. And to highlight the need for, you know, strengthening your resilience and well-being is something very important. So, thank you for bringing that to the discussion. And that actually kind of leads to my next question. Sometimes our mental health can be challenged by big changes, challenging moments, and it can take a toll on how we feel about our careers. So my next question is, could you share a time in your career where you had some big changes in responsibilities of your role, and how did you approach it and what did you learn from it?
Yeah, I think, I think maybe the sort of critical juncture for me was when I joined UNDP, in 2017, and moved to New York, the new role was quite different from my previous role and UNDP, as an organization also worked in a very different way than my previous organization. So I think I learned to appreciate that it takes some time to grasp the new context and asking the right questions and understanding that, you know, one should not assume that what worked well in your previous role and organization is, is sort of directly applicable in the in the new content, or in the new context. I think the learnings maybe happened, sort of, in some kind of internal after-action review and reflection, also now in hindsight, realizing that UN, especially when it comes to relocations, those are not only your decisions, if you have family members who are joining you, and so, so certainly reflecting afterwards, the appreciation of the willingness of my family to join me and also looking back at not only those years, but also throughout my career in the UN, as someone who was raising children as well, I am having such gratitude and sort of humility. And understanding that those people around me, you know, grandparents and relatives and their immediate family members have certainly been enablers for me, and for that I am, I am very grateful.
That’s lovely, thank you so much for sharing that. And, yeah, I can totally imagine that these changes of relocating to a different country, different continent, changing your are a big milestone in everyone’s lifetime. And so sharing those learning outcomes might be very useful and good to hear, and I’m sure a lot of our listeners can relate to it as well. Talking about living abroad and having different international experiences, experiences from different career paths and career experiences, what are some of the best tips you have gathered throughout your career so far, when it comes to either creating a career that you like, creating a satisfying career, or just navigating a career in general?
Well, I think it’s important to follow your heart and your passion, when you enjoy what you do, it makes, it makes it all so much easier. And it shows also in the results you deliver, you know, when I grew up, the mentality was a little bit like, you know, job is a job, and then life happens outside of the job, and you should sort of play the same card, you know, study hard and get a job that you can have until you retire. And, you know, we all know, especially the young generations, that those days are over. So, I think maybe, you know, understanding that these type of career moves and career aspirations, they always come with a certain risk. You can’t have it all, you know, you should always in mind, you follow your passion, and understand that that’s not necessarily always the most sort of stable path. But if that’s what you truly want, you should go for it. And then I think in general, I mean, when it comes to sort of career tips, I’m not sure if I’m the best one to share any of those. Once someone much wiser than me told me that, you know, essentially, there are two ways to plan your career, either you go with the flow, or you have clear goals of the type of roles and profiles you’re aspiring for, and then, you know, you make a roadmap and follow that path. Honestly, I have personally been one of the sorts of go with the flow type of profiles. And, you know, that has worked for me. I have jumped on the opportunities that had been in front of me, and sometimes it’s been daunting, but I would say, you know, go for it. All jobs are extremely valuable. You learn things in whatever role you have, for however short time you would have that, you know, it teaches you about the role itself, but it also allows you to meet different people who might have different tips.
These are really great tips and advice and I’m sure the listeners will find it very helpful because I think it’s always good to be reminded of, you know, following the passion and having that as the guiding… guiding light of when you’re trying to navigate through the career so, so thank you very much for that. I’d like to ask you, where would you like to be career-wise in the next coming years? Or do you have any maybe aspirations as well? I know you just shared with us that you prefer to, you know, maybe go with the flow. But is there anything you’d like to achieve in the next coming years in terms of your career?
Oh, thanks for the question. You know, I love my current role. I‘ve been in this role for some 18 months. And I feel that I still have quite a lot to give in this current position. And then future will show what’s the what’s next in in store for me.
Well thank you very much, and I wish you all the best! I really enjoyed our conversation. And I found it very interesting and insightful. And yeah, I hope you had a good time as well.
Absolutely. My pleasure Petra, and keep up with the great job, great work that you’re doing here with the podcast.
Thank you very much! And thank you to all our listeners. We hope you enjoyed this episode and that our conversations will inspire you to keep learning and advancing in your careers. If you liked the episode, please share it with your friends and colleagues, and make sure to tune in for the next one.

Just about a year ago I moved into this incredibly small and beautiful country called Denmark all the way from India to pursue my PhD. I had dreamt about it for a long time and it was so surreal when I actually landed in Copenhagen. Noone back home understood why I chose this strange far away cold land when I could have been applying to top universities in the US; hustling away in pursuit of an empire I had no desire to build in the first place. To me, a safe, happy and a peaceful place would make moving my entire life to another country absolutely worth it. Copenhagen consistently ranked among the top three livable cities in the world while Denmark is popularly known for being one of the happiest countries across the entire world. I knew that as an expat the rules would be different; I wouldn’t share the same benefits that the Danes enjoy and perhaps, my opinions about the happiness index would be different from how the Danes perceive it. That is not say that the index is wrong because it is indeed the opinions of the Danish citizens that actually matter.
My priorities in life were always different. I didn’t care about owning a car and a house to display how successful I was in my social circle. To me, peace of mind, having just enough of what you need and want, and respect were above materialistic desires. That is not to say that money didn’t matter to me. I want to be wealthy in terms of experiences, good health, healthy relationships and money is just a part of wealth. As an overly anxious, introverted and sensitive person, I learnt from a very young age what my triggers were and how to cope with them and so I knew that working in an annoyingly bureaucratic corporate structure and culture was not for me. While I have financially successful friends I really respect and admire, I have no desire to talk the same language as them. I started working young and ensured that I would never have to borrow money from my parents anymore whether it was for my education or materialistic pursuits. If I couldn’t afford it, I wouldn’t buy it. I chose academia simply because at the time it gave me the freedom to think, read, and write the way I wanted and I was given due credit for it. I wanted to move away right after my Masters but my father was clear that unless I had a scholarship, it wouldn’t be worth it. And, that’s when it all began! A six year long journey post my Masters making peanuts but doing what I loved, saving just enough to finally take the leap. I had my eyes on Denmark for many reasons, the most important being safety and gender equality.
One year down and I wouldn’t call it perfect but I know it in my gut that I made the right choice. They ask, what was the biggest culture shock for you when you moved here? I laugh! Because India has given me far more cultural shocks than I expect to experience anywhere else. I have lived in different parts of India and navigated life across language and cultural barriers. We were united by the delicious food and our diversity itself! I am grateful for my journey from a tiny Indian town noone knows of to this beautiful city where I am living the life I always dreamt of. Life in India prepared me for life in a strange country I had absolutely no connection to. The struggles are not unfamiliar— a different language, the lack of a social circle, having to find an affordable living arrangement, getting familiar with the rules and regulations. Things that took me a while getting adjusted to was the right-hand traffic and the fact that there was barely any traffic :D Sure, the weather is rough and the winters are dark and the Danes are reserved (you know the stereotype), but every single day I am in awe of how this tiny little dot on the world map evolved into an architectural beauty, home to some of the largest MNCs and holding an impressive reputation of being politically progressive.
Danmark er virkelig et dejligt land! There was not a single day when a Dane refused to help a “confused” me trying to get used to the city. Often they would greet with a pleasant smile and would appreciate you trying to speak a little bit of broken Danish while making small talk. I deliberately chose to work with a Danish supervisor for two reasons — first I wanted to push myself to work with unfamiliar people (since Indians tend to flock to each other everywhere in the world; I am guilty of this too) and second, I had some serious toxic boss baggage from India that I knew would ease off in the flat heirarchical structure Scandanivian countries are famous for. Wait, I could call my seniors by their first names and they wouldn’t mind? And did you say they don’t call you after work hours (they never call you at all if you are lucky)? Also, you are not obligated to respond to their emails after 5 pm? Wait, did they ask for my opinion? Oh wait, the professors consider their PhD students “colleagues” and not slaves? And…whaaattt!! I am paid a living wage as a PhD student? To me, this was a dream! This is where I felt I could become a well-rounded person whose opinions were equally important and my gender didn’t decide how much I was paid.
I won’t lie I did have my own insecurities (thanks to our colonial past and the ensuing inferiority complex). I was in this land full of white people with beautiful blue/green eyes and blond hair, ones I had only seen on Television up until I moved to Denmark. Soon enough I realised we are bonded by similar desires and experiences that is only natural to the humankind and it is not the color of our skin but our openness to embracing the unknown that really mattered. Sure, I felt unseen many times in a conversation across a table that only white people could connect to (endless discussions over the origins of wine and cheese like we talk about chai and samosas) but this would be followed by a few empathetic people (or those afraid to be perceived as politically incorrect…kidding!) displaying a little bit of curiosity into my culture. I was suddenly representing India in these conversations; not my tiny hometown, not the cities that I lived in but the rich and diverse country that India is. I was educating people who had these preconceived biases against the Indians, some of which were quite ridiculous and rude to be frank (if you don’t eat red meat, you are religious; most of India is polluted, poor and filthy). Some of them had ill-informed opinions about Hinduism and the political situation in the country! On the other hand I was surprised by how India was perceived by Europeans in general. Many considered it to be the land of CEOs, shooting for the galaxies, full of lucrative investment opportunities, ofcourse Bollywood and interestingly home to the good “green stuff” (if you know what I mean ;)). Some applauded me for the bold choice to move to a cold country all the way from India while some struggled to grasp why any South Asian would want to move to this part of the world. I just enjoyed the ride! I am not one to get offended easily. It is only natural to have your prejudices but come to me with an open mind and I will answer all your questions. How you frame your words and the way you speak them tells me a bit about your upbringing and the conscious efforts you put into educating yourself to get rid of your biases often shaped by problematic western constructs. So hey! It has nothing to do with the color of your skin. You can be brown, white, black, straight, gay, queer and whatever you identify as and still be a vile person. In Denmark though, I have mostly met the nicest and most open minded people. They are not intrusive (which unfortunately we Indians could be most of the time), they are polite and respectful of other’s time and space, they call a spade a spade and they really do have a wonderful life outside of work (hygge anyone???). This is the place where I feel my own person, where nobody cares about my age, gender, marital status and whether or not I have kids. I am a far more evolved person than I was when I first moved here and I am doing things I never believed I would be able to do.
So that’s my first Medium post here, a short story of an Indian smalltowner in Denmark. Not sure if I would still call this the happiest place in the world but this sure is the happiest I have ever been :)

I remember well the last days before I left my Vilnius. Days, where I have been walking in the city, going to the places that I have always wanted to, but did not have time for it, spending time with my family and meeting with good old friends. Those days were great. However, the time flies fast. And even though I was quite excited to start a new life in a foreign country, I was also a bit worried. Who will be my new friends? When will Ifind a job? Will I like the studies? How will Copenhagen greet me? After a year of living here, I have found some answers.
Copenhagen greeted me with big white clouds and the hustle in the airport. The hustle of the people greeting their fellow travelers and the hustle of the people running for their planes. An airport is a place where people come and go. And I was one of the many arrived to Copenhagen. I remember that I was not at all impressed by Copenhagen in the first days. So many buildings so similar to each other, so few green spaces compressed between them and cyclists with their angry faces.
It is now, a year after living in Copenhagen, I understand that Copenhagen has so much to offer. Small details matter in this city and it feels like the community is trying to make it with a personal touch. Buildings in different neighborhoods do not look alike and there are very nice green spaces within the city. Only my perception of cyclists did not change.
Nevertheless, I came here to study Organizational Innovations and Entrepreneurship (OIE) — a masters program organized by Copenhagen Business School (CBS). The program offered quite an interesting path of studying, combining theoretical knowledge and practical classes with the most diverse class that I’ve been a part of in my life.
The beginning of the studies was quite interesting. We’ve had an introduction week, organized by previous OIE students, where we had a chance to visit some of the most prominent startup hubs and companies in Copenhagen, mingle together and get to know what awaits us in the future.
And the future was…
Studies at OIE program comprise of two different sets of subjects divided into 4 quarters throughout the first year. One subject will be practical (lectures which are happening in Studio) and the other one — theoretical. On the second year of education students are allowed to choose between exchange, electives, summer university or internship. Or it can be a mix of everything (up to 30 ECTS credits). After that — only master thesis and graduation, where everybody is happy :)
But let’s get back to the first year with compulsory subjects. As it was mentioned before there were 4 quarters with different focuses:
Furthermore, we have also had an elective course — study trip to Silicon Valley, where we have met 28 different companies throughout 2 weeks. You can read more about it in my previous stories on Medium (beginning, part 1, part 2).
As the courses implied, we have been working hard on different business ideas every quarter. I remember it like yesterday:
Q1. Developing an app for finding people/friends with similar interests
Q2. Developing a lip balm for winter sports enthuziasts
Q3. Developing a YouTube channel about local undiscovered places
Q4. Researching the “precariat” & changing spaces (in our case — CPH Village and containers made livable).
Plus we’ve had some of the theoretical classes related to the classical understanding of entrepreneurship, strategic management of innovations, the art of innovation (like design-driven innovation) and some other interesting activities combined together.
Last, but not least, CBS really tries hard to develop in us the entrepreneurial spirit, creating opportunities for the students to go further and make the ideas real. As part of our program, we have been also introduced to Copenhagen School of Entrepreneurship, whereas we, if there is any business idea, could try to get in and use the co-working spaces, advisors and other useful programs for free throughout the different stages of development.
Overall, the OIE program allows to develop the skills and abilities, necessary for becoming an entrepreneur or working with innovations within different fields. Plus, if you have a business idea — you can go for it. Nevertheless, the living costs in Copenhagen are not cheap and a big part of a Danish student life will be described in the next chapter.
Most of the students in Denmark are combining studies with student jobs. That’s a fact. Even though they are generously paid by the government scheme called SU, they are still working as part-time employees in different companies, starting from cafes and bars and ending with study-related jobs.
As my finances did not allow me to live here for two years without having an actual job, I started to look for the new opportunities in Copenhagen. Even though it took me some time (including exams and other activities) to find an actual first job (to be precise — 4 months), I had a great experience learning how the Danish job market operates.
Throughout the 4-month period I had 6 job interviews with different companies, where I had a chance to present myself and also get to know the other side of the table. In the end, I have landed a job at a local food chain, where I have been working as Operations Assistant, learning to deal with numbers, revenues, Excel and developing programs. Nevertheless, during the summer situation has changed and I have to find a new job, which I would like to learn from most, combining my previous experience with my skills and knowledge.
One lesson that I have learned throughout the year — try to be more unique in every aspect that goes throughout the job search adventure. And, the most important, show the companies what you can bring to the advertised position and show that you are a valuable person worth the salary that you will get while working there.
Pro tip: students from EU — if you have a part-time job, working min. 10–12 hours/week — apply for a student scholarship (SU) to be equal with Danish students. More info: www.su.dk
What is a student life without fun? The answer is easy — it is not a student life. People, with whom you are studying, can bring a lot of joy, happiness and adventures throughout the years that you will be studying together and, most probably, they will become the friends for life.
I had the honor to meet with people from different countries and cultures, with whom I had a lot of fun and great things done together. Copenhagen is a great city, where if you want to do something — you will find it. It offers a wide variety of events, places, bars, cafes, parks where you can hang out with your friends, meet even more people and learn about Danish traditions. And, the most important thing, not to be lonely, because sometimes that feeling of being such can come.
Last year I have visited many different places and hometowns of my friends — Bornholm, Aalborg, San Francisco, Asturias. I have also participated in many local traditional events and learned more about Danish culture and who are Danes. Funny enough, but while being in Denmark, I have learned a lot about Mexican culture :) I had a lovely Christmas-New Year’s Eve period, seeing the local traditions and participating in them, seeing how Danes can be welcoming and how cozy are their homes.
Pro tip: check out the Survival Guide in Denmark, it is a great guide to find almost everything you need before your arrival or during your stay.
The first year in Denmark was an amazing experience. The weather was great (4 months of sun in a row), the people are awesome, the studies and the job gave me lots of new skills and knowledge.
I believe that the next year will be even better, with more interesting discoveries, experiences and amazing people. Especially now, when everybody will be back in Copenhagen and will be ready to rock’n’roll.

Copenhagen, Denmark (population of 799,033 as of 2020)
Copenhagen aims to be the world’s first carbon-neutral capital city by 2025 (The CPH 2025 Climate Plan, Copenhagen — Urban Development). Politically, the city also intends to demonstrate how it is possible for big cities to combine growth, development, and an enhanced quality of life while reducing carbon emissions at the same time. This goal sets Copenhagen as a frontrunner in the international arena.
Copenhagen designed its Climate Plan Roadmap in three phases and set on the first phase of the net-zero journey in 2013 with the ultimate goal to become carbon neutral by 2025. The plan was developed in line with the emergence of new knowledge and technology, as continued innovation allowed to make carbon reduction strategies possible and at scale. At the same time, the CPH 2025 Climate Plan seeks to enhance the quality of life for Copenhageners using carbon neutrality goals to change behavior and stimulate innovation, job creation and investments.
By 2018, Copenhagen has successfully achieved a reduction of carbon emissions per capita by 57% while the city’s population grew by 22%. This reduction was mostly due to the green conversion of power-generation and district heating systems from coal to biomass and the erection of wind turbines.
Figures 5, 6: Copenhagen carbon emissions actual and projected, 2005–2025
According to Figure 6, while the 2018 progress has been remarkable, it will require significant additional efforts to reach the 2025 targets. This aggressive goal is based on the city’s climate plan’s four pillars: (1) Energy consumption, (2) Energy production, (3) Mobility with reduced emissions, and (4) City Administration initiatives.
Energy consumption. This pillar primarily focuses on achieving energy efficiency for district heating and transitioning from oil to renewable energy systems. City of Copenhagen collaborates with large building owners on efficient management of their properties by monitoring their energy consumption and optimizing building operations.
Energy production. Copenhagen is powered mostly by renewable energy with more than 50% of electricity supplied by wind and solar, and approximately 80% of all electricity coming from renewable energy sources including bioenergy and geothermal energy (“A record year: Wind and solar supplied more than half of Denmark’s electricity in 2020.” State of Green). The city has ambitious efforts to add at least 460MW from wind turbines by 2025.
Mobility covers two groups of transportation: road and maritime. The city plans to convert all its public busses, road and harbor busses, to renewable energy sources and run on electricity, biodiesel, bioethanol, biogas, natural gas-electric hybrids or hydrogen fuel cell busses. The city is looking to expand public transportation and promote the use of bicycles to travel around the city. In addition to achieving a reduction of CO2 emissions, this initiative will have the benefit of significantly less street noise and reduced local air pollution (“Copenhagen aims to become a carbon neutral capital/Sustainable Transit.” Green City Times).
City Administration. This category sets an example for the Administration to lead the way to reduce the city’s energy consumption, green procurement and transition of the city’s vehicles and infrastructure to operate on alternative fuels. This is important in stimulating public-private partnerships, cooperation with other municipalities and other organizations, and engaging the citizens in the green transformation.
Copenhagen is showing an impressive reduction in carbon emissions. Two specific projects the city is proud of are EnergyLab Nordhavn and seawater use for cooling (“This is how Copenhagen plans to go carbon neutral by 2025.” World Economic Forum). EnergyLab Nordhavn is located in Copenhagen’s waterfront city district North Harbor. The EnergyLab was launched in 2015 in close partnership between academia, industry, utilities, and local government to design a full-scale smart city energy lab with innovative solutions in the areas such as intelligent waste handling, low-temperature district heating, clean public transportation, and super cycle highways. This project is looking at the whole energy system as one, integrating heat, electricity, and transport and testing new solutions such as large batteries and EVs to reduce peak load on the grid, intelligent heating of buildings, and a heat pump and storage system to improve flexibility and optimize local district heating network (“Cities 100: Copenhagen’s new Nordhavn neighborhood is a center of innovation for small energy systems.” C40 Knowledge).
Copenhagen also uses seawater from the harbor for its cooling system with the potential to cut emissions by 70% and keep about 80,000 tons of carbon out of the city’s direct atmosphere. In addition to the climate and environmental benefits, it costs less, takes up less space and it makes no noise. It works by pumping seawater of about 6C, using this water for the district water supply and returning water at about 16C back to the harbor (“Seawater keeps Copenhagen buildings cool.” Climate Change Adaptation).
This is a case study for the main article, Urban Path to Net-Zero: Leading Strategies of the Most Energy-Efficient Cities.

This is a short summary of what I saw in the conference, what I liked and didn't like and what I think was most interesting or worth notice considering my personal preferences and needs.
It was my first international conference and also the biggest conference I've attended so far, so please take that into account when reading this.
The conference had a good amount of different topics, I was satisfied with the balance between topics related with soft and hard skills, although, some of the mandatory talks could be frustrating to some people due to the lack of technical points or a practical guides.
Talks presented by partners (sponsors) weren’t simply trying to sell their solution, but were tackling problems or showing general solutions that can benefit you or your company even if you don’t use the partner specific solution. It was great to see the power of Kafka, GraphQL and Erlang/Elixir.
I was happy to be able to catch up on some topics like AI and quantum computing, the talks in general were well presented, not too long or too short and relevant. I felt that some topics should have had less talks considering that talks on similar subject were already present as part of the mandatory talks (AI and machine learning for example). I believed that the topics could had been better distributed (maximum number of talks per topic). On another side I understand that some redundancy is built-in for the different days and for people that might not be able to attend certain talks due do conflicts with parallel sessions. I understand that it’s not an easy to solve problem, and even with these remarks the overall experience was incredibly positive.
On a personal note I really liked the talk from Saša Jurić about Erlang and Elixir, seeing what Erlang and Elixir can do really gave me the extra push needed to dive into it. The talk from Adam Tornhill ""Prioritizing Technical Debt as if Time and Money Matters"" gave me a new perspective and even actionable points (although not easy) to deal with the trade-off between improving existing code and adding new features. Finally I was surprised with the extreme digitization in China presented by Christina Boutrup, it gave great insights which I believe are not on the radar of standard western people.
I currently live in Switzerland and I have to say that the Danes seemed to me to be even more punctual and organized! No real issues with talks being late or running over time, the duration and number of breaks helping to keep your attention on each talk you attend. Registration and overall logistical organization was very good ( quality of the food and amount of options was great).
The area for partners was cool and well structured, good amount of swag and most partners were easy to interact and have a good conversation during the quick breaks between talks.
One point that I really didn’t like was the amount of talks that were not being recorded, I don’t have enough conference experience to know how much this is common practice but feeling forced to attend to certain talks that might, or not, be of interest just for fear of missing out isn’t a great feeling in my opinion.
I didn't know most of the speakers, but was satisfied with the quality of the talks. As celebrities go, it was cool to see Steve Wozniak in person!
Most of the talks contributed more or less in the same way and a lot of them helped me into catching up with the current state of the industry (at least in a high-level view).
I'm less scared about AI and I think the field still has to evolve a lot before an AI tries to destroy humanity, still I would bet that many people will have their jobs taken by AI based solutions, but it's difficult to say how fast this will happen even for specialists in the field.
China is really a place to pay attention to, we can learn from them, as they seem to be able to foster innovation despite being very restrictive on their market and ideas.
Machine learning is finding more efficient and precise methods to do things in ways that humans can't understand, so it’s something I think everyone should pay more attention to as the results so far are already impressive (and seem to be less dangerous than what we normally associate with AI apocalypse, although strongly related).
Elixir is really awesome and I need to start experimenting and learning asap.
There are different ways to handle the trade-off between adding new functionality and improving existing code, I have much to learn!
The new perspective from Adam Tornhill is something that I believe will have an immediate positive impact on my daily work as in any fast paced and competitive business it’s part of the day to day job to weight the benefits of improving existing code versus the many new features that business requires in the short and long term. This talk gave me a different perspective on how to look at the problem and directions on what needs to be considered on a more technical and practical stand for me to be able to keep the best balance between business value added and the long term evolution of our platforms, while also keeping our 24/5 high frequency trading system competitive.
As a possible mid/long term contribution I think I would like to partner with our big data and BI teams and see what I can do using machine learning to improve the overall business. I now, more than before, believe that machine learning can really help businesses to take big leaps forward in ways that we humans simply can’t predict.
I wish I have the time and opportunity to put some Elixir in action at Swissquote as I believe that the very nature of the business can benefit immensely from the platform features (Erlang/Elixir) that support high availability, fast recovery and the benefits of the actor based model (processes in Elixir). Perfect for my needs in the Forex business line!
Thank you for you attention.

GUEST ENTRY: Pleo’s Jeppe Rindom gives his opinion on Copenhagen’s current ability to attract the best of the best.
Hi! My name is Jeppe Rindom and I am CEO and co-founder of Pleo, a fintech startup that automates expense reporting.
In 2015, my former colleague from Tradeshift, Niccolo, and I founded Pleo in Copenhagen. We had and still have big and global ambitions but with the limited access to digital talent in Denmark, we wondered, right from the beginning, if we would ever be able to scale a global company without moving our base.
It is evident that digital graduates are produced at a much slower pace than what our fellow startups (and desperate ‘we-fear-disruption’ corporates) are screaming for. But hey, our country has pretty architecture, bikes, great food, and the happiest people in the world. So, as bold entrepreneurs we figured; ‘let’s not bring Pleo to the talent — Let’s bring the talent to Pleo!’
Fast forward 30 months, our organisation now counts +40 employees and more than half are non-Danes. What a great success one might conclude, but actually I would argue the opposite, because only in one single case did we, as a company, succeed in convincing an international candidate to relocate to Denmark. And in this specific case, the relocation was caused by a strong friendship to an existing employee.
We consider Pleo a fairly attractive workplace. We’ve been recognized with international prizes and have attracted substantial investments from venture capital firms. I believed so much in our ability to attract international talent that I naively wrote a blog post with the title ‘Let’s conquer the World, not each other!’, which was a shout to the Danish digital ecosystem to hire internationally instead of stealing talent locally. Yet, we’ve never been able do so. But Why?
The Danish ‘package’ is not competitive
As much as I am proud of the Danish welfare system as well as the Capital of Copenhagen, I have come to the conclusion that the Danish ‘package’ sounds much more compelling than it is.
A classic Danish startup package looks somewhat like this:
1) a non-competitive salary, which is really no news if you want to work in startups.
2) high taxation due to our welfare system. Here you might say ‘you get what you pay for’, but that’s actually not true. Most candidates we’ve tried to relocate have a 3 to 7 year perspective for staying in Denmark. They are at a stage in their lives, where access to free education, free healthcare etc. is of very little value.
3) a high cost of living. Being a foreigner without a place to stay in Copenhagen is really tough. Even if you’re willing to settle for just a room in a shared apartment, you will likely end up paying +€1K a month.
On point 1 and 3, Copenhagen is not much different from cities like London, Paris and Stockholm but on taxation, our offering is much worse. And that’s not only a shame, it’s a deal breaker.
So, how have we made it to first base?
I’ve always had mixed feelings when it comes to our ‘open’ (read: free for EU citizens) education system. Today, I praise myself lucky. It saved my a.. Big Time. When we were 1.5 year into the journey, we, as everybody else, couldn’t recruit Danish digital talent, and when our team turned 15 employees, I was still the only Dane. Looking around me, I realised that everyone else were here because of our good and open education system. Luckily for us, many had decided to stay after graduation and in hindsight, I should have done more to build relationships to schools and universities and would encourage any startup to do so.
Second, we right from the beginning had an international company culture. My co-founder is Italian so the Danish way was really never an option. It was of course an obvious thing for us, as our ambitions goes far beyond Danish borders, but our strong international company culture has also become a strong selling point when we hire. Today, Pleo has 14 different nationalities and we still have strong focus on maintaining a welcoming, family-like company culture.
Third, we have had a lot of media attention both inside and outside of Denmark. Today, it mostly relates to our business traction, but in the beginning we did serious efforts to create some buzz, both in terms of being present at conferences, startup events and constantly trying to get media coverage. That helped us tremendously — also in our recruiting.
Fourth, our foreign employees have been great at enabling their networks. Because of that, we today have a handful of engineers working remotely. And it has worked surprisingly well, not something I expected initially and that I believe is strong correlated to the fact that all remote workers were familiar with other Pleo folks (and vice versa) right from the beginning. So get your employees to enable their networks! Chances are that they already know a handful of relevant candidates.
We praise ourselves lucky to have made it to first base. But I fear that more challenges will come when targeting second base and growing our product organisation from 15 to 50 in the foreseeable future.
The bigger picture
We have to join forces on promoting Copenhagen as a European techhub. Organisations like CPHFTW and Copenhagen Capacity are doing a great job building, empowering, and promoting our tech community. But there’s a need for more ambassadors spreading great stories of the Danish tech ecosystem. We just hired a candidate who chose to move to Denmark before having a job. She decided to seek opportunities in Copenhagen (and relocate from Madrid) due to her positive perception of the Copenhagen startup scene. What a win!
We also need shared living at a reasonable price for foreign workers, who relocate to Denmark. Shared living initiatives such as LifeX have also proved to be social catalysts in the tech community. A place to meet like minded people outside of work. Being a foreigner and having social success in Denmark can be hard. Let’s admit it, Danes are pretty reserved when it comes to being inclusive of foreigners. Foreigners with a social headstart are more likely to stick around.
Lastly, I want to come back to our taxation. Our tax society has previously been creative, when facing the lack of talent. In the 90’s, we invented ‘expert taxation’ (in Danish: Forskerordningen), a favourable tax system for researchers and well paid employees recruited abroad. At that point in time, most of the Danish growth arrived from research-heavy organisations.
Today, our world is upside down. Big corporates face challenges maintaining growth and leadership positions and younger growth companies are contributing increasingly to the economic growth.
I strongly encourage Denmark to expand the ‘expert taxation’ agreement, so that tax incentives are created for medium-income but much-needed digital talent moving to Denmark.
Because there is no way we can scale our businesses without help from abroad. So let’s spread those great stories, let’s do our utmost to welcome foreign talent and let’s continue to push our politicians for more attractive framework conditions.
Jeppe

""Why Copenhagen?"" has been the common question when we told people we got married there. I am a Cambodian; my husband is English; and we live in Berlin. Wouldn't it make more sense to get married in Berlin, England, or Cambodia?
Yes, we did have a big fat wedding celebration in Cambodia. But more to that later. What I'm talking about is the legal/civil wedding where you sign a paper that legally binds you as husband and wife.
So… Yes, we live in Berlin. No, we don't speak very good German. This makes it hard because (1) we will then need an official translator at the wedding, (2) it would be tough throughout the whole application because of the limited German, (3) the paperwork is just too much. This article here could tell you more about everything you need to do to get married in Germany. One of the most ridiculous document you need to provide — in my opinion — is the Ehefähigkeitszeugnis aka Certificate of no impediment to marriage from your country of origin (and if I'm not mistaken, from all the countries you have lived at prior to Germany). Did I also mention certified copy of birth certificate? It's not easy business to get that for some countries.
And ""why not the UK then""? Which is actually a good question. UK is a bit simpler (probably because it's all in English so we could understand stuffs), but then we found out there is this requirement that ""In order to actually start the marriage process, you and your partner have to have been living in the UK for at least 7 days prior to notifying a designated registrar office of your plans to marry"". Read more from this article.
So yeah. Getting married in Germany seems hard. Getting married in the UK was also tricky. Thanks to the sponsored Google ads, we found out that a lot of expats in Europe goes to Denmark to get married. It looked like Copenhagen was the Vegas of Europe! No joke! Looking deeper, it was not like Vegas. There's no drive-through or laundry weddings. I know, disappointing right? But still, everyone claimed it was the best decision one could do if one of us are not German and not willing to go through the bureaucracy. So yeah, we decided to do Copenhagen.
There is literally this website that we found: https://gettingmarriedindenmark.com/ that provided a very clear step by step explanation of what to do. (FYI this is not a sponsored post or anything, I'm simply sharing information) They also provide the consultation service that helps you through with a fee. Honestly, the process is simple enough that you probably would not need the service, but we got it just for the peace of mind (and admit it — less stress for the bride).
So here is what we did.
Voila! Now you just need to turn up for the wedding!
We got married at Copenhagen city hall. Everything was straightforward and relaxing, and the whole ceremony was done in less than 10 minutes. We did not even have to bring any witnesses — they have those if we need. The people who performed the ceremony was nice and friendly, and we felt really comfortable. You can do vows too if you like. We didn't though. None of us really like to say emotional stuffs, so we skipped it. We simply said ""I do""and exchanged rings, and kissed. And oh, we signed the papers too.
It was just the two of us. So simple. So easy. Not a care in the world about guests, how we looked, or anything going wrong. We focused on getting married and did exactly JUST that.
As you could see, we dressed up a little though and had a photographer to capture the moment. You can skip all these and just rock up. I told the consultant agency what I was looking for, and they gave me some recommendations. However, there's plenty of photography, makeup, and flower services at different price points that you could go for if you google or check on instagram. They are pretty nice and friendly too, so just send them a text with your needs. Some people also opted for the fancier packages where you get married it at your own venue or a little off the bustling city center area.
None at all. We spent a bit of money but it was smooth and I recommend any expats living in Germany or Europe that struggles with the bureaucracy where they live to consider Copenhagen as their wedding destination. You can make it a little holiday and even invite people you care about to attend the ceremony.
Lots of love, from the newly Mrs ❤ Let me know if you have any questions or would like to know which photography and makeup service we used.

Alex Martin shares his love of history with people in Copenhagen, Denmark, through his job as a tour guide. This last Tuesday, April 5th, Martin led a food focused tour with a group of students from Semester at Sea.
Semester at Sea is a floating university where students from all over the world spend the semester taking classes on a ship, the MV World Odyssey. During the semester students get to travel to 10–13 different countries. While in country, they can travel independently or with field programs organized by Semester at Sea and tour companies from each country. Martin’s tour was with a group of journalism students.
Martin has been living in Copenhagen for 20 years. He started working as a tour guide because of his love for the city and his love for history. Because of his wide range of knowledge, he is able to lead tours related to a variety of topics. This tour focused on the food scene in Copenhagen, but just the day before Martin led another tour with Semester at Sea that focused on social movements with a group of political science students. Martin introduced the group of journalism students to the rich history of food in Denmark by telling them the story of rye bread, and its importance in the country. According to him, rye bread is a staple in most Nordic cultures because of its rich nutrients. The bread uses flour made from rye grain instead of wheat grain and includes a variety of seeds. Historically, people used to even put wood shavings in it to bulk up its nutritious value. Danish farmers used to use this bread as an edible plate and bring their leftovers to the fields for lunch, creating an open-faced sandwich called the smorgasbord. This practical and inexpensive dish was later adopted by bars who would serve it to clients in effort to get them to buy more drinks. The public really enjoyed these sandwiches and began to request specific flavors. The bars responded to this interest by making the smorgasbord a permanent item on the menu, and restaurants soon followed. Smorgasbord is now considered the national dish of Denmark and, although it has practical roots, it is presented as a delicate, elegant dish at many dining establishments.
After teaching the students about the history of rye bread and smorgasbord, Martin brought them to CPH Cooking Class to try and make the dish themselves. The group prepared three different variations of the dish. The first variation was vegetarian and consisted of buttered rye, boiled potatoes, mustard mayo, fried onions, and dill. The second was rye topped with chicken salad made of shredded chicken, mayo, green apple, green onion, and herbs. The last variation was fried fish and vegetables served on top of rye with lemon. Martin said the fish was a red spotted fish popular in Denmark because of its supply in the North Atlantic. The group was able to eat their creations with popular fruit juices while having time to ask Martin and the CPH Cooking Class staff questions before heading off to their next activity.
A short bus ride took Martin and his students to Reffen, a famous Copenhagen food market where the stands are made of recycled shipping containers. Martin explained that Denmark is one of the most sustainability focused countries in the world with a huge emphasis on recycling. Making food stands out of old shipping containers near the capitol’s shipping port is just one of the innovative Danish techniques that Martin taught about. He also pointed out a complex of student housing made from the recycled containers, a garbage incinerator that creates power for the city and has an artificial ski hill on top of it, a group of windmills near the coast, the importance of bikes in the city, and the use of recycled materials in Copenhagen’s hippie commune, Christiania. He gave the students free time to explore the food market, interview business owners, and taste more unique dishes. According to Martin, Reffen is a great place for aspiring chefs and business owners to enter Copenhagen’s already dense food industry.
For their last stop, Martin took the students to one of his personal favorite spots, Halls on the Plaza in the city center. This food market offers many take home options and is conveniently located downtown, making it a popular spot for Copenhagen residents on their way home from work. The plaza consists of two buildings constructed on top of an underground recycling complex. While it is expensive to rent a space at, the heavily trafficked area generates steady business making it another great place for people trying to enter the city’s food industry. Martin’s personal favorite things to buy at the plaza are fish cakes and chocolates.
Bellies full of Danish food and heads full of information, Martin took the group of students back to their ship. When asked if he likes his job he replied, “I get to learn new things every day, what’s not to like?”
Thank you to Kris Kodrich and Semester at Sea for facilitating this field class.

I would like to share my overall impressions about the flight to the Faroe Islands and why I chose this airline.
The company made its first flight on March 1988. Since then, much has changed, and the company has become larger. Now Atlantic Airways has 184 employees. The fleet consists of 3 planes and 2 helicopters, the aircrafts are relatively new, including the brand new Airbus A320NEO and Leonardo AW139 helicopters. The airplanes and helicopters are named after the outstanding artists of the Faroe Islands.
The decision to fly to the Faroe Islands came very spontaneously, and there was little to no time for deliberation and plans. However, at the same time, I was pleasantly surprised by the cost of tickets, even when buying a mere 10 days before the departure.
As an experienced tourist, I decided to register on the site and get a frequent flyer card, but something went wrong, and I was confronted with an error on the website. Looking ahead, I would say that this is the only minus that I can note. In any case, I was not upset, as the primary goal was to buy flight tickets, and this can be done without any registration.
Go to the airline’s website, and right on the main page, you can immediately see all direct destinations:
North
South
There is also an option — to see the calendar of low prices.
The process of buying tickets is quite simple, all prices on the website are in Danish kroner. Choosing a date, you can see prices for a few days back and forth, which will allow you to find the best option.
You can also buy tickets using mobile apps on iOS and Android devices.
You can use the app or web to Check-in online, and you don’t need to print out boarding passes, you can use them directly from the mobile app.
Before buying tickets, I recommend checking the information if you need a visa since the Faroe Islands have their own permission.
Information on countries whose residents need a visa can be found here.
If you still need a visa, the list of embassies can be found here.
The Faroe Islands are not part of the Schengen Area, and therefore you can’t get here using a Danish visa. You must apply directly for an Island visa.
After all the preparations had been completed, finally the long-awaited day of the departure had arrived. The route consisted of a stop off in Copenhagen then onto Vagar.
Check-in and baggage drop-off at the airport closes half an hour before a flight. If you have luggage, you can choose 2 options:
In the first case, the airport staff will help you arrange everything. Although if you decide to use the second option, you need to scan the boarding pass and select passengers with luggage, after which the machine prints a sticker that must be attached to the suitcase. After that, just a few meters away is the baggage drop-off point. If your baggage weighs more than 20 kg, it’s classified as heavy so you will need to attach a special tag to it, which you will find right next to the scanner.
Wave goodbye to your luggage and head to the gate for boarding. If you are departing from Copenhagen Airport, I would highly recommend you to arrive early, as there are a lot of shops and various cafes inside.
The gate was in a small remote wing of the terminal. Most of all, I was worried about company loyalty to hand luggage. The hand luggage restrictions are 55x40x25 cm and 8kg weight plus a laptop bag.
As I noticed, there were no questions from the airport staff regarding the size and quantity of hand luggage and boarding was speedy.
I flew on the brand new AIRBUS A320NEO, and my impressions were only the most positive, not only from the plane but also from what was happening inside.
I was almost the last person to board the plane, and this did not hinder me from putting my suitcase on the luggage rack. The shelves were not full, even despite the fact I was flying to a cold country, and people would need a lot of outerwear.
I think it’s not worth saying however that the seats were in excellent condition as the plane is still new. You are able to change the position of the chair and headrest.
I was surprised by the mobile device holder, as well as USB charging for each seat.
Atlantic Airways provides an app for passengers. The main functionality is
How to get the app? Connect to WIFI AtlanticAirFi and open airfi.aero in a browser.
Atlantic Review Magazine is published 4 times a year and has been available to airline users since 1990. On the airline’s website, you can find all the old publications since 2010. The journal tells about the sights, entertainment, and events on the islands, as well as historical information.
Oh, what a delicious sandwich, you can create songs about it ;)
A selection of free drinks provided on board: sweet soda, juices, and coffee or tea.
I especially recommend you to try tomato juice. I would even say that it is not juice, but a ready-made cocktail with spices, incredibly tasty for spicy lovers.
Food can be ordered in several ways:
You can order sandwiches or rolls as well as desserts and drinks, but if you travel in the morning, breakfast may be your choice too.
A feature of the menu was the opportunity to try craft beer, specially brewed in collaboration with the brewery and the airline.
Föroya Bjór fly WIT me
Atlantic Airways asked Föroya Bjór to brew beer specifically for passengers, and as a result, we got a fly WIT me. This is Belgian Witbier (Bière Blanche), and experts say that the best place to drink beer you can have at an altitude of 10,000 meters.

Healthy. Organic. Paleo restaurant
Inspired by our latest trip to Berlin and how much wifey and I enjoyed the #SexyGood healthy delicious Simply Keto restaurant/cafe in Berlin, Germany, I realised how much I had enjoyed a similar experience last August when we had gone to Copenhagen Denmark.
The entire #SexyGood + links to the 3 visits to Simply Keto can be captured here https://medium.com/@abhijitpradhan/the-launch-of-the-true-life-metric-95a305856195
We had done a short 5 day trip to this amazing city for the following reasons
After paying homage to the Coffee Collective at their roastery outlet in Godthabsvej/Freidricksburg, we came to the famed Torvehallerne, the hip and happening food hall ( there are 2 big halls ).
And while hunting for lunch options, my eyes settled on Palæo which I had read about earlier. Luckily, as one could pick up food from any kiosk and sit together in one place, I didn’t have to worry about wifey, who was frankly not too interested in the place ! ( It took her a trip to Berlin last month to finally nudge her !). She looked at the different food options, but her attention quickly wandered off and she came back with a multi cheese platter as her lunch !
I went to the counter and the person taking orders was friendly and helpful. The place was more a snack/fast food/smoothie kind of place. Apparently there was a “restauranty” style Paleo outlet somewhere else in the city, but she told me the food was essentially the same.
I ordered a salad which was heavy on keto bread, avocado, nuts, berries, etc.
She suggested I go for the Sweet Potato chips. I did. And my main course was a “grass fed” Hot dog with the sausage wrapped in an egg omelette.
I was in seventh heaven as one did not get such treats back home-especially the grass fed hot dog !
The other thing that struck me after reaching Copenhagen was the sheer quality of their produce. Especially the vegetables. I told wifey that I could happily give up meat for ever, if I get a constant supply of such awesome vegetables. This theme continued throughout the trip and even in the Michelin starred restaurants that we ate in and loved, the vegetables were like from another planet !! #Swoon
Torvehallerne became a very convenient lunch spot for us. It was next to the hub station, Norreport, so it was connected to all places in the city ( Metro, train, bus) and dinners were strategically chosen and booked by wifey to feed her chef soul, so basically I got a license to have most of my lunches at Palæo ! Yay ! Think I did at least 3 :)
My favourite dish was discovered when I ordered their burger. The same friendly order taker told me the bread used for the burger was not as heavy as their regular bread as it used more seeds than nuts. Cool !
I loved it. The meat was obviously grass fed beef and from the first bite I was transported to my school days where my dream meal was in one of the fast food burger joints ( Hardees, Dairy Queen etc.) and my favourite dish used to the burger ( specifically the Mushroom & Swiss burger in Hardees).
I ensured that I had the burger again in my next and last visit here !
This experience gave me hope that Sexy and Good can co-exist and my recent trip to Berlin and Simply Keto has only reinforced that hope !! Also, it was heartening to know that Michelin star chef Thomas Rode Andersen was behind the design of the menu ! #SexyGood in action !https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/mar/02/fast-food-restaurant-caveman-diet-copenhagen
I had turned “Paleo” way back in 2012 and in fact tried to use that approach while running marathons but it didn’t work as after 30 k of running, the system would just revolt and scream for quick carbs. Energy gels, potatoes. I was eating more and more unhealthy stuff just to fuel my runs !
It was only in 2016 where I discovered “Keto” which actually gives me hope of plugging that energy crash issue that I always faced on the longer runs.
Paleo can be seen as High Protein ( which I realised was not actually good for me) + Low Carb + Low Fat whereas Keto is High Fat + Moderate Protein ( a crucial tweak) and Low Carb
When ( and if ) your body adapts to the High fat and low carb component of Keto, it slowly starts prefering to burn fat as a fuel ( which is far cleaner) rather than the extremely dirty and volatile carbs as source of fuel. I know now that if I had managed this during my marathoning days, it would have made a world of difference ! I don’t do long runs anymore as it took me a very long time to get over a knee injury and I realised that my body thrives on high intense short bursts of activity rather than the prolonged abuse that I was subjecting it to + after the recent Paris + Berlin trip, I re-connected with “walking” as it probably activates health in my system better than any other activity ! Wow.
The above is a short recap of how I arrived at #SexyGood in terms of diet, nutrition and exercise.

When this Airbnb host in London decided to be an Airbnb guest in design-conscious Copenhagen, he found much to be inspired by in the galleries and museums. If you’re also looking for design/art inspiration, here are three spots you should include when visiting Copenhagen. (Although just being in the city itself seems to activate latent design genes…)
The SMK houses 700 years’ worth of Danish and Nordic art and sculpture with a clear demarcation between the original architecture built in 1896 and the stunning, light-filled modernist section built 100 years later. If you like a chronological context, you can work your way from the front and understand the big themes through the centuries with clever diversions into more obscure and ‘problematic’ branches every so often.
A short train trip north of Copenhagen takes you to another repository of modern art in a stunning waterside setting, housed in an architectural marvel.
Louisiana (named after the original owners three wives, all named Louise) is a day trip in itself. The permanent collection boasts works by Picasso, Klein, Arp, Moore, Warhol, Hockney, Giacometti and oodles more. The current exhibitions included a immersive retrospective of Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama, Lucien Freud and ‘Africa’, a hugely thoughtful and surprising treatise on architecture, art and culture from the continent today.
If Copenhagen can’t have a stunning museum of design, what hope is there for anywhere else? The museum has the lofty twin ambitions to both serve ‘as a source of inspiration for people active in industry’ while making ‘contemporary consumers both critically aware and discerning’.
This translates of course into a whole lot of #chairporn…
So, despite ostensibly taking a break from London, Airbnb and design, I find myself filled with a better understanding of how Danish design works. Now to bring some of that all important hygge to Kith & Kine.
Kith & Kine is a stylish two-bed property close to all the hip/tech action in Shoreditch, London. Come and stay and see how far we’ve got recreating some Danish hygge…

Guide by Lisa Abend Introduction by Helen RussellPhotographs by Carol SachsIllustrations by Louise Rosenkrands
THERE WAS something different about the Danes, I noticed from the saddle of my Jetsons-­style city bike — complete with touchscreen — on my first visit to Copenhagen. The locals didn’t look like us, quite apart from the fact that they were all strapping individuals, towering above me. They looked more relaxed, and healthier. They walked more slowly. They took their time.
Having lived in London for 12 years, I relocated to Denmark when my husband was offered his dream job working for Lego, the iconic Danish toymaker. Denmark ranks among the happiest countries in the world in studies going back to the 1970s, so as a correspondent for the Guardian and an amateur anthropologist, I resolved to investigate the ­Danish happiness phenomenon firsthand, embarking on a year of “living Danishly” (I later published a book of the same name) to uncover the secrets of happy Danes. Copenhagen, regularly voted one of the world’s best cities, was top of the list for a pilgrimage.
Originally a Viking fishing hub, thanks to a natural harbor and an abundance of herring, Denmark’s understated capital has evolved into a cultural smorgasbord and an Instagrammer’s paradise. Only 29 percent of households in Copenhagen own a car, so the streets are picturesquely filled with stylish people on bikes.
Once in the saddle, I took in the colorful terraced houses of Nyhavn and the Little Mermaid statue before ending up in one of the city’s canal-side restaurants, dining on powdered mushrooms followed by peppered loin of venison. The pocket-size capital of just 583,000 people has enjoyed a culinary renaissance in recent years with the rise of New Nordic cuisine and its emphasis on simple ingredients, eating in micro seasons, and foraging.
And your average Dane actually has time to forage, as I discovered. They work far less than the rest of us, clocking in an average of 32.4 hours a week. This means they get to have a life, get on in life, and, crucially, make time for hygge — the guttural-sounding word used to describe Denmark’s national obsession with being cozy and relaxed. Candlelight is key, and fittingly, Danes burn the highest number of candles per head in the European Union.
While biking around town, I noticed a few babies sleeping outside cafés in prams, their parents lunching inside. I later learned that, according to one 2009 study, 79 percent of Danes trust “most people,” which is why they’re able to leave their kids outside without having a heart attack. And this calm, of course, makes Danes even happier: If you’re not anxious all the time, you’ve got the headspace to enjoy life more.
After just a few days in Copenhagen, I was a ­convert — and at the end of our year-long ­experiment, we decided to stay for good. But you don’t have to relocate to reap the benefits of living Danishly. Just a few days in the capital can act like a decompression chamber. Watching the sunset from a ­harborside bar, or strolling cobbled streets with no particular place to go, can imbue a feeling of calm so strong, you just might be able to bring the hygge back on the plane with you.
City Hall is the setting for scenes in Nordic noir favorite The Killing, and the bridge in, well, The Bridge is near the airport. The Necco-­wafer-colored facades of ­Nyhavn figure prominently in The Danish Girl, an Oscar-winning film about transgender pioneer Lili Elbe.
Set in Copenhagen and Greenland, Smilla’s Sense of Snow, by Peter Høeg, is both a gripping, atmospheric mystery and a pretty biting indictment of Denmark’s colonial past. The Almost Nearly Perfect People, by ­Michael Booth, is part humorous travelogue, part insightful cultural analysis, and amusingly expounds on the notion of hygge.
Stay near buzzy art galleries, gritty clubs, or somewhere quaint and quiet — choose your own adventure.
VESTERBRO: WHERE THE COOL KIDS HANG
Once — and, if we’re honest, still — the city’s red-light district, Vesterbro extends west from City Hall and includes the amusement park Tivoli Gardens. But thanks especially to the conversion of the old meat-packing area, it has also become hipster central, with craft breweries, small galleries, creative start-ups, and stylish restaurants galore.
ØSTERBRO: FOR THOSE WITH WEE ONES IN TOW
More upscale and sedate, this is where prosperous Copenhageners move when they start having kids. Streets here are a little broader, with fine apartment houses, tasteful shops, and a lot of embassies. On nice days, the lush Fælledparken fills with families (the park is also home to the national soccer ­stadium), as does the beach at Svanemolle.
NØRREBRO: WHERE THE ACTION IS
When the old demarcation line between city and country was eradicated in the mid-19th century, this neighborhood boomed with worker housing. Today, it’s the most culturally diverse and liveliest of the city’s districts. Home to ­Assistens cemetery (where Hans Christian Andersen is buried), it’s ­populated by tons of cafés, cocktail bars, and ethnic restaurants — including the (locally) famous ­Kebabistan.
CHRISTIANIA: WHERE THE HIPPIES ARE
A self-declared “free city” on the southern edge of the city center, Christiania began when hippies and other free spirits took over an abandoned military base in 1971 and began building homes there. (Alas, there are no Airbnbs in the neighborhood, but it’s still worth an afternoon.) Today, despite frequent police raids, it remains most famous for Pusher Street, where stalls (a lot of them run by gangs) openly sell pot and hash. But it’s also home to a thriving community, with schools, restaurants, theaters, and sometimes whimsical DIY homes and gardens.
A certain minimalist aesthetic and Denmark’s comparatively small gene pool can sometimes make it seem like the streets are filled with tall blond people looking effortlessly great as they cycle around in black jeans, black coats, and massive scarves. And while there is something to the cliché — the prevailing street vibe, according to fashion blogger Marie My, translates into “sneakers with everything, no matter if you’re wearing a feminine floral dress or mom jeans” — designers are embracing bold colors and looking beyond their ­borders. The population is diversifying, and “everyone is wearing everything!” says My.
ARMIN TEHRANI, art director
Tip: Always bring a light jacket with you, ­because the temperature will dip very quickly as soon as the sun sets!
My Outfit: This green jacket was my very first purchase when I moved to ­Copenhagen. It’s a very versatile piece for the summer and spring by Norse Projects.
LUISA ELVIRA TRAINA, creative consultant
Tip: Combine styles in an eclectic manner. If you’re wearing a super-fancy, sequined ­skintight dress, pair it with sneaks.
My Outfit: This is a piece from a collection I created with the Danish kids label Miniature. I decided the brand should create a few grown-up styles inspired by kidswear, and I always get girls stopping me on the street when I’m wearing it, asking me where it’s from.
Join the 41 percent — that’s how many locals bike each day. Mikael Colville-Andersen, founder and CEO of Copenhagenize Design Co., which advises cities on how to improve their cycling infrastructure, breaks down Danish biking basics.
1 / Dress for the destination.
In ­Copenhagen, cycling isn’t working out, and it isn’t recreation: It’s transportation. So wear whatever you would normally wear. You don’t dress specially to drive a car or sit on a bus!
2 / Learn by watching.
You can ride side by side with someone, but otherwise, stay to the right. And raise your hand when you’re about to stop — that’s unique to Copenhagen. And, you know, ride in a straight line.
3 / Wheels up!
There is no shortage of rental options, but the one I always recommend is Baisikeli, which collects used bikes in Denmark and sends them to Mozambique and Sierra Leone.
Where world-renowned local architect Bjarke Ingels sends visitors looking for design inspo.
1. Bagsværd Kirke: Danish architect Jørn Utzon’s church is inconspicuous from the outside, but inside the supremely peaceful space, the light is magical.
2. Eremitage ­castle: King Christian VI’s castle, where the entire dinner table was built like an elevator, to descend into the floor at will.
3. Vor Frelsers Kirke (Our Savior Church): A baroque church famous for its outdoor winding staircase that goes right up to the spire.
4. Rundetårn: King Christian IV built this observatory with ramps, so in the past you could ride a horse all the way up to the roof, should that have been of interest.
5. 8 house: An entire city block designed by Ingels such that people can stroll, run, or bicycle all the way from the street to the roofscape and down again.
Copenhagen’s hottest new neighborhood isn’t really a neighborhood at all. For most of its existence, Refshaleøen, an island on the south side of the city’s harbor, was populated by nothing more than shipping warehouses. But a stint as the home to the Eurovision Song Contest 2014 — as well as some much-loved local music festivals like Distortion — drew attention to the area. Now creative entrepreneurs are grabbing up the abandoned warehouses as fast as they can, turning this once industrial wasteland into the city’s newest destination for food, sports, and all kinds of fun.
1 / Amager Bakke: Leave it to Copenhagen to make a power plant a thing of, if not exactly beauty, at least good design. The smokestack-topped structure, which incinerates the city’s trash and turns it into energy, is also about to become a sports and fitness park, complete with a climbing gym up the side of the building.
2 / Amass: Ex-Noma chef Matt Orlando opened this ambitious, utterly unique restaurant in an old warehouse. On the plate, his cooking looks refined and innovative, but it’s based on a profound dedication to sustainability, from the garden out back where they grow many of their own vegetables to his imaginative use of ingredients others might discard.
3 / CopenHot: It’s got its own sauna, with a glass wall facing the harbor, but the real draw is the boats, each of which comes equipped with a water-­level Jacuzzi that seats five. Floating around the harbor in bubbling hot water on a cold day is one of Copenhagen’s unique pleasures — and an experience you’d be hard-pressed to find in many other cities.
4 / Mikkeller Baghaven: Cult brewer Mikkeller recently opened a brewery at New York’s Citi Field, but Baghaven acts as a reminder of its experimental roots. Here, new Master Blender Ehren Schmidt makes mostly sour beers from wild yeasts and ferments them in oak casks, producing delicious — and uniquely local — brews.
5 / La Banchina: Quite possibly the most pleasurable bar ever, La Banchina serves up food and drink from inside an old boathouse, but most take their glasses to the dock outside, to sip in between dips in the harbor. On a warm, sunny day, with women in bikinis all around, you’d think you were on the ­Mediterranean.
6 / Reffen: After losing its lease on Paper Island, Copenhagen Street Food has moved its much-loved food stalls to the edge of the city and is now ­bigger and better. In addition to stalls offering pulled-pork sandwiches, duck-fat fries, and the like, there are also performance spaces for creatives, plus co-working offices.
THE WORLD OF SMØRREBRØD
Danish open-faced sandwiches may look simple: Slap some stuff on bread and call it a day. But there is a complex, unspoken set of rules that govern not only when smørrebrød is eaten, but also how it’s made. Trine Hahnemann — the chef and author who literally wrote the book Open Sandwiches­­ — schools us on building the perfect æggemad, or egg on rye.
WHERE AND WHEN
It’s typically lunch food, so you’ll mostly find it in restaurants during the day. However, Hahnemann admits that one of her favorite dinners is to lay out bread, ­butter, and a collection of simple toppings and let everyone build their own.
GARNISH
Each piece should have at least three colors, so use herbs, flowers (here, chive) or vegetables. “It’s all about balance,” says Hahnemann.
TOPPINGS
The range of suitable toppings is wide, from tiny hand-peeled shrimp to liver paste to egg. But whichever you choose, include a mix of flavors and textures: “You want at least three of the five ­flavors — sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami — and to make sure that there’s creamy, crunchy, and soft.”
BUTTER
Smørrebrød literally means “buttered bread,” but Hahnemann says butter is negotiable: “I use it if it’s important for the flavor, or if the topping would soak the bread without it.” One thing is not up for discussion, however: “It must be salted.”
BREAD
Danes love rye bread with a passion others reserve for football teams or their childhood pet, and most smørrebrød will start with a slice of the dark stuff. “But there are exceptions,” says Hahnemann. Shrimp and salmon can be overpowered by rye; then use white.
Dad is famed Noma chef René, mom is cookbook author Nadine, and even the wee-est member has a perfect palate. Some must-eat recs for every age from the Redzepi clan.
Ro / age 4: My mom’s pasta with meat sauce. ­Because she makes it with pasta.
Genta / age 7: Ice cream from Dessertboden. Get the strawberry dipped in chocolate and dried raspberries on a stick.
Arwen / age 10: The dried fruits and shrimp at Noma. At first you think it’s just shrimp heads, and then you open it and you think it’s just the crispy chicken skin, and then you eat that and it’s the fruit and oil and raw shrimp.
Nadine / age 33: The schnitzel at Barr. They serve it with peas and horseradish cream, and you can add some caviar if you want. It’s the best I’ve ever had.
René / age 40: The dirty carnitas taco at Sánchez. That’s like medicine for me.
Grandma Bente / age 63: Arwen stole my answer! That’s the only dish that’s ever made me cry.
Natural wines, excellent dancing, and wee-hours-of-the-morning shawarma
5 P.M. Head to Queen ­Louise’s Bridge, where friends gather to drink and people-watch.
7 P.M. The city has one of the biggest natural-wine scenes in the world, and no shortage of wine bars specializing in the funky stuff. Check out Pompette, a new bare-bones space in Nørrebro with keenly knowledgeable staff.
9 P.M. Vega is one of the city’s great venues, drawing big names to its 1,500- p­erson-capacity main hall.
11 P.M. Try Balderdash for its cozy room and whimsical concoctions, or Atze Peng for an artisanal post-show experience.
12 A.M. Jolene is the city’s quintessential club, despite the fact it has no cover, no cocktails, and no design to speak of. Just beer and excellent dancing.
1:30 A.M. You basically have two choices for food: Kebabistan, its three outlets offering shawarma to the inebriated masses, or Barabba, a restaurant that serves inventive Italian food so excellent you’d find it delicious even if you were stone cold sober. (Note: Last order’s at 2 a.m. Thursday through Saturday.)
Søren Krogh Sørensen, beloved cult bartender and local cocktail visionary, shares his favorite places to drink.
Ved Stranden 10: There’s no menu — the staff just asks questions about your preferences and suggests a glass from that. The bar itself has beautiful interiors filled with Danish Modern furniture, and in the warmer months, the outdoor service area along the canal is one of my all-time favorites.
Himmeriget: It’s at the perfect level of super nerdy beers and service that still makes you feel comfortable. You can ask for beers that will challenge you or that are right in your comfort zone. They also have a nice collection of amaro and whiskeys.
Atze Peng: When it comes to cocktails, I like places that stand out a little, places you would only find if you were a local. This spot offers a small, very personal take on what cocktails in Copenhagen can be. You’ll also have a fantastic conversation with the bartender on what you’ll be served.
Ceramicist Inge Vincents likes to work, as she puts it, “at the edge of the functional.” From her studio on the happening Jægersborggade, she shapes clay into daily objects — vases, bowls, and candleholders — that are so thin as to be literally translucent. The results are delicate works that push the boundaries of Scandinavian design and whose beauty has made them a favorite on restaurant tabletops throughout the city.
Copenhagen is ground zero for the foraging movement, launched in its modern form when chef René Redzepi of Noma began searching for local ingredients that would help him define a distinctly Nordic cuisine. His team still goes out regularly to forage for plants and ants, but there’s no need to trek far to find the flavor of the city.
A vast nature preserve in the city, Amager Fælled, has a mix of wild varieties and domesticated plants from people’s gardens, since parts of the preserve are built on a dump. “Some of them are really weird,” says Mikkel-Lau Mikkelsen, director of Vild Mad, a program that promotes foraging. “But you also have the expected ones, like sea buckthorn.” The latter, among the most typical of Nordic ingredients, are juicy berries that grow on spiky shrubs. “Each berry has the same amount of vitamin C as a whole orange,” he says.
Once part of the old city fortifications, today Østre Anlæg is a lovely park, located right behind the National Gallery. In the fall, the fruit on its apple trees will be ripe, and because these too are a mix of wild and domesticated trees, you can never tell what sort of flavor and texture they’ll have. “I’ve tasted some that were like eating a cantaloupe,” says Mikkelsen. Just northwest of the city is a deciduous forest, Hareskoven, where, in fall, you can find field mushrooms and hazelnut trees just coming into fruit. And at the city beach Amager strand, there is plenty of beach mustard growing on rocks along the water. It has the exact same flavor as regular mustard but is very crisp and light, with a saltiness it gets from the sea air. “Like everything from the beach, it pairs well with seafood,” says Mikkelsen. Hook some fish, and you can have yourself a nice little meal.
Castles, culture, sunbathing, and famous falafel, just a short way away — we’re talking sometimes as short as a bike ride.
The imposing castle on a spit of land was supposedly the inspiration for Hamlet, and every August a Shakespeare festival, complete with performances by prominent international theater troupes, is held on its patio. Even without the Bard it’s a cool place to visit, with a museum, craft shops, and a coffee roastery inside the moat walls.
An impossibly adorable Danish village on the water, Dragør has narrow streets lined with red-tiled and thatch-roofed houses and neatly tended flower gardens. The center holds a handful of small galleries and charming restaurants. Note: Because it’s located just 13 kilometers from the center of Copenhagen, it makes for a great bike ride.
A posh, stately town up the coast that has become a bedroom community for the city, Humlebæk is home to the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, one of the best — and most idiosyncratic — modern and contemporary art museums in Europe. Just up the road, the farm stand at Krogerup Avlsgaard sells excellent produce, flowers, and cider.
Malmö may be a country away, but it’s also an easy 35-minute train ride from Copenhagen. (Note of interest: You get there by crossing the bridge in the television show The Bridge.) With the exception of Santiago Calatrava’s stunning Turning Torso building and its new food hall, there’s not much in the way of sites, but the vibe in its urban streets is distinct, and its falafel is rightly famous.

Copenhagen is doubtless a lovely and historic city. But it didn’t seem to inspire the happiness which Stockholm and Malmo (and Lund for that matter) did. Part of that will be down to tourism fatigue. After nine nights in Sweden there had been no break, no real rest time. I was hurting. My shins were feeling like I had shin splints and were being address by copious amounts of biofreeze to help them out.
Initial impressions help, and it was raining when we arrived, and when we went on our first little foray around the city. I think that kind of thing does tend to cloud your judgement a bit. It did feel as if we never really got into being there. And it was noticeably more expensive. The prices were the same as in Sweden, only with them being in Danish Krona and not Swedish Krona, the exchange rate is quite different, where it had been thirteen Swedish Krona to a pound it was less than nine Danish Krona to a pound.
But there was an early bonus, we had been given a room upgrade, and had lounge access, and ended up with free breakfast. Our room was on the nineteenth floor and there were good views out over to the airport and countryside.
At that height, none of the windows in the rooms open, but then on the fire escape stairwell, the windows only go halfway up, and the top half is open to the elements. I didn’t go near that; it was dizzying enough through the fully secure and in place window in the room.
There is a lot to see in Copenhagen. The hop on, hop off bus tour was acquired and used. There isn’t just the one loop, they have three different loops. Which we did back to back to back, which is a lot of continuous bus time. And a lot to take in.
A lot to see indeed. Old, new, and more palaces than you could shake any number of sticks at.
And it left us trying to work out what we would get around to looking at in more detail later. We did also get around to doing a boat tour. Which was probably the best one we’ve been on. There is a lot of history all around what would have been the port.
Nowadays the water has been cleaned out. Commercial traffic stops long before the centre of the city and the water there is clean enough that they have twenty-odd designated swimming areas in it. And going past one of these on the boat there were teenagers dive bombing in to try and splash the passengers on the boat.
We have been back at home for a few weeks now as I try and cobble this piece together, such has been the lack of writing motivation, and now a lot of the things we did and saw have blended into one. The order we did things is all over the place as well.
There was a lot of walking around the outside of historic buildings. Mainly because the city likes to try and gouge as much money as possible out of the tourists it attracts. One of the palace complexes, which now houses the Danish parliament, had numerous different buildings to it. They all charged to get into each one of them separately, and none of them were cheap.
We did go inside the grand church of Frederiks Kirke, or The Marble Church as it is colloquially known.
It is an impressive building and nice and cool inside on the only really hot day there was when we were in Copenhagen. But it was busy, and we didn’t want to draw attention to ourselves by doing the clap and echo test there.
We did also go up the spire of Vor Frelsers Kirke.
There are a lot of steps up to the base of the unique corkscrew spire, all of them inside, and no sense of hoe high up you were. To then come out on a level where we were granted spectacular views across the city.
And the chance to head up the spiral of the twisted tower which gets narrower as you reach the top. So narrow, my fat ass couldn’t get into the very top bit. And I gave myself proper vertigo fear trying to turn around in the tight space to come back down and be partly hanging over the barrier even higher up than before. I just about managed to make it down the twist and back inside without bursting into tears or hyperventilating.
That afternoon we also had some food over in the part of the city known as Freetown Christiania. Where they try and live outside of the governance of the city, and which was the home to dope central for a long time.
There were no shortage of amusing (to my childish mind anyway) signs to see.
And there was the Bastard Café. We went in and found it is quite possibly the biggest board game bar anywhere in the world. Every wall has floor to ceiling shelving all crammed full of different board games.
They say there are nearly six thousand in total. The bar was full of people playing different games on every table.
Nyhaven is worth a look and one of the main attractions. And so says nearly every other tourist there. It was one of the few places where trying to see, let alone get a photograph of was difficult. Instagrammers of the world — fuck off.
Barging in front of you, not caring if they get in your shot, and then hogging the site for twenty minutes. I resisted the temptation to ‘accidentally’ bump any of them into the Nyhaven which has no railings next to the water. I was more tempted to push a twunt with a selfie stick and no self-awareness into a fountain by the Amalienborg palaces. He was getting in everyone else’s shots, looking quite deliberate about it, and then spending ages taking and retaking the same gormless selfies. Even his wife was getting pissed off with him.
It was petty payback later when we were at Tivoli Gardens and he was doing the same thing, and we would casually wander into his shots, but with our back to him.
We did spend a while in Tivoli Gardens, probably the most famous of all Copenhagen’s attractions. Arriving in the afternoon, we had a wander around the park, and then had dinner, and wandered around it again. To me it does seem to be a bit of a case of hype over substance. We did go on the world’s oldest big wheel, which isn’t that big by modern standards, so much so it was difficult to find it hidden away between buildings. But it still went up far enough to give me the heebie jeebies.
I feel as if Tivoli might be better at other times of the year. It is midsummer and there isn’t much night and darkness and so even with the lights coming on it doesn’t stand out in the near night. But it probably looks wonderful when it is properly dark.
The Monday must have been cruise ship day as everywhere was rammed and it felt a bit overwhelming, but a couple of days later and a wander only a street away from the main shopping strip in the Latin Quarter, it felt so much more relaxed. More restful, less stressful.
And we passed churches, university buildings, and little squares.
I took a lot of photos which I haven’t really looked through properly yet, but when trying to find a prompt for a writing group I found I had taken a lot of pictures of doorways.
Lots of very impressive and interesting doorways. I didn’t realise I was doing it. but having a flick through the photos from other places we have visited I find that I have been doing this everywhere we’ve been to. A secret (even to me until now) doorway fetish.
On the day we were coming back home it was raining and the forecast was for it to be doing so all day. So we just went along to the shopping centre near the hotel. We were a few miles outside of the centre of the city in an area called Orestad. In the shopping centre they had a display about the area. When they build new areas in Scandinavia, they do it with a view to how it will be to live there, rather than just throw some random buildings up and hope for the best. The transport links are sorted, and it is cheap to get in and out of the city on public transport. There are wide cycle lanes on both sides of the road, and wider pavements set back. And being a bit further out there were nature reserves within the gaps between buildings, and something like twelve different country walks advertised in the area. Everywhere is so clean. It is interesting to see just how well other countries build compared to the shit show we have in the UK.
And then it was that time. The cases are packed, and the sun has come out to see us off, two stops on the train to the airport, duty free shopping and the flight back to Gatwick just in time to vote.
All in all a decent holiday. Perhaps we were trying to cram too much in doing three cities where there feels like a need to be going and seeing things and doing stuff every day, and so there is no rest. Something to bear in mind for next time.

Posted: 2/8/203 | February 8th, 2023
Copenhagen is a lively, modern, and fun capital perfect for weekend getaways or as a base as you explore the region at large.
It’s a laid-back city with a high quality of living, boasting charming rows of colorful houses, inventive green spaces, inviting canals, and bike lanes galore (there are five times as many bikes as cars in the city, and more bikes than people too).
The Danish capital is very compact and made for walking. And every neighborhood has its own distinct flavor and personality. For this reason, it’s important to have an idea of which part of town you’d like to plant yourself in while here.
To help you decide where to stay in Copenhagen, here are the best neighborhoods — and why I like them — so you can choose the area that best suits your travel style and budget.
But, before I get to the specifics, here are some common questions I get asked about Copenhagen neighborhoods:
What’s the best neighborhood for first-time visitors?  Indre By is one of the most picturesque areas of town and where much of the action is. If you’re new to the city, this is the best place to base yourself.
What’s the best neighborhood for shopping?  Frederiksberg is an upscale neighborhood with plenty of boutique shops and cafés where you can sit back and watch the city go by.
What’s the best neighborhood for foodies?  Nørrebro is the most diverse neighborhood in the city and is bursting with delicious cuisine, from cheap street food to Michelin-starred eateries.
What’s the best neighborhood for hipsters?  Once a run-down neighborhood, Vesterbro is now lined with chic shops, third-wave cafés, and cool galleries.
What’s the best neighborhood to feel like a local?  Amagerbro is a largely residential neighborhood perfect for taking in the local pace of life.
What’s the best neighborhood overall?  Indre By has something for everyone and really shouldn’t be missed!
With those questions now answered, here is a more specific breakdown of each neighborhood — with suggested accommodations for each, so you’ll know exactly where to stay in Copenhagen.
Copenhagen Neighborhood Overview
Indre By, also known as Copenhagen Center or downtown, is probably the first neighborhood most first-time visitors explore when they set out to discover this city. After all, it’s one of the most picturesque areas of town, complete with rows of colorful, centuries-old houses on the harbor, medieval thoroughfares, a castle, the main art museum (Statens Museum for Kunst), Europe’s longest pedestrian shopping street, and even the queen’s residence. Tivoli Gardens, the city’s small amusement park, is also located here.
Indre By, literally “inner city,” or as locals call it, Nyhavn, is the most convenient place to stay for those wanting to pack a lot in on their first visit, since all the main sights are just a few steps away — including Freetown Christiania, the city’s (in)famous commune/micronation.
Best Places to Stay in Indre By:
If you like a dose of sophistication with your travels, book yourself at a hotel or hostel in Frederiksberg, a neighborhood west of downtown. Upscale clothing boutiques, theaters, fancy coffee spots and restaurants, and quiet cafés flank the district’s streets. You’ll also find a quaint park, a diminutive castle, and picturesque canals that are perfect for strolling around when the sun is out.
Best Places to Stay in Frederiksberg:
Northwest from the historical center sits Nørrebro, home to the famed Assistens Cemetery, where you can view the grave of author Hans Christian Andersen (he wrote The Little Mermaid and The Ugly Duckling, amongst many other noteworthy stories). Nørrebro also happens to be the most ethnically diverse district in town: walk down the street and you’ll hear dozens of different languages.
It’s also home to a slew of restaurants and cafés, from great no-frills spots to Michelin-starred eateries. If you’re not sure where or what to eat, come to Nørrebro and you’ll be spoiled with a rich variety of great restaurants.
Best Places to Stay in Nørrebro
There once was a time when Vesterbro, located west of the historical center and nearly hugging the main canal, was a no-go zone, its streets prowled by drug dealers. Some of these elements are still there, but today Vesterbro is one of the hippest places to hang out in the Danish capital. The streets are now lined with cutting-edge art galleries, hipster bars, third-wave coffee shops (emphasizing high quality), and excellent restaurants.
There are not a ton of accommodation options in Vesterbro, but what’s there — and just across the border in neighboring districts — is good for a few nights.
Best Places to Stay in Vesterbro:
Situated to the south, Amagerbro is a sprawling neighborhood with a large residential section. It’s also on Amager Island, which once had the moniker “Shit Island,” because it was the place where the city’s sewage was deposited.
Today, the sewage is gone, and the neighborhood is one of the most sought-after places to reside, as the streets are flanked by cool cafés, restaurants serving elevated Danish fare, and unique shops.
Best Places to Stay in Amagerbro:
***
Copenhagen has a lot of things to see — from Tivoli Gardens to the National Museum of Denmark to Christiansborg Palace to the alternative and hippie-laden Christiania district. With an abundance of charming, beautiful, and laid-back neighborhoods that showcase Danish culture, Copenhagen is easy to enjoy, no matter in which you choose to base yourself.
Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner. It’s my favorite search engine because it searches websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is being left unturned.
Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld. If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel, use Booking.com as it consistently returns the cheapest rates for guesthouses and hotels.

I boarded my flight to Copenhagen with a sense of excitement that, interestingly, kept growing on me. I spent three weeks in the land of rye bread last March 2025. The weeks flew by in a flash — and just like that, a month has passed since that trip.
I have kept myself busy, but the thought of writing about my time in Denmark has always lingered at the back of my mind. It took me a while to finally sit down and write — not because I was insanely busy (well, maybe just a little?) — but mainly because I found it hard to condense everything into a neat 2,000-word piece. What should I write about? What style should I use? How deep should I go? The endless choices to be made left me feeling paralysed.
But hey, here I am — itching to write. So forget about the perfect structure; let’s just dive in!
If there was a common thread running through my trip, it was the question I kept circling back to: “Why, how, and what makes Denmark… Denmark?” A country that consistently ranks among the highest in quality of life. A place where sustainability is not just a buzzword but a way of life. And for cyclists? A heaven.
I went to Denmark for a short course on Responsive Project Management, funded by the Danida Fellowship Center— (no, this is not a sponsored post 😉). I thought I would spend my time learning frameworks and management tools. Instead, I found myself on a much deeper journey: exploring the slow, steady story of a nation shaped over centuries, not built overnight with a snap of the fingers.
Let me start with this — it might sound overly simple. I would not pretend that three weeks in Denmark and a month of reflection could reveal the full answer to how a country develops. But I am trying to make sense of my experience.
If I had to point to one reason why everything seems to work in Denmark, from public transport to waste management, from bicycle lanes to water drinking system, it would be trust. Yes, just five letters: T.R.U.S.T.
The system is built on a foundation of trust. Danes trust their government to distribute welfare fairly and effectively, which is why high tax rates are widely accepted without major protest. The government trusts its citizens to act in the best interest of the common good, which is why penalties for non-compliance are often minimal. It is a mutual understanding that holds the whole system together.
I was mind-blown when I found out that the metro in Copenhagen runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, without fail. I could not think of any other country where public transport operates nonstop like that. It felt like such a powerful service offered to citizens for the benefit of the common good. I doubt running the metro at 3 a.m. adds much to the company’s bottom line — but then again, is not that the true role of public services? To serve the public interest, not just capital.
When it comes to building a bicycle culture in their journey toward becoming a net-zero city, Copenhagen does not stop at simply painting bike lanes on the streets. They walk the talk. They created special carriages for bicycles on trains. They installed bicycle lanes along station stairs to make it easier for cyclists to travel longer distances. Their city planning includes an extensive network of cycle superhighways designed to prioritise cyclist. When they say they want to make cycling a primary mode of transportation, they actually focus on building a comprehensive, interconnected infrastructure — not just making empty promises.
On the other hand, I noticed that trains in Copenhagen are often covered in graffiti that clearly did not look like part of the official design. At first, I wondered — how could such a disciplined country allow vandalism? So, I asked a few locals what they thought about the graffiti on public spaces and why the government seemed to do nothing about it. Their response was casual: “Yeah, some people do that, but it is not really a big deal.” And in that moment, it clicked for me: the government trusts that not enough people will behave in a way that disrupts public services. Rather than wasting time and resources chasing down every minor act of vandalism, they choose to focus on bigger, more important priorities.
Cities in Denmark are built for living. You can tell that urban planners truly had the users in mind when designing the city. This becomes obvious in small but meaningful ways — like how supermarkets are always within walking distance from residential areas, or how close train stations are to apartment complexes. I had almost forgotten how fun it is to stroll aimlessly around a supermarket after a long day of work. It was delightful — yes, I loved it. I have never enjoyed online shopping (call me old-fashioned), but there is something uniquely satisfying about wandering through aisles with no intention of buying anything. It feels healthier than scrolling through my phone, and it offers a spontaneous break after eight hours of structured, planned work.
And what is more user-centric than thoughtful city planning? Maybe a door that swings just the right way. At the building where I took my short course, there were several swing doors. Uniquely, the two sides of each door swung in different directions: the right side swung away from you, while the left side swung toward you. Why? Because in Denmark, people naturally walk on the right side of the lane.
How could you not trust a company that pays such close attention to even the smallest details — like how a door swings — for the comfort of its users?
If you are wondering whether I would write about Denmark’s waste management system — you guessed it right. I simply cannot visit a new country without peeking into a few trash bins and wandering through recycling centers.
Denmark’s system is impressive but not perfect. Around 53.9% of waste is collected for recycling and less than 1% ends up in landfill, but about 45.2% of waste is still incinerated.
Some of the waste workers I met during field visits shared differing views. A few doubted that the EPR system could truly work, while others argued that waste-to-energy is the most viable circular solution — since no material can be recycled indefinitely. I agree to a certain extent: we cannot recycle our way out of the mess we have created. So the point? It is not the perfect world I initially imagined. Sustainability is still a work in progress. Not all Danes are passionate about recycling. Not all Danes love rye bread either… okay, maybe I was wrong about the rye bread.
But it is not all gloom — there were definitely more bright stories (as you expected duh).
I visited one recycling center on the outskirts of Copenhagen. The center is designed for self-service drop-offs: no securities, no checkpoints. People just walk or drive in with their waste. For households, it is free (already covered in their waste retribution fees); businesses pay per visit. Surprisingly, there is no staff at the entrance — only a few CCTVs that capture license plates and automatically register and bill accordingly.
Of course, I asked, “What if a business owner uses their private car to dump waste instead?” The manager replied with the same mindset I had heard before: “It does not happen that much. Not enough people cheat the system.”
My next question was, “How do you ensure there is no contamination across the 20 different recyclable categories?” He then said, “If someone makes a mistake, we let them know and ask them not to repeat it.”
“And if they keep doing it?” I probed further. “We do nothing. Maybe less than 5% of people are stubborn. We can tolerate that.”
Another mind-blown moment: trust, again, is a powerful behaviour change enabler. The system trusts that most people will do the right thing, so they focus their resources on helping, not policing.
And that trust is matched by thoughtful system design. Containers are placed underground — essentially large holes — making it easier to dispose of waste properly. New waste categories were introduced slowly over decades to avoid overwhelming households (for example, food waste sorting was only introduced in 2021).
And their waste retribution fees? Completely transparent. The fees are calculated based on the total costs of collection, transportation, incineration, and recycling, minus the revenue earned from selling recyclables. The final cost is divided equally among all households. It is a dynamic system: if households sort better and recycling value increases, fees can go down.
Importantly, this fee is separate from taxes. The philosophy is simple: waste will always exist, regardless of national politics or budget priorities. Waste management should be funded based directly on the real cost of handling waste, not influenced by unrelated government spending.
On my final day in Copenhagen, I had the chance to visit one of the city’s incinerator plants. Surprisingly or not surprisingly, the massive facility was managed by just 4–5 people at a time — only two in the control room monitoring the indicators, and another two on standby for any needed repairs. As I walked around, I barely saw a soul; only the heat humming, doing their work. The chimney was stabbed with dozens of measuring instruments, all working overtime to ensure the final smokes were clean, pure white, and non-toxic.
During the visit, the plant manager casually mentioned a surprising challenge: it is getting harder to find enough waste to burn. Denmark’s rising recycling rate means less and less waste is arriving at incinerators, even though the plant must operate 24/7 to remain efficient.
What an irony, I thought — succeeding too well at recycling is now creating a new challenge.
“How do we build trust in the first place?” I wonder about that a lot. One thing I am sure of — it does not happen overnight. In one of the classes I attended, the instructor shared this formula:
Credibility is about your words — do people believe you know what you’re talking about? Reliability is about your actions — do you do what you say you will do? Intimacy is about safety — do people feel comfortable being honest with you? And finally, self-orientation is about intent — are you in it for others, or just for yourself? The lower your self-orientation, the stronger the trust you can build.
Trust is not just about being good at what you do — it is about showing up with integrity and empathy, consistently, over time.”
Trust is built through reputation. It is built through history. In one introduction to Danish culture, I learned, “Danes generally support their monarchy due to a mix of tradition, national unity, and the royal family’s approachable, down-to-earth demeanour. The royals are actively engaged in public life, which makes them relatable.”
That trust was not built overnight — it has been earned over time, layer by layer, until it became a strong and lasting foundation.
I could go on — there were so many things that fascinated me, from Denmark’s pork industry to the sight of babies left napping in their strollers outside restaurants (yes, you read that right — alone without adult supervision). But I guess I should stop here. I had a truly enjoyable time in Denmark. Oh also, I met wonderful friends, got a little drunk dancing to Swedish music, and played international ping-pong matches with friends from three different continents. Now, it is time to get back to the grind in Jakarta — hopefully, with a little more clarity and trust in the process.

Today wraps my last day in Copenhagen, Denmark — the first leg of the scandinavian holiday that I’m taking while on sabbatical. Copenhagen has been amazing, it’s a complete contrast of what I was expecting with lots of wide open spaces instead of the usual spaghetti of roads that european capitals have.
We flew out on the 4th of November from Heathrow and on landing the vibe of the country was evident when the passport officer had a cheerful chat with us about our travel plans instead of a stern grilling.
The train from the airport to the city centre where we were staying was fast and really spacious. Compared to the LNER train that we took to London from Leeds to get to the airport in the UK the train was taller and while just as wide it was laid out so that there was more space for bikes and disabled seating.
Walking to the hotel we encountered some issues, the pavements are laid out in a way that there’s two lanes of smooth pavement split up with cobblestones. These cobblestones are terrible for suitcases so we had to find ways to avoid these while walking through the Friday night crowds.
We also got told off for wearing our facemasks in public, it turns out that no-one in Copenhagen wears them which as someone who is very conscious of coronavirus and how that could up-end our holiday plans feels like a lot of risk for us to be taking just to fit into the social norms.
On Saturday, the first full day we had we visited Ørstedsparken and Kongens Have, two very nice parks full of statues that looked amazing as the leaves changed colour.
Near those two parks is the Botanical Gardens which was closed by the time we got there on the Saturday so we went back on Sunday and visited the Natural History Museum also. As part of the Museum ticket was entry to the Palm House in the Botanical Gardens so we went back for that.
On the Monday we visited a shared office space that a colleague was working from which was in the old meat packing area of Copenhagen. The area really reminded me of Clerkenwell in London with loads of large buildings repurposed into unique shops and offices.
We had looked to visit Tivoli Gardens on the Monday after the office visit but when we got to the gate we found out that the park is closed for weeks as the seasons change. When we arrived it was halloween season but on the Sunday it closed to change to the christmas season and wouldn’t reopen until after we had left Denmark.
On Tuesday we walked to Copenhagen Zoo which while a bit of a walk from our hotel was worth the effort as not only did we get to have a fun time there but we discovered a number of small shops to revisit and a park too. The zoo itself was amazing, with really nice enclosures for the animals and even enclosures where the animals roamed freely around you.
On Wednesday we had a bus and canal tour booked so we jumped aboard to learn about the history of Copenhagen, learning that a fair amount of that history involves Britain invading or blowing things up. This was something that I never got taught about in school so was interesting to know.
While the history aspect was interesting some of the sights from the boat weren’t as good, for instance someone on the internet said that there’d be a good view of the Little Mermaid statue from the boat but the view was awful.
Thursday was an early start to do some laundry and a walk over to Søndermarken near the Zoo and then over to Fisktorvet near the meat packing area. This involved a fair amount of walking but was a nice trip around town.
And finally today (Friday) was a trip over to the Little Mermaid to get a better picture and a walk around the Kastellet before walking over to the National Gallery. We then did some souvenir shopping and headed back to the hotel to pack, ready for the next leg of the trip — Sweden.

This isn’t one of those annoying headlines that gets flipped on its arse and actually ends up telling you how incredibly amazing Copenhagen is. Nope — this article is an honest account of why Copenhagen is utterly shite.
How did I end up somewhere so awful? I fell victim to various accounts from various friends, all of whom painted Copenhagen as a real ‘must see’. Someone even told me it’s their favourite city in Europe. Oh dear.
I’d also read that the Danes are some of the happiest folk on the planet. Guess what? It turned out to be fake news. We figured this out fairly quickly for ourselves — on the train from the airport, actually, when we got told off by none other than a teenager for daring to whisper in the quiet carriage. We also got a finger wagging for unwittingly leaning against the walls of the palace — fair play there I suppose — although in our defence it didn’t look like a palace…at all.
So, 6 reasons Copenhagen sucks balls:
1. It’s dreary as hell
Actually, hell would be a lot less dreary. At least all that fire would give it some colour — something Copenhagen is noticeably devoid of. The buildings are bleak, lacklustre and remarkably uninspired. With the exception of Nyhavn and Frederik’s Church in Amalienborg, there’s really nothing that catches the eye.
2. It’s SO expensive
A small bottle of water is close to £2 and a pint can set you back as much as £8. One evening, we paid £70 for 2 pizzas, two beers, a glass of wine and a bottle of water. Oh, and the pizzas were shit. AND we had to collect them from the counter ourselves when our crappy plastic buzzer started going berserk. I’m pretty sure you have to pay for tap water too. Not cool.
3. The weather is depressing
Admittedly, winter may not have been the best time to visit Northern Europe. But it’s sure put me off ever going again.
4. It’s pretty boring
The one attraction Copenhagen is known for — the Little Mermaid statue — can be better described as a dwarf-sized non-attraction. The airport has a replica anyway which saves you a disappointing trip, not to mention the huge queue of tourists lining up to take an underwhelming selfie. The only mildly interesting thing about it is that it gets decapitated every couple of years, undoubtedly by bored Danish teenagers.
5. There’s shit in the streets
Horse shit, mind. But shit nonetheless.
6. Christiania is a shithole
I imagined Christiania as a hippy haven and a street art photographer’s dream. How wrong I was. The ‘freetown’ is a total dump full of shifty characters in dire need of a bath and a haircut. Taking photos is also forbidden, which turned out not to be such a problem after all. Verdict: don’t waste your time.
It has a spiral ramp you can run down if you’re feeling energetic, and the roof offers panoramic views of Copenhagen’s splendour. Don’t all rush at once.
2. Frederik’s Church
It has a very impressive dome. And it’s a great place for a nap.
3. The coins
They have holes in, like the donuts you can’t afford.
4. Church of our Saviour
A lovely baroque church with some cool relics and a helix spire with an external winding staircase. 400 steps, 90 metres above street level — it’s probably the only time you’ll have an adrenaline rush in Copenhagen.
5. The Aquarium
Cool building, interesting marine species and, best of all, out of town.
6. The Copenhagen Card
Heads up: they rarely check the expiry date. Hello free attractions for 72 hours instead of the 48 we paid for, plus a free ride to the airport. Having said that, I would’ve happily paid good money to journey back to the airport and get the hell out of dodge.
Have you been to Copenhagen? Did you hate it as much as I did or am I missing something?

Here are a few of my thoughts on the city and the people:
As you walk around the city you start to realise that there are very few overweight people. Everyone seems healthy and happy and beautiful.
Then you also start to realise that there aren’t many fast-food outlets. And that people are riding bikes everywhere. I wonder if there’s any correlation…?
Hygge is a Danish word that’s defined as ‘…a quality of cosiness and comfortable conviviality that engenders a feeling of contentment or well-being (regarded as a defining characteristic of Danish culture).’
As well as being beautiful on the outside, Danish people seem to exude an inner peace and light. You can see it on their faces as they walk or cycle by; their faces look tranquil, content, at peace, full of self-confidence.

Copenhagen is an incredible food city — from three star meals to hot dog stands, there is something for everyone. I booked my recent trip to eat at Noma one more time before it closes, and I was thrilled to also get a chance to dine at Alchemist. In addition, we enjoyed delicious meals at Marv & Ben, Baest, Silbauers, and Doomsday Deli. The only meal we weren’t thrilled about was a lunch at Selma’s. Reviews of each meal are below.
In addition, our activity each day was to try bakeries and cafes in search of the city’s best pastries. My ranking of bakeries is summarized here. You can also read my trip report from 2021 here.

This 2nd blogpost of the series marks the next milestone in the collaboration between Dark Matter Labs and the Institute of Human Rights and Business (IHRB), to increase transparency regarding the largest urban landowners in four European cities (see: Blog 1 explaining the project purpose). This study mapped land ownership in Copenhagen (as of August, 2023) aiming to reveal the largest land owners, patterns in management of land, and resulting power dynamics in city space production.
Through these findings, we also suggest initial ways forward with regards to city space production and ownership transparency. We would love to hear your views.
Transparency is a cross-cutting human rights principle, which helps to strengthen decision-making to enable better outcomes for people. IHRB is partnering with Dark Matter Labs to identify the largest owners of urban land in four European cities, as part of its project Building for Today and the Future. This recognizes that knowledge of who owns space within a city is one important step (in tandem with many others) to strengthen decision-making, as well as social and environmental outcomes.
Copenhagen is known for its high quality of living, deeply rooted culture of public welfare and participation, resistance to speculative foreign investments as well as rich urban planning and architectural scene: it is often held up as an example of equitable space production and a “liveable” city. However, in the recent decades, the dismantling and restructuring of the Danish Welfare State and private-led urban development patterns have contributed to Copenhagen’s high levels of unaffordability, as well as spatial disparity and discrimination. Across Danish cities, the housing cost overburden (reflecting housing cost as a share in disposable income) is the second highest in Europe (see also the Right to Dwell — Un-liveability Trends, KADK 2018).
Housing in Europe: Housing cost overburden: cities or rural area - Compare your countryec.europa.eu
→ Data transparency and accessibility in Copenhagen set an example for other cities, as this information is relatively easy to access. However, from our research it is clear that, in contexts such as this, the understanding of the wider city political dynamics, institutional changes, and local actors’ strategic moves are as important, if not more, than the static accessible ownership data registers.
One might therefore want to call for an additional set of tools to increase the transparency and accountability for decision-making. Tools which unlock greater insights into areas such as:
As this might sound complex… the data, at least for Copenhagen, is largely there.
Accessibility to static datasets (or map interfaces — as the Little Mermaid fortunately resting on the municipal soil) sets a good ground for basic analysis of who owns what, which is still an impossible task in most cities.
However, extending the sensing infrastructures (civic and public) might render a possibility of updating the predominantly debt-driven land-value capture model → (see: OECD, 2022 & Cities for Free) to better serve the greater public and environmental good in the long-term.
1. The ten largest owners of land in Copenhagen, which include the municipality, City & Port Corporation (By & Havn I/S), and the public housing corporation FSB.
2. Three case studies, diving into the areas of Nordhavn, Lynetteholmen and Tingbjerg:
I. Municipal land
— land management with land-value capture model.
II. New land
— mega projects
C2. Lynetteholmen — New Municipal Land, Mega Projects & Potentials for City-Region Coordination Capacity: the planned mega project of Lynetteholmen (a 280-hectare, artificial island development ) points to city region coordination issues and the logic behind future city development pathways.
III. Non-profit land
— Commodification of non-profit land and housing
C3. Tingbjerg — Non-profit Land, Socio-economic Indicators & Fight for Space in a social housing area, pointing to approaches to vulnerable neighbourhoods in Denmark.
Concluding reflections
Methodology
1. Københavns Kommune — Copenhagen Municipality (KK)
2. By & Havn I/S — (City and Port Corporation — owned 95% by KK, 5% by the Danish State)
3. Den Danske Stat — Danish State
4. Banedanmark — Danish Railway
5. Bygningsstyrelsen — Danish Building & Property Agency
6. A/S Øresundsforbindelsen — owning land around the Øresund bridge and highways
7. Fsb — The largest public housing organization
8. Forsvaret og Forsvarsministeriets styrelser — The Ministry of Defence
9. Boligforeningen AAB — social housing organization
10. Samvirkende Boligselskaber (SAB) — Cooperative Housing Societies
Based on the case studies, examples of the most powerful land owning actors — defined as “needed in the room” to engage in an impactful discussion about shifting modes of Copenhagen’s development — include:
Note: further landowners can be easily identified based on available data sets.
In Dark Matter Labs, we often aim to design portfolios of strategic interventions as well as institutional capacities for democratization of common resources or civic & environmental good. Analogously, yet in contrast, in collaboration with IHRB, we looked at the set of policies, interventions & approaches that have defined urban land management in Copenhagen. Through this approach we can point towards a set of missing institutional and civic capacities required to update the way city space is produced in Copenhagen.
The purpose was not merely to complain or point fingers but to point towards a set of missing institutional and civic capacities necessary to update the way city space of Copenhagen is produced.
Nordhavn — the upscale neighbourhood in the northern part of the city is a flagship project of the City & Port corporation.
To further understand the reasons behind the push for developments described by many as risky, environmentally, and socially questionable one needs to zoom out and look at the Copenhagen Metropolitan Area as a whole, which includes 34 municipalities.
The famous Finger Plan once aimed to ensure the ecological diversity and functionality of the landscape by incorporated green belts with green wedges for recreational and environmental purposes, as well as a strategy for metropolitan expansion along 5 fingers in multiple municipalities. T he plan has been recognized as one of Europe’s best examples of far-sighted and long-term sustainable urban planning.
In 2015, the responsibility for the FP was handed over from the Ministry of Environment to the Ministry of Industry, Business and Financial Affairs, indicating economic growth as the main function of spatial planning . Apart from the city population growth and political pressures rooted in economic agendas, the green wedges and the structure of the Finger Plan have been challenged by the administrative division of power and interests of the neighbouring municipalities.
An emblematic example of the regional competition, rather than coordination in the Copenhagen Region can be another island development — Avedøre Holme, promoted by the Hvidovre Municipality, as Europe’s largest business district.
Some of the key reflections include:
Finally, several complex questions which require further consideration came out of this initial investigation:
In addition to relatively transparent ownership & transaction databases:
Responding to findings around Almene boliger / Tingbjerg
Reflecting on the dominance of land value capture logic
Some ways forward to explore — context specific (broked down above)
Further, basing on DML, UNDP collaboration “A way Forward”:
The data gathering, analysis and mapping was performed and revealed owners of all plots larger than 2,000 sqm. It was conducted through a combination of methods including data requests from Datafordeler, and sourcing data OIS, BBR and Dawa API. The data was analysed and visualized in GIS and Tableau.
The transparency and accessibility of ownership data can set an example for many cities around the world.

Posted: 4/26/24 | April 26th, 2024
A compact capital with more bikes than cars, Copenhagen is a lively, modern city perfect for weekend getaways.
Copenhagen is also considered one of the world’s happiest cities, boasting plenty of green space, cool museums, and a rambunctious nightlife. Famed for its cyclist-friendly streets, there’s not only more bikes than cars here, there’s actually more bikes than people!
I’ve been visiting the city on and off for over 16 years and always have a blast. The quality of life here is virtually unrivaled. And while the city is expensive, it’s definitely possible to visit without breaking the bank.
To help you plan your trip, here’s my list of the best hotels in Copenhagen:
This three-star hotel is situated right on the canal in the center of Indre By, the most picturesque area of town. The hotel comprises three historic buildings, with large and spacious rooms that are clean and comfortable. The décor is modern, though a little dated, and generally quite minimalist (don’t expect much art or color). The carpeted rooms include a flatscreen TV, a desk, wardrobe, and free Wi-Fi. There’s no coffee/tea maker in the room, but I appreciate that the lounge has free coffee and tea 24/7. The breakfast, while not included, is filling and has a lot of variety, though it’s mostly cold foods like pastries, cold cuts, and cereal. The bathrooms are a bit small, but they are clean and the showers have great water pressure.
While there’s no gym or other facilities on site, the hotel has larger rooms perfect for families or groups. And you really can’t beat the location. It’s an affordable, central, no-frills choice.
Book here!
Part of the former Carlsberg brewery, Otilia is a four-star property that has won several architecture awards for its transformation into a hotel. Located in Vesterbro, an area known for its excellent eateries and third-wave coffee shops, the standard rooms here are stylish but minimal, emphasizing contrasting light and dark tones. Rooms feature Wi-Fi, flatscreen TVs with Netflix, coffee/tea markers, and cozy chairs. If you’re on a budget and traveling solo, they have smaller rooms available too. The bathrooms have chic dark tile and include complimentary toiletries. I love that the bathroom floors are heated, so you stay nice and warm even in the winter. The shower pressure is great too, though just be aware that some rooms have open bathroom designs so privacy is limited.
Breakfast is filling and I especially like that it’s 100% organic. It’s served on the top floor so you can take in the view as you enjoy the fresh spread. Another nice touch is the daily happy hour with complimentary wine.
Book here!
This three-star hotel is just a short walk from the Central Station and the Tivoli Gardens amusement park. Located in trendy Vesterbro, the rooms here are compact but functional, with a cozy Danish-inspired design featuring taupe and sage-green walls along with hardwood or parquet floors. The simple rooms feature a flatscreen TV, a small desk, clothes rack, and free Wi-Fi. The bathrooms are also quite small, but the showers have decent water pressure. A tasty organic breakfast of fresh bread, fruit, and pastries is offered each morning too.
There’s also a chic lobby bar and a rooftop terrace to hang out on, complete with a bar and a sauna (you have to book and pay to use it though). The hotel was completely renovated in 2024 and is clean, comfortable, and perfect for budget travelers.
Book here!
This four-star hotel located in Nyhavn is in a historic transformer station, so the entire place has a chic industrial style. The lobby is especially striking; it’s over two stories high and features a huge 3D-printed sculpture. I like that there’s a cool cocktail bar here too.
The large rooms feature minimal décor and have big windows that let in a lot of natural light. Rooms include soft beds, air conditioning, a Bose sound system, a flatscreen TV, comfy armchairs, a minibar, kettle, and free Wi-Fi. The marble bathrooms are bright and roomy, with complimentary eco-friendly toiletries and excellent water pressure. The breakfast each morning has lots of options (including veg options), and can be ordered as a buffet, a la carte, or continental. There’s no gym or spa on-site, but with its central location, you can pretty much walk to all the main sights from here. It’s a stylish, central choice.
Book here!
Located in the diverse Nørrebro neighborhood, this three-star hotel sits in an ornate 19th-century building. The rooms here are airy and bright and let in a lot of natural light. The décor is minimalist, but the rooms feature bright carpet that really makes the space pop. Amenities include a flatscreen TV, work desk, minifridge, coffee/tea maker, and free Wi-Fi. The bathrooms are a little dated, but they have good water pressure and complimentary toiletries.
A fresh Danish breakfast is available each morning, and you can choose what you’d like to eat in advance (you order the night beforehand). I especially like that you get a bottle of water and a beer when you check in. There’s even a small rooftop terrace where you can hang out and enjoy the view over the city.
Book here!
If you really want to splash out, this five-star hotel is located in Copenhagen’s old Latin Quarter, just minutes away from the main shopping street. The stylish rooms are large and invite in a lot of natural light. They feature darker tones and lots of dark blue, which contrasts nicely with the wooden furniture and minimal artwork. The beds are big and comfy, and rooms include a flatscreen TV, desk, minibar, coffee/tea maker, and parquet or hardwood floors. The large bathrooms are bright and boast complimentary toiletries and plush bathrobes.
There’s a bar in the expansive lobby (the hotel even crafts its own gin), a fitness center on-site, and parking is available for anyone traveling with a car. The breakfast is especially tasty, with fresh waffles, eggs, pastries, fruit, granola, and more. If you want to splurge, stay here.
Book here!

Fermion Physics
The Copenhagen interpretation is one of the most popular interpretations of quantum mechanics, and it is the orthodoxy in physics. It is usually related to all the weird things about quantum mechanics you may have heard, like Schrodinger’s Cat. But what if I told you that the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics — is wrong? Here’s why
Before I write the rest of this article, I want to say that my beliefs here are not the orthodoxy in the physics world — most physicists believe the copenhagen interpretation and most of the rest don’t care. I’m not claiming to have made some new discovery. What I’m doing here is providing an argument against the Copenhagen interpretation. I’m not saying it is a complete fabrication. But what must be kept in mind is that most physicists believe the copenhagen interpretation simply because that is what is usually taught in universities. Many don’t really care to look for actual justifications or an alternative explanation. A majority of physicists agreeing does not make them correct, and it also does not make them wrong. Even though the measurement problem is not a settled issue, the arguments I present here will be as objective as possible and as reasonable as possible. If you disagree with any of my arguments, great! Tell me why I’m wrong in the comments. With all that said, let’s begin.
It would be great to start out by defining the copenhagen interpretation. The Copenhagen interpretation turns out to not be well defined, and there is many disagreement between self identified proponents, but the copenhagen interpretation could be summed up as
These are the postulates of the Copenhagen interpretation.
The way the copenhagen interpretation is formulated is already problematic. It does not define what a measurement is, it does not talk about the eigenvalue of a system before a measurement, and it does not say why the wave function is related to the probability density. It turns out that this is by design. The copenhagen interpretation is intentionally formulated to be vague, and to just describe what is measured. If a scientist walks into a lab, and does a measurement, the wave function will indeed tell the scientist how likely he will get that measurement. The copenhagen interpretation could be thought as the instructions a medicine container has. “Take 1 pill each day and your sore throat will be cleared.” These instructions do not tell you how the pill clears your throat, it does not say what the pill is doing inside your body, it just tells you what happens. The same thing happens with the copenhagen interpretation. It just tells you what you’re gonna (likely) get, and dodges all other questions. For many physicists, this is satisfactory. They have a theory that can predict stuff, so why will they care more about what’s going on beyond the math? I will respond to this point later, but right now I want to give more arguments about why the Copenhagen interpretation is wrong.
Like I said earlier, it doesn’t say what counts as a measurement. Does the measurer have to be conscious? Does the measurer play by the rules of quantum mechanics? Does the measurer have to be outside the system? It doesn’t answer these. Does the system before measurement even have an energy? It doesn’t answer this either. All it does is it tells you what you might get. Some people will try to answer these questions though and still claim they are copenhaganists. A common answer is that before measured, the system is in “all states at once” or “smeared out into a wave”. This is not the copenhagen interpretation; it’s an objectively false description of quantum mechanics that I debunked in this article.
Another statement is that the object does not have a definite value before measured. This statement, though not directly incorrect, is going a step further and talks about the actual nature of a particle before measurement. The copenhagen interpretation only talks about probabilities before measurement (states are probabilistic), not the status of a particle having a certain quality before measurement. So if that stance is taken, then it is no longer the copenhagen interpretation. That stance is also very problematic: If I never observe an atom decay, does that mean that it does not having a decay status at all (ex. it has neither decayed nor not decayed)? This statement is an oxymoron. An object can either decay, or not decay. This is one of the basic principles of logic: a is not “not a” by definition. Some people decide to bite the bullet, and accept that oxymorons can still be true. This is a philosophy called “trivialism”, which is a topic for next time.
A common belief among Copenhaganists is that the measurement devices have to be outside the system. This makes sense, since the opposite would apply that systems can measure themselves, which would imply that systems always exist as having definite eigenvalues since they are constantly measuring themselves. It is this element of the Copenhagen interpretation that destroys itself from the inside. What I want to stress is that what follows is not personal interpretation, but actual undisputed fact about quantum mechanics. When we have 1 particle in our system, the wave function is a function of that one particle: it maps the locations/momenta/energies of that particles into another dimension (the axis of the wave function). In other words, it is a function that maps one input to an output. For 2 particles, the wave function is a function of 2 particles. For 3 particles, the wave function is a function of 3 particles. You get the idea. What I’m describing here is what is called “configuration space”, the space that contains all possible configurations of a system. We can go higher and higher and higher. Quantum mechanics implies that there is a wave function that is a function of every single particle in the universe. Again, this isn’t an assumption or interpretation. It is just quantum mechanics itself: The wave function if a function of n-particles in an n+1 dimensional configuration space. Just replace n to the number of all particles. So now we know that there is a wavefunction of the universe. What does this mean under the Copenhagen interpretation? Well the Copenhagen interpretation requires the measurer to be outside the system, but the system in question is the universe! This means that for the wave function to collapse, then someone outside the universe would have to measure the universe — but wouldn’t this person also be a part of the system? So you’d need another person outside everything else in the system to measure the person inside the system, and you get an infinite regress. Unless you believe that there is someone outside the universe that is collapsing wave functions left and right, then this is huge trouble for copenhaganists. Again, what we did was just normal quantum mechanics. We showed that the Copenhagen interpretation cannot even reconcile with this without postulating an infinite regress of measurers outside of our universe. Now since we actually do measure things inside the universe, this is a direct contradiction of what is implied by the Copenhagen interpretation, making the copenhagen interpretation (the way it is usually presented), false. Someone could try to save copenhagen by saying that systems can measure themselves, but that would mean that a system will have a definite value prior to us measuring it (since it had already measured itself), which would be a hidden-variable theory — something many copenhaganists are against: you can’t have your measurement device and eat it too.
Some people say, “we shouldn’t ask about what happens before it was measured since we aren’t measuring it.” This statement is self defeating. Quantum mechanics talks about probabilities before measurement, so with the logic, the copenhagen interpretation shouldn’t be talked about at all — no quantum mechanics should be talked about at all. But the stance itself is one on quantum mechanics, so it is a self defeating point. This is somewhat analogous to what happened to philosophical logical positivism.
Some people simply don’t care: a usual statement they give is “well all the interpretations lead to the same results”. The people who genuinely believe this are a danger to the progression of physics. It is no secret that particle physics has been somewhat stagnant over recent years. And in my opinion, it is precisely because of people like this: the moderate. The moderate does not care about any deeper insight or intuition in what their mathematics describes. All they care about is performing a calculation. But physics isn’t just about performing calculations — it shouldn’t be just about calculations. Did Newton study the nature of light just to perform a calculation? Did Einstein theorize atoms just to perform a calculation? Did Georges Lemaitre, when he theorized the Big Bang, do so just to perform a calculation? The answer to all 3 of these, if you haven’t gotten it already, is no. These physicists did physics to better understand the world around them. They wanted to understand what made the universe tick. They wanted to fundamentally know the nature of material objects. All of these discoveries of course used calculations, and needed calculations, but calculations are what physicists use to guide them into understanding nature — they do not do calculations for the sake of calculations. One who only does physics for calculations is no different than a calculator; they do not need a job, because a calculator can do it for them — probably better. The reason as to why we do not have many “New Einsteins” or “New Diracs” is because many physicists of this modern age do not question the very meaning of the equations they write. They do not care to see beyond the math. They do not bother to ponder where the lure of physics is leading them — they only care about publishing that paper with some calculation. It was Galileo questioning the geocentric model that contributed to heliocentrism, it was Newton questioning the epicycles that gave us Newton’s laws of gravitation, it was Einstein questioning the works of Newton — looking deeper into the meaning behind the math — that gave us general relativity. It was even Einstein’s challenges towards the quantum mechanics orthodoxy that sparked even more interest in the subject, and an increase in much new exciting material like Bell’s Theorem and Entanglement that became something bigger than intended. All of this started with people looking beyond the math and asking: “what does this all really mean at a fundamental level?” If physics has lost people like that, then it has lost everything.

After I left Amsterdam, I traveled to the beautiful, and quite similar, city of Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark. This Scandinavian city located in between the Danish mainland of Jutland and Sweden is surrounded by the sea on three sides, giving Copenhagen some of the most splendid waterside views next to the many canals, harbors, wharfs, and rivers found throughout the city.
Copenhagen has become one of my favorite cities in Europe. I enjoy its relaxed atmosphere, its abundance of picturesque sights, and its friendly people. Denmark has often been ranked the happiest country in the world, and I can see why. In addition to having a beautiful capital city, the Danes take time to enjoy life, often lounging with friends next to the waterfront, having drinks together at a cozy bar, or cruising on yachts and sailboats. When I studied abroad in Hong Kong in the summer of 2016 (right before my freshman year of college), many of the students I met there were Danish, and I learned that Danes travel quite often and are encouraged to do so with lots of vacation days and financial sponsorship for university students. This societal emphasis on enjoying life makes the typical Dane a happy and amiable individual.
The Danish lifestyle also contributes to the well-being of its citizens. American-style fast food is rare here, and people often eat healthy meals sourced from the surrounding countryside and the sea…

Danish Lockdown Diary

The thing that struck me after my first few days in Copenhagen is that the city feels, at once, foreign and familiar. Familiar, not because I’d been before, but because it feels livable and relatable. Foreign, because it’s dissimilar enough to be interesting.
After spending a month digesting and absorbing life in the Danish capital, I’ve learned some of its norms, and more importantly, a few insights on what can help you feel a little more integrated as you’re settling into this fine city.
Getting Around: Biking is going to be your most efficient — and exhilarating — mode for getting around the city. Be mindful, however, of cycling etiquette and left-hand turns. Cyclists use hand signals here like they’re a new form of communication. Look for the upward raise of the left hand to signal one is stopping on the curb or shuffling to pedal up to make a left hand turn (what they call a box turn, or the “Copenhagen Left”). Refer to diagram below:
It’s super confusing until you do it.
Catching the train or metro from the airport is easy, and takes just 13 minutes to arrive in the city center. Uber is also available, though I’ve found their estimated arrival times to be consistently inconsistent, so if you’re in a rush, better to hail a cab.
Dining: The Danes eat well, and by well, I mean flavor-forward and nutrient dense. Decent attention is being paid to sourcing ecologically and locally, though farmers markets are hard to come by. The closest example is the stalls at Torvehallerne. A few chefs are working to change this, but en masse, it’s slow.
There’s no shortage of delicious smørrebrød. A couple of my favorite establishments include Aamanns and Schønnemann’s. Aamanns is a bit more progressive; Schønnemann’s more traditional. They have an incredibly diverse selection of snaps, which is the classic accompaniment to a Danish lunch of smørrebrød.
Christian Puglisi, one of the two most notable chefs in Copenhagen, owns an empire of four establishments: Relæ, Manfreds, Bæst, and Mirabelle, a bakery. His founding story between Relæe and Manfreds (originally published in Fool Magazine) is a fun one, and worth a read.
And delighting nearly every palate, former Noma chef Rosio Sanchez, originally from Chicago and with Mexican roots, is upping the global taco game with her handmade tortillas and house made cheese, made with Danish milk and cheese cultures shipped in from Mexico. Her tacos are ridiculously good and unique in flavor.
Move that body: While you’re loading up on all the carbs from rye bread (rugbrød) and beer (øl), think about taking a jog or a dip in the ocean at Kastrup Søbad.
The Danes love their exercise. Jogging around The Lakes is popular, as is through the public park, Superkilen.
Danish design: Danes love usefulness, clean lines, minimal pigment, and natural materials. From wooden countertops and bathroom paneling, to slate and tile floors, brick and stone, the home is an expression of the natural resources of the region. As it gets dark early in the evening in the winter months, you’ll find the custom of large, round, warm sailing lamps in many establishments, especially low-hanging to emphasize contrast and focus on the activity at hand. Candles burn nearly everywhere. They provide warmth and the symbolism of energy, when all the world outside is oft grey, damp, and moody.
Sights: Rundetårn is a remarkable monument to explore. The round tower, dating to the 17th century, was built as an astronomical observatory. Most notable is its equestrian staircase — and one of the best views above the city.
A visit to the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, just 30 minutes north of the city by train, is a must.
Fashion: In terms of fashion, CPH is the capital for the sharpest in Scandinavian style. Home to brands like Norse Projects, Wood Wood, Henrik Vibskov, Dansk, Libertine Libertine, Mads Nørgaard, Won Hundred, and Samsøe & Samsøe, it is the Scandinavian capital to compose your look.
Hay House is a perennial must for lifestyle house and writing wares.
Where to stay: Airbnb is a great option for longer-term housing. If you want a place to simply crash for a few nights in style, I recommend the newly-opened boutique hotel, SP34, from the Brochner Group. They have a strong pillow game, and all of their furniture is custom.
In terms of neighborhoods to call home in central Copenhagen, Vesterbro is up and coming. Quiet, mainly residential, it is home to the Meatpacking District with a small handful of restaurants, galleries, and clubs. Dyrehaven is popular among Danes and expats alike. There are also a few co-working spaces clustering and a burgeoning tech scene in this neighborhood.
Adjacent is the town of Frederiksburg. Technically it’s a town surrounded by Copenhagen, but it’s literally in the middle of the city. Today the neighborhood is primarily residential, though it is home to a few great cafés and green spaces. One of the notable boulevards for taking in the scenery is Frederiksberg Allé.
Nørrebro is my preferred neighborhood, primarily due to its proximity to Christian Puglisi’s empire (Bæst, Mirabelle, Relæ, Manfred’s), Superkilen and the famous cemetery Assistens Kirkegården, the center of the city, and one of the best bars — The Barking Dog (and its accompanying shop which sells rare liquors by the 100g).
You, of course, have the city center, Københaven K. Tons of shopping, cafés, cobblestone streets, and palaces. Lastly, a few small neighborhoods linger to the east, namely Christianshavn, which encompasses a few smaller neighborhoods, including the rapidly evolving area where the future Noma will be located.
With the grey, brisk autumn days, you might fancy a coffee to keep you warm and awake. I recommend Coffee Collective, Enghave Kaffe, Democratic Coffee, and Koppi.

Having experienced the issue of connecting someone only to later find out their real age, I’ve always been a fan of this a film, which is a nuanced take on romance that explores maturity, emotions, love, social norms, human dynamics, traumas, and human development. It borderlines on problematic and creepy, but carefully treads that path in an artful and truthful way.
The primary dynamic is the relationship of Effy, from Copehagen, and William, who is an American trying to locate his Danish grandfather, who we later learn was a Nazi and a bad father.
This film does an excellent job of making it difficult to first know Effy’s age. She smokes and is first introduced working at a hotel, which an American could easily attribute to someone older than 14.
Considering the actress who played her was 20 at the time of filming, the character is believable as possibly older, but the actress also does a great job of channeling younger mannerisms and making her age ambiguous.

Nordic countries have many gems waiting for a hungry explorer to discover. The places which surprise though often lie in unexpected corners — food stalls in Reffen or Broens Gadekøkken, offering a taste of home origins of generations who migrated to Denmark decades ago, or refined restaurants which skilfully combine cooking and tradition. There is much more than Noma, Geranium, or Jordnær. For example, Michelin-Green-Starred restaurant ARK is by far my favourite vegetarian destination in the world (and here I mean all 38 countries I have travelled to).
This article is divided into four sections:
Copenhagen breakfast options are poor. If pastry for a morning bite is not enough and you are the type who needs a fulfilling meal in the morning, I have bad news for you.
Quality = money formula is incorporated in The Sixteen Twelves and Riviera, but the rest of the places — Ø12, Sonny, Darcy’s Kaffe, Atelier September, or Wulff & Konstali — are somewhat overpriced, standard in taste, indecently simple eateries.
Let’s start with the places I can genuinely recommend.
The Sixteen Twelves must be squeezed in every tourist’s tight schedule! The cafe serves comfort food, but the savour combinations can surprise even the pickiest foodies! For example, stracciatella and pickled rhubarb, or turmeric pickled egg and goat cheese, or brioche with salted and roasted coconut…Yummy! The drinks vary from mango lassi to turmeric latte so make sure to try one of those.
The demand is ridiculously high, so I recommend arriving at the opening or during the week.
Summary:
🌱 A few vegetarian options.⭐ 4/5 for interesting taste combos and iconic turmeric egg.💸 €20–30/ person
Riviera offers granola, toasts, summer salad, scrambled eggs, and many traditional Danish pastries such as tebirkes (remonse bun with poppy seeds) or kardemummabullar (cardamon bun). It is just good for its price. Scandinavian spacious interior with wooden tables and chairs is warm and welcoming, and there is a terrace for all resistant to cold.
Summary:
🌱 Plenty of vegetarian options.⭐ 4/5 for good quality of morning meals.💸 €20–30/ person
A bustling spot called Ø12 won’t be a local’s first choice, but if one is on lookout for a homelike breakfast and coffee, Ø12 checks all the boxes. I usually take the pancakes with fresh berries and vanilla cream, but there are other options such as avocado on sourdough bread, Benedict eggs, or oatmeal. Fresh juices taste excellent and brewed coffee is good as well. The food won’t leave anyone on a cloud nine but should at least satisfy one’s hunger.
Summary:
🌱 A few vegetarian options.⭐ 3/5 for a regular breakfast.💸 €20–30/ person
Atelier September closes the breakfast list. The food is rather standard in taste, and the portions are on the smaller side. If you suddenly find yourself in the city center and crave a quick familiar bite, this will do. The breakfast covers all the popular positions: pancakes with berries, avocado toast, yogurt with granola, eggs on bread, and so on.
Summary:
🌱 A few vegetarian options.⭐ 3/5 for a regular breakfast.💸 €7–30/ person
Probably one of the top-three restaurants in the world I have been so far is ARK. Vegan to its core, distinguished with a Michelin Green Star, ARK served the hellishly delicious tasting menu with the dish I will probably never forget — a vegan version of Chawanmushi.
As per the authentic Nordic philosophy, the restaurant strives for sustainability, and in my humble opinion, they are doing an amazing job! ARK has its own fungi farm, serves natural wines and creates its magic using only local ingredients!
Along with mentioned above Chawanmushi where egg was replaced with asparagus foam, I savoured burnt cabbage leaves with tomato, camomile, and red wine infusion, caviar made of black garlic seeds, peas and beans with Koji sauce and elderflower vinegar, and the most surprising dessert I have ever eaten — carrot creme patissiere with carrot pieces, coco crisps and rice paper soaked in Calvados and dill oil. I think before, I had never imagined that dill and carrot flavours marry so well together.
Summary:
🌱 100% vegan.⭐ 5/5 for making vegan food perfect.💸 €175 for a menu without wine/ non-alcoholic pairing
Bistro Lupa is a more affordable sister of ARK. It is a vegan restaurant with a won’t-remember-the-next-day interior, but excellent service and tasting menu. I strongly encourage you to add a serving of Lupa’s mushrooms once you embark on a tasting journey. Same as ARK’s, the core idea of the bistro is to use every piece, slice and crumb of ingredients in the dishes it serves. Fruits, vegetables, flowers, and herbs are being served together and each of the products opens up differently, depending on the combination. The amount of food on the tasting menu feels just right and if one goes for a la carte, five dishes for two people is sufficient (plus a portion of milk buns).
Summary:
🌱 100% vegan.⭐ 5/5 for making vegan food perfect.💸 €70 for a menu without wine/ non-alcoholic pairing
Aamanns 1921 is on the pricier side and offers traditional Scandinavian open-faced sandwiches. I was happy enough to have the opportunity to try one of those considered that original recipes always taste either fish or meat.
Two smørrebrøds make a perfect portion for one, and I tried a vegetarian, and a fish option — only to realise that smørrebrød is just not my cup of tea. Aamanns 1921 is worth a try, however, if meat and fish is what you like, head to Restaurant Schønnemann (book in advance!).
Summary:
🌱 3 vegetarian smørrebrøds.⭐ 3/5 for vegetarian options.💸 €40–50 for two smørrebrøds and a glass of wine.
There are many pizza places like Pizzeria Luca or Corsa pizza, but I prefer a place with a more nonchalant vibe — Flere Fugle. It is located in the underground neighbourhood Nordvest, and makes a good stop for lunch before taking a stroll along the rapidly developing area. Flere Fugle offers excellent coffee, but if you want to make an adventure out of the regular lunch time, go for coffee to Kaffedepartementet, and take a look at the The Library at Rentemestervej — a book heaven for kids :)
Summary:
🌱 A few vegetarian options.⭐ 5/5 for the chill vibe.💸 €19–25 for a pizza.
It is difficult to find a bad bakery in Copenhagen (with one exception mentioned in the ‘Eateries which are not there yet’ section). My top pastry shops are probably Skt. Peders Bageri, Flere Fugle, and Riviera. Depends on the area I am in when the sugar craving hits. First one is a go-to for pistachio cruffins, and traditional Danish pastries, last two are responsible for aromatic cardamon buns which are my favourite among all the pastries.
The traditional, the oldest, the Danish one — Skt. Peders Bageri. After a long dispute with a friend we concluded that the cardamon rolls they make are the tastiest in Copenhagen. I can also justify why a pistachio cruffin magically appears in my beg every time I pass the bakery (look for those between 10–13 every day as after 13 they disappear quickly).
💸 €5 for a bun.
Riviera is another decent pastry shop. What is nice about the bakery is that it is very spacious, making it a cozy place for snack and some reading. It also offers breakfasts for those who become hungry once they smell coffee :)
💸 €5 for a bun.
If you are on the hunt for traditional Danish desserts, Conditori La Glace is the right place! A wide range of cakes, candies, desserts, cookies and an excellent tea collection make La Glace a lovely place to sit, reflect, read a book and enjoy the treat (works only if one arrives before the tourists pour in). I always take Kartoffelkager which is best of all (you can get one of those in Sweet Valentine in Torvehallerne as well).
💸 €11 for a slice of cake.
Juno the bakery is a very mainstream bakery, targeted at tourists. Their cardamon rolls are indeed delicious, but not exceptional or different from Skt. Peders Bageri, Riviera or Flere Fugle. If you are on a curious side and strolling around Østerbro — go for it, but consider the lines in the morning and during lunchtime.
💸 €5 is what you will pay for a bun.
The beloved Copenhagen spot Hart Bageri (there are few around the city) makes the best cheesecake in town (and no one can convince me that it’s not true). Their crispy sourdough bread makes an impression as well.
💸 €14 for a slice of cheesecake and a coffee.
Another must-visit bakery is Andersen Bakery. They make sweets, candies, and desserts of all possible kinds. Here you can also grab a sandwich and sip a coffee in the sun.
💸 €14 for a slice of cheesecake and a coffee.
This is the pastry shop I visit every time I am in Copenhagen. Small, cozy, Leckerbaer reminds me of a doll house with doll-like cookies. It is slightly overpriced but serves as an excellent present.
💸 €19 for an 8-cookie box.
I tried a 5-course menu in Høst in June 2024, and to my disappointment I liked only one of the dishes. Even the surprise treats which Høst generously brought didn’t convince me. The food tasted just fine but not enough for that price.
The beetroot with raspberries and goat cheese had an interesting crispy texture and was quite tasty but the rest disappeared from my taste buds’ memory as soon as I left the restaurant. Considering the opinions on the internet, their pescatarian or meat menu is much better, so if one doesn’t have any preferences, Høst might be considered a place worth trying.
Summary:
🌱 Vegetarian 3 or 5-course menu.⭐ 3/5 for nice treats along the meals.💸 €70 for a menu without wine/ non-alcoholic pairing
If I were to describe Theo in two words, they would be salty and hard. I tried a smaller dish, which were potato gnocchi, and a main course — agnolotti with zucchini, lemon, and riccota. Both were quite similar in taste, and so salty, that it was difficult to taste each of the meal components (I didn't feel the sage at all, even though it has a strong flavour).
Summary:
🌱 A few vegetarian options with one vegetarian main dish.⭐ 2/5 for vegetarian options.💸 €50–70 for a la carte lunch.
A place in Torvehallerne called Il_mattarello serves basic pasta made on spot. The word ‘basic’ perfectly describes the pasta’s flavour, and I can reassure you there are better bistros for a pasta or a quick lunch.
Summary:
🌱 One or two vegetarian pastas.⭐ 2/5 for making their own pasta.💸 €20 for a pasta
Mexican street food chain Hija de Sanchez might provide delicious tacos with pork but tacos with kale were far from good. And I am not talking kale here. The meal was extremely greasy, and oil was almost the only flavour on my tongue.
Summary:
🌱 Vegetarian tacos as the only option.⭐ 2/5 for trying.💸 €15 for a portion of three.
Regarding the bakeries I didn’t like. Albatross & Venner in Torvehallerne left me unimpressed. It is definitely not the place to look for Danish pastries.
Regarding the breakfast eateries I didn’t like. Sonny, Darcy’s Kaffe, and Wulff & Konstali are overpriced and not worth your time. The portions often aren’t big enough and should be called snacks instead.
I am always on the lookout for new places, so this story is being updated on a regular basis :)

Just a day after landing back in UK, I was going off to Copenhagen for the family trip! Mom was flying off in the morning due to her flight being booked way before mine, and it being Norwegian airlines. Thus, she left by 6.45am and landed in Copenhagen airport at around 1pm. We booked the Zleep Hotel Copenhagen Arena, which was about 2 metro stops away from the airport. She took the train from the airport to ørestad station, then walked a few minutes to the hotel. It was a budget hotel — no kettle, coffee maker etc, just a shower with a 2-in-1 shower gel/shampoo, and a little study desk by the side near the windows. Very sparse and minimalistic, but suitable for just an overnight stay.
My flight was with RyanAir at 1855, so right after I cooked lunch and did my last minute checks, I left for Victoria station, carrying my backpack and duffel bag. I packed dinner already, so I wouldn’t have to buy expensive airport food. I took the Victoria line to Tottenham Hale station, whereby I then took the Stansted Express to Stansted airport. It was a pretty long journey — 1.5hrs in total, but quite smooth. It was crowded, as expected, since it’s the summer holidays and people are just taking this opportunity to travel again. I reached the airport around 3.45pm, and started queuing for check-in. It was crazy crowded and the queue moved so slowly, since there were tons of people and families travelling. After an hour’s worth of queuing and holding my pee, I finally reached the counter to check in and print my boarding pass. Heng I could sneak in my duffel bag! :P I then proceeded to the security departure area, which again was crowded but managed to get through it in good time. I was done by 1705, so I headed to Joe & The Juice to grab a table and eat my dinner. After that, I waited at the sitting area to just while away my time till it was time for the gate to be announced.
I waited… and waited… and waited until 1830, and I got really worried then — the gate hasn’t been announced yet and it was almost flight time. I went to the information counter, and the girl informed us that the flight had been delayed to 2130! Holy shit, that was another 2 hours wait in that goddamned airport! I felt awful — I was still jetlagged and really tired by then, and was getting a little hungry too. Plus, it was so inconvenient to drink water cause I’d have to lug all my stuff with me every time I went to the toilet, so I tried not to drink too much but was really thirsty. I read my ebook, then watched 2 episodes of “The Office” to try and kill time while saving my phone batteries. Finally, they announced the gate at 2030, and I walked to gate 42. It was a full flight, and lots of people were also tired like me. I queued in the non-priority lane, and finally boarded at the front of the plane since my seat was 12C. We had to wait in the drizzling rain whilst they slowly got us from the airport building, along the tarmac and up into the plane. God, I was so tired. We only departed at around 10pm, and landed at 11.30pm. I slept for the whole flight, but was still tired anyway. I was supposed to make my way to the Zleep hotel myself like Mom did, but since my flight got delayed and it was midnight by the time I’d make it through immigration customs, Mom kindly waited for me at the airport. Good thing too — the metro stopped at midnight, and the trains would only come every hourly. Hence, after walking from T2 to the customs, we took a cab to the hotel. It was really expensive to take a cab — 200DKK which was around 40SGD. Jesus christ. Stuff here is crazy expensive. Anyway, once I got to the room 529, I dumped my stuff, took a shower and started charging my phones. Slept and woke up at 6am.
Woke up early, probably due to being slightly jetlagged. Did some stretching and stuff, then headed down with Mom for a cuppa tea and coffee for her. Their Rooibos tea was really nice — so I had a 2–3 cups of it. We then walked around the outside area, passing by Burger King and Fields (supposed to be the largest shopping mall), before Papa arrived at around 8+am where he would meet us at the hotel. After he dumped his stuff in the room, took a shower, we walked to the Orestad station and took the metro to Christianshavn station, then took bus 2A to the Refshaleøen (Refshalevej) area, whereby we would be able to find the Grønt Marked. Refshaleøen is an old industrial area, home to huge shipyards and wastewater treatment plants. The Grønt Marked is a non-profit farmers market organisation in Copenhagen, with small individual farmers selling home-grown, local, fresh and seasonal produce such as kale, tomatoes, berries and potatoes. They even sold honey schnapps! They appear in different parts of Copenhagen depending on which Sunday it is, so since we’re here on the 1st Sunday, it’s located at Refshaleøen, the original location of the market’s beginnings. There were a few other visitors as well, and lots of them were queueing up to buy food from Lille Bakery, which was located at the end of the market. Whilst Mom and Papa bought their breakfast pastries — mushroom roll, jam cookie, berliner (some kind of sugared donut), and black coffee — I went to buy my tomatoes and blackberries. We left by 10.30am to catch the 2A bus back to Christianhavn, and walked around the area. We strolled along the canal, seeing lots of yachts and boathouses, as well as stopping by the Bolia showroom. Bolia’s stuff is really nice — typical minimalistic yet beautiful Scandinavian style furniture and decor, lots of beige and earthy tones, wool and ceramic materials used. We walked until around 11.30pm, then slowly turned back to make our way back to the hotel to pick up our luggage and head for lunch at Ciao Pasta, which was located near our apartment. We decided to go for lunch first, since we could only check into the apartment at 1pm. However, by the time we took the train and walked to the apartment, it was already 1pm. It was located at Gasværksvej 11, Ground floor, København 1656. Kinda old looking and when we arrived the cleaning lady was still there. There were 3 separate bedrooms, 1 big open concept kitchen, a living room and 1 toilet to share. There were basic amenities like cooking utensils, cups and bowls, and a little utility closet off to the side of the kitchen (vacuum, more soap, random stuff all dumped there). In the toilet, it was really spartan looking — just 1 toilet right beside the sink, opposite was a Miel washing machine and dryer on top, the tiled shower on the right. We just dumped our stuff, then tried to figure out how to get the door key, cause I realised that we needed one to be able to get back in. We spent a good 10–15mins trying and calling for help, but no answer. Our saviour came in the form of an upstairs neighbour who heard our troubles, and solved the issue by figuring out that the key to the door was in the lockbox, and that the lockbox code wasn’t to unlock the door, which we had thought to be so. Thus, we were saved and could finally go for lunch. Well, more of Mom and I going and then Mom dabaoing back lunch, since Kai had landed and Papa wanted to meet him to make sure he got to the apartment cause Kai is useless that way. Mom got the meat lovers pasta for them and herself the veggie loves, whilst I had my special order of the ciao lovers pasta with garlic, chili and added vegetables. The pasta was tortellini with some truffle filling, but I mostly ate the filling and veg cause the pasta was too much. Papa of course was pissed off with the whole apartment, making the usual black face and cursing his head off. Mom of course, felt awful and tried to convince him to go to ah hotel instead, but alas, no. How unfortunate.
Anyway, after I finished lunch, I headed to the nearby supermarket, Superbrugsen, to get some body soap (apartment only had shampoo and bar soap), salad, yoghurt (they only had skyr but same same), and some strawberries. Made it back only by 3+pm, and boy did everyone’s faces look like shit. It was drizzling by then, so the cloudy weather didn’t make anything better. I ate some yoghurt and berries, then after resting a bit, decided to go out and explore some more. Might as well see as much as I could instead of wasting the time away cooped up in the apartment with angry men. I walked towards the Palads Cinema, which was really pink and blocky. The Palads Cinema first opened its doors to the public more than 100 years ago in 1912. At the time, it was located in the former central railway station which had ceased operation a year prior. The cinema was extensively renovated in 1955 and was further updated in the 1970s. In 1989 the cinema received its signature coat of paint which itself attracts thousands of visitors every year. I then walked past the Axel Towers, which was designed by Danish architect Lene Tranberg and opened in 2017. Very modern looking, consisting of five interconnected towers, the tallest of which reaches a height of 61 meters. Whilst walking along the streets, I noticed how clean they were, and also how few rubbish bins were out — it was like Japan where they expected you to keep your trash with you and not litter. There were also lots of Burger King’s and 7-Eleven — their 7-Eleven was very fancy, almost like an M&S in the train stations back in UK kind of fancy. I walked past a Warhammer store and an Animerch store too, which sold little anime trinkets like keychains and soft toys. There was a Hard Rock Cafe too, which was my toilet stop. After the Palads cinema, I passed by the Wallmans Cirkusbygingen, which hosted cabaret acts and dancing. I then proceeded onwards to the City Hall Square, aka Radhuspladsen, and saw the Copenhagen City Hall. Just a very grand looking building, first opened in 1905. t was designed by Danish architect Martin Nyrop who drew inspiration from Siena City Hall and put elements of the Italian style in a Danish context. I passed by the Tivoli Gardens, but didn’t go in since family wanted to go there tomorrow or after. As I walked along the streets of Indre By, there was a Mentos promotion going on, with sales people just giving out free mini bottles of Mentol chewing gum. After a few minutes walk — all of these destinations were within 10–15minutes walking distance of each other — I ended up at Nytorv and Gammeltorv, 2 adjoining squares in the city. Gammeltorv is the oldest square in Copenhagen, dating back to the city’s foundation in the 12th century. Its most distinguishable feature is the Caritas Fountain, the oldest fountain in Copenhagen. Nytorv was created by King Christian IV and is located just to the other side of the former city hall. This old city hall, however, burned down in 1795 and was rebuilt in a different location on Nytorv. I then walked to the Church of Our Lady (Vor Frue Kirke), the city’s most important church and also known as Copenhagen Cathedral. The original church was built soon after the city’s foundation in the 12th century, but fell victim to a devastating fire in the early 14th century. The building has Neo-Classical architecture, and the inside was a large vaulted domed ceiling with lots of columnades at its sides. It was quiet and peaceful, and the white colours of the inside was soothing to the eye. I left the church and walked towards the Round Tower (Rundetaarn). It was this really tall brick tower that was erected in the 17th century under Christian IV, and functions as an astronomical observatory. You could pay to go inside the tower and see stuff, but seeing how boring the brochure looked, plus with a time limit (I had a dinner booking at 1730, and it was already 1630), I decided to make a slow journey back in the drizzle. Yup, still drizzling and cloudy and windy. I passed by Skindergrade Gyde along the way back, which was just a bunch of colourful old looking houses. I made a short stop to see the nearby supermarket Irma, which was much closer to our apartment and sold the skyr yogurt which I’m eating here, Thise. I reached back by around 1715, dropped off my backpack and charged my phone, then headed out again with mom for my dinner booking at Maple Casual Dining. I had pre-ordered the chicken thighs with asparagus instead of the potatoes, and the chef made an alternative sauce of olive oil, herbs and sliced chili. Really tasty, though kind of oily. Oh well. I ordered an extra bowl of veg (broccolini, green beans and asparagus), and it was really good. Mom accompanied me by ordering their mixed berries Nordic sorbet, but the sorbet looked more like ice cream, and her dessert came with these cocoa looking cereal. Of course, to appease Mom, I went back and ate more yoghurt. They were heading out for dinner with Kit and Emily at some other Restaurant Puk at 1930, so left by 1900. I had my shower and then tea afterwards, and just chilled and wind down. Ah, so peaceful without the angry men. I wish they’d just go and stay at a hotel rather than try to live with this and make everyone unhappy. I’m just really sad Mom has to deal with all their unhappiness and cursing, despite planning everything as best she could and scrambling after the funeral happenings. Also, such a waste that she couldn’t come on my little exploration today to see the sights despite the cloudy weather, cause the next few days are forecast to be rainy as well.
After their dinner, Kit and Emily are coming to the apartment to eat durian, so there goes the post-dinner peace and quiet, plus having to smell durian the whole night probably. Also, with only a single toilet to share, one can only pray that Papa doesn’t clog the toilet and that the windows can air it out enough.
Woke up at 5am, then tried to sleep more till 5.15am but couldn’t so just got up and made tea. It was sort of light by then, and there were some people on the street. Alas, it was still drizzling a little bit, so I’m not sure what the plan is for today. Did my usual wake up warm-ups, and hydrated. The Jing green tea and black tea Mom gave me was kinda light, not very strong flavour — oh well. Anyway, Mom got up at around 6am, then after washing up, we re-explored the utilities room and found: body wash, more body wash, and a ton of bin bags. So we actually didn’t have to buy body soap yesterday… dang it. So we decided to use the body soap provided as hand soap instead in the toilet, and the little body wash bottles as hand soap in the kitchen. Yesterday night Kit and Emily didn’t come over for durian as they said they were too full from dinner, and would come over tonight instead. So while waiting for stuff to open, I decided to just read and then drink more water and tea before heading out.
Mom and I left around 7.30am to head out for our morning journey, since Kai and Papa were not up for it and still sleeping, respectively. We walked to the København H metro station, then took the M4 train to Marmorkirken stop. I bought my Copenhagen City card which allowed us to ride all the public transport and access all the different attractions/museums in the city for different duration of times — 48hrs, 96hrs, 120hrs etc. So after getting off at our stop, we actually realised that right outside the station was Frederik’s Church, aka the Marble Church. It’s best known for its outstanding rococo interiors and its striking dome which dominates the cityscape. It was drizzling and really windy, but still manageable. We walked past Khmer Cuisine, a SPAR grocery store, and even a Michelin/Chaine restaurant Bistro Boheme. On our way to the Kastellet, we walked past the Churchill park, then crossed the Kastellet Bridge to enter the area proper. Also known as the Citadel, it is a star-shaped fortress that was once a crucial part of the city’s defense system. Although it is still under the command of the Danish Armed Forces today, it is also a popular recreational space for the locals — there were still people jogging and walking their dogs, even in the grey weather! The barracks were a nice brick red colour. After that, we made our way to the Little Mermaid statue, and on the way saw the Søfartsmonumentet, which is a huge statue dedicated to civilian Danish sailors who have lost their lives during WWI. The Little Mermaid statue was kind of small, being only 1.25m tall and just parked right in the middle of the sea. It was unveiled on 23 August 1913, presented by Danish brewer Carl Jacobsen as a gift to the City of Copenhagen. The sculpture is made of bronze and granite, and inspired by the Hans Christian Andersen’s fairytale of the same name, “Den Lille Havfrue” (The Little Mermaid). Carl Jacobsen fell in love with the character after watching a ballet performance based on the fairytale at the Royal Danish Theatre, so much so that he commissioned the sculptor Edvard Eriksen to create the sculpture of the mermaid. Fun fact: Erikson’s wife, Eline Eriksen, actually posed for the statue! After that, we walked a little further to find the Gefion Fountain, which is a huge fountain donated to the city by the Carlsberg Foundation, depicting the Norse goddess Gefjon driving a wagon pulled by oxen. According to legend, it was Gefjon who plowed the Danish island of Zealand out of Sweden. The Swedish king Gylfe supposedly offered her as much land as she could plow out within a day and a night. In order to accomplish this crazy challenge, Gefjon transformed her sons into oxen, which are seen pulling the plow. Just off to the side is the St. Alban’s Church (English Church), which was currently under restoration works. It was built in the late 19th century in a distinct British Gothic Revival style (aka Victorian style). The church has served the British-Anglican community in Copenhagen ever since and is one of the few churches with services in English today. It’s quite a beautiful structure, just a shame that we couldn’t go inside today. Since we finished seeing the few main sites in the area — and all within an hour! — we decided to head back to the apartment. After taking the train back to the København H metro station, I bought a squash and some fresh tomatoes from the outside grocer. Mom went to the train station to buy some coffee and pastries for breakfast for her and the angry men from Lagkagehuset — 1 espresso, 1 cappuccino, 1 raspberry swirl, 1 chocolate cinnamon swirl, 1 bread thing and 1 almond croissant. We then walked back and got back around 9.30am. After that, it was kind of chill time till they finally decide what to do — mostly the plan is to do indoors stuff as it’s drizzly and gloomy weather. Anyway, there was a lot of mixed up planning for where to go and etc after they finished breakfast, and there was a scramble for me to book another lunch for 6 at 1230pm at Restaurant Havfruen, which I was going for lunch to at today.
Anyway, we ultimately decided to head to the Amalienborg Palace, which is the residence of the Danish royal family since the 18th Century, after the original residence of the royal family — Christianborg Palace — burned down. Parts of the palace are open to the public, while others are reserved exclusively for the royal family. Whether any of them are at home is indicated by the flags hoisted at the palace or the changing of the guards. It was really drizzly and windy when we headed out, and waiting for bus 23 was quite miserable as there was no shelter. We took the bus to the Odd Fellow Palæet stop, then walked a short distance to enter the Palace. We were in time for the changing of the guards too, which was like that in Buckingham Palace. After that, we went to see the inside of one of the buildings available for viewing, and it was quite a short tour — only 2 levels, and just some old furniture and paintings to see. The museum shop was also really small — I got a bunch of postcards and a diorama of the palace, whilst mom got a bunch of fridge magnets. After that, mom and I left first for lunch, which was booked at 1230, but by the time we walked there it was already 1pm. Kai and Papa would settle their own lunch and meet us back at the Frederik’s Church after lunch, where we would go inside to see the interior. On the way to Restaurant Havfruen, we passed by Nyhavn, which was just a row of colourful buildings located along the harbour. We passed by the Royal Danish Playhouse as well, which is this really modern blocky looking building. It’s a mix of brick, stainless steel and glass, with some parts of the building hovering over the water and supported by Venetian-style crooked columns. The restaurant was quite small, and packed. I had already pre-ordered my baked salmon with asparagus, whilst Mom had the fish and chips. The food came relatively fast, and just in time too, cause shortly after we ordered there came a big group of 12 angmohs, American I think from their accent. The food was quite delicious, and while waiting to be served, I ate my blackberries, strawberries and tomatoes. After we finished lunch, I was still a little hungry, and wanted to eat my yoghurt but alas, it was back at the apartment. We strolled back to the church, passing by a little souvenir shop where Mom bought more magnets. We waited for Kai and Papa inside the church, and they finally arrived at 2.35pm. After a short look inside, which wasn’t very impressive unfortunately, we took the metro back to our apartment. Kai and Papa decided to go see the War Museum, so thank god it was only Mom and I. We went back and I got to eat more yoghurt to fill up a little, then we took the bus to Strøget, which was their version of Orchard Road. Not very impressive — just small versions of branded shops like Gucci, LV, COS etc. We also went into their shopping mall, Illum, but also quite chiam lah. We walked on a little further, and saw the Helligaands Kirken on the way to the metro. We then dropped by Lidl for me to buy dinner vegetables — kale, zucchini, red onions and edamame. And we made it back just in time before the guys got back. Mom kindly helped me chop my stuff up and then we just boiled everything in a pot. Ate dinner around 6pm, then waited until they left before showering and having some tea. They had dinner at nearby Ristorante Buono, which I had actually looked up for food but they didn’t reply my email. I planned tomorrow’s activities with Mom before she left for dinner, so she could discuss it with the rest of them during dinnertime. At least by the time they left for dinner, it had stopped raining and seemed ok. They came back around 9pm, and then ate the durian that Papa brought. Emily seemed ok, and it was nice to chat with her again. We discussed tomorrow’s plan, which was thankfully free and easy, just to meet at 5.30pm at Noma. Then, lo and behold, the neighbours smelled the durian smell and reported it to the fire station as a suspected gas leak. So there came 2 firetrucks, and the firemen came into our flat to investigate a gas leak. My god. REAL FIREMEN! IN THEIR SUITS AND EVERYTHING WITH THE TRUCKS!
Holy jesus. They came into and out of the apartment several times, carrying their carbon monoxide detector and trying to find the source of the “leak”. Oh boy, was Kai so pissed off. Mom opened the windows to try and air the flat out so the scent wouldn’t linger, and bagged up the trash for disposal tomorrow. I’m not sure what time they left by, cause I went to sleep first.
Woke up at 5.40am, and surprisingly Papa was awake too — or maybe not so surprising, since he has jet lag too, and worse than us. the day is gloomy but dry, which is at least 1 blessing there. Had my usual tea, and just read and started to revise a little about my case discussion for the PEG interview with Papa. Sian — the more I revise, and when discussing with him, the more stress and worried I get. And this is in addition to the OSCE retake I have to also prepare for once I get back from Copenhagen. Stress, stress stress. Waiting for Mom to wake up before I can finally move out and start walking to Nyboder, which is a block of red, orange and yellow coloured buildings, and people still live there too! They once served as the homes of Danish sailors and their families, and were barracks under the command of the Danish Navy. Eventually, 8am came around and Mom still wasn’t awake, so I decided to head off first and let her sleep in. I changed and walked to Nyboder, taking a straight route through Strøget, seeing the different stores and eateries along the way. It wasn’t rainy but crazy gusty today, and the wind was so strong that you had moments of just standing still trying to keep upright. Along the way, I saw a few wall murals that were quite nice, but incomparable to those in Argentina. I saw the houses in Nyboder, and I guess they were quite pretty, but nothing very impressive. Walked till the end of the block, whereby I saw the statue of Christian IV. I also saw a Jewish church nearby. I then began walking towards the Botanical Gardens, and passed by the SMK Museum at the same time. The gloomy clouds were beginning to clear a little, such that there was some sunshine coming through — makes all the difference man. The garden was ok — I was never really into all the plants and stuff, and it was too early for the Palm house to be open (most things open at 10am here). Mom finally woke up by 9am, so she called and we agreed to meet at the gardens. After seeing some of the sights, we walked to the nearby Museum of Natural History, which was part of the University of Copenhagen, where they were showcasing two special exhibitions: Monkeys — A Primate Story and the Wildlife Photographer of The Year. They also had a mineral exhibition going on, but we skipped that cause it was just looking at rocks and stones. The photography exhibition had a few different categories to look at, and the showcase was for the year’s 100 best images. They were really beautiful and so HD to look at. It was quite a short exhibit, so we finished it pretty fast. We then went to the museum shop, where I got this hand-sewn lion plushie thing, whilst Mom got some mineral stones. Before heading to the Rosenberg castle, we stopped by at a nearby coffee shop, Espresso House, so that Mom could get herself some breakfast. She ordered a cappucino, and had a cinnamon roll and a cinnamon-cardamom bun to go. After that, we went to the Rosenberg Castle, built in the early 1600s and one of Christian IV’s architectural projects. The castle contains Denmark’s crown jewels, and outside was the King’s Garden (Kongens Have), which has been open to the public since 1770. We toured the whole castle, seeing the many paintings and furniture they had — they even had a fancy toilet that was all tiles! Lots of gold stuff, ivory dioramas and handicrafts, plus fancy weaponry like muskets that were inlaid with mother-of-pearl engravings and decorations. The basement levels housed the crown and the more precious items, but beyond that, that was it. So far, all the palaces are pretty ok, not as impressive as I’d thought they’d be. After that, we headed back to the apartment for lunchtime, or at least for my lunch. I stopped by the Coop 365 discount supermarket and bought 2 more boxes of strawberries (they were really sweet!), and a Skyr yoghurt cause I was running out. Cooked the same meal as last night’s dinner — onions, zucchini, squash, tomatoes, kale. Mom had 1/3 of her bun for lunch, as she wanted to save her stomach for tonight’s Noma dinner. Basically everyone but me was saving their stomach for Noma. We finished lunch around 2pm, then left around 30mins later to go to Nyhavn to walk a bit due to the good weather, which would eventually lead us to Kongens Nytorv.
We took the bus to Nyhavn, and it passed by the Royal Library (Det Kongelige Bibliotek), which is the national library and one of the largest libraries in the world. We also passed by BLOX, which is this really modern building that was recently built in 2018 and houses the Danish Architecture Center. Lots of glass and concrete, steel beams. Walking towards Kongens Nytorv, which is the largest square in Copenhagen, which was laid out in the 17th century by King Christian V. After its completion, several notable buildings were erected around the square. To the south lies the Royal Danish Theatre from 1874; to the east Charlottenborg Palace; to the west Hotel D’Angleterre and Magasin du Nord department store; and to the north Thott Palace. In the centre of the square is an equestrian statue of the king himself. After that, we walked towards Agnete and the Merman, which is a collection of bronze statues submerged in one of the city’s numerous canals. They depict a merman and his seven sons, urging his daughter Agnete to return to them. This was done by Danish sculptor Suste Bonnen, who was inspired by a traditional Danish folk story “Agnete og Havmanden”. When we went, it was barely visible in the waters, so I felt kind of cheated… Along the way, we passed by the Charlottenborg Palace, which was originally constructed in the 17th century as a city palace for the half-brother of King Christian V. Since 1754, it has served as the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, and also houses the art gallery Kunsthal Charlottenborg. The building boasts a Dutch Baroque style with Italian influences.
Our last stop before heading to Freetown Christiana was Holmens Bro — a bridge which is one of the 9 bridges connecting the island of Slotsholmen with the rest of Copenhagen. Nearby lies the Holmens Kirke (Church of Holmen), first built as an anchor forge in the 16th century but was converted into a church by King Christian IV in the early 17th century. We walked to Freetown Christiana, which is an autonomous district of Copenhagen that openly sells weed and cannabis. In 1971, a group of hippies broke down the barricades and began squatting there. Nowadays, approximately 900 people live in the area, comprising a community that has its own rules and regulations completely independent of the Danish government. They also have restaurants and cafes there, like the Sunshine bakery and Cafe Loppen. We walked around taking pictures of the colourful murals, but made sure to respect the online rule of not taking pictures of the drug dealers or anyone. When we were there, the scnet of weed as so strong — choking, almost. There was also a police raid happening at the same time, so we left to avoid any trouble. I wasn’t afraid per se, since it was still daylight and there were other tourists and families around, but definitely wary of the environment since it was drugs and weed all around. Nice murals, but Argentina’s are way more colourful and expressive. We backtracked to the entrance, then went to the nearby hotel for a toilet break before heading to Noma for dinner at 5pm. We actually passed by Kit and Emily on the way to the hotel, and they had just finished their canal tour and were going to see the Freetown now. We took the bus 2A to Margretheholm (Refshalevej) stop, and walked a little bit to reach Noma, which was recognisable by the bunch of greenhouses. There were other guests already there too, waiting for their dinner to begin. Papa and Kai had been there since around 4.30pm, and were just waiting for the rest of us to arrive. It was really windy out still, but at least sunny-ish. There was a greenhouse where they grew all their herbs and flowers, which would be harvested and used in tonight’s Vegetable Season dinner. After we all arrived, they brought us to our table and began the dinner — 12–13 dishes with 2 desserts, accompanied by a mix of non-alcoholic juices and tea (you could choose the alcoholic option too). It was beautiful and simple, and the tastes of the food prepared was exceptional. Small portions but very flavourful, lots of that tangy and sourish element incorporated into the dishes. They used a lot of fresh produce, such as oyster mushrooms, flowers, zucchini flowers. Each dish had a drink paired with it for either 1–2 courses. Dessert was a special “onigiri” — ice cream shaped into the triangular shape wrapped in a blueberry leather, and a dish of berries with this delicious almond-tasting sauce. Also, a piece of chocolate with a bunch of flowers on it. Yes, the first time in the past few years that I’ve decided to let myself eat dessert. Who cares about it tonight — Papa paid a hefty 700SGD for this, so I’m not gonna waste it. Plus, it’s a sign from Gonggong that the whole family was supposed to come for this dinner, so I will not let him down. I really enjoyed the dinner, and I think everyone else was impressed too. However, Kai and Kit were obviously still hungry, with Kai searching for dinner options to eat afterwards. But by the time we ended, it was already 9.30pm, so a lot of places have closed for the night except some burger places which Kai was too lazy to go and dabao from. After we finished dinner, we had some tea and then got the opportunity to tour the kitchen area. We got to see their fermenting area, which was like a science lab with some chim looking tools, and their huge buckets of kombucha and fermented items, like lupin and oyster mushroom fermented solutions. They cleaned up and closed shop by 9pm, with some of the staff sitting at the staff canteen polishing the silverware and tidying things up. During dinner, we discussed tomorrow’s plan, and eventually settled on leaving it free and easy again — Kit, Emily and Kai were planning to go to the aquarium in the morning, whilst Mom and I planned on seeing the Christianborg Palace in the morning, then afternoon going to see the SMK Art musem and Torvehallerne. We all took a cab back, as it was already dark out and got back to the apartment by 10pm. Kai didn’t want to go out to buy food, so decided to be hungry and sleep. Poor Kai, he should’ve eaten some lunch :/
Happy National Day! Can’t believe we’re celebrating it, or not really, here in Copenhagen with its gloomy skies and rainy days. Woke up at 5.30am as usual, but just a little tired, not too much. Did my usual warm up activities and tea, then did some Googling to see what could be open. Ultimately, I saw that the zoo was open at 9am, and was just a 30min walk from our apartment. So my plan was to go the nearby park at 8am, walk and chill until 9am, then see the zoo stuff till whatever time. I didn’t intend to eat lunch today, but an early dinner, so will just go straight from the zoo to the Glypotek museum, since Kit wanted to go there in the morning and meet Mom. Then, I probably will head to the Christianborg Palace, followed by the Medicine Museum and Design museum, seeing how the timing goes. We left for the Søndermarken shortly after 7.45am, taking a slow stroll in the drizzle and strong winds. The Søndermarken is one of Denmark’s oldest palace gardens, and is part of the gardens surrounding Frederiksberg Palace. At the end of the 18th century, Søndermarken was redesigned as a romantic landscape garden with meandering paths, allowing access to the Norwegian House, The Cisterns and the Chinese Pavilion. You could even get a view of the elephants in the Copenhagen Zoo! We walked along the paths and saw the Frederiksberg Palace, a yellow stately building, then continued onwards to the Chinese Pavilion. It was just a small little pavilion, quite cute. Mom realised her shoe was coming apart due to the rain, so we decided to go to a nearby cafe to warm up and rest a little. We walked out of the park and to a nearby cafe, Thiemers Kaffebar — very aesthetic and bookish, nice and small. Mom ordered a cappucino and ate a bit of her muffin thing from yesterday. We sat there for a while, then when it was around 8.50am, we left to take a slow walk to the Copenhagen zoo. It was pretty empty since we were the first few stragglers in at the moment of opening, and so we had free rein of the place. We decided to just make a loop around the area, and we managed to see the lions, tigers, elephants, penguins, seals etc. Most of the animals were hiding in shelter due to the crappy weather — poor guys, having to deal with this kind of climate. I saw a claw machine — 25DKK for a chance to win! The soft toys inside were monkey and tiger plushies, whereas the plushies in the out-of-order machine at the Elephant House had red pandas and elephants. Well, losers can’t be choosers! We didn’t have any coins with us, so I went to change a 100DKK into 20DKK coins to play. Upon my first try, I managed to get the claw to grab not only one, but two monkey plushies! :D First time I’ve ever been so lucky on the claw machine in my life! After that, we just finished up at the museum shop, and then left for the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek.
Mom had arranged for us to meet Kit and Emily there, but apparently Emily as busy working in the morning so they missed it completely. We took bus 7A from the Zoologisk Have stop to Hovedbanegården, Tivoli stop, then walked a little to reach the museum. The Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek is one of the most famous art museums in Copenhagen, primarily exhibiting sculpture from Ancient Rome, Greece and Egypt, in addition to showcasing a wide collection of Danish and French art. The founder is Carl Jacobsen. The permanent exhibitions were:
Then there were the special exhibits:
It was quite small for the special exhibits, and the other ones were just huge rooms full of sculptures and paintings, that my mind went numb after a few rooms. Nope, can’t do art for too long. I managed to finish it within 2 hours, and we actually met up with Kai and Papa there. The museum shop wasn’t very impressive too, so quite a letdown for Mom especially. Since I wasn’t having lunch with them, and wanted to go back for tea instead, I left first at around 12.05pm to take the bus back to our apartment. They would be having lunch at Restaurant Havfruen at Nyhavn, then I’m not sure what their afternoon plans are. For myself, I took the bus in the wrong direction for 1 stop, then swapped direction and got back by 1230pm. Had some warm tea and water, and updated the blog and read my emails.
After resting a little, I headed out to the Christianborg Palace. Unfortunately, it was still drizzling and cold, but whatever. Took the bus there and walked a little to enter the castle. Being blur, I queued up to go up and see the Tower, which would provide a view over Slotsholmen. I took the lift up to the top, but the view was ok, nothing special or wow. I guess the weather also kind of destroyed the opportunity to take a nice city view. After that, I found the right entrance to enter the palace, and toured the Royal Reception Rooms (Great Hall, Queen’s tapestries). The tapestries were really beautiful and vibrant, and it is said that these tapestries were made to mark the occasion of Her Majesty Queen Margrethe II’s 50th birthday in 1990, by ordering a gift of 11 tapestries. Bjørn Nørgaard painted the full-size sketches upon which the tapestries were woven, and they depict 1000 years of Danish history. I considered going to the ruins, but saw that it was a long queue, and it was almost 3pm. The Medicine museum closed at 4pm, so I took the M3/M4 to the Marmorkirken station and walked to the museum. It was quite small, and I finished it within 10 mins — nothing very good to see, all old stuff and quite terrible honestly. Along the way I passed by a 19th Century Russian Orthodox church, Skt Aleksander Nevskij Kirke, and a random small Roman church. A short walk away was the Design museum, and the queue was super long so I decided to just go to the gift shop and buy Mom a magnet. Mom they all met for lunch and had a seafood platter to share, but Kit and Emily left first cause they had a booking at the Rosenberg Castle. Mom, Papa and Kai then had dessert at the nearby Vaffelbageren Nyhavn, where they had churros with Bailey’s ice cream and some softserve too. They then walked along the Nyhavn canal and also to Strøget, before taking the bus back. I dropped by the 365 discount store near the Marmorkirken station, getting zucchini and pumpkin and skyr before heading back. So coincidentally, they got back just a few minutes before I did!
The moment I got back, I just dropped off my stuff and started prepping with Mom for dinner, eating my yoghurt and strawberries whilst waiting. I’m quite proud of myself for accomplishing so many destinations today, alone too! Of course, I wish Mom could’ve been there with me to see the sights, but oh well. Had dinner and finished by 1730, while everyone else went to nap before dinner. Tonight, they’re going to that Michelin place Bistro Boheme for a 1915 dinner. Hopefully it’s nice. Meanwhile, I will chill and slowly warm up at the apartment — I think I’ve done enough outdoor walking for today.
Man, I was really tired yesterday night — must be from all that walking, plus falling on my left knee yesterday at the zoo. I lay in bed just as they got home from dinner — Mom said the portions were good size, but food was so-so. Oh well. Usual wake up routine, and everyone else got up at around 7+am. We were going to the Kronborg castle this morning, to try and beat the hordes of tourists that would be sure to come later in the day. We would be meeting Kit and Emily at the Kobenhavn Hovedb. station and take the RE train to Helsingør station, where we would still have to walk a little bit to get to the castle itself. Today’s weather looks better — not raining, but still cool and windy. Fingers crossed it gets warmer and slightly sunnier as predicted by the weather report. We left by 8.30am to get to the station where we got the 8.42am train to Helsingør. It was around an hour’s journey there, and not much to see along the way. Kai was rather unhappy at the rush, cause he didn’t manage to get his breakfast. When we reached, it was kind of gloomy, and I found a cafe for Kai to get some food in before we went to the castle. The nearby Cafe Karisma was very quaint and nice, very coffeeshop vibes — Papa had an apple pie and hot chocolate with whipped cream, Kai had the spicy chicken sandwich and a cuppacino. We decided to wait for Kit and Emily at the cafe and then together we go to the castle. Whilst they were eating their breakfast, I decided to walk around the old town streets of Helsingør, seeing a few of the sights. It began to drizzle a little whilst I was walking the streets.
The first stop I had was to see St. Olaf’s Church, which was situated on the same spot where the city’s first church was built over 800 years ago. St. Olaf’s Church got its present look back in 1559, and it could therefore celebrate its 450th anniversary in 2009. The oldest parts of the church wall, however, are from the 13th century. The first church was established here on what was once the beach of the castle at the time, Drekrog, before Kronborg was built over it. The church takes its name from its guardian saint, the Norwegian Viking king and national saint, Olaf the Holy, who managed to both unify and Christianise Norway. When Erik of Pomerania began collecting the Sound Dues, St. Olaf’s Church underwent a transformation. The church had to keep up with Elsinore’s growing importance for the country, and it was therefore expanded several times. Since 1961, St. Olaf’s Church has formally become a cathedral, due to the fact that northern Zealand became an independent diocese. On the east gable of the church one can see a door leading to a burial vault. Above it, there is seen a skull and crossbones, the symbol of death. The French inscription reads: Thus do we all become. Inside the church, the interior is dominated by an 11.5-metre tall altarpiece from 1664. The altarpiece is constructed of 19 reliefs, depicting the life of Jesus Christ. There is also a treasure trove of Renaissance and Baroque art, such as the pulpit, from the year 1567. There is a yellow house, which lies on Sct. Annagade 6, that faces the church with a large mural — this was the childhood home of the composer Diderik Buxtehude (1637–1707). In the years 1660–1668, he was the organist at the Church of St.Mary, and he was known as one of the 17th century’s most important composers, inspiring famous composers such as Johan Sebastian Bach and Georg Friedrich Handel. The paintings on the gable across from Buxthehude’s house in Sct. Annagade depict the era of the Sound Dues. They show the cosmopolitan rich and very vibrant mercantile town, which for over 400 years profited greatly off the many ships that had to stop and pay the Sound dues. Along a small side street was GI Færgestræde, a very aesthetic cobblestone alleyway.
The second church I saw was St. Mary’s Church and the Carmelite Priory. St. Mary’s Church, together with the Carmelite Priory, is one of Northern Europe’s best preserved priories from the Middle Ages. The priory was founded in 1430, shortly after the introduction of the Sound Dues, when Erik of Pomerania invited the Carmelite monks, the so-called Whitefriars, to Elsinore. The church and priory were completed in their present form around the year 1500. After the Reformation, the priory was converted to a hospital in 1541. The priory also housed Elsinore’s grammar school, and in the 1800s it was a retirement home for those deemed in worthy need. Inside the church the floor is covered in numerous, partly worn down gravestones, which originate from the time where it was possible for wealthy citizens to buy a burial site in the church. The church’s prestigious chalk murals were made from 1440–1500. A main attraction is the church organ which was put there in 1662–63 — this was the same organ that Diderik Buxtehude used while he was the church organist. Following the Protestant Reformation, the church was intially desolate, but was later used as a stable for traveller’s horses. It was on the brink of being torn down, but due to the many foreigners in the city, Frederick I gave it to the German and Dutch congregation. From 1576, sermons were performed exclusively in German. In 1851, the German sermons were halted, but the many German inscriptions still bear witness to the long period where it served as a German church.
I also managed to find a few different murals that were painted on the sides of the buildings: Soul of the Walls; the Middle Ages and the Sound Dues; History of the Churches; and the Maritime History. Very beautiful, colourful large murals. There was also a side street, Stengade 64–76, which has a row of beautiful 16th-century stone houses part of the Sound Dues residences. They are merchant houses from a time when Elsinore was flush with the profits of international trade. By 1426, Erik of Pomerania had given the city certain special mercantile privileges, and for a time Elsinore was Denmark’s second largest city. Erik of Pomerania had pushed for the development of the city by ordering its citizens to “build your city, increase its size and improve it with good merchant houses.” To encourage this, the King tempted the residents with tax cuts: If you built your house out of stone, you would not have to pay taxes for 10 years. (Those who built their houses out of wood only had five years without taxation!) The houses were built concurrently with King Frederick lI’s construction of Kronborg. It is obvious that the houses were built with the assistance of the same foreign craftsmen that were building for the King. The buildings in Stengade 72 and 74 are called “Leyel’s Houses.” For a number of years, they were owned by the Leyel family, an aristocratic bloodline of Scottish descent who came to be very influential in the city. For the house in no. 72, the windows are encased in stone, whilst no. 74 has a stepped gable. Across the front of the building there is a band of limestone with Gothic writing, and upon it there is written in Latin: “For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth. And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.” The horizontal bands were made during the Renaissance. In no. 76, it is the house of customs officer David Hansen. The property is one of the oldest pre-served private residences in Elsinore, built in 1579. The front of the building features bands of sandstone, and it is richly decorated. Above the windows, one can see a row of small busts. Two of the busts, made as portraits of a man and a woman, wear outfits from the time of Frederick II.
I then backtracked as it was around 10.30am, and after a quick toilet break, we walked to the Kronborg Castle. It was a short distance away, and thankfully the large tour groups hadn’t come yet. Kronborg Castle (aka Hamlet’s Castle) was the actual site that Shakespeare set Hamlet in — so you could see lots of Hamlet inspired souvenirs, and also staff doing tours in Hamlet outfits. Kronborg Castle has existed at Helsingør (Elsinore) since 1420. It’s been burned to the ground and rebuilt since, but always maintained its vital position at the head of the Øresund Sound. Ships passing into the Baltic Sea paid tolls at Kronborg Castle,and Helsingør was once one of the most important towns in Europe. In 2000, Kronborg Castle became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was quite nice, with the usual moat and large imposing walls. After touring the inside of the castle, which just showed some rooms and tapestries, I went to climb the Cannon Tower — 145 curving steps up to the top, and you got a pretty good view of the harbour. Gloomy day though, so the view wasn’t so breathtaking. After that, I explored the Casemates, which were the castle’s underground system of corridors and rooms. It was so dark and cramped, and I had to stoop many times to make my way through the tunnels, and at times having to use my flashlight just to light my way. I can only imagine how shitty and creepy it is at night… Oh boy. After seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, I regrouped with the rest of the family (they stayed for the short tour of the castle), and I went with Mom to see the chapel. Then, because I wanted to go off and see more stuff, knowing how slow the rest of them are, I left first. I went to the see their exhibition on “Monsters — Beastly beings with big emotions”. It was about monsters of the past, such as the basilisk, Kraken, with these monsters recreated from recycled materials by artist Shane Brox. His inspiration for this exhibition was human emotions — how everyone can feel and be a monster in their lives. He wanted to start a conversation about emotions in a fun and exciting way, because making the emotions visual through the monsters provide a creative and interactive way to explore this topic. It was quite a short exhibit, and the monsters were very cute. The souvenir shop sold these monster plushies, but they were unfortunately really expensive. Instead, I got myself this Kronborg castle coin. Before leaving the castle, I went up to see the flag bastion, which also provided a view of the sound. I finished everything by around 12pm, then walked to see the Museet for Sofart, or the Maritime Museum of Denmark, since it was just outside the castle. It was all about the shipping industry and history in early Denmark, and it also had on a special exhibition on the Haenyeo divers, showcasing photos and telling their stories. It was quite short and sweet, and I finished within 30mins. After that, I walked to see the Han statue (Han af elmgreen og dragset), this metallic sculpture of some guy on a rock. Then, I walked a little bit further to see the Dancer’s Fountain (Danserindebrønden af Rudolph Tegner), before heading back to the station to catch the RE train at 1303 back to Kobenhavn Hovedb. station. Mom and Kit they all had a light lunch at Helsingør, before taking the 1418 train back. The moment I got back, I went to the apartment and ate my strawberries and skyr with nuts for lunch. After resting a little and charging my phone, I planned to meet Mom directly at Torvehallerne. Torvehallerne is a food market selling fresh produce and fish, in addition to little stalls selling a variety of foods — smørrebrøds, pastries, empanadas, ice cream and more. I bought a few cherry tomatoes from the Torvehallernes Frugt & Grønt, which was located between the two glass halls — it sold such a wide variety of fruits and vegetables — tomatoes, purple carrots and cabbage, apricots, pumpkins — everything so beautiful and vibrant and FRESH! I wish I could’ve bought one of each to try… ah well. Mom bought the classic Danish treat flødeboller, which is a chocolate-covered cream balls topped with different stuff like pistachio, almonds, marzipan, from the famous stall Summerbird. It was packed with people, and just amazing to see the huge variety of foods available. By then, the gloomy weather had cleared and it was nice and cool, with some sunshine. We visited the nearby Flying Tiger shop, then walked to SMK, the National Gallery of Denmark. The National Gallery of Denmark (Statens Museum for Kunst) features Danish and international art from the past seven centuries. It features art from past and present Danish paintings and sculptures, French art, European art, as well as a special exhibit on Baroque art. Pretty nice, but too much art for my brain to handle. We finished it all within an hour, and then went back to the apartment to cook dinner. Initially, Mom told me she would have dinner with me, but as expected, she didn’t keep her word. She wasn’t willing to buy something back to eat with my cooked dinner, so I just told her to go eat with the guys at the Japanese restaurant they booked, Tokyo Restaurant. Ah well, what’s new there, right? At least she helped to cut and wash up I guess. Whilst the dinner was cooking, I made a quick trip down to Irma to buy another tub of Skyr, just to appease Mom that I was eating more food though I already ate at least 1kg worth of Skyr for lunch. Ah well, let’s hope I don’t get too fat then.
Quite happy with all the sights I managed to see today — basically everything that’s on my list and more, so that’s great. Tomorrow I plan to walk around in the morning until the Round Tower opens at 10am, then head to Tivoli to finally ride the rides and see it at 11am. Head for lunch, then see what else I can fill in the afternoon with.
Woke up at 6am, and surprised I managed to get a decent amount of sleep with the noise that was happening upstairs. Don’t know what they’re doing, but there was a lot of loud thumping noises and music too. Today’s weather looks good, as it is partially sunny and bright, so I think a good amount of walking is in order since its a rare decent weather. I found a few smorgesbrod places, since that’s something I haven’t tried and Mom too, and I think the best options are still at Tolverhavernne. But I also located a Vietnamese spring roll place, so I might go there after the bread, and then to La Galette for the buckwheat galettes and sweet crepes for the rest of them. After Mom woke up and had her coffee, I told her the plan and then got ready to leave. Papa wanted to come with us this morning, and as Kai was still sleeping, we decided to just let him be and inform him via Whatsapp that we were out. I was fine with Papa coming along, but made it clear to him that Mom and I would keep walking on first, and he could take his time to take his pictures. I decided to walk towards Vestre Kirkegård, where there was supposed to be a park. Along the way, there were some pretty nice murals to see — one of the wall murals was 85 years old, as we were kindly informed by this old gentleman. We also entered the Christ Church (Kristkirken), and it was a nice old church. We didn’t exactly reach the park, as it was almost 9am by then, and I had planned to go to the Planetarium before the Round Tower. Emily messaged me, and we decided to meet up at 10.20am at the Round Tower to go up together. So Mom and I backtracked to the Planetarium, which opened at 9.30am and saw the very very short exhibition on the Cosmos (about the Big Bang theory, stars, black holes), seeing a real moon rock and a very artsy exhibit on the Rings of Saturn. The museum shop was small, and they were selling popcorn which smelled so good. After that, we took the M3/M4 to Nørreport station, where we dropped by the Taffelbay bakery for Mom to get some breakfast — she got 3 small things to eat (almond florentine, like a little tart; a Berlinervaffel, looks like a dacquoise with a crunchy nut base and filled with mocha cream; and a Limonetti, a light Italian wreath cake with lemon zest) plus a cappucino. After sitting a while, we made our way to the Round Tower, passing by Normal and some lifestyle shop that looked like a Scandinavian version of Muji (we visited after the Round Tower). We met Emily, Papa and Kai there, and went up the tower together. There were just a few things to see, with the ultimate conclusion at the tower top where you could get a 360 view of the cityscape. There was also an exhibit on Meisen Kimono. The meisen kimono became popular in Japan in the first half of the 20th century. This happened after a cultural and technological exchange between Japan and the West made it possible to manufacture kimonos at lower costs than previously, when the silk kimono was preserved for the upper classes. Now, ordinary Japanese people were able to buy fashionable silk kimonos in bold new designs inspired by European art. Over the past 30 years, Danish artist and textile designer Henriette Fris has built up an impressive private collection of these kimonos. Her interest in kimonos was sparked when she was taught by a Japanese silk painter. Since then, she has collected over 100 unique and hand-sewn kimonos dating back to the heyday of the Meisen kimono between 1910 and 1955. During this period, Western art movements such as Art Nouveau, Art Deco, De Stijl and Cubism had a strong influence on Japanese artists’ kimono designs, and these kimonos later re-inspired Western textile design. The exhibition showcases long and short kimonos from Henriette Fris’ private collection. They sold some Japanese crafts like the cat and tote bags featuring the corgi and Japanese landscapes, but crazy expensive. After finishing the tower, Mom and I went to see Tivoli Amusement Park and the Tivoli gardens, passing through Jorck’s Passage. Along the way, we passed by the Frue Plads Marked, a 3-day craft fair that was occurring from the 10th- 11th Aug. It was full of people milling around the various artisan craft stalls, with most stalls selling ceramic handicrafts like cups, plates, and decorative vases. They were all so beautiful to look at, and the minimalistic designs and muted palettes were just so aesthetically pleasing. I wish I could buy a few of the pieces to bring back, but they were crazy expensive. There were a few stores also selling wool clothing and leather items, but mostly ceramic items. Mom and I decided to get a souvenir from the fair, this chameleon looking thing by a female artist — Mom got a vase and I got the chameleon thing itself. Though it was expensive, I decided it was worth the cost as I “made it up” from not going out for meals, plus I definitely did not intend to come back to Copenhagen again. Nope, just not appealing enough unlike Japan or Italy. By then, the sky had turned really gloomy and grey again, and we decided to drop off our stuff at the apartment first and refill water before heading to Tivoli. When we reached, it was packed like sardines, as by the time we arrived it was 11.30am. We managed to skip the queue with our Copenhagen card, but the card only guaranteed us a free entrance but not free access to the rides, where you had to pay 50–90DKK per ride. Nope. So we just walked around the fairgrounds and looked at the rides, seeing the very pathetic Tivoli aquarium, and generally just being disappointed by the whole thing. I believe it’s been overly hyped up, and that in reality it was just another amusement park, and not even as good as Disney World/Sea Japan. Oh boy, will Papa be disappointed. Anyway, we finished walking around, then took the train to Nørreport station to meet everyone else at Tolverhavernne Food Hall for lunch. We got there around 1310, and found Kai and Emily walking around, whilst Papa went to find a seat. Mom queued up a long time for the Hallernes Smørrebrød, getting the chicken salad (homemade chicken salad, bacon, and chervil), Danish meatball (meatball made with pork and veal, homemade potato salad, and thyme), Fish cake (fish cake made with cod, served with dill mayonnaise and hand-peeled shrimps) and I think the last one was Roast pork (roast pork with crispy crackling, homemade pickled red cabbage, and cucumber salad). Emily bought a hotdog thing to share, which Papa ended up eating the whole thing plus a Smørrebrød; Kai also got a hotdog too. Emily also bought cherries, figs, white and black cranberries to share, but ended up bringing back the cranberries cause it wasn’t popular. I got smørrebrød from Rørt: “leftovers” which was organic up-cycled vegetables from MATR, mushrooms, Jerusalem artichoke mayo, pickled cabbage and fried buckwheat on toasted rye; and their “Green Crush” which was smashed avocado, tomato relish, chili and coriander on toasted rye. After walking to find Papa, I finally settled to eat my first ever smørrebrød and it was DELICIOUS! My god, I loved the umami taste of it all, and just so creamy and tasty wow. Emily also got a green apple gelato since Papa ate her hotdog. Oh, I also got my purple carrot for dinner, and Kai bought chocolates for Heidi. After we finished up, we walked a short distance to La Galette, a French restaurant that is inspired by the Asterix French cartoon character. They served a variety of savoury buckwheat pancakes as well as sweet crepes — I ordered the Asterix (ratatouille, egg and chives), whilst Papa had the egg, bacon and ham one, Emily ordered the Confiture (sweet with black currant jam) and Mom had the Crêpe flambée (with banana and Grand Marnier). Mom got twice the dose of alcohol as the guy’s lighter didn’t work the first time round, so he came back with a fresh cup of alcohol to light up. It was really tasty and light, not heavy at all or overly salty. I really liked it, and am glad I decided to go for it today and not miss out. After we finished, Mom and I headed back to let me eat some yoghurt and strawberries, whilst the rest of them went to the aquarium. Kit unfortunately was feeling feverish this morning, so missed out the whole day’s outing, but thankfully was feeling better by lunchtime so would join for dinner. After yoghurt, Mom and I went to the Christianborg Palace, as Mom wanted to see the tapestries. I went with her to finish my tour of the place, seeing the ruins (just a bunch of rocks) and the kitchens (very boring). I bought Mom a magnet of the palace, and after that we departed back for the apartment. Papa was back before us, and that was cause he was tired and also Kai messed up. Apparently, he went to the wrong aquarium which wasn’t covered by the Copenhagen card, and entry was 120DKK. Papa didn’t want to pay entry, so left first. Oh well. I realised that Kai’s been creating a lot of negative energy this whole trip, making snide remarks about Kit to Emily, or making Kit seem like such a lazy shit who got lucky in life. He doesn’t even consider the fact that it may be embarrassing Kit or even Emily, and that maybe Kit actually is jealous of Kai being able to be a doctor. Jesus Christ. Anyway, got back and cooked dinner, finishing up my Thise skyr and feeling sad when I finished it cause I just wanted to keep eating more… oh well. Mom they all were going to El Meson for dinner, a Spanish tapas place. Hopefully the food is good, and no more food poisoning for tomorrow we’re all flying back. Papa’s flight was at 11am so he would set out first, while Mom, Kai and I would go to the airport later as our flights were around 2pm. I pray that Ryanair doesn’t delay the flights again, if not I’ll be so pissed. Really happy and proud of myself for eating the lunch out today and not caring about the salt/sugar content, but just embracing the delicious foods as is. I guess I knew that I would go back to eating a salt-free diet from tomorrow onwards again, and never intend to come back to Copenhagen, so 1 meal won’t kill me. And maybe it’ll actually help heal me. Oh yes, also am very surprised by how trusting the Danish people are — they just leave their bikes unlocked, supermarkets leave produce outside with no cameras or security guards watching. And their MRT station also uses a tap-in/out card that not everyone has to use, with no one really checking. Gosh.
Ah, last morning here in Copenhagen before heading back to the awful reality of life in the UK and school and OSCE retakes and PEG. Woke up at 6.30am, then did the usual warm up and tea time. Papa was up already cause his flight was at 11+am, so planned to leave the flat by 9.30am. Last night’s dinner was so-so according to Mom — they had meatballs, sausage, Iberico ham, paella etc. They wanted the grilled lambchops but they ran out! Anyway, they got back at midnight, as after dinner they went to Tivoli to see the lights. Mom said that all the rides were closed already, and they actually see Rick Astley performing live! Oh man, what a treat it would’ve been. Anyway, packed all the stuff to let Mom bring back on my behalf, and then I changed and left by 7.30am for Juno Bakery. Apparently, it was a really really famous and good bakery as it was opened by former cook of Noma, Emil Glaser. Their cardamom rolls are the most famous, and so I decided to try and get it for breakfast for Mom, Papa and Kai. The bakery was located at Århusgade, and I decided to talk a nice morning walk along the Peblinge Sø, which is like a river, and along the way saw some murals and this island of birds (Fugleøen, on Google Maps). The walk was nice and peaceful, and today was much warmer than usual despite it being cloudy. Lots of people out running and cycling, and the streets were quiet with few cars. By the time I reached the bakery, it was a really long queue. Suddenly, Mom told me that she wanted us all to leave at the same time as Papa, so I very stressed to get back on time. I queued, and bought 3 cardamom buns, 2 pistachio and 2 almond danish. I then chionged back for the flat, taking the M4 from Nordhavn station back to Kobehavn. Speed-walked back to the flat, and managed to get there by 9.30am for Papa and Mom to have a whole bun for themselves, fresh and hot (well, lukewarm). They really liked it, saying the pastry was soft and delicious. :D
After that, we took the train to the Copenhagen airport, and checked in. No queue for Papa’s business class, but a small queue for my Ryanair flight. Thankfully we reached by 10.30am, so hardly anyone there yet. Got my boarding pass and then proceeded through security. Kai was grumpy as shit, having to suddenly rush at the sudden change of plans and not being able to have a proper slow, sit-down breakfast. Oh well. After passing through security, the duty free shops and other shops inside the airport were pretty nice. I just walked around a little while waiting for Mom and Kai to pass through, and after a while managed to meet up with Kit and Emily. They had lunch at Yo! Sushi, and we all convened there eventually. After resting a while, and unfortunately not finding a 7-Eleven, I had to go to my boarding gate, F105. Sian, everyone else’s gate was C-something but mine had to be the furthest away. I was really tired and had a headache, but just powered through it anyway. No lunch, except for a few cherry tomatoes and nuts. Why can’t airports have shops selling greek yoghurt or skyr? Dang it man. Anyway, I’m just glad that the flight wasn’t delayed this time, though we did depart late by 20mins. Full flight, and I was so tired I dozed off for the majority of the flight. We landed at around 3.10pm, and then I went to the Stansted Express for the 3.43pm train to Tottenham Hale Court. Unfortunately, the train journey was extended, due to some guy trespassing on the tracks so yeah. After a 10min delay, we finally continued on and reached the station at around 4.30pm. I walked to the Victoria station line, and took another 30min journey back. By the time I reached Warwick, it was 5.05pm already, and Mom and Kai had just reached before me. Heidi was there already too — she was cooking them dinner tonight. I ate a few spoonfuls of yoghurt then got cooking, as Mom kindly helped me go sainsbury and the market man to buy veg and fruits. Man, was I so tired and my head was pounding. Whilst cooking, I boiled water to refill my bottles and unpacked at the same time. Only finished cooking by 6pm, and then finished by 6.30pm. Finally took a shower, and just updating the blog now. Man I am so tired…
Oh well, it was a pretty ok family trip, though lots of unhappiness and rough patches the first few days — ok, mostly everyday there’s something wrong. Just like today, Kit didn’t even bother saying or hugging me goodbye unlike he did with Kai and Mom. Guess I should just give up on him too.

This is a post about a couple of museums that I visited while I was in Copenhagen. As I was more determined nto not make my holiday into a busman’s trip, I somehow managed to find myself in yet another museum…
Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, or the New Carlsberg Museum, was founded by the same founder who launched the beer brand. The founding collection of the museum was the private collections of the Carl Jakobson. I wasn’t aware of how close the museum was from my hotel and had passed it many times while looking for other attractions.
The highlight of my visit was definitely the winter garden. When I was reading the information on tripadivsor, I thought it was another botanical garden. I didn’t realise how wrong I was until I arrived.
What greeted me first was a stream of different sounds: recordings of both natural sounds, such as birds’ chirping and wind, and artificial sounds. I heard something that reminded me the strange music of a theremin or a glass armonica. Sometimes the melody turned into a high pitch, but most of time it was as if the ruffling leaves were murmuring. The winter garden was smaller than I expected, but the magical sound somehow enlarged the place. I was lucky enough to secure a seat at the cafe next to the garden, and enjoyed a light lunch as if I were in the jungle (a very cold one indeed).
Another thing worth mentioned was a literary project for eight selected sculptures. Invited guest writers were asked to write a short passage, giving the marbles voice and perspectives. I was relieved when learning that the text was all translated in English and juxtaposed with Danish. Nevertheless, this was the moment when I wish I had mastered a foreign language so I didn’t need to rely on translation.
The visit was rather short, as a heavy rain in the morning soaked me through and I had to go back to my hotel to give an online talk to the Museum studies students at the Uni. Leicester. It was a fine museum; a typical “private-collection-turned-museum”. I appreciate the attempt of the literary projects, giving the collections new meaning.
2. Medicinsk Museion (Medical Museum), 1 Sep
I was over the moon when I learned that there was another medical museum in Copenhagen. No surprise, it is a university-affiliated museum, transformed with collections previously used in lectures. At first, I couldn’t find it upon arriving at the address: There was no sign on the street, but a thick wooden door. I then realised that thise must have been the feelings for many visitors when they went to the Whipple Museum: Being discouraged by the intimidating door, fearing that whatever was behind the door was far too important to be disturbed.
Originally I thought it was going to be another small and quirky museum that had no choice but to take advantage of every inch of space possible, that the arrangement and curation were going to be limited. However, I was surprised to find that first of all, the space was bigger than I thought (at least bigger than Whipple), and that there was a certain curatorial logic that went through different galleries. From a display that asked visitor to reflect upon difficult choices during Covid, to an interactive game about factors that extend or shorten humans’ lives expectancy, permanent displays showed a wide coverage of various yet common aspects regarding health and medicine. I especially appreciate the display of instruments for the visually impaired, such as Braille, typewriters, and computers. As a person who is severely myopic, I understand how these tools can make a huge difference to the blind.
www.museion.ku.dk
The Exhibitions “The Body Collected” exceeded my expectations. Making the best use of the human remains collected since the 18th century, the exhibition discussed life, death, deformity, and disease from macro to micro. Exhibitions as such always attracted people who simply wanted to snap pictures of the “freaks” and the “deformed”, i.e. skeletal remains or samples left by people with disability. I don’t deny that the power of genes never stops amazing me, yet every time I see a giggling teenager (usually they were there only because of some private summer camp, and that a cultural visit was a must to satisfy the parents) laughing while taking pictures of “things”, I understand more why there are rules in UK museums that forbid people from any photography. Visitors should always be reminded of the magnitude of historical superstition, prejudice, misunderstanding, and the emotions that accompanied all stillborns of deformity and victims of disease when being presented with human remains. On the other side, UK museums are probably the only country that actually put out signs that forbid photography when it comes to human remains, and not every museum abides the rule (e.g. archaeological remains). It is always surprising to see no effort is made in European medical museums to remind people of the ethics and respect, but truly, what position museums have to do so?
Before my visit ended at a strange temporary exhibition on germs and intestinal health (about digestion and of course, waste), I gladly found that I could buy acopy of the display text for “The Body Collected”, English available. I didn’t have time to read all the labels, but the book provided wonderful, high-res photos of the collections, accompanied with paragraphs written by the curators who explained the context and stories of the dead. After reading the book, I felt that the body parts, severed and partially presented, reclaimed a bit of humanity. It as very important for me.
3. Danish Architecture Centre, 5 Sep
I wasn’t planning on visiting the DAC, but eventually stepped inside since it was included as free entry in my Copenhagne Pass. I’m glad that I did visit this place, as it was very informative.
I had heard many positive comments about Danish architecture, that it was one of the best when talking about modern design. Although I never pay any attention on architecture, I can still apreciate the curatorial decision made in the gallery that presented the philosphy and creativity of Danish architecture. One thing I took away was the importance of techniques to make bricks and bricklaying, as well as the design to let all Copenhagen citizens enjoy water. When looking at the illustration, I remembered the long jetty that I walked by every morning in front of my hotel, where I imagined would be fully packed with swimmers in summer.
I did not visit that many museums when I was in Copenhagen; instead, I went to a few famous historical royal palaces. As my attention now is more focus on how museums manage and care for their collections on the public side, I don’t think I know enough to critique the management of royal palaces and heritage sites. As magnificent as they are, I don’t intend to make this blog into a travel diary.
Copenhagen was a beautiful place that reminded me of Amsterdam: Water, canal, bikes, and clear sky above neat city planning. Yet it is indeed a city of its own distinctive charm.
This blog post was very much delayed in publishing, as I was soon caught in a whirl wind of work and life changes when I came back to the UK: New job, new role, things to learn, etc..

A new cookbook revealing the hidden gems of Copenhagen cuisine is set to take American readers by storm later this month as Trine Hahnemann’s Copenhagen Food arrives in bookstores across the country.
The Danish chef and food entrepreneur’s latest work is a sprawling exploration of her hometown and the hyggelig cafés and restaurants that make it a unique standout in the global gastronomic map. Chapters covering eight boroughs, including Nyhavn & Gammelholm, Frederiksstaden, Christianshavn, Central Copenhagen, Vesterbro & Frederiksberg, Nørrebro, and Østerbro, and also Outside Copenhagen, are paired with over 70 local and traditional recipes and Trine’s own personal stories of living in and rediscovering each neighbourhood.
#DenmarkInNY met up with Trine Hahnemann to discuss her view on how Copenhagen food culture stands out from the rest of New Nordic cuisine and what the sophisticated New York palate can learn from Copenhagen’s food culture.
DKNY: Can you tell me a little bit about yourself and how you became inspired to produce a cookbook about Copenhagen food culture?
TH: I am native to Copenhagen and I have lived here all my life (a part from a few years in New York and London). I have worked in food for more than 25 years and I thought that now that Copenhagen has become a recognized gastronomic destination I would really like to write about the everyday food culture and how Copenhagen forms part of my history. I also wanted to go back to the roots and tell about where we are coming from.
DKNY: Is there something special that characterises Copenhagen food culture and distinguishes it from the rest of New Nordic cuisine?
TH: Yes, the ‘smørrebrød’ (open sandwiches). The bread culture — especially rye bread. And, of course, all the soft sweet buns we eat where the most iconic Danish is “kanelkringle.” Then the most diffuse traditional fast food is the hotdog, which comes in traditional, modern and organic versions.
DKNY: New Nordic cuisine has built a broad fan base over the past few years but it is now a known entity. Can Copenhagen food culture help maintain New Nordic’s popularity?
TH: Copenhagen is at the epicentre [of New Nordic cuisine] and at the same time finding its own identity away from New Nordic. Restaurants with food from around the world are opening here and I think seasonal, terroir and traditional and cutting-edge sustainable solutions are the future of Copenhagen restaurants.
DKNY: New York is a very diverse city when it comes to food. Is there something that New Yorkers learn from Copenhagen’s food culture?
TH: I would say the culture around eating out is relaxed. Hygge is important in sharing a meal. The other unique aspect is the local produce and the diversity of the seasons. We have more like 12 seasons instead of four, in part because many things only grow here for a very short time. Moreover, restaurants work directly with producers. We are close to the country and distances are short therefore local collaborations are easier.
DKNY: What is a staple of Copenhagen food culture that New Yorkers absolutely need to discover?
TH: The smørrebrød and trying out the lunch culture of having smørrebrød, beer and snaps at some of the classic lunch restaurants thereby trying the whole flow of a Danish lunch. The other thing is bicycling around and trying the different street food markets.

I did not have a single Danish when I was travelling in Copenhagen. Regret? Maybe.
I was in Copenhagen for holiday between 29 Aug and 6 Sep. It was a trip that I had been waiting for a long time, despite the fact that it might not seem so according to the post here: It seems that I just got back from Amsterdam, and whoosh, I was on holiday again! Only I knew I badly needed a holiday. I was aware that if I didn’t have any break before I started my new job at the MAA, I probably would’ve lost my mind.
As usual, it was a busman’s holiday, i.e. plenty of museums and heritage sites. This post will talk about the aquariums and botanical garden I visited.
I remember that we had to choose from five different topics for the last module (Specialisms) prior to the research dissertation in postgrad. The options were Museum & Knowledge (which I ended up with), Digital Museum, Education, Heritage, and Green Museum. The last option did not receive anyone signing up, and I felt really bad for Prof Unwin, but that was the first time when I learned that “green museum” wasn’t limited to environmental activists and climate crisis issues, but included collection-wise aspects.
When talking about the museum sector, botanical gardens are often included, e.g. The Cambridge Botanical Garden is part of the University Cambridge Museums (UCM). It is because the plant sciences associated with developing knowledge, and to conserve both tangible and intangible assest (in this case, the living plants in botanical garden and the pressed dried seeds and specimens in a herbarium) is as equally fundamental as other types of museum professions. On the basis of caring and protecting living plants, including zoos as a type of museum isn’t an idea so strange. An interesting and simple metaphor I now often use for explaining to outsiders is that a botanical garden is for living plants, a herbarium for the dead, a zoo and an aquarium for living animals, and finally a museum of natural science (usually iconic with a whale skeleton, or even better, a dinosaur) is for the dead, such as taxidermy.
A little sidenote to my postgrad and green museum course is that doing a two-month placement studies at the Leicester Zoo was one of the 200 available posts then. I don’t think anyone chose to spend a summer with zoo animals. Nevertheless, it makes sense to me now.
When I was planning for Copenhagen, I learned that Den Blå Planet (National Aquarium Denmark), an aquarium close to the airport, was the biggest aquarium in northern Europe. I was immediately attracted by the wonderful photos of blue water and the cool sea tunnel and booked the ticket when it was available. It had been probably more than twenty years since I last visited an aquarium.
I had no idea what to expect when I stepped inside, which was probably why I discovered surprise one after another. Indeed, large built-in-wall fish tanks were wonderful, but I appreciated the touch-screen beside each tank that explained what the sea animals were, where to find them, and if they were endangered. That was a great deal information. There was only one short-coming: Some touch screens mentioned an audio guide from the aquarium official app, which I did download, but it did not work at all.
Here are a few features that I really liked during my visit, and I think they are, though not unique in aquariums and zoos, equally functional as traditional education role of a museum.
There were four “shows” that I participated: One was touching sea stars and flounders, with a staff member explaining the species; one was letting the doctor fish eat the dead skin on my hand; one was an hourly feeding show for the cownose ray; the last one was watching the staff feeding the Amazonian pirahnas.
These shows are slightly different in types and they represent how zoos and aquariums engage with audiences. First one is direct interaction with the collections (in this case, living animals) with supervision and demonstration, and the interaction is part of the experience. Second one is similar to the first, but without supervision. In my case, I was playing with the doctor fish while reading the panels about these funny creatures. Third one is a mixture of fundamental animal conservation and education programme, since feeding the cownose rays are behind-the-scene task brought to the front for the visitors. It was also a direct interaction since the explainer gave away little shrimp pieces for kids to feed the ray. Finally, the last one is just as the third one, but without the visitors actually feeding. I’m pretty sure the reputation of pirahnas played a part.
One thing in common is that both staff members and the wall panels were the integral part of the whole experience. I learned a lot more than I expected, especially about the Amazonian pirahnas, that they didn’t really munch on people immediately if a poor sould fell into the water. Contrary to the stereotypical image portrayed by Hollywood movies, the fish are actually afraid of humans since we are larger. They also have natural risk aversement, which is against things that move, so it is unlikely that they would actively attack a drowning human. I learned about these facts by asking the conservator, and she did say that movies had more influence than them. It is exactly like the movie Jaws, which makes people think sharks will pursue swimmers no matter what, despite most cases suggest otherwise.
This might come across more of an independent situation, where the staff members were dedicated to telling people how sea animals become part of huamans’ diet. Whereas in museums, I seldom hear or read that some collections are good for making a house decoration or have high value in the market (perhaps topics alike would appear in marketing meetings, but I doubt that general public would be interested in knowing what decisions were made to produce the souvenirs they take home with!).
When I was poking (gently) the star fish, the conservator, a passionate young man, explained to me that some other fish I had touched were flounders, which were common on dinner plate. I told him that sea urchins were delicious, too in Asia. He agreed and said that such things were important to teach the children, that how their food came from. To be honest, I was a bit surprised by his candor, but really appreciated.
I also recalled reading an article years ago, which talked about how Taiwan “celebrated more seafood culture rather than sea culture”. As an island, and actually, one of the islands of defining status in both Austrolasian linguistic family and Oceanic diaspora, Taiwanese do not have a high literay in respecting and living in peace with the sea. Surely we consume tons of seafood, and most of us, though may not recognise the formal names, are good at distinguishing levels of freshness. Yet seafood is only one tiny party of living amid the ocean. The eagerness of the conservator, who took pride in educating the kids on learning the food source, made me wonder if an aquarium could strike a balance between modern scientific conservation and anthropological understanding for sea/ocean.
Here are some of the photos I took, of things I found worth remembering. Regretably, sometimes I forgot to note what the fish tank label said. The caption is about what I remember.
2. Botanical Garden, 3 Sep 2023
Besides visiting an aquarium, I also went to the Botanical Garden of the University of Copenhagen. Having stayed in the UK and Europe for some time though, I find it interesting how the Europeans emphasise and advertise greenhouses with tropical and exotic plants, which are usually bananas, cocoa, and palm trees. What I mean by “interesting” is that these greenhouses, though after centuries, far gone by the time they were built when anything “oriental” would definitely be a showstopper, are still being considered a highlight for visitors nowadays. I am always amused by the idea how my father would say, that his daughter travels far just to see bananas while she can see them in the garden!
I also feel a bit embarrased whenever I visit any botanical garden or herbarium, because I a) don’t know anything about horticulture or botany. b) am terrible at keeping plants alive. and c) even though I tried to take notes, the Latin terms and many English names never intend to stay in my mind very long. I am a bit worried that I didn’t make the best use of such invaluable resource.
The Botanical Garden, besides featured greenhouses of palm trees and bananas (it was incredibly steamy, so warm and wet that I couldn’t breathe. It was a sign that I had been transformed by the European climate!), boasted its butterfly room. I was not prepared for it; I thought the butterflies were specimens, or we would see them behind glass. I was sorrily wrong…
I don’t like butterflies. There are many things I don’t like that surprise people, and butterflies are one of them. I’m squeamish when seeing them: thin legs, fragile fat body, and I never am able to predict which way they fly towards to. I find them incredibly beautiful, though, especially if I don’t have to duck.
I couldn’t say out loud about how I felt about butterflies, because clearly everyone was amazed, feeling like living a Snow White’s daily life. I also felt a bit sad, because Taiwan used to be called the island of butterflies, and I only got to experience a brief moment of the name in a foreign country.
There was a large part of the Botanical Garden close due to reconstruction and conservation, so I didn’t get to wander around. Nevertheless, it was a wonderful visit. I will have to visit the one in Cambridge (shamefully I still haven’t been there) to compare the two.
It was nice to step out of my confort zone to see what other public educational space looked like. It was a valuable experience, especially the aquarium, as I don’t think there is anything as such in the UK (or maybe I should look closer!).

Copenhagen is unlike other European cities. It was apparent the moment when, exhausted after a 12 hour plane ride and turned away from our hotel for arriving too early, we decided to brave a nippy morning for a stroll around the city.
It was past 8am but the Radshuspladsen, or City Hall Square and “bustling heart of Copenhagen”, and the Stroget, a pedestrian street in the old city, is still eerily empty.
Where are the tenacious tourists? In fact, where is everyone? Are we in the right place?
One of the few souls we saw were these guys standing in the middle of a square, turning a decapitated cow on a spit.
Freezing, we gravitated to the warmth of the open fire like a bunch of hobos.
“That is the biggest lamb I’ve seen,” said the husband, whose brains have obviously stopped functioning in the cold.
“Oh, its a cow…and it will only be ready in a few hours,” says the blond-hair, blue-eyed one casually, like it’s perfectly normal to be roasting a whole cow out on the streets like this. “I’ve been up since last night getting this thing ready so, yeah, it’s just a few more hours to go.”
We might have missed a fine Viking feast but we did end up in Holm’s Bager, an ugly modern bakery which serves perhaps the most exquisite takeout sandwiches in the world. It was also our first time trying tebirkes, or Danish poppy seed rolls.
By this time, the city was coming slowly to life and, with freshly made sandwiches in hand, we continued to Slotholmen, or Castle Island, where the Christiansborg Palace, the Parliament, the Supreme Court, Ministry of Finance and the Borsen — the former World Trade Centre of Scandinavia — all reside. We were content with admiring these fine collection of buildings from the outside (although all we really wanted to do at this point was to go back to our hotel room and hibernate).
Standing there shivering in my cardigan and boots however, I saw more badassery… namely, a bunch of Viking descendants swimming competitively in the river in nothing more than swimsuits and trunks in 12 °C weather.
The Andersen Hotel was a fine place to crash, if not for its flawed check-in process. We were treated to a free wine hour after emerging from a good long nap, and played chess in the lobby while the weather continued to suck.
It was also close to the Skydebanehaven, a public park filled with climbing frames, a sand pit, a wading pool as well as stuff that would’ve been stolen / destroyed a long time ago if this had been another country, like balls and trikes. It was not just better than the city parks in Europe, it was free.
Copenhagen has several castles you can visit, but we decided on Rosenborg Castle because it was supposed to be the most captivating of the lot. And I totally understood why: its owner, King Christian IV, was a lover and fighter par excellence, with his hipster braid and Roman toga.
At his finest hour at the age of 67, after being injured by shrapnel during a naval battle against Sweden, he bounced right back up and continued waging war as if nothing happened. Not only that: he also had the shrapnel pieces removed from his eye and forehead later and made into earrings as a gift for his mistress.
The castle is infused with the personality of its owner: There was the room of mirrors — not to be mistaken for the less hedonistic Hall of Mirrors in Versailles — where he dunked the dingus in; there was the room where he reclined on a throne carved entirely from narwhal tusk; there was the room where he breathed in his last breath at the ripe old age of 70, after fathering 25 kids (with two wives and three mistresses).
Then, there was also the treasury, which looked like P. Diddy or Jay-Z’s personal wardrobe, where you can ogle at his golden crown and various other objects dripping in jewels.
It was hard not to walk out of the Rosenborg without wondering who, really, are these people? Why do they make Chuck Norris look like a pansy? And what do they eat, apart from whole headless animals?
Some of these questions were answered during our visit to the National Museum — which should be renamed the House of Horrors for its macabre exhibitions (see below). It started out innocently enough: we began with stuff left behind by their long dead — but no doubt, once strapping — Viking ancestors, like horned helmets and rune stones proclaiming heroic deeds.
And once you walk further in thinking what a nice, family-friendly museum this is, the museum delivers its sucker punch: bones animals and humans, mummified corpses, the head of a little girl who met a gruesome end — no doubt a victim of sacrifice. Further proof that you don’t wanna mess with these guys.
Then, as if wandering through halls containing dead bodies and decapitated heads weren’t creepy enough, there was also a charming area devoted entirely to old-fashioned doll houses. And a scary Hitler puppet for effect.
The children’s section — supposedly excellent — was closed while we were there but we managed to quell our disappointment by having a go at dressing up in the height of 17th century Danish fashion. Our littlest one, unfortunately, refused to humiliate himself, so here’s the three of us.
We eventually made our way to Christiana, a “free city” that sprung up in 1971, when 700 free-spirited Danes established a squatters’ colony in abandoned military barracks just a stone’s throw away from the parliament. They have survived multiple police crackdowns and skyrocketing property prices to remain standing today, several decades later, as a ragtag community of idealists, hippies, potheads, and artists who formed their own rules and built their own homes.
I was, however, rather skeptical: descendants of possibly the most fearsome people on earth, now enlightened new-age hipsters? Who believe in free love? And who would rather go vegan than a-pillaging?
I NEED TO SEE THESE PEOPLE FOR MYSELF.
And so we went — the kids mesmerized by all the rainbow colors and recycled art around them.
Down Pusher Street we went too, although we didn’t realize until we saw a bags of grass on a cart staffed by a shifty-eyed man.
We went to Nemoland, hoping to get some falafel and hummus but was put off by all the cigarette smoke. So we had Thai food at the beautiful Cafeloppen where the waitress was high-as-a-kite but the food was great.
And then we explored some more. We saw plenty of tourists; other families with young children; a guy, in handcuffs, getting escorted away by three policemen. I was especially delighted to come across a smoky little tavern where a bunch of old Asian grandpas and grandmas sat around, smoking hashish and being all ‘Whats Upppp’ instead of tending to the grandchildren like they do over here. That just made my day.
We ended up in a derelict-looking building that would’ve made any sane person nervous, but was actually home to a really great little art gallery. A group of musicians were inside, playing folk music.
My kids started flailing their arms and stomping around to the tune and, before I could rush over and restrain them like a panicked nurse at a mental hospital, a lady stopped me with a nod and a smile.
“It’s ok. Just let them be.”
And she handed them a cookie each.
She didn’t look like she was ready to take me on with an axe or something. She just seemed very kind, which was so unlike the Parisian lady in Montmartre who burned my son’s cheek with her cigarette and snapped at my husband for not being careful, or the Norwegian ladies who glared at us as our kids jumped around in the back of a stationary car during a ferry crossing.
I felt, at that moment, that we came to the right place. Even if we did see someone being arrested, we came to the right place.
And you know what? Copenhagen may not win a beauty or popularity contest anytime soon, but the people here are something else.
STAY Andersen Hotel Clarion Hotel Copenhagen Airport Sleek, modern rooms a short, indoor walk from the arrivals hall and copious breakfast make this place a great bet for those staying two nights or less. Also located less than a five minute indoor walk to the train station, where regular train takes you right to the city centre in just ten minutes. Early check-ins possible. $$ Generous, good quality breakfast (think smoked salmon, jamon iberico and amazing croissants), free wine hours, comfortable rooms and excellent location in the middle of the city. Unfortunately however, the CONCEPT24, which is unique to the hotel and means that your room is available for 24 hours after check-in, is absolutely useless, especially during peak tourist season. $$$

Previous: San Francisco — Copenhagen Scandinavian Airlines SK936 Flight Report
However short time I have in a city, I still enjoy taking public transportation not to save money, but to experience subways and buses in different countries as much as possible. So I took M2 metro line from airport to downtown Copenhagen. It was a 20 min short ride, but cost as many as 30 DKK ($4.5). Scandinavian price is no joke even to a Bay Area resident like me.
Copenhagen metro: not the best I’ve taken, but pretty comfortable and clean, definitely a far cry from the US ones.
I planned to start from the City Hall at the western end of downtown area, and made my way to the famous Little Mermaid statue in the east, which would cover most of Copenhagen’s central area. That is from the statue of Anderson to the statue to one of the most famous characters he created. As I walked out the metro station, to my surprise, I saw a sea of flags of not Denmark, but Palestine. It was in the midst of the Hamas-Israeli war, shortly after the Israeli army entered the Gaza Strip.
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has always been one that’s close to my heart. Personally having been to both Israel and Palestine, I’ve heard stories from both sides, and attended events of various sorts from both sides as well. So I stayed here to observe for a while, seeing the impassioned crowds waving the flags and chanting the political slogan “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.”
In the middle of chaos, I took some time to walk toward the other end of the plaza to see Mr Hans Christian Anderson, arguably the most famous person every tourist to Copenhagen would come to visit. Anderson sit on his chair with a top hat, looking at the other side, seemingly not paying attention to the ongoing protests on the plaza at all. He seemed to see these quite often and just wanted to chill.
As I decided to leave the plaza and began my walking tour, the rally also ended. So I followed the crowds to the Strøget, the famous pedestrian, car-free street in Copenhagen. The street seemed to be a touristy area with many souvenir stores, many of which were named “Viking” conveniently, and “exotic” restaurants. In retrospect, I really should have had dinner here.
Flyers on the wall were about the Palestine rally I saw earlier.
With crowds still chanting Palestinian slogans, I continued walking down the Strøget, while occastionally left the crowds to explore some stores briefly. A huge pulpit was seen placed next to this fountain, where Quran was played loudly admist the Scandinavian night. Seeing a group of mid-age Danish people sitting on the other side of the plaza hanging out and drinking, I wondered how they thought about the scene. Did they embrace such diversity or else?
Continuing walking eastward, architectures looked more and more modern. Fountains and statues could be seen once in a while. Then a market full of crowds came to my sight. Even thought it was still early November, the Christmas market had already taken place.
I personally can’t stand sitting outside in such a cold weather, but it seemed fitting to the Danish. People dressing in heavy jackets came together to chill, drink beers ,and share sausages and desserts on this Saturday night. The price for everything looked insanely high though. As a sausage cost nearly $20, I just observed the crowds.
I also visited a department store that fortunately was still open. Such stores are good places to observe local lives, so I always make them top on my list when I travel. Everything in the supermarket, from vegetables to seafood, seemed very pricey. Even though I later found my conversion rate was a little bit off, these prices were still way higher than in the Bay Area, which was already one of the most expensive places in the world.
As I walked pass the seafood counter and saw a lady sorting out seafood, a surreal feeling occurred to me. Travel brought me to this random place to encounter this random person, which wouldn’t have had anything to do with my life otherwise.
This is exactly what I travel for.
I planned to have dinner in the department store, but it didn’t really have a food court (only one serving desserts and wine). So I continued walking. Finally seeing Danish flags outside souvenir stores after a while.
This iconic building with all the dazzling lights was also a department store (for some reason I forgot to take any photo inside). I have arrived at the Kongens Nytorv (lit king’s new market) and Nyhavn (lit New harbor) area. This is also where the postcard-worthy photos of the colorful facades and old ships were taken (something along these lines). There was a McDonald right outside the department store, but I didn’t feel like having it as my only meal in Denmark. Big mistake, but we’ll come back to this.
To my disappointment, the facades were not very well-lit, which made them not very colorful. Both sides of Nyhavn were full of fancy restaurants that would probably cost me an arm to eat and a leg to dine inside (seriously $60 for a simple meal?) I was unsure whether these were tourist traps, or just typical Scandinavian prices.
Walking to the end of the harbor, I took a photo of the iconic new opera building across the harbor, under chilling winds. I thought the Little Mermaid, as popular as it is, has to be located in somewhere full of crowds. However the lively vibe I had experienced so far suddenly faded away. I realized it was really just the walkable Strøget area that was lively, and now I had encountered another side of Copenhagen.
Amalienborg was the official residence of the Danish royal family, where the Queen of Denmark resides today! However, it was only serenity that I could experience at night. A few royal guards wearing huge bearskin hats were patrolling the plaza. They would walk from one end of the building to a specific corner, stand still, turn around, and walk back to the original spot, so disciplined and well trained as if they were programmed robots. But as the palace where the head of state resides, I felt the security level was way lower than expected.
So on the plaza in this tranquil night, there were really only the royal guards wearing bearskin hats, King Frederick V on the horseback (he was actually king of both Denmark and Norway, when these two countries used to be one), and myself. I was observing both of them, while both the king and the guards were just going about their day (or night), ignoring my presence.
I was desperate to have dinner at any time, but few restaurants could be found. I made a small detour to a nearby street, where there were Khmer, Thai, and Vietnamese restaurants, presumably opened by immigrants. My experience told me that these places would offer foods at reasonable price. However, they all turned out to be high-end restaurants that cost $40 a meal.
Other restaurants I went to either was closed, or cost even more. I really wondered how an average person got to survive here.
At least I was glad to see the Danish road signs! Whoever plays Geoguessr would recognize this typical Danish signs, screaming Denmark, at first glance.
So I was approaching my destination, the Little Mermaid, walking in hunger and increasingly brutal winds. I realized the statue was located in a coastal park, with no stores or restaurants around as I imagined before. My final shot to not starve would be this seafood restaurant on the way there.
I almost thought the place was closed too, because I couldn’t even open the door as fierce winds blew onto it. It turned out to be a food court with many restaurants to choose from, ranging from seafood, authentic Mexican food, Argentinian grills……. and even Japanese sushi.
I ended up having this poke bowl as my only meal in Copenhagen. The famous Hawaiian and Californian-inspired dish that came with fish, avocado and random vegetables. Seriously it could not be less Danish than this. After I came out from the much needed restroom, I wondered how funny it would be to write about this journey, sharing about the authentic Danish food that Danish people get to eat in their everyday lives. I really should have eaten McDonalds or Burger King, or even the Chinese restaurant I first saw.
But hey, at least I had walked across nearly all of Copenhagen!
After such an authentic Danish dining experience, I went on to see something truly Danish: the Little Mermaid. The coastal park seemed to be a fun place to visit during the day, with good trails to bike if I hadn’t been carrying a 10kg backpack. Few tourists would visit the Little Mermaid in such a chilly night. In fact, only two local Danish dudes were there chatting. They came to me asking for cigarettes, which was indeed very fitting for this setting. Too bad I didn’t have one.
On my way walking to the metro station, I realized I had drunk too much water when I had the Danish delights, and my bladder couldn’t stand anymore. Unlike my dinner, I had no luck this time — absolutely nowhere was open in 10pm; the public restroom at train station was hopelessly occupied forever; however neat and clean Copenhagen’s metro was, it didn’t have any restroom in the station.
I tried to focus on my brain instead of my bladder. At one point I almost had no options but to take metro all the way to the airport, just for its guaranteed public restrooms. The department store and McDonalds in downtown, only 2 stations away from here, finally occurred to me. As I ran out the metro, the former seemed to be closed, but the latter, fortunately, was open.
I ran all the way to the basement, rushing into the restroom, only to see some ladies waiting in line. As I quickly turned back and about to ran out, a lady said “it’s fine! it’s both genders!”
“I promise I’ll eat McDonald next time Im in this city.” I pondered, As I used the gender-neutral restroom.
Walking out of McDonalds, I took metro to Ørestad. This is where I would stay tonight, somewhere with reasonable price and only two stations from the airport. Since my flight would depart 8am the next day, proximity was the top priority.
I walked through the already closed shopping mall and exited via the confusing parking lot stairs to avoid the ruthless freezing winds.
The hotel was a good deal for what I paid in such an expensive city. But my room turned out to be the final room down the hallway. This is very scary and something I would like to avoid at all cost. Legend has it that, the final room down the hallway always……
had the worst wi-fi signals…….took me forever to upload my Strava activity.
And was I only 5 hours into the trip? Why did I feel it’s already been 5 full days…….

I originally wrote this article in Danish for Politiken Byrum. Here’s the English translation.
Copenhagen is about to get a unique opportunity to learn from other global cities when it hosts the C40 Cities Conference. The question is whether a city as smug as Copenhagen is willing to exploit the opportunity. I doubt it.
The C40 network is bolstered by strong city brands with renowned mayors and is trying to act as a counterweight to national governments and their molasses-like politics, with an agenda strong on action. Cities are an absolute key in the fight against climate change but we’re not exploiting their potential near enough. Copenhagen is in the C40 club, since the city’s status quo is on a high level. Perhaps Lord Mayor Frank Jensen might even drag his bike out of the garage for the event. THAT would be epic.
It is clearly an advantage to work internationally in urban planning and design and say that I come from Copenhagen. It gives street cred. In 2007, I coined the word copenhagenize as a way of describing how other cities could be inspired by all the — back then — exciting things the city was doing. The word hit a nerve around the world.
It is quite telling that I came upon copenhagenize rather than something like denmarkification. Regardless of which political block is at the nation’s helm, the state still focuses on motorways and car sales, as though it’s still 1955. They haven’t understood the concept of induced demand — if you make more space for cars, you get more cars. It is hard to see the difference between the different transport ministers. The latest incarnation has recently been in Oslo to “look at electric cars”. We don’t need fewer cars in Denmark. No no no. Just different cars.
For years I have put Copenhagen on a pedestal regarding sustainable development and I have been an eager exporter of inspiration and transferable solutions with Copenhagen as a role model. I’ve worked in over 100 cities and, with my tv-series about urbanism The Life-Sized City — I curate so many amazing things that are happening in cities around the world. For 12 years I have taken hundreds of politicians, policymakers and professionals around my city on bicycle urbanism tours and I have given countless keynotes and interviews about the city. The pedestal, however, is getting wobbly.
Where arriving home in Copenhagen from my travels used to be pure pleasure, it is now often a bit of a bummer. There are simply so many amazing things happening out there in the world that Copenhagen is looking more and more old school. The brand is dusty and tired. Lately I have to answer puzzled questions from colleagues like, “why the hell did you build a Metro instead of reestablishing the tram network you removed in 1972?!” As on urban planning colleague from France put it, “car-centric cities build metros and people-friendly cities build tramlines”.
I live in Frederiksberg, a city in its own right in the heart of Copenhagen. It’s too small to be in the fancy C40 club but brags ad nauseum about being “The Green Heart of the Capital”. Here on the corner of Godthåbsvej and Nordre Fasanvej, where I’m writing these words, more than 30,000 cars groan past my windows. Windows that are consistently dirtier than any other apartment I’ve lived in in the capital. Frederiksberg is building underground parking garages but without removing the same number of street parking spots. Induced demand is a foreign concept to them, too. It’s wild to think that with the current parking licence fees for residents (only about €100 per year) it takes 900 years to pay off one underground car parking spot. Rumour has it the parking prices will increase, but let’s see if they actually rise to a price that makes sense. It costs 50,000 Danish kroner (€6700) just to paint and maintain an on-street parking spot. So the fee should be at least that.
The city is throwing around taxpayer money like it’s going out of style in the form — among other things — of expensive noise reducing asphalt. If you lower the speed limit from 50 km/h to 30 km/h it will give you the same noise reduction in our densely-populated neighbourhoods as the new asphalt — for a lot less money. The Black Heart of the Capital.
I’m an optimist but I’m also an impatient idealist. I simply have to be inspired in my daily work in order to bother continuing. Luckily there is inspiration to be had around the world. If Copenhagen dares to stand up and kick their laurels aside, here’s a quick and dirty list of modern ideas they can learn from.
Former Mayor of Paris from 2001–2014, Bertrand Delanoë spelled it out perfectly: “The fact is that cars no longer have a place in the big cities of our time”. He is far from alone on this. The woman who took over from him, Anne Hidalgo, is trying to continue where Delanoë left off. Mayors around the world have been quoted for similar, modern statements. It is simply the new normal to work towards fewer cars in a city. Okay, maybe not THAT new. Since the 1990s, French cities with over 100,000 inhabitants have been obliged by national law to develop mobility plans that would reduce car traffic and strengthen public transport, walking and cycling. Maybe when the current transport minister is done with looking at those Norwegian cars he could get started on intelligent legislation.
What else do we have? Hmm.
Over the past four years Oslo of all places has removed over 5000 car parking spots and made it impossible to drive into the city center unless you live there. Amsterdam plans to remove 10,000 parking spots for cars between now and 2025 in favour of making the city safer and adding public space. Helsinki is almost proud when they say it won’t be necessary to own a car in the city in the near future. They’re putting their money on MaaS (mobility as a service) instead. Vancouver is trying to turn the transport budget paradigm on its head — money goes to public transport, walking and cycling first and whatever is left goes to cars.
Now it’s getting awkward. Congestion charges. The national government promised us on around Copenhagen a few years and then failed to deliver. They’re a success in Stockholm, Oslo, Milan, London and Singapore and there is now serious talk of implementing them in many cities, including New York and Belgian cities. Are you as tired as me that your tax money goes to benefiting motorists who don’t even live in — or pay taxes in — your city? Shouldn’t we try to get some of that money back? Other cities have done the math.
Soon 85% of all the streets in Paris will be 30 km/h zones and the “30 Zone” movement that started in Germany in 1986 continues to roll. Soon Central London will slow down to 30 km/h like over 150 cities around Europe. Outside my windows it’s 50 km/h — in Denmark’s most densely-populated city.
I can go on. Ljubljana is in the midst of a massive green paradigm shift. Mexico has an official “laboratory for the city” created to think out of the box. Barcelona is developing people-friendly “superblocks” to reestablish life in the streets after the destructive reign of the automobile. Dublin has banned large trucks from the city center. Several cities are rebuilding or expanding their tram networks. Large logistics companies like DHL and UPS have been using — for a few years — cargo bikes for their last-mile logistics in over 75 EU cities.
Just look at Malmö, Sweden. You can literally see it from Copenhagen. They have a policy to strengthen density, they’re working on being the world’s most skateboard friendly city and they’ve built a bike-friendly apartment building without car parking.
Back to Copenhagen. Things are going well. So well that we don’t need to think about doing it better and maintaining our leadership position. World’s best and safest bicycle city — sure, until further notice. Massive investments in climate change adaptation. Super. But think about it. We have so much money that we have lost touch with reality.
The City just completed a bombastic new waste incinerator called Amager Bakke right near the city centre. One of the greatest singular vanity projects in recent memory. Oooh, there’s a ski hill on top! Nevermind that we don’t generate enough garbage to fill it and we have to import garbage from abroad to make it break even.
Is there really talk of a harbour tunnel that will pump more cars into the city when other cities are removing their last-century, fossil fuel infrastructure motorways? No serious action on affordable housing? More car parking spots that will just give us more cars? The same mistakes in the Nordhavn development that we didn’t learn from after the Ørestad and Carlsberg City disasters?
Imagine if Nordhavn was designed to be the world’s most sustainable development — like a huge version of Vauban in Germany — by using the whole arsenal of modern solutions. THAT is leadership. But no, all we have at the moment is a pile of marketing hype about being C02 neutral in 2015. A plan that activates my bullshit detector like never before.
Copenhagen thinks it’s in the boxing ring with the great fighters but in reality the city is merely the hot bikini-clad woman holding up the sign in between rounds. It is time to send copenhagenize into retirement. Personally, I’m more excited to see what vancouverism, barcelonification or osloism — or whatever the next one will be — has to offer up as inspiration.
When the cities of the world come to C40 in Copenhagen, we need to shut up and sit up straight. We need to listen. We need to learn.

📆 Flight Date: 20/11/2022📌 Nyhavn, Copenhagen — Denmark
During our stay in Gothenburg, we planned a 2-day weekend trip to Copenhagen. We hopped on a fast train that took us to Copenhagen in just 3 hours, arriving early in the morning. It was a delightful city to explore and wander around. We wished it were a bit warmer, but unfortunately, the weather was so cold that evening, it had snowed for the first time that year.
Nyhavn is a historic harbour area and one of the symbols of Copenhagen. Built-in the early 17th century, this region was originally used as a trading port. It is renowned for its colourful and distinctive buildings, its atmosphere steeped in history, and its maritime heritage. In the past, Nyhavn was a popular stop for sailors, hosting various cultures over time. Today, it has become a vibrant meeting point for tourists and locals alike, with lively cafes, restaurants, and charming colourful houses.
It was a day when we set out early in the morning to explore the city. While wandering around, I kept an eye out for a suitable place to fly the drone. When we arrived at the famous Nyhavn area, I found an open and quiet space near the river and decided to take off from there. It was an extremely cold day, and the wind was blowing very strongly, making it challenging to control the drone at times.
After taking off, the city looked stunning from above, and I captured a few photographs. Then, I spotted a tourist boat moving along the river towards Nyhavn, and I immediately started recording a video. Slowly progressing alongside the boat, I maneuvered through the streets.
And I took one more photograph of the city.
In my second video, I reversed the process, moving backward away from the river.
In my third video, I kept the drone stationary and, while facing the river, slowly elevated the camera towards the sky.
And finally, my one of my personal favourites is below. In this video, I captured the famous colorful houses and boats by moving the drone parallel to them. Due to the wind, I had to make 2–3 attempts while filming, but in the end, I believe it was worth it.
You can find detailed information about drone flying permissions in Denmark here. Although I have a drone license from the Turkish Directorate General of Civil Aviation, I didn’t possess the required license to fly in urban areas in Denmark. Unfortunately, I flew for a very brief period without obtaining permission. I made sure to stay away from people and buildings during the flight.
The indispensable element of my Northern European shots, the wind, challenged me once again. In fact, I couldn’t feel my fingertips due to the cold for a while after the shoot. Copenhagen was a beautiful city, and the buildings provided delightful scenery.
My point: 9/10
I’m considering adding my past flights here as a memento, so the dates mentioned in the writings I’ve added may belong to the last two years.

If you visit Copenhagen during the colder months, eating your way through their amazing bakeries is one of the best ways to spend your time (and to gain a few pounds of padding to protect you from the cold). We visited 9 bakeries in 5 days. Copenhagen’s bakeries rivaled the ones I tried in Stockholm (reviewed here). While I loved them all, we agreed there was one clear favorite. The list below is loosely in reverse rank order and rated as good, great, or amazing.

Part two: Getting an apartment
So you’ve moved to Copenhagen (or you’re about to!) and you read my last post, so you know that you need an apartment before you can get set up for absolutely anything else (health care, bank account, nemID, etc.). Here’s what I learned…
First, Set your expectations.It took us over 3 weeks to get an apartment in Copenhagen, and I was working on it every single day. We had to move between two different Airbnb’s because it kept taking longer than we thought. We have both a dog and a cat, and it was the middle of winter so it wasn’t much fun to trek around the city. Hopefully for you it will be faster!
In terms of what’s available here… Many Danish bathrooms are very small, to the point where you have to shower over your toilet (ew). And most do not have bathtubs. Pets make it extra-difficult to find a place. Many buildings are walk-ups (we are on the 4th floor with no elevator). However, there is plenty of hardwood and natural light and Danish modern design sensibility YAY!
Invest in the apps.Almost every apartment rental site costs money. Try a few (Boligsurf and Boligportal are decent) and pay for trial subscriptions, but put a note in your calendar to cancel the subscriptions when they are about to auto renew because they are not cheap. DBA is the equivalent of Craigslist and can have some good options, especially if you are willing to do a short term rental and then find a full-time spot later. However, it’s important to have a permanent address in order to get your CPR number, which is your key to everything else (see my last post).
Prepare for the competition.Competition can be fierce in Copenhagen. Come ready to see apartments with your proof of residency/income/employment, passports, and willingness to pay, just like you would in NYC, SF, or DC. Some places require you to fill out an application, others don’t. Bottom line, if you love it, don’t hesitate. On the flip side, the Danes have a more… relaxed pace, especially now during the summer months, so getting a showing can take time. Keep pushing if you have a good feeling about a place!
A note on agents.If you see an apartment that you kind of like, but it’s already gone, or not quite right, ask the person showing it what else they have on the market. Use them as a filter for similar quality apartments. But, keep in mind that buildings rented out by agents are also more expensive because they get a cut.
Be ready to shell out.In Copenhagen it is standard to pay an extra 3 months of rent on top of your 1st month’s rent as a damage deposit. Some places also charge 2–3 months on top of that as a deposit for the last few months rent. So, you are likely to pay between 4–7 months rent on day one. For a 1 bedroom 15.000dk apartment, that could add up to as much as 105.000dk, or $16,500 USD. As I mentioned in the last post, paying your first payment can be tricky without a local bank account, which first requires you to have a local address (so bizzare). I found Transferwise to be pretty useful for those first few overseas payments.
New vs. old?In Copenhagen, deciding between new vs. old is not the difference between modern luxuries and convenience, or personality and affordability. Some of the new construction buildings we saw had few luxuries, were located on the fringes of town (pretty inconvenient), but were more affordable, while some of the older buildings we saw had no character, or a few modern luxuries and conveniences, but at a much higher price. In other words, don’t be fooled by the age of the building!
In Copenhagen, a 15min bike ride is considered far. The city is really not that big, but I’d recommend choosing just a few neighborhoods that are close to where you want to spend your time, especially for when the weather gets uglier. You can find both expensive and affordable apartments in each neighborhood, though as a general rule it’s more expensive the closer to the center you are. When you start searching, you will see Københaven S, V, SV, N, O, K, etc. These refer to the areas of the town, but not the neighborhoods…
I have not even included Vanløsem Brønshøj-Husum, or Bispebjerg, because I’m assuming that if you’re moving to Copenhagen for a short time, you’d rather be in the middle of things.
K CENTER/CENTRUM
Centrum AKA Indre By: Can be a bit more expensive, not good for dogs, full of tourists, but super convenient to get anywhere. Good shopping, restaurants, scenic canals, museums…
VWEST/VEST
Valby: Families and more affordable housing over one big hill from the center. You can even get a whole house out there, I hear! The neighborhood of Carlsberg Byen, right on the edge of Frederiksberg is in heavy construction, and may be a cool area to check out in the next year or two.
Vesterbro and Kødbyen (meat packing): Can be loud, but also super hip and fun. Home to many cafes and bars and boutique shops. I found it hard to find apartments here.
N NORTH/NORD
Nørrebro: One of the most-multicultural neighborhoods in Copenhagen. A bit more crime, but also a lot of amazing culture — food, art, shops, etc. We spend a lot of time here.
Ø EAST/ØST
Østerbro: Quiet and family-friendly with lots of beautiful old character buildings. Close to “the lakes” (not what I think of as lakes, but beautiful for jogging and strolling) and the best bakery in town. All my friends live here.
Nordhavn: lots of newer construction buildings, right on the ocean! I hear the swimming is great.
SSOUTH/SYD
Islands Brygge: Copenhagen charm, if you want to live right on the water. But keep in mind that everyone else also wants to be right on the water all summer.
Amagerbro: A bit more crime here, but affordable and interesting. A short train or bikeride to the center.
Amager: Further out from the center, but closer to the beach, and the airport. Some areas feel pretty soul-less to me with back-to-back office buildings. But, I’m sure there are some awesome affordable apartment gems out here, and a whole lot of nature.
Christianshavn: Home to many houseboats, and also the famous Freetown Christiania. The neighborhood is just across from the center, and close to NOMA, you know, just in case. For cheaper eats, there’s also the new food hall at Reffen nearby.
Sydhavnen: Here there are A LOT of newer buildings that you can get into quickly, which are not too expensive. But, it feels a bit separated from the city by the railroad tracks, and much of this area is still being developed. Pro: it’s also right on the water.
And finally,
FREDERIKSBERGFrederiksberg is an island (figuratively, not literally) in the middle of Copenhagen. Even though it’s quite central, it’s a completely different byen, or city, which means different regulations, street signs, taxes, etc. It’s quiet and convenient, with lots of old character buildings, boutique shops and a gorgeous park. We love it.
My 5 step process to find the best apartments in any city
Start with what you need (and what you want).Whenever my husband and I move to a new place, we spend an hour or so writing up post-its with everything we’d like to have in our new apartment. Usually it’s based on learnings of what we liked or didn’t like in the last place. Once we’ve written everything that we can imagine (it’s light and bright, there’s outdoor space, a bathtub!), we’ll rank them by importance to our quality of life, debating back and forth until we both feel satisfied that this vision of an apartment is representative of our needs, and then our wants. This way, if only one of us is available during househunting, then we also have a good guide to make decisions with.
Know your budget.Choosing an apartment can be a very emotional process, so having an anchor to return to helps when it’s time for serious decision-making. I like to start with a “spending plan” for how much I think I’ll make and spend in my new city/neighborhood, then determine the high and low end of our rental budget, and clarifying what we would be giving up if you went with the high end. Don’t forget to factor in all the moving costs before, during, and after the move, like movers, new furniture, and damage deposits.
Visualize your ideal.Since I’m a visual person and a designer, I also often make a moodboard of what I want the space to look and feel like. It helps me check whether I’ve found the right place, or just a “good enough” place. My husband and I have been building this Moodboard for our House for the last 5 or 6 years, and I think it’s helped us understand each other’s sense of style.
Start early.Before I arrive in a new place, I get on all the local apps and start evaluating the market to find out what’s available, what would be a realistic price range, and how the neighborhoods compare — Airbnb neighborhoods and people who have recently moved to the city can be a good gut check. Many people told us to start trying to rent an apartment before we arrived in Copenhagen, but I think that’s bad advice, because it doesn’t allow you to…
…trust your gut.Now that I know what I can afford, where I’d like to be, and what’s most important to me, it’s time to let my intuition do the work. If it feels too good to be true, or I have a sneaking suspicion that there’s something off, I try to listen to that warning. After all, this is the place we’ll call home.

It was the day before Onam. I was sitting in the beautiful Frederiksberg Gardens in Copenhagen. It was a beautiful sunny day and all around us families were picnicking, children running around, and dogs dozing. This is what I would consider a perfect afternoon and I was soaking in every second of it. But, in the back of my mind I was also thinking about what I would be doing if I was home. (Currently, we do not have a permanent address). I would be cooking dal for Sambhar and chopping vegetables for Avial; defrosting packets of grated coconut to go into each of the five or six dishes I usually make. As an immigrant (now going on 12 years), cooking is how I feel at home. Cooking is, as some might say, my love language. Vishu and Onam are when that instinct comes out in full force. As much as I am enjoying this Europe sojourn, being in a different place every week and even cooking in new kitchens, not having Sadhya on Onam is a recipe for homesickness.
Home is a complicated concept; but one way I think of it is that home is the place where most of my food memories and cravings are anchored. That day in Copenhagen, we had bought a couple of things from a bakery (or bageri) to eat at the park. One of them was a cardamom bun or kardemommabolle which every Copenhagen food blog I consulted had recommended. As I bit into the beautifully glazed and twisted cardamom bun, nostalgia flooded my senses. Although, I had never eaten a kardemommabolle before, it felt so intensely familiar. That mix of sugar and cardamom and the soft melt-in-your-mouth bread, transported me home to Kerala. For a moment, I was a little girl eating one of those buns stuffed with sweetened coconut, flavored with cardamom. It reminded me of other confections that used this formula, now replaced by cakes and cookies in most Kerala bakeries, whose names I have long forgotten.
Food nostalgia can often hit you in unexpected places and ways. The smell of a particular mix of ingredients hitting hot oil, the texture of a dessert, and even the flavor of something you have never eaten before can bring back memories of familiar foods, places, and people. So why had this kardemommabolle transported me from Copenhagen to Kerala?
Cardamom—elam, elakka, elakaya in Malayalam—is the quintessential dessert flavoring in Kerala cuisine. This is not surprising given that some of the world’s best cardamom is grown in Kerala. Cardamom goes into our payasams (delicately flavored milk-based dessert), ela-ada (rice flour pie stuffed with jaggery-sweetened and cardamom spiced coconut filling that is steamed in banana leaves), and unnakaya (steamed and pounded plantain shaped into beautiful oval shapes, stuffed with sweetened and cardamom spiced coconut, then fried). It is used to flavor spiced black tea or Sulaimani of the Malabar region (which in my humble opinion is superior to the milky cardamom tea of the North). It is also used to flavor breads and cakes that became a part of Kerala cuisine, as a legacy of British colonial presence. When I first moved to the US, before Cinnabon kiosks opened up in Indian malls, I was slightly puzzled by the prolific use of cinnamon in American desserts. In Kerala, cinnamon is very much a savory spice. It is cardamom, and occasionally cloves, that are used to flavor sweet treats, although they are also key in savory dishes such as stew and biriyani.
We also revere cardamom for its supposed medicinal properties. You can pop a few pods into your pocket or handbag and chew on the seeds as a mouth freshener or to suppress nausea or motion sickness. Eladi Lehyam, an Ayurvedic paste with cardamom as its main ingredient is used to treat sore throat and cough, and an ubiquitous item in the medicine cabinets of Malayalis. (As I write this, I can almost recall the metallic methol taste of the Lehyam at the back of my throat). Eladi Thailam, or cardamom oil is used for head and body massages. Thus, cardamom is familiar not just to our taste buds, but all our senses. So how did this “queen of spices” make its way to Scandinavia and into the delectable kardemommabolle?
The Danish had some trading posts in India, including the southern port of Tranquebar, which it held as a colony for more than a two-hundred years. (Danish discourse seem to avoid the term colony and refer to Tranquebar as a trading post, but they did build a fort there). In the heyday of Danish East India Trade Company it had factories along the southern coast including—Edava—a town near Varkala, not far from a part of the Western Ghats known as the Cardamom Hills. So does the origin of the delectable Cardamon bun that transported me to Kerala on that Onam-eve lie in Denmark’s trade with South India?
Online sleuthing tells me that the creation of cardamom bun predates Scandinavian presence in Asia. Although I happened to have my first cardamom bun in Denmark, everyone (on the internet) seems to agree that it is a Swedish invention, where it is known as Kardemummabullar. Before the Portuguese explorer, Vasco Da Gama, landed in Calicut on the Malabar coast—my hometown and the heart of the spice trade at the time—spices were coming to Europe via the Middle East. The spice trade is believed to have started as early as 2000 BCE along the silk route, and was over the centuries controlled by Arabs, Venetians, and Genoans. The demand for spices played a key role in creating the first international trade routes and the European quest to cut out middle men and get to the source of the spices was a driving force of the “age of exploration” or as the colonized like us call it — the colonial era. Spices were making their way to Europe and shaping its cuisines well before Europeans themselves arrived at South and Southeast Asian shores in its pursuit.
One theory dates the arrival of cardamom in Sweden all the way back to the time of the Vikings. Supposedly, cardamom was brought back to the region by Viking explorers who made their way to Istanbul (then Constantinople) sometime in the 11th century. Another theory suggests that cardamom was introduced to Scandinavia by the Moors. This theory cites the appearance of cardamom in Scandinavian recipes in the mid-1400s and the “Moorish” influence of those recipes. This of course does not indicate a specific time or place, and might refer to the Maghreb or Al-Andalus. Irrespective of how cardamom first arrived in Scandinavia, Tranquebar and the East India Companies of other European nations (including Sweden) played a part in it becoming an essential part of the cuisine. This “opening up” of the spice trade in the 15th century made cardamom and other spices, which were previously luxury goods meant for the kitchens of the elite, more accessible to working class Europeans, even as it paved the way for the colonization of South and Southeast Asia.
As I was connecting the historical dots of how cardamom made its way from Kerala to Scandinavia, I realized that I had brought my own cache of cardamom there in the form of my homemade garam masala. One of its key ingredients is green cardamom that my aunt gave me on my last trip to Kerala. I made some lovely (even if I say so myself) Malabari biriyani for dinner on one of my nights in Copenhagen.
Copenhagen’s beauty is in both the grandiose and the mundane. Spectacular palaces sit unpretentiously besides old housing blocks with stunning but understated brickwork; Museums housed in old impressive buildings are surrounded by shops selling Danish-designed furniture and home ware that could give any museums a run for their money; verdant home and apartment gardens that look unplanned and wild are no less aesthetic than the many perfectly manicured royal gardens of the city. As much as I loved everything about Copenhagen, it is not the place where I expected to become nostalgic about Kerala (although, we do consider ourselves more understated and subtle in our aesthetics compared to the rest of India).
Food is an archive of history, cultures, and exchange. Food can bring back memories, and reveal connections in the most unexpected ways. This is probably why Food Studies has emerged as a serious field of research to understand culture, migration, history, and politics. As a seafood lover, I enjoyed the many Smørrebrød (open-faced sandwich, usually topped with seafood) that we had in Denmark. But it did not remind me of the fish curries, fish fries, or other seafood dishes that form an essential part of Kerala cuisine. On the other hand, a humble cardamom bun made me nostalgic and sent me down a research rabbit-hole. I am looking forward to having many more of them when I get to Stockholm next week.

We sent podcast host and self-proclaimed “expert on everything” Markus Herrmann on a road trip across Europe to find out how cities embrace the future of urban space. In this episode, we’re in Copenhagen, a city that is known for its incredible bicycle infrastructure. But the Danish capital has more to offer, eg. an artificial ski slope.
When it comes to urban mobility, Copenhagen is immediately mentioned as a prime example. After all, the Danish capital is considered the European capital of cycling. But apart from two-meter-wide cycle paths, what makes the development of the cityscape, and the mobility associated with it, so special?
If you take a look at the figures on bicycles, Copenhagen’s special position quickly becomes clear. An impressive 45 percent of the inhabitants commute to work, school or university by bike, covering around 1.4 million kilometres every day. According to a study, even more people in the Greater Copenhagen area bike to work every day than in the entire USA. There are five times more bicycles than cars in the city center, and only 14 percent of inhabitants drive a car every day.
It’s clear that with so much cycling traffic, new records are being set. The cycle path at Nørrebrogade, for example, is the world’s busiest cycle path, with up to 40,000 cyclists a day. Not only there, but in the entire city area, about 1,000 kilometers of cycle paths provide the right connection. Of these, 200 kilometers alone are high-speed cycle paths — so-called Cykelsuperstier — which are particularly well-developed and designed to prioritize bike traffic. These cycle paths are three meters wide, and the traffic lights along them are synchronized to create a “green wave” so cyclists don’t have to stop at intersections.
But it’s also the small things that show further thought is being given to cyclists here. For example, rubbish bins are oriented diagonally towards the cyclists, and there are footrests at the traffic lights so that cyclists don’t have to get out of their saddles while waiting.
Those who would like to take advantage of the cyclists’ paradise themselves are best served by the city bikes from the Bycyklen public bike hire system. After a short registration, you can rent one of the e-bikes and start cycling right away.
Bycycklen city bikes already have a long tradition in Copenhagen. In May 1995, the first 1000 city bikes rolled through Copenhagen’s streets. And when Bill Clinton came to Denmark for a state visit in 1997, he received the “City Bike One” as an official guest gift.
As progressive as the rental bike system might be, there have still been some unexpected setbacks. Until recently, e-bikes were equipped with tablets, which not only allowed you to rent the bike but also to view a map and information about the surrounding area. Unfortunately, due to heavy vandalism last year, all tablets were removed from the bikes.
Even though Copenhagen is completely flat and it hardly ever snows, there is one rather unexpected way of getting around: downhill skiing! Since the beginning of 2019, Copenhagen has a new landmark, the “CopenHill”. A ski slope was built on the roof of a waste incineration plant, on whose dry ski slope you can ski almost 100 meters down into the valley.
It is hard to believe it, but the waste incineration plant Amager Bakke inside the urban ski slope is one of many building blocks for Copenhagen’s next big goal: the city wants to become climate neutral by 2025. If it succeeds, Copenhagen would be the world’s first CO2-neutral capital. Since 2009, a multi-faceted plan has been underway to achieve this goal. What starts with rather obvious measures such as solar panels on public buildings extends to the optimization of menus in canteens and kindergartens. Copenhagen is on its way to become a sustainable model for the whole world — not only on the cycle path.
Markus Herrmann is a blogger, author, and member of the successful podcast “Gästeliste Geisterbahn”. For Porsche, he is testing the mobility level of the Back 2 Tape metropolises in Europe.
The project “Back 2 Tape” is a cooperation between the Porsche Newsroom and music journalist Niko Backspin. It follows the tracks of hip hop in Europe. All further information on this project can be found in the Porsche Newsroom.
An important note: Markus’ trip through Europe as well as “Back 2 Tape” were produced before the outbreak of COVID-19. Porsche, Backspin and the involved agencies and artists are aware of their social responsibility and advise against such a trip at this time out of consideration for the health and well-being of all people.

I’m from Brazil and I’ve been living in Copenhagen for 2 years. In Brazil we have more than 2000 freshwater fish species, but Pike isn’t one of them and I’ve always wanted to catch big Pike, after watching on TV how violent this fish is.
Looking for Pike in a lake in the middle of the city (Valby, Copenhagen)
I live 3 km away from an urban lake, so it was the first lake I wanted to try fishing in Denmark. Last year, in 2019, I went there 2 times in the summer and didn’t catch anything, and I considered the lake just dead water.
I wanted to give the lake another try in the summer this year, one year after my last trip to it. It was a Saturday in August and I was immediately greeted by a small pike, caught in a small weightless spinner (known in Brazil as “varejeira”) rigged with a bombarda (a kind of float with weight). My first pike ever! I finally crossed this specie off of my list. But still, far away from the big pikes that I saw on TV. Anyway, on this same day, I ended up catching more than 50 small pikes. It was basically one pike per cast!
The next day, Sunday, I got there after lunch and ended up catching dozens of small pikes and even small perches. I decided to move around the lake, until at 18:00, my friend Ricardo cast a small spinner and hooked a big one, which immediately got off the hook, due to how small the lure was. He agreed on me throwing my big wobbler right where he lost the pike and finally, I hooked the big one!
In my mind, it was huge, because I was used to hooking only tiny pikes! Five minutes afterwards, I cast close to where I caught the big one and I hooked one which appeared to be twice bigger than the previous one! Spot on! I finally found the one I was looking for! Even the previous pike could now be considered “small” compared to this one!
Going Bigger
Afterwards, I went there almost on a daily basis after work and hooked medium to big pikes constantly. I even got a reasonably sized one in an ultralight set with 0.08mm braided line (thin as a hair).
One day I decided to try a “pen toy rod” that I bought from China for only US$ 3 and I hooked a lot of small pikes.
Suddenly, I saw a wave nearby, and it was the biggest pike I’ve ever seem. It was just taking a look at the small pikes that I was releasing, in a place where it’s probably 15 to 20cm deep. I switched to my bait casting set and a bigger lure. Unfortunately it ignored all my casts. I switched more than 10 different lures, until I got it… but my fluorocarbon leader was only 0.35mm and it cut the line. I was hectic. I quickly tied another leader (still 0.35mm) and put a 16cm lure, and then I cast in parallel to the shallow area where the pike was. Unfortunately it was gone, it was a sad 5 minutes for me. Anyway, I decided to keep casting the 16cm lure parallel to the shallow surface, until suddenly, I hooked it! After fighting it, I managed to bring it out of the water!
A very long but thin pike. The head itself was bigger than 25cm. My record pike so far! And to think that it all started with the toy rod that day.
Halloween Night Pike Fishing (Going even Bigger)
As a Halloween challenge, I made my own Halloween pike lure and I went night pike fishing at the same lake! The night delivered 3 big pikes, all above 100 cm, where one of them was a BIG FAT MAMA (big curved belly when you hold it), my biggest and heaviest pike, and I wonder if this one is the biggest in that lake? I ended up getting one with my custom lure and 2 with a Danish lure made especially for pikes.
I can now identify the pikes from my local lake from their patterns and from their scars, and I even started calling them by name, because I caught some of the pikes more than once the past 3 months, that’s also the magic and emotion of catch and release! For me, it’s a very happy moment to release the fish and see it swimming back!
Never underestimate your backyard lake!

Part One: Onboarding
Moving to Copenhagen can be pretty overwhelming, and I found all the sequenced steps to be frustratingly unclear. To help you avoid running around in circles, I’ve put together a step-by-step guide to beginning your awesome new life in Copenhagen.
Each step must be done in order, or you risk wasting a lot of time.
Once you have your proof of residency and an address, you’ve unlocked the next set of tasks.
With your NemID and CPR number set up, you are finally eligible to get your yellow card, and set up your online life.
The following steps can be done with a bit more leisure, but most within 90 days of arrival.
Leaving — If you were to ever leave Copenhagen (and really, who would?) you have to go in reverse order and remove yourself from all these systems. Read more here.

The story sounds familiar: A utopian city where the streets are clean, traffic is orderly, and the people are tall, beautiful, and calm. It’s the stuff science fiction novels are made of…
I didn’t have many expectations for each city that we visited during this trip but I had some thoughts going to Copenhagen.
Some quick backstory:
I’ve grown up to with the American work ethic of the “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” kind. So to come to a country where socialism plays an important part of the governing system, it immediately brought thoughts of lazy dependence on an overtaxed government from beatnik no-doers. I should say that most of my understanding of socialism spews from good ‘ole propaganda-filled American public education. It has led me to believe that socialism is THE anti-American way of living and is often told much like a scary bedtime story to caution wayward capitalist children about the tyranny of the Soviet Union. 👻
In reality, Denmark is not a socialist state but rather it upholds a socialist democratic practice. The objective is not for the state to own the means of production but rather it refers to a political philosophy that supports economic and social policies that promote social justice in a capitalist economy in a democratic way. Most people see this through the way they govern a tax-financed health care service. (Universal healthcare 🚑) Others might refer to it as a social welfare country due to its extensive services for children, the elderly and the poor. Denmark also provides special provisions for universal education, support for unions or collective bargaining, and sensible (ostensibly) government regulation of industry to preserve the environment and health and welfare of people within the jurisdiction of the country. Either way you spin it, the country operates with private and publicly run businesses and Copenhagen is considered to be one of the top ranked best city in the world for standard of living. So with that in mind, I came to Copenhagen with a lot of curiosity for the way everything worked and operated.
Here’s a breakdown of our trip to Copenhagen:
We arrived in the late afternoon of our first day. CPH was quite nice and fairly large. Having flown a lot domestically within the US, it was a night/day comparison to see a privately-owned airport. (As compared to the airports owned by the government much like the Port Authority NY/NJ) Even the bus lines are privately owned in Copenhagen and I was mostly impressed by the clear signage, cleanliness, and on-time reliability.
We decided to purchase the 72-hour CityPass ticket to get around on public transit since it encompassed the entirety of our stay in Copenhagen. (We got in late our first day and left at noon on our last for a total of three days.) Public transit is a bit pricey here. A one-way ticket throughout the 3-zones that the city encompasses is $36 DK or $5.39 USD. So to purchase their $200 DK 72-hour card, it only cost about $30 USD for three days. We didn’t rent bikes this time around but rather walked. If I return again, I would rent a bike for the entirety of our stay since the city was very bike friendly and central to most points of interest.
Our Airbnb was conveniently located just a few blocks from the Nørrebro Station. Thom and I really enjoyed our stay there. Our guests were very welcoming and the apartment was very comfortable. If you follow me on any other social media, then you’d know that I’ve already posted a short video of our stay.
A lot of the time making this video was spent find creative ways to shoot still video without a tripod though. 😝
The location of our Airbnb was absolutely great! Again, we were very close to public transit but also a short walk away from The Lakes, Copenhagen’s Botanical Gardens and parks, grocery stores, and the famous Torvehallerne.
On our first evening, we walked over the Lakes and ate at Thai Pan. I’ll admit that food is a bit pricey in Copenhagen in general, but this restaurant had a great three-course menu that provided us with a lot of leftovers for the next day. They make a super tasty coconut soup with chicken and mushrooms. That alone was well-worth the price and trip!
Also that first night, I received the best email that I could ever imagine:
Noma has an open spot for you and one other to dine on the following day. Would we care to join?
WOULD WE CARE TO JOIN??!! WOULD WE EVER!
I think that I’ll save that experience for it’s own special post since the meal was over 3.5 hours long and consisted of 14 courses and a tour of the kitchen and grounds. Long story short:
It. was. amazing. 😍
The other two days we spent walking around site-seeing. We visited:
One place that we did not have time to see was Tivoli Gardens. I still don’t know if I regret this or if this was something to easy miss. I haven’t been to a theme park since my short visit to Disney World over three years ago. The idea of long lines, large crowds, and rollercoasters just doesn’t appeal like it used to when I was 14. But Tivoli is one of the world’s oldest theme parks and has some beautiful gardens. If I had the chance again, I think that I would go to see and visit the grounds alone.
Here are some shots from our stay in Copenhagen:
Some shots around Christiania. You aren’t allowed to photograph some parts within the free state:
Out and about Copenhagen, including: The Lakes, Botanical Gardens, and Nyhavn:
And that was it! An overall great impression of the city. What really stuck out to me was the overall infrastructure of the city and how well maintained it is. I enjoyed the serenity found in the heart of the city and loved the fact that people were out and about strolling in the parks or by the Lakes late into the evenings. My only criticism is the near-perfect state of everything. There weren’t any brash forms of expression of any kind whether through the city itself or it’s people. It’s of no surprise that a place like Christiania had established it self so long ago. It acts as the only visual protest of all the conformity found throughout the rest of Copenhagen. Even staying in the multicultural Nørrebro neighborhood, I felt that there was a tragic loss of diversity, especially compared to places like Berlin and Amsterdam. (SO many blonde-haired, blue-eyed people everywhere in Copenhagen!)
It’s truly a give and take with this city with this ultimately in mind: High prices for a better standard of living.
My last take: Not to live in, but I would visit again.
This post is a part of a series based on my recent two-week trip to Europe.

In June, the Civic Commons Learning Network in partnership with the Better Block Foundation hosted Civic Commons Learning Journey: Copenhagen, a four-day study trip that immersed learning network members in the public life, policy and culture of the city. Through explorations of the city by bike and frank conversations with local leaders on the work they are pursuing, we considered how the city is building and sustaining public assets that deliver more public value. On our final day in Copenhagen, we hosted a workshop session to distill learning from the two dozen participants representing Akron, Detroit and Philadelphia.
Here are 10 key lessons from the trip:
Copenhagen is known as being one of the most liveable cities in the world. But it wasn’t always this way. In the early ’90s, the city faced bankruptcy. Seeing a bleak future, the leaders of the city came together to create several strategies for change. One of these was to focus on pilot projects. The city began to expand and scale pedestrian street conversions originally built in the 1960s and parking lots that, in the 1980s, had been transformed into public squares. The goal was to create visible changes quickly that would encourage the citizens to come together. Just as important as the pilot projects was following up with permanent investments when the pilots proved successful.
In the ’60s, many cities around the world expanded their freeway infrastructure by building elevated highways. But when this idea was proposed in Copenhagen people protested. In the ’90s, when the city was nearing bankruptcy and had little money to invest, it put the money where it could be stretched — toward bicycling infrastructure.
Copenhagenize, which highlights cycling life in Copenhagen, said that because infrastructure investments of the ’60s and ’90s made it easier to bike, more people started biking. In fact, now 56 percent of Copenhageners use a bike every day. By making bicycling the most convenient option, and by keeping the cycling infrastructure simple and legible, Copenhagen has made biking the easiest, fastest and cheapest mode of transportation. “Copenhageners are just as lazy as you are,” said Morten Kabell, COO of Copenhagenize. “Fifty percent of us only ride a bicycle because the city of Copenhagen has made it fast and easy.”
In Denmark, design is everything. Every single element of every single space has been designed with the user in mind. One small example: trash cans. Each trash can has a lip on the outside for cans and glass. This way, it’s easier for people who need those items to grab them for recycling.
The city has also found ways to maximize its spaces by taking down the fences and designing areas to support a wide variety of activities. An example: a large courtyard next to a marketplace that serves as both a schoolyard playground and common space with a basketball court. During lunch, multiple worlds collide in one cohesive space. And in terms of policy, the city is redesigning all of its schoolyards to be fenceless so they are open and welcoming to the community.
We ended our trip at Gehl Architects, where Mayra Madriz talked through the firm’s approach to building cities, highlighting the importance of design. “Consider urban life before urban space and urban space before buildings,” Mayra said.
Copenhagen’s architecture policy promotes a people-first approach. Chief City Architect Tina Saaby holds position of influence, advising politicians and city administrators alike. When a development proposal crosses her desk, her first question is, “Who is the landscape architect?” She recognizes that the space between buildings is where public life either thrives or fails to thrive.
When a crisis faces Copenhagen, the city’s response often comes in the form of investments in public life. While bankruptcy spurred some of the best bike infrastructure in the world, climate change catalyzed the concept of cloud burst parks. This network of green public spaces mitigates flooding by holding and filtering excess water. They also serve as a natural playscape.
For significant neighborhood-wide investments, the project managers from the city’s urban planning department don’t do their jobs from city hall or in an administrative building downtown. Instead, they work in the neighborhood’s culture house. For example, Eva Christensen and Sia Boensen, project managers in the neighborhood of Nørrebro, lead a diverse team of architects, planners and social scientists who will be based in the community for six years. Their mission involves co-creating a set of projects. Together with neighbors, they’ll reimagine Hans Tavsens Park as a cloud burst park that combines stormwater management with recreation, complete neighborhood-wide transportation planning and develop safe streets. But the city and the planning team see their work as much more than capital projects. The team is also interested in understanding existing social networks and the exploring the connecting between infrastructure investments and building social capital.
Whimsy. That was the one word that kept coming to mind when visiting the various parks and public spaces throughout Copenhagen. Trampolines embedded in sidewalks are just the start. Each park was unique, playful and a reflection of the neighborhood that surrounded it. For example, Monstrum, a playground design company, created the Crooked Houses in the Brumbley neighborhood. The houses can be climbed in and on, slid down and crawled between. They are a near-identical reflection of the neighborhood homes, yet slightly topsy-turvy.
But the parks in Copenhagen aren’t just about kids. They allow for unexpected moments of joy, relaxation and, in some cases, the thrill of fear for all ages. At Folkets Park, for example, a bridge was designed that wasn’t reflective of the community’s needs, so a new designer transformed the bridge into a parkour course. The bridge has self-moderating aspects (such as a second step that is too high for most children to make) to keep it safe while still allowing for a thrill. And many parks offer cafe kiosks for adults to buy a coffee and chat with a friend or a stranger.
From Torvehallerne to Reffen by Copenhagen Street Food, there is no shortage of great food markets in Copenhagen. These sites are serving as on-ramps for entrepreneurs to test their products. They make it easier for vendors to focus on their products, while providing shared services like bathrooms, seating, trash, permitting and marketing. They also happen to be public spaces capable of attracting people from every background, if they keep an eye on price points to ensure they remain welcoming to all. Reffen’s founder, Dan Husted, has proven his concept once before with a temporary food court that gained acclaim. He hopes to do the same with this new concept in a forgotten area. “We decide the primary colors, then we invite the public to paint the canvas,” he says.
Jacob Hartmann is an instigator turned city bureaucrat, and his Sharing Copenhagen mini-grants capture a spirit of “yes” in a way not often seen in municipal government. The grants are tied to the vision for the city and allow everyday citizens to test new ideas for change, from a floating sauna to a pop-up farm to a program that encourages hitchhiking. And when the easy answer is “no,” we can’t allow for that, he works with urban innovators to get to “maybe” — and sometimes asks for permission later. From inside city government, he has developed a program that fosters active citizen engagement in making the city more sustainable, and more fun.
Nearly every city has them: natural features that were once polluted and still carry the stigma of being dirty and unsafe. Just 15 years ago, the water in Copenhagen’s harbour was so polluted that it posed a health risk. Alongside unsexy municipal efforts to make the waters clean, like wastewater treatment plants and a modernized sewage system, the city also made public space investments like the harbour baths, parks and pathways along the water that have drastically changed the use and narrative of this waterfront. Now harbour baths are packed on warm summer days, a bicycle chef uses a harbourside spot as his homebase and a maritime education center cultivates oysters and mussels in the urban waterways.
There are many reasons Copenhagen is studied, imitated and beloved. The bicycling infrastructure alone makes it something to strive for. However, the city is not perfect. No city is. While we experienced many beautiful examples of infrastructure, public space and collaboration in Copenhagen, we were jarred by the discussion of race, immigration and who truly belonged. Or, perhaps, by the lack of discussion. In some of our conversations and experiences in the city, multiculturalism was characterized as a burden, rather than a value. This article offers context for what we witnessed.
It was a stark reminder of why Reimagining the Civic Commons holds socioeconomic mixing as a goal for public space investments. Bringing people of all backgrounds to share in public life and build trust will not happen without intention.
We realized that, while we went to Copenhagen to study and be inspired, our demonstrations cities are inspirational, too. Through their approach to revitalizing and connecting public assets, they are setting a new standard for advancing civic engagement and “creating the welcome.” This realization reflects the value of learning journeys: they create moments for team members to experience, to learn, and to reflect on our shared work with a fresh perspective.

Copenhagen is the best of Europe distilled into one city, the continent at its most perfect.
From the airport, we take the metro, a clean, modern train, glass-walled to let in the pale sunlight. The airport was like this too, not the gray, military aesthetic of Reykjavik where we had a layover, but a space with curves and glass and white paint.
The ride reminds me that I’m back in Europe. Well-dressed people in coats and scarves and shoes that click against the ground step on and off. The train moves with an almost silent whir down tracks that look new but must be at least a century old. Outside, red-brick houses flash by that make me think of England: the same gabled, tiled roofs, the same compactness.
Our hostel is in the Nørrebro district, at the end of a long, connected row of 19th century red-brick buildings. On the way, we pass falafel and shawarma places, cool, dark bars in tiny storefronts, and well-lit cafes where people work on laptops. There’s at least one bike shop on every street so far, and special bike lanes separated from the road where the cyclists breeze by with enviable nonchalance.
The hostel is simultaneously hip and cozy: long wooden tables, old, circular metal lamps shining dark yellow light, and a bar that sells both coffee and beer. Large windows look out onto the quiet street, where a row of parked bikes points down to a 19th century building, mostly brick but renovated to include a glass elevator, and a church on the adjacent block looming against the gray sky.
We check in with the receptionist, who like everyone here looks at once elegant and casual, with blonde hair in a ponytail and the sleeves of her gray sweater rolled up to reveal forearm tattoos. Our room is in a separate building, and we get there by following a trail of sheep painted onto the sidewalk.
Out primal need is sleep, but after washing up, we head out to find food. Yelp suggests a “toast bar” which proves to be excellent, with dark, rich coffee and sandwiches smothered in various melted cheeses. The barista is a guy with a beanie, a beard, and tattoos who talks in a loud, echoing voice and looks like he runs a bike shop part-time. There are a few others in the cafe, but two are on laptops and the other two are a couple who aren’t talking, which gives the room a strange silence. We sit at the window, where a candle drips white wax onto the counter. Outside, bundled up pedestrians walk small dogs. In the building facing us, a guy stands at the window, having an intense cell-phone conversation. Across the street is another cafe, with a black exterior, a dark interior, and a small chalkboard sign advertising pricey lunch specials. To the left is a park with a modernist sculpture of twisted metal bars and a brick apartment building with the words “FREE GAZA” written in large, white block letters.
At one point, the two women working on their laptops go outside to smoke. They leave their jackets inside and stand huddled in their sweaters, breathing out a mix of smoke and cold breath.
From there, we walk down to what I at first think is a river or a canal but later learn is an artificial lake, created back in the Middle Ages. Across the water, the houses have that grand, 19th century look: mansard roofs, symmetrical windows, brick and stucco painted various shades of red and white. They go on endlessly down the bank and remind me of Budapest, but with warmer colors. People walk dogs and linger along the grass and feed the swans. A couple sits on a bench, talking about sex in Danish-accented and perfectly articulate English. I notice that everyone in Copenhagen is as young as we are, as if the city exists only for millennials. Los Angeles by contrast always feels slightly older, a city for tired people in their late thirties and early forties.
We cross the lake at a large embankment, along a pedestrian path separated from the busy street by trees and manicured shrubbery and past a large white pavilion, late 19th or early 20th century, situated along the water. On the other side of the lake, the street becomes H.C. Andersens Boulevard, and the buildings are bigger are more varied. Across the street is a brick building that’s an unfortunate mix of architectural styles — a neo-Gothic crenelated tower centered between two large, gabled roofs, like an orphanage from a Dickens’ novel, 19th century kitsch — and beyond it rise the flat roofs of the 20th century and the shining glass walls of the 21st. We walk leisurely down the sidewalk in these buildings’ shadows while everything breezes by us, the bikes and the cars and the pedestrians walking briskly in coats and scarves, all moving with a comforting urban indifference.
Traffic here is the densest we’ve seen in Denmark, as busy as Wilshire or Santa Monica Boulevard. Somehow, though, it all seems more orderly, less chaotic, as if like everything else here, it too is better regulated.
#
In the center of the city and across from the train station sits Tivoli Gardens, an 1840s-era amusement park supposedly built to distract the country’s population from protesting the absolute monarchy, now bedecked with Christmas lights and related items: trees, gnomes, snowmen, a building lined with several austere Nutcrackers, a wooden reindeer that looks like a Trojan Horse, a strange mirrored wall mounted with polar bear heads wearing Santa hats. There are lots of children about, and the adults are mostly mothers in groups pushing strollers, or young couples enjoying the kitsch. The park is like Disneyland, and was in fact one of the inspirations, though it’s smaller and quainter and less corporate. There are different sections corresponding to regions of the world — some pagodas representing either China or Japan, domed mosques for the Middle East or India, a lighthouse and a pirate ship possibly signifying Europe. It’s only vaguely and benignly racist, and nothing out of the ordinary for the 19th century. Bronze statues from that era are sprinkled throughout the park, including one of the founder, Georg Carstensen, looking proud and dapper with his mustache and top hat.
We stroll leisurely through the crowds, past food stands and stores selling magnets and memorabilia. I buy a glogg, which tastes pleasantly warm on a day this cold, though the best part is getting to recycle the plastic cup in one of the futuristic red kiosks, which lowers my cup down into the void with a mechanical whir and then gives me back 5 kroner. It’s an extremely practical and efficient solution to incentivize recycling, which is probably why the United States would never use it.
In the middle of the park we find an octagonal glass theater, a replica of one built in the late 1800s, which Nazi sympathizers burned down in the 1940s. Out beyond the walls of Tivoli, meanwhile, rises city hall, red brick towers capped with green spires, built in the early 20th century but speaking much more of the 1600s.
In this moment, I feel very close to the past. Like the crenelations on city hall, it feels like a ring surrounding us. Take away the phones and the electric lights and make the coats longer and give everyone top hats and we might as well be in the 1800s when the park first opened. Take away the park and give everyone ruffled collars and we’d be in the 1600s. Only 600 years before that, and we’d all be Vikings in huts.
#
The National Gallery, or the Statens Museum for Kunst, is across the city, though still within walking distance. It’s colder now, so we pull our scarves tighter as we walk down the empty streets. Soon we reach the white stone of Christiansborg Palace, and across the canal from it, along Nybrogade, a row of picturesque 17th and 18th century houses, narrow and built against each other, painted red and white and dark-brown. The sunset above streaks the sky with wisps of purple and brings out the color of each building. Even the yellow construction crane is more vivid and seems a remnant of past centuries.
We reach a small bridge and cross it into a Christmas market selling gnome statues and wooden souvenirs, and food of course. I smell sausages and see mushrooms simmering in a vat of butter. Behind me, the sun dips behind two rows of houses on opposite sides of a canal, and paints the whole scene, including a distant bronze statue, in a cold, yellow light — a sunset-hued cityscape, postcard-perfect, on all sides colors like an artist’s palette.
The city darkens as we move across it, past contemporary shops and dark streets and cyclists. It’s only 4:00, but it feels much later. A languor settles over us, and I remember our lack of sleep.
We reach Rosenborg Slot, Christian IV’s 17th century palace, and we walk across the park behind it, down a path lined with trees whose bare branches meet overhead. The castle looks romantically sinister silhouetted through the trees, but also small, “like a toy castle” K______ says, especially next to the block-long 19th century houses stretching down the parallel street. The park and the castle remind me of Oxford — a small patch of the past preserved despite the various encroaching presents pushing in from all around.
Just past the park is the museum, a grand, 19th century building reminiscent of museums from Britain, built to reflect the glory of the nation, or whatever. We’re both tired and cold, but on the walk up the large steps I feel exhilaration.
Inside, we find familiar European art. There’s a Titian portrait of a gentleman staring thoughtfully off to the left, a painting by a follower of Bosch of tiny figures against a bleak brown landscape, and quite a few Lucas Cranachs — various women with big heads and weird chins, and one work titled Melancholy depicting three oddly shaped infants trying to push a stone ball through a hoop with sticks while a winged woman watches them wistfully and several witches ride goats in a distant corner. But the highlights of the museum are the Danish pieces, a tour through one of the lesser known traditions of European art. In the first room are portraits of Danish royals from the 17th century and 18th century, all painted by the same Swedish-born court painter, C.G. Pilo, and opposite them, portraits of the bourgeoisie by Jens Juel, the most prominent one of an odd-looking middle-class family standing before a plantation. The room’s juxtaposition is perfect, ingeniously displaying the fundamental change of the 18th century, the rise and triumph of the bourgeoisie in all their awkward glory.
The next room has allegorical and historical paintings, and the following room works from the Romantic Era inspired by Caspar David Friedrich. A late-19th century room has some vaguely orientalist paintings of reclining women by Elisabeth Baumann and a wonderful work by Carl Bloch, of a man and two women eating dinner at a table and staring in surprise back at the viewer, their wine carafes tellingly half-empty, a guilty look on the man’s face. I assume his wife must be the viewer, having just caught him in the early stages of what might have become a threesome.
There’s also a beautiful late-19th century piece by J.F. Willumsen, titled En bjergbestigerske (A Mountain Climber), of a woman in a white sweater standing in front of a mountain, her walking stick leaning casually behind her, her cloak hanging lightly off her shoulders, and her hip thrust to the side as she looks boldly into the distance. According to the plaque, Willumsen’s artistic movement was called vitalism, and vitality is exactly what the woman gives off. She is more alive than the inert, distant mountains, a triumph of humanity over nature, her fierce stare made bolder by the vaguely impressionistic style of the piece, the soft colors and the murky brush strokes.
Finally, there’s a room of paintings by Vilhelm Hammershøi: cold, melancholy portraits of empty artist’s studios and solitary women, like sad Vermeers. Everything is cast over in a gray-blue pallor, all bleak, forlorn — how appropriate for the dawn of the 20th century.
We leave around 6:00 PM, very tired now, and buy falafel and shawarma from near our apartment. We eat in the hostel common room, quickly, not talking, plastic bags and foil strewn everywhere. Back in our rooms, we shower and are asleep by 8:00.

Biking in Copenhagen is exhilarating. We sail without much effort along cold winds, over bridges, down through old buildings, along wall-paved, separated bike lanes. Cold air whips at my face and nose and my poorly wrapped scarf comes untangled in the wind, but it all feels glorious moving among the herd of cyclists, not worrying about passing cars, feeling safety in numbers. We stop at an intersection behind a cluster of ten bikes, mostly young people like ourselves, some mothers with babies strapped into tiny seats, a few older men who look fitter than me, everyone leaning gracefully to one side as they wait for the light to change.
#
Christiansborg Palace, the old seat of the monarchy and the current seat of Parliament, is largely a lesser-Versailles, a 20th-century reconstruction of the site’s various older palaces which all burned down. But amidst the standard set of stately and filigreed reception rooms we find the Great Hall, a room whose expensive chandeliers and 18th century allegorical ceiling are belied by the floor tiles’ 20th-century black and white pattern and, the room’s highlight, the 17 ultra-modern tapestries. They chronicle Denmark’s history, from the Viking era to the 21st century, and are done in a self-consciously non-Western style, reminiscent of Diego Rivera’s murals in Mexico City, with vivid, wild colors, bright reds and dark greens and deep purples. We take our time before several of them, using the laminated guides to identify the various figures. Some names I know — the Viking Kings Ragnar Lothbrok and Harald Bluetooth, the Arab traveler Ibn Fadlan, Margaret “the Lady King” of the medieval Kalmar Union — but most are unrecognizable, a rush of history that swirls together in all the bright color.
There’s one tapestry titled “The Future” depicting two men in suits hovering in a nebula of blue and purple, surrounded by floating microbes and crystals and drawings of atoms and solar systems, “the bionic men” as K______ calls them. The irony of course is that Denmark already is the future: a country with safe bike lanes and universal healthcare and free higher education and a minimum wage twice as high as the United States and 5 weeks paid vacation and 32 weeks paid family leave and 85% voter turnout and overall some of the happiest people in the world.

The National Museum has an impressive collection of historical artifacts. We spend most of our time on the bottom floor, amidst the pre-Viking stuff, prehistoric arrowheads and cerated harpoons and burnt animals bones offered as ritual sacrifices. There are large skeletons of an aurochs and an elk, and a grave from 5000 BC with the bones of a 40-year-old woman and her 3-year-old child. The description tell us she survived several blows to the head.
Farther down we reach the Bronze Age, where we find more bodies and objects preserved in bogs or unearthed from barrows: swords, helmets, shields, jewelry, a wooden folding chair from 1400 BC, a tree-trunk coffin from 1370 with the remains of the Egtved Girl, her ragged clothing, bits of her skin and teeth, and a large bronze belt. Later, in the Iron Age we find a metal carriage pulled up from a bog, with large wheels and small decorative details, and following that the Gundestrup cauldron, a large silver bowl decorated with strange non-Viking figures and animal imagery, evidence of Denmark’s early connections with the wider world. Beyond them, finally, is the Viking era, where we find shining swords and shields, drinking horns of various sizes, large rune stones etched with unfamiliar letters, and the remnants of a wooden longboat.
The museum’s most interesting item, though, is the Trundholm sun chariot, from 1800 BC: a bronze statue of the sun pulled along in a chariot by a small horse. The sun is still gilded on one side and shines brightly in the dark museum gallery
I find this evidence of Bronze Age spirituality particularly fascinating. In our modern world the word “religion” has developed such negative connotations, dogmatism, stupidity, intolerance. But everything in this museum, from this chariot to the Early Modern allegorical ceilings on the floor above us to the animal bones in the Paleolithic room, show the need for some kind of religion — perhaps not the ones we have today, that speak of abstract principles of righteousness and morality, but ones like these, of people who viewed the afterlife and the supernatural in the literal terms of their own small worlds, who buried themselves with the physical objects they imagined they might need in whatever awaited them hereafter.
What would we be buried with, I wonder? Our phones perhaps?
#
Later, at the Christiansborg Palace stables, I notice how similar the royal carriages look to the iron age wagon pulled up from the bog.
#
We walk back along Rantzausgade, looking for a place to eat. Signs of Danish coziness are everyone, people visible in windows seated around a table, not bundled up like we are, candles before them, all eating and drinking slowly while relaxing and talking, signs of community, of warmth, inviting from the cold. We see one such group in a well-lit interior, drinking wine around half-empty plates, and I can’t tell if it’s a restaurant or just young people having dinner at home. Because of all the glass walls and big windows, at night every interior becomes so well lit, so easy to see from the street. The lack of privacy feels deliberate, as if as if projecting this image of coziness is part of the charm of the city.
We find a small place, run by a woman who both cooks and takes orders. We sit at the well-lit window, next to the dark street and split a hummus sandwich, vegan chili, and a nice, fruity Danish IPA. Afterwards, K______ goes to sleep, but I stay up in hostel with a pilsner and write. Around me is the same atmosphere I saw in all the windows. A group of Spanish tourists are chatting at my long table, everyone in sweaters rolled up at the sleeves, their scarves and jackets piled on a chair in the corner. A candle flickers in a holder amidst their beers, and mellow music plays from overhead. I feel a pleasant warmth from the outside cold.
#
The buildings on the canal-side streets of Christianshavn are nicer, richer — some are older, painted red and ochre, and some are made of brick, and along the waterfront are a few modern apartments, red stone reinforced with black metal.
Nearby is an 18th century warehouse, a long, beige, brick building, bland, unassuming, rectangular. Now it houses an art gallery and the Michelin-starred restaurant Noma, supposedly the best in the world. Dinner there would have been 2000 KR (roughly 250 dollars) each, for 6 courses. Another tourist couple are taking pictures under the sign. It’s not yet open, and the inside is mostly dark, save for the candles flickering in the window. A white shape, probably a waiter, moves in the shadows beyond the yellow flames.
Beside the warehouse is an old wooden, ship, tied to the dock and resting silently in the water. A man sits on it, eyes closed, so still he’s almost part of the boat. Against the contemporary black steel of the apartment behind it, the ship looks particularly ancient.
The warehouse’s art gallery features an Icelandic artist, whose work deals with water and climate change and methods of measurement. One of the sculptures on the second floor is a ticking clock, which echoes through the bright and empty room.
Because of the new light wood flooring and the white, newly painted walls, it’s hard to imagine this gallery as a warehouse. I try to see the sacks of grain and barrels of herring that would have lined the walls, ready to load onto merchant ships like the one outside — but I can’t. The space seems like it was built not in 1767 but in 2015, as an artistic aperitif for the haute-bourgeois diners of Noma.
#
We have lunch at Copenhagen Street Food — a hipster food market located in a former paper factory — and then bike farther north towards Refshaleøen, an old industrial area that our guidebook recommended, now mostly used for warehouse parties. The ride up takes us off the main road and along a smaller bike path that winds between broad, grassy plains, and past varied and interesting buildings, some contemporary glass and steel, some pre-industrial brick and stone. We cross a small bridge, and a large fluttering Danish flag comes into view, and below it a statue of what looks like a merman holding aloft a smaller Danish flag, angled forward, like he’s carrying it into battle. In the distance is a strange-shaped factory, a square metal hulk with a rounded top, sending darkish-white smoke up into the grey sky. The sun is still hidden, as it has been all day, and the air is bitterly cold, but the sense of adventure is enough to keep us going. Wind whips at my face, my nose is numb, my cheeks stinging, and I can feel the cold through my gloves as they’re stretched across the handlebars — but we’re moving so quickly, flying around concrete roads, bouncing across gravel, following the memory of a Google Map through an unfamiliar landscape, past signs we can’t read, the grey warehouses growing larger ahead of us. Only a few cars pass us, one or two vans, one bus, a handful of cyclists, and so it feels to us as though the landscape is all ours, Denmark a private playground.
We reach the end of a gravel road, where it meets the water. Behind us is the Mikkeler warehouse. Cinder blocks lie stacked outside the sheds and a few old cars sit empty and rusting. Everything is quiet now, and the warehouse windows dark, and no one is about expect the solitary biker who’d pulled up to a building somewhere behind us. We walk our bikes across old metal tracks which run along the gravel next to the concrete barrier separating us from the water. It’s quiet, peaceful, and majestic, to look out across the water at the row of brick buildings, now the familiar skyline of Copenhagen, the grey sky bringing out their pre-modern red. Behind us, the word “Refshaleøen” looms, written in big black letters across a gray factory building.
We take in the landscape for several long moments, our hearts still beating from our bike ride. Evidence of history stands all around us, the 18th and 19th centuries in brick out across the water, the 20th in metal stretching out behind us — but right now, it feels emphatically like the present, nothing else but 21st century, and I don’t wish we were anytime else.
After a moment, a white car turns a corner to our right and approaches us with bright headlights. The spell broken, we mount our bikes and ride back into the city.
#
From there we bike to Nyhavn then up to Amalienborg Palace, where the queen lives. We watch the guards in blue and black doing a march, which makes me think of England and Buckingham Palace. The idea of monarchy seems even more absurd up here.
From there we go inside the large church we’d seen from across the canal. It’s big and grand, but I don’t feel impressed, perhaps because Christianity hasn’t figured so prominently here. It may be the country’s Protestantism, but also probably that the religion in general only reached Scandinavia in the late 900s. It’s been Protestant almost as long as it’s been Catholic, and it was pagan up until almost the Crusades. A thousand years of Church history and tradition don’t even exist here. Warehouses seem better symbols of Copenhagen than churches.
From there, we go to the Danish Design Museum, where we find among other things an exhibit on chairs. “The chair is one of the most culture-bearing objects we ever invented,” the description says. “It reveals everything about the age and society in which it was created.” A folding chair from the 20th century makes me think of the folding chair from the bog we saw yesterday at the history museum — as with the carriages, a consistency from past to present.
From there, we bike up to the Little Mermaid Statue. The sun has almost set now, and to our right over green hills rises a stone church, beautifully backlit against the fading day. We pass though the Kastellet, a star fortress from the 1600s, the walls now mostly crumbling stone. We walk our bikes between quaint red buildings and watch three soldiers conduct a flag ceremony. They look like Boy Scouts rather than grown men.
The Mermaid is naked, like a Greek statue, and very sad, sitting atop a pile of rocks and looking longingly out across the water. It’s 4:30 now, and practically dark. Across the canal, we can see Refshaleøen, where we just were, the black letters written on the gray building. It seems so far to have come in just half a day.
#
Rosenborg Palace is dark and poorly lit, as expected in a 17th century building, and outside the latticed windows rain falls from a gray sky. But inside, the various royal treasures sparkle: gilded chests, fine wooden cabinets, small objects of ivory and amber, paintings ranging from humble landscapes to wild allegories to austere portraits of men, women, and horses, all in all an impressive collection that takes us from the castle’s construction in 1606 under Christian IV to the end of Denmark’s absolute monarchy in 1848. On the top floor is the throne room with antechambers holding the King’s collections of glass and porcelain, and in the basement is the royal treasury, with crowns and scepters and gold rings. The palace’s most interesting object, though, is tucked away in a small glass case against a wall of one of the 19th century rooms: the pen King Frederick VII used to sign the 1849 constitution.
Afterwards, we go to the Worker’s Museum where instead of rooms glorifying individual Kings we find a space honoring the nameless millions of the 20th century. In the central hall where union leaders once met hang the flags of various labor organizations, most of them a vivid, socialist red against the beige walls. In one of the exhibits in the basement, several old union flags have been stitched together into a single red banner, now reading “HOPE NOT FEAR”.
One of the rooms has a small exhibit on Thorvald Stauning, Denmark’s first social democratic prime minister, elected in 1924, and the country’s longest serving PM of the 20th century. He came from a working class background and trained as a cigar sorter before getting involved in politics. We stare at his big, bearded face in some surprise. As we’d just learned, Denmark had still been an absolute monarchy only 74 years before. And now, 90 years after, it’s one of the world’s preeminent social democracies.
If Denmark can change that much so quickly, then why can’t we, the United States, already born as a republic?
#
The only thing that frustrates us here in Denmark is the small window for lunch. It’s 3:00 and we’re wandering Kødbyen, the former meatpacking district in Vesterbro, going warehouse to warehouse only to find that most of the bourgeois restaurants are closed until dinner at 6:00. The fish place our guidebook recommended is open till 3:30, but it looks too expensive. The Indian restaurant does take-out only. A pub serving beer and burgers is open all day, but it looks like something we could find in Los Angeles. Eventually, at 3:30, we sit down in a packed Italian place. Neither of us particularly wants Italian food, but we’re both hungry. After ten minutes, though, the waiters still haven’t brought us menus, so we get up and leave. The waitress gives us an irritated look as we button up our coats.
We eat ultimately at Øl & Brød, a slightly upscale lunch place attached to the Mikkeller bar we were at earlier, open till 4:00. The tables have white tablecloths and the clientele is mostly older, except for a group of six posh guys in their early 20s, all wearing sweaters over button-downs and with the same expensive haircut, like some Danish version of the Bullingdon Club. We’re too hungry to bother converting the prices on the menu until after we order. The food is delicious: 3 open faced sandwiches (smørrebrød) and a savory chicken tartelet filled with gravy.
When the bill comes, we have just enough cash to cover it.
#
One our final day, we wait on the empty platform for our mid-morning train to Stockholm. It was warmer earlier, and even a little sunny — but now the sky is gray again and the temperature dropping.
Now and then a train passes with the smooth sound of sliding metal, and the occasional bundled up pedestrian or cyclist moves by on the street above. But for the most part everything is quiet and almost desolate. The tracks would be abandoned-looking if they weren’t so pristine and well-maintained. But this ghost-town quality is an appropriate way to bid farewell to Copenhagen, as we felt it several times over the last few days, from Nørrebro to Refshaleøen to Kødbyen. As always, everyone must be inside now, staying warm behind the yellow lights.
In looking at all the buildings, I can’t help, of course, but note the mix of centuries: the brick train station of the early 20th century in the foreground, the elegant mansard roofs of the 19th century repeating down along the street, the distant concrete of the late 20th century, and out beyond the floating glass and steel of today.
Dominating the horizon is the ugly SAS hotel, a Le-Corbusier-inspired tower of misguided modernity. There was a brief section on it in the Design Museum, about how when it was constructed in the 1950s, the architect Arne Jacobsen sincerely believed it would be the pinnacle of architectural form, functionalism perfected. It looks even worse here than similar buildings do in the United States, too clumsy next to the elegant brick or the floating glass. But considering everything else we saw, its imperfection is forgivable.

Back in 2014, the news in Copenhagen was that the modal share bikes exploded between 2012 and 2013, from 36% to 45%. A whopping 9% increase in people arriving at a destination in the City of Copenhagen for work or education. That had never happened anywhere before. At the same time, the modal share for motorists fell from 27% to 23%.
We were in the midst of one of the greatest urban transport experiments in the world, and didn’t really realise it.
For years I’ve espoused the benefits of following the simple traffic planning guide at the top of this article. Prioritise the three, inherently inter-modal transport forms on the left — bikes, pedestrians and public transport — and make driving a car a pain the ass. Make it the slower option, make it more expensive and difficult, and you’re on your way to a bright transport future. I call it A2Bism. It’s what every human who has ever lived wants the most: to go quick from A to B. Humans are like rivers — we’ll always seek out the quickest route.
So what happened between 2012 and 2013 in Copenhagen? The City made it a pain in the ass to drive a car. Not on purpose, mind you. The construction of a new Metro line, with 17 stations, was underway and, in a glorious coincidence of bad municipal communication, the city also dug up streets to upgrade the pipes for our district heating. The city was one big squiggly line — primarily for cars. In biannual surveys since the 1990s, a continuous majority of Copenhageners have declared that their primary reason for riding a bike is the fact that it’s the quickest way from A2B. The City inadvertently enabled them to go to the next level, at the expense of car traffic.
Fast-forward to late 2019. The new Metro ring line has just opened. The contstruction hoarding has been removed and roads are returning to how they were before the work began. This great urban experiment is going to go one of two ways. Either the City learns from it and keeps that squiggly line or we just return to the car-centric status quo we started with.
I’ve never been a fan of the Metro expansion. A city this size doesn’t need a metro — it needs tramways like so many other cities in Europe. I don’t advocate shoving citizens underground. They should be on street level on foot, on bicycle and in trams. My colleagues around Europe basically point and laugh when I tell them that we have bus routes with 50,000 passengers a day and the City ISN’T building tramways. The main problem in Copenhagen is that we have so much money and we have delusions of grandeur.
But hey. I guess I didn’t succeed in talking the city out of building the metro expansion. The new M3 line doesn’t go anywhere new. It just spins around in a circle and goes to places that have been easily accessible by bike for over a century. The Metro has been falsely advertising travel times for years. Advertising station to station, but not the first and last mile to and from the station. I sent out a team a few years ago to map travel times using real world scenarios and — no surprise — the bike usually beats the Metro in Copenhagen.
There are more great statistics from the glorious period of 2012–2013. The average bike trip length in Copenhagen rose 35% from 3.2 km to 4.2 km between 2012 and 2013. That means that the oft-quoted statistic about how Copenhageners cycle 1.2 million km a day needed to be upgraded to 2,006,313 km per day.
When the results of the travel survey came out back in 2014, journalists were scrambling for answers. Two researchers at DTU were “surprised”. They were quoted in the Danish press as saying things like, “uh… the City’s new bridges and traffic calming on certain streets seem to have worked. Giving cyclists carrots encourage cycling.”
The detail they forgot was that the new cycling bridges weren’t finished yet, nor was the traffic calming on Amagerbrogade. The Nørrebrogade stretch is from 2008. Cycling rose on that street by 15% but that was BEFORE 2012. Duh. Basically, there hadn’t been much carrot dangling in this city for a few years. So forget about THAT hastily thunk up theory.
It was simply a combination of construction sites and district heating pipes being upgraded. It was a fantastic urban experiment.
In the original feasibility study for the new M3 line, I found an alarming statistic buried in the document. It was estimated that cycling levels in the city would drop by 2.8% after the completion of the new line. Then we saw that fantastic, unexpected rise of 9% between 2012 and 2013.
Can we now expect a drop in the modal share for bikes of 12% in Copenhagen? Perhaps. You read it here first.
Unless, of course, the City of Copenhagen has the cajones to embrace this experiment and use it to finally make The Leap — as described by author Chris Turner — into the future of our city. Expanding and widening the cycle tracks. Reallocating space from falling car traffic to bicycles and public transport. The new BRT route in Copenhagen is a good step. Let’s see how much farther we can go. Designing cities instead of engineering them.
They can listen to me or they can just listen to the simple logic of children.
The citizens have shown us that they will be on our side if we do the right thing.
Otherwise, this rich petri dish experiment will just rot and be forgotten.

Shortly after joining Tymit, I started hearing whispers about KotlinConf’25 in Copenhagen. I’d never been to an international conference before — let alone one dedicated to a language I use every day as a Junior Android Developer. The excitement was real! I couldn’t wait to see what the global Kotlin community looked like up close.
When I finally arrived, I was blown away by the energy. The event was so well organized — registration was fast, the talks started on time, and everything felt super professional. I had been worried that most of the sessions would be too advanced for me, but there was something for everyone, no matter your experience level.
What really struck me was seeing Kotlin’s potential in action. I already knew Kotlin was powerful, but it’s something else to be in a room full of developers from all over the world, sharing their passion for the language. The enthusiasm was contagious — even developers who don’t use Kotlin every day were getting inspired! I was especially surprised to see backend and even iOS developers interested in Kotlin Multiplatform. It made me realize that Kotlin is much bigger than just Android development; it’s a growing ecosystem with a place for everyone.
Attending KotlinConf with my Tymit team made the experience even better. We picked out talks together, grabbed lunch between sessions, and just enjoyed being part of the event as a team. It helped us bond and made the whole trip unforgettable.
The conference started with an inspiring keynote by Roman Elizarov, who walked us through how Kotlin has evolved and teased some amazing features coming soon. The talk that stood out most for our team was “Rich Errors in Kotlin” by Sébastien Deleuze, which introduced a new way to handle errors in Kotlin.
Day 1 Highlights:
Day 2 Highlights:
A lot of talks focused on AI and Kotlin Multiplatform, both of which I’m really excited about. I left the conference full of ideas for side projects and new tools to try at work.
We also got to see Junie, JetBrains’ new AI assistant for their IDEs like Android Studio. We’re planning to try it out on our team, hoping it’ll help us automate tasks and boost productivity.
The Rich Errors proposal especially caught our eye — we think it could make our app even more robust.
Overall, KotlinConf’25 was an amazing experience. I’m so grateful to Tymit for making it possible. If you ever get a chance to attend, don’t hesitate — you’ll come back inspired, connected, and ready to level up!

Copenhagen is my city. I still feel like that, even after having moved (far) away and not lived here for years. It still feels like home.
I’ve walked through its parks with my boys when they were little chubby babies sleeping in warm blankets in their prams.
I’ve cycled along its lakes for a decade on my way to work.
I’ve discussed world peace and literature and art with my friends at its cafes and bars for countless hours.
I know its streets and parks, and museums and galleries like the back of my hand.
And furthermore, it is home to my closest friends.
In other words, this place has a special place in my heart, which is also why this guide and description might be a tad bias. I hope you can bear with me.
I just spent ten days in Copenhagen. And from the moment I arrived, the special Copenhagen feeling seeped through my bones and made me feel at home and eager to get out walk and cycle and sit at the harbor area with a glass of white wine and wind in my hair.

The Danish National Opera House — opened in 2005—is located on a small island in Copenhagen’s inner harbor. It is one of the most technically advanced in the world. It is also one of the most expensive, costing a cool half a billion dollars.
Situated very strategically, the opera house is sited at the end of what is called the Amalienborg Axis in the very heart of Copenhagen, Denmark’s capital city. The Axis is equivalent to the National Mall in Washington D.C. It is a stone plaza that bisects the Queen’s residential compound, terminating at the Marble Church, the largest in Denmark, and a holy shrine. Directly opposite, and clearly visible across the harbor, sits the Opera House.
The bulk of the money to build it came from the A. P. Møller Foundation, who controls the enormous fortune of the founder of the gigantic Danish shipping company, Maersk. Møller himself has a reputation for being imperious and heavy-handed.
The imposing facade of the very Danish Modern glass and concrete Opera House looms over the harbor. It was designed by the prominent Danish architecture firm, Henning Larsen. Like most established architectural design firms, Henning Larsen is big and conservative, but not that conservative. As the story goes, A.P. Møller arbitrarily overrode some of Henning Larsen’s design decisions, and this did not please the architects. Møller’s ham-fisted meddling with the architect’s design is at the heart of this story of Danish rebellion.
Less than a mile from the Opera House is the autonomous neighborhood of Christiania, encompassed entirely within the city limits of Copenhagen. Formerly an Army barracks, Christiania was abandoned in the late 1960s only to be occupied by hippie squatters in the early 1970s. The authorities never bothered to kick them out and left them to their own devices, so they established their own informal government and rules. It’s home to several successful businesses like the eponymous cargo bicycles that are ubiquitous in bike-loving Copenhagen. Today, the community is home to about 850 people, most of whom are artists, craftsmen, performers, and other creative people who, like their hippie forbears, lean to the left politically.
Christiania, though, is famous for marijuana. For more than 40 years the Copenhagen authorities have turned a blind eye to widespread pot selling and smoking as long as it stayed within the boundaries of the former army base. Christiania residents confine pot sales to one short avenue, often called “Green Street.” Photography on Green Street is strictly forbidden, and brandishing a camera might get you summarily escorted out of town by a dozen offended citizens. Even though Christiania now has its own government, commerce, mayor, and many respectable full time residents, it remains a bold counter-culture statement right in the heart of conservative, Christian, Copenhagen, a living symbol of tolerance and independence. Christiania also proudly flies its own flag, which is orange with three yellow circles in a horizontal line. More than anything else, this iconic flag represents the anti-establishment spirit of Christiania.
The imposing Opera House, on the other hand, is an important civic building representing traditional values and the triumph of global trade and capitalism. But even vastly wealthy, self-important capitalists need to hire creative people, and it is unwise to abuse them, as A.P. Møller learned.
Long after the industrialist Møller forced the unwanted changes on Henning-Larsen’s design, and long after he innocently approved the lighting plan, which included the installation of three gigantic round chandeliers in the auditorium foyer, it gradually dawned on the good citizens of Copenhagen that the Henning-Larsen architectural firm had got the last laugh. At night, after it gets very dark, the entire Opera House glows a certain shade of orange, and the three giant round chandeliers shine a certain shade of yellow, all in a horizontal line with a characteristic spacing, all clearly visible from the Marble Church, the Amalienborg Axis, and the Queen’s Palace. It’s a gentle, subtle, anti-establishment gesture of defiance to those with more dollars than sense.
Heartwarming, isn’t it?

The Liberators: Unleashing Organizational Superpowers

Last week, we visited the LEGO Group’s office in Copenhagen. Where the office in Billund is hard to miss, the one in Copenhagen is nicely hidden in the city center. It reminded me of Harry Potter searching for platform nine-and-three-quarters. 😄
One reason for our visit was to gather feedback from real users of our product, Columinity. We can look long and hard into our crystal ball to search for clues about customers’ experiences or ask them instead. With 150 active teams, it shouldn’t be too difficult to find someone using it. 🔎
During our session, we focused on talking with various Agile Coaches using it to support their teams in continuously improving based on scientific insights and evidence-based feedback.
We *almost* started a classic open discussion (the horror 😱)…
Luckily, the idea of running a lightweight version of the Liberating Structure “User Experience Fishbowl” came to mind. This seemed to make sense, given our goal of collecting real users’ experiences. 🤔
The flow was simple:1. A small group of Agile Coaches positioned themselves in a circle in the center. For about 10 minutes, they started talking about their experiences using Columinity. 2. At the same time, Denny de Waard, myself, and a few others were listening. Whenever a question came to mind, we threw fish food (representing the question) into the bowl. Christina Mumm had the brilliant idea of using LEGO bricks as “fish food.” 🐠 3. After 10 minutes, we flipped roles. The users became the listeners, and we (the original listeners) positioned ourselves in the middle and shared what we noticed in the first round. What experiences stood out? What did we like, surprise, and maybe even worry about?4. For a final time, the users returned to the center of the fishbowl and continuously shared new thoughts and experiences. 5. After roughly 45 minutes ⏰, we closed the UX Fishbowl.
I considered it a valuable experience. It resulted in lots of feedback we can use to improve the use of our product. It was also an excellent (IMHO) example of how you can use Liberating Structures in a lightweight manner without any preparation.
Now, you probably think:
“Hey, why haven’t you included real-life pictures? Did it actually happen? Or are you just making things up here…”
Fair point. You’ll never know, but it’s a nice story, right? 😃
Additional thoughts by Christina Mumm — Agile Coach Competency Lead at the LEGO Group:
“This is not only modeling the value of Liberating Structures ;) It’s about deliberately creating opportunities for necessary conversations across any divide. In this case, we are choosing to close the gap between internal and external (customer- vendor). Working as one team brings value to everyone much faster. Why would we want to keep a distance? I hope we can inspire others to do the same by walking the talk this way.”
Whether it happened or not, why don’t you try this yourself? If you already have used UX Fishbowl, how did it work for you?

Last week I went to Copenhagen, Denmark. It was my first time traveling outside the country since the trip I took to Italy with my friends Corey and Amanda in 2018, a vacation booked when at least two-thirds of us were in the throes of romantic angst. On that trip we drank a lot of Aperol spritzes, ate arancini from a beachside stand most mornings we were in Sicily, and had the best pasta of our lives in Rome. Due to a language mix-up we also accidentally ordered seven sandwiches instead of a charcuterie board. It was a great vacation and I returned to the United States more tan and improbably more relaxed than I had been before. (I had not been relaxed when we left.)
This trip to Denmark was not a vacation but a trip for work. The startup I work for has an office in Soho, where most of the business functions of the company operate, and another office in Copenhagen, where our design, product and engineering teams are located. In the spirit of the company value of hygge and togetherness, I boarded a plane at Newark headed for Copenhagen last Sunday evening. Though I intended to knock myself out and sleep for the entirety of the 8-hour flight (I had a vision of landing in Copenhagen at 7 am local time, looking and feeling fresh as a daisy and invigorated by a good night’s sleep) Scandinavian Airlines had other plans for me — namely, feeding me two large meals throughout the…

I recently returned from a two-week trip to Europe, and I obviously spent a lot of time observing pedestrian and bicycle culture and infrastructure. Rather than simply envy our neighbors across the pond for their walkable and bike-friendly cities and believe that we Yanks could never match their high active transportation mode shares, I was constantly thinking how I could translate my experiences and observations into on-the-ground change here in the U.S. I also realized that we have some progressive transportation infrastructure on our own soil to be proud of.
We first made the pilgrimage to Copenhagen — the Promised Land for many Americans in the bicycle/pedestrian profession… And it lived up to the hype! The comprehensive network of physically separated cycle tracks was incredible and refreshing, of course, but I was more impressed by how easy it was to walk around the city. Several of the major streets were actually pedestrianized, with motor vehicles prohibited. While some examples of this concept exist in the U.S. — including Santa Monica’s Third Street Promenade — they feel rather manufactured and not organic.
Even with the dreary weather, we were sad to leave the playground of Copenhagen. But Paris was awaiting us! I had a mental image of Paris as the small, charming town along the river that is shown in films and travel magazines. However, I was immediately made aware of the city’s sprawling size and wide, auto-clogged boulevards. In a way, I was reminded of my hometown of Los Angeles, except that Paris’s Metro system blankets the region. In a flip from my experience in Copenhagen, I had gone to Paris expecting a walker’s paradise, but instead saw a budding cycling haven. The city had already squeezed cycle tracks along many of the major boulevards, and the famous Vélib’ public bicycles were as common a sight as sidewalk cafés and baguettes. The bicycle network appears set up to help Parisians close the “first mile/last mile gap” that often exists in a trip using public transit. I would love to see Los Angeles and other U.S. cities with mass transit networks pursue a similar course.
Finally, we ended our vacation by hanging out in the pedestrian paradises that are old Spanish cities. Barcelona, our first stop, was seemingly built to make walking a pleasurable experience, with interesting side streets, promenades, and commercial districts around every corner. Barcelona and other Spanish cities like Granada and Toledo also make good use of shared streets, or woonerfs, to make streets safe in constrained neighborhoods.
Finally, the many plazas and parklets in Spain’s cities were a never-ending source of resting space and excellent people watching.
Although very different in many ways, Los Angeles can and should follow the lead of European cities by creating safe and pleasurable spaces for people to walk or bike and be outside enjoying our near-perfect weather. And I’m proud to say that the LA region is beginning to seriously take on that mission. Both Long Beach and Temple City now have cycle tracks. LA County Metro is planning a regional bike share program. And through the LA Department of Transportation’s People St. program, several plazas and parklets have been created or are planned for previously underused road space. I’m excited that our leaders are beginning to push for progressive changes to restore some balance to how we move around our own cities.

If you are visiting that part of Europe that is carbon neutral and scores high on sustainability, you’ll be rewarded with a perfect, clean, and green getaway like Copenhagen. From the perspective of someone like me who is an advocate for sustainable travel, their endeavors to protect the environment are laudable. I had the privilege of visiting the beautiful, bike-friendly capital of Denmark, endowed with a rich history and culture. It had long been on my bucket list and finally, the dream was fulfilled. Copenhagen was everything that I hoped for and more.
We could manage to set aside only 3 days out of our 20-day Europe itinerary and to make matters worse the weather Gods were not on our side. The day we landed was bright and sunny, but incessant rains dampened our spirits on the main day that we were there and had reserved for sightseeing. However, we refused to let the gloomy weather get us down and made the most out of our time in the city.
Copenhagen has something for everyone. From world-class museums and art galleries, centuries-old castles and palaces, and delicious food, to charming shops, cafes, and entertainment parks.
For history buffs Christianborg Palace and the Rosenberg Castle would be fascinating, giving a walkthrough the lives of Danish royalty. You may feel like skipping them if you’re there for a short time, but these grand places are worth a visit. We too were in a dilemma whether to go inside or miss it, but finally, it was a yes from everyone, and it was a great decision.
The center of the Danish Parliament, the Christianborg Palace may not have attractive exteriors, and you may not be much impressed. But once you step inside you’ll find the opulent interiors awe-inspiring. From the decor and chandeliers to the furniture and artwork, a glimpse into the lives of royalty was fabulous.
The most famous touristy spot in Copenhagen is Nyhaven. Once a 17th-century fishing village, is now a dazzling waterfront entertainment zone, with a string of cafes, restaurants, and brightly painted houses. An amusing anecdote about the reason behind these vibrantly painted houses is so that the owners recognize their homes after returning drunken in the night from the bar.
You’ll also come across centuries-old iconic wooden ships at Nyhaven, taking you back in time. It’s a pleasure to walk beside the canal and enjoy the views. There are coffee shops with fireplaces that provide hot drinks and offer a haven from the chilly winds outside. Must try is the crispy, layered Danish pastry, which is delicious.
The Little Mermaid — based on a fairy tale written by a Danish author, this bronze statue of the little mermaid sitting on a rock is situated by the waterside at the Langelinie promenade. This is a great photo spot full of tourists.
Another Copenhagen highlight is a guided boat tour of the canal. Find significant historical landmarks on this tour as described by the guide, while admiring the beauty and listening to engrossing tales from the past. The witty incidents narrated had the audience enthralled. It was interesting to know that the author of the famous story the `Ugly Duckling was a resident of Copenhagen too.
Something that is unpredictable in Copenhagen, like most of Europe is the weather. Our canal trip was therefore interrupted by showers, but thankfully the boat had a glass roof so we could still take in the scenery. Considering the erratic weather having raincoats and umbrellas with you is a necessity. Even though it may mean hauling heavier bags, it is preferable than getting drenched in the midst of your vacation.
Several modern and historic museums dot the city. We decided on the Design Museum, having a very contemporary vibe and numerous masterpieces on display.
“Sail while the breeze blows, wind and tide wait for no man” — Danish Proverb
Impromptu plans are what make holidays enjoyable. The museum was on the waterfront, and from the terrace, we located a ferry point. Just as the last of the ferries was about to depart in the evening, we hurried and got on to it for what turned out to be an adventurous ride. Though there wasn’t any specific agenda, and the program was made on the spur of the moment, the sunset boat ride was worth it. And doubly so, it was absolutely free.
Getting around is quite easy in the capital of Denmark. Though there are various modes of transport, like, metro, bus, cab, or even ferry, using a bike is common. Specific tracks on the sides of roads, make it so convenient for cycling. It not just saves fuel but keeps the surroundings free of carbon emissions. Walking around on foot appeals to some as well.
Staying at the centrally located Mayfair Hotel was a pleasant experience. Not only were the rooms comfortable, the food and ambiance nice as well. As much as we wanted to, because of a shortage of time, missed going to the famous Tivoli Gardens. Probably, a sign that we ought to come here again.

In the ninth grade I came across bioplastics, plastics derived from renewable biomass, for the first time. Since then I have spent hundreds of hours researching the space and coming up with an idea for a bioplastic made from duckweed. The thought process was that bioplastics today generally come from biomass like corn, potatoes, sugar cane, etc. but these take up acres of land to grow and need to be consumed by humans (especially with the rise in climate change causing a shortage in food supply). Thus, duckweed, although possessing a bit of an odd name, has been a large focus of mine for two years now.
Shortly after I discovered bioplastics, the CEO of Pond Biomaterials became a mentor of mine. Pond is a startup based out of Denmark and I have been working with them (virtually) for these two years. This summer, though, I finally got to come to Denmark in person and Pond set me up to work in three labs across Copenhagen for five weeks, including Novozymes, the Technical University of Denmark, and the University of Copenhagen.
The reason for three labs instead of just one is that to build this project requires work in many different areas of science, including microbiology, biochemistry, and chemistry.
Below, I will go over what I worked on in each lab as well as my biggest learnings / takeaways.
Novozymes was the first lab I worked in. This is a private company, and the world leader in industrial enzyme production. I had never worked on my project in a lab that was not in a university, so this was a very different experience. I worked closely with Ulla Rosenberg and Kim Borch, two individuals I am incredibly lucky to have met. I always had help in the lab and the support was unreal. My days were usually 9–11 hours long but there was always someone by my side sticking it out with me and it was honestly so much fun.
For the first week I worked on an optimized enzymatic procedure for the duckweed. We experimented with different parameters and got the highest glucose concentrations I have seen out of my duckweed. I learned a lot about enzymes themselves, dilution series, and how to run an assay.
The next few days, I worked on fermenting the sugar solutions where I was in the microbiology lab with Robin Dorau trying to produce lactic acid. Some of the things I learned about were buffering capacities, measuring the optical density of bacteria via a spectrophotometer, and how to ensure the bacteria had enough nutrients. We ended up getting very high lactic acid concentrations, although I also learned about some other compounds present in my mixtures that have led to more discoveries about the duckweed and experiments themselves.
We were working large scale, with hundreds of grams of duckweed, so we had to be innovative with our setups. It doesn’t matter what lab you are working in: you always have to do some improvisation. Here are some examples of us simply having to figure it out:
1.) We had to have our samples stirring at a certain temperature for the enzymes to optimally operate, however our system kept dropping in temperature. In order for the setup to be self sufficient, we improvised and used aluminum and towels for insulation, and poured boiling water into the tub our samples were in. It worked like a charm, but definitely looked a little interesting.
2.) Another scenario where we had to just figure it out was when our samples would not filter prior to fermentation. I have been working on a smaller scale in Ottawa so although filtering was an issue I wasn’t on as much of a time crunch and had less material to work with. What we ended up doing was going to the brewery lab and their pressure filters (used for beer) worked perfectly. This taught me another valuable lesson, which was the importance of interconnectedness and asking others — even if in a completely different space of work — for help. Working at Novozymes was so unique because there are so many individuals working on different things and yet everyone can help each other, even a beer brewery lab and a biotech lab.
One more valuable lesson for me was to not always trust the results you get. When we did colorimetric analysis (basically determining the concentration of a chemical compound using a colour reagent) we got very low lactic acid concentrations which was honestly very disappointing because I never would have expected my results to be in this ball park. Later, though, we ran an HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography, a method that is much more precise) and our results were over 20x higher than we had initially thought. This really changed the next steps that had to be taken, so it’s important to ensure that when doing a test like an assay or something generally less precise (usually because they are easier and cheaper) they can have large margins of error in the results they yield.
The second lab I worked in was at the Technical University of Denmark, DTU. Here I was working on something I had never done before: the separation of lactic acid from the fermentation mixture. This process was quite difficult and was certainly not a success, but I learned a lot about purification technologies and namely, their complexity.
My biggest takeaway was to not underestimate how much time something new can take. I would have figured I would have learned this by now but it’s easy to have too high of expectations in science. Since I had never worked on the purification side of things before, I did not fully comprehend the difficulty of it until I tried it out. Researching and ideating is one thing, and actually doing it is something else entirely! For example, we attempted something called an azeotropic distillation on my first day (see the photo below) which theoretically should have worked quite easily but in fact did not at all. Even removing the water without evaporating other compounds was hugely complex and when I researched what to do, I was greeted with hundreds of research papers.
Thus, I learned something else that was very important which was to keep my solutions as clean as possible. What I mean by this is that in prior steps to the purification I am adding enzymes, buffers, extracts, etc. to my mixtures, but I have to in reality remove everything to get pure lactic acid at the end. When working on prior steps it is very important to keep in mind the end goal and future steps that must also be optimized for.
Another takeaway was to utilize online videos for the use of analytical equipment because there is so much online that can help. I had to be much more independent in this lab, and through a video I learned how to do infrared spectroscopy which was very helpful.
I had a hard time coping with failure at this lab overall but it offered many insights into what comes next in this project, as this step will be the key to producing the bioplastic and will be a challenge on its own.
Finally, I worked at the University of Copenhagen with Peter Ulvskov, a professor in plant biology. This tied more into what I had been working on at Novozymes, but instead of optimizing the enzymes being added to the biomass we were working on what could happen even prior to this: cell wall degradation, mechanical methods of breakdown, etc. Honestly, I found this so much fun and full of learning. I truly got to understand the duckweed to a greater extent, like what exists in it that may inhibit bacterial growth, what polysaccharides it contains, and how the starch granules behave. For the first time I got to look at the duckweed under a microscope — microscopy was actually key in my work at KU. For example, before degradation of the cell walls, we could see the starch granules stuck in the duckweed cells (left image, where the granules are dark blue) and then after we could see the granules released from the cells (right image).
Something else we worked on was the removal of pigmentation from the duckweed to explore how this may hinder future steps in my procedures (see the below picture, where the rightmost beaker contains a much lower content of chlorophyll). I found I was looking at duckweed through a different lens because of how much unique experimentation I got to do at the university.
Likely my biggest takeaway was the significance of writing absolutely everything down and taking many pictures. This is of course something I have always had to do in the lab but Peter put a lot of emphasis on organization and I came up with a much better system for taking notes, keeping track of which photos are which, etc. It can be easy to recognize what a microscopy image is showing a few minutes after you’ve taken it, but a month later, the importance of that image to you may be gone.
My second takeaway was to keep in mind everything that is required for each part of my project and look at how this may translate to a real world protocol. For example, when we were grinding the duckweed we made sure to use equipment that could be scaled up easily as opposed to only something that works small scale.
Another one of my learnings was the importance of going back to the very beginning — the foundations of a project — because this is where the most improvement can transpire. Breaking down the cell walls to a greater extent was not helping me in the purification of the lactic acid, but eventually it could help me get more lactic acid to work with by creating improvements in glucose yields. Every step holds weight.
All in all, getting to spend time in Copenhagen was such a neat experience and I am so grateful to everyone who helped me. I also felt that I became a more independent person as I lived alone for around five days which I have never done before! Getting to meet my supervisor Martin from Pond was a huge highlight, as well as exploring the wonderful city (and the crêpe stands👩🏽‍🍳).
Thank you so much for reading this! I’m a 17-year-old learning about where sustainability meets technology, and am the author of the “Chronicles of Illusions” duology. If you want to see more of my work, connect with me on LinkedIn, Twitter, or subscribe to my newsletter!

Name: Malene Sabinsky
What do you do all day? Boss people around and talk very loudly– no really, that’s what project managers do. *laughs*
Hometown: Copenhagen, Denmark
Hunting territory: Copenhagen and beyond
Can you tell us a bit about the difference between the street art in you town compared to the rest of the world? As in, what makes your town really stand out!? I don’t know if there’s a major difference, as a lot of international artists have made pieces in Copenhagen too, but of course the local artist make it completely unique.
Where do most artists get there inspiration from in your town? That would be unfair of me to answer, as I don’t know.
Is there more currated or illegal work? The murals are mostly curated, but there is also a fair bit of illegal activity
What is that one artwork you need to see in your hunting territory? I have to cheat and choose two: DALeast because I cycle past it everyday, and never tire of looking at it. Copenhagen, for me, wouldn’t be the same without it now. And ‘Creativity is Freedom’ by Danish artist Don John. I really love his work, and there are so many great pieces by him around town.
Who introduced you to the street art scene? Nobody did. I am still waiting for my official introduction :-)
When were you infected with the hunter virus? I’m a newbie really *laughs* I’ve had an interest for at long time. I lived in London for many years, and it’s hard not to notice and appreciate street art when living there. But it didn’t actually become a real (active) passion until summer 2015, when i saw the Surface exhibition by Danish photographer Søren Solkær in Copenhagen. And alongside this, I followed the creation of new murals for “Outdoor Surface” (the DalEast piece being one of these).
My hunting kit includes: It’s a very simple kit: bicycle, iphone, headphones and wind in my hair.
When you are out shooting, how much of it is instinctual versus planned? With increased passion comes increased planning! Of course I still stumble upon new pieces when on general eplorations, but mostly I plan to go to a certain place, because there is something specific I want to see.
Do you take photos more for yourself, or for others? Mostly for myself, but I don’t mind sharing :-)
How would you define your style in taking photo’s or writing a (instagram) post? Lacking style in general! I’m not a skilled photographer, so it’s a good thing the art speaks for itself. The same goes for posts. I’m too impatient to write a lot, so an artist credit and an emoji tends to suffice.
Who are some of your favorite classic photographers, and how did they influence you? I like a lot of photographers: Cindy Sherman, Martin Parr, Nan Goldin, William Eggleston, Andreas Gursky etc. And of course I have to mention both Søren Solkær and Martha Cooper, for combining the art of photography and street art. They haven’t influenced me in any particular way, I just admire their skill and art.
What is your biggest challenge of being a hunter? Too much rain, and too little time.
What is the best piece of advice I can give to newbie hunters? Be curious and open-minded. Credit artists where you can , they deserve it. Do it out of passion and interest, not the likes.
Or ignore all that, and just download the app and get yourself a bicycle.
Can you tell us the most exiting hunter story? Any close calls with getting your equipment robbed or caught by the police? Haha, no close calls at all. I’m too well behaved.
I will share a non-exciting, but vivid hunter memory with you though: I was touring California (and beyond) with my two kids a few months back, and when we stopped over in Vegas, we had to go hunting. I had no connection on my phone, so my son got the job of navigating using the Street Art Cities website (see, it’s so easy even a kid can use it!). After some time with no results, I was getting pretty hot and bothered, but suddenly my son stops and points. And I very loadly exclaim: “Woaw, Martin Whatson”. The look of pride in his eyes for having found it, combined with the beauty of the wall, was just priceless.
My most recent discovery in the street art scene is: Not so recent, but during the summer I found some great stencils in Copenhagen, there are four really close to each other. I haven’t found any more across town, and don’t know anything about the artist, apart from the signature ‘Jochum’. I’m dead curious, really like the pieces, and want to see and know more.
Name a few artists you like to follow and why. These artists are all Danish, have their very own style, are super talented, and can be found around the streets of Copenhagen:
Do you collect art books, T-shirts, and other things? What’s the most valuable item for you? No, I’m not much of a collector as such, but I’m dead chuffed with a small piece by Tankpetrol, I bought and just received in the post the other day.
What is your favorite location fellow hunters should definitely visit? Don’t miss a visit to Bolsjefabrikken where local artist make new pieces all the time, cruise down Rentemestervej — possible the one street in Copenhagen with the mist murals. And of course Christiania — for art and the rest — but don’t pull out your camera on pusher street unless you specifically are collecting “exciting hunter stories”.
What are the benefits you find being part of a street art collective? Having found so many people with the same passion and so many of whom are very knowledgeable, and great photographers. I will start inviting myself for coffee and tours when I travel, so be warned.
Last but not least. What is the most valuable thing about Street Art Cities? The app is fantastic. It’s a great resource when travelling.

I remember seeing the term Hygge for the first time while looking for Airbnb experiences in Copenhagen. A quick google search showed that Hygge meant “a cozy quality that makes a person feel content and comfortable”. It gave me the image of resting by the fireplace on a cold winter’s night, which didn’t feel too relevant for my upcoming summer trip, so I kind of forgot about it.
When I was in Copenhagen, I remember feeling occasional waves of inner joy, in a “just glad to be here” kind of way. It was otherwise sublime and hard to describe, and even harder to attribute the cause. I didn’t try to analyze it too much — after all, I was on vacation and taking in the idyllic vibes of a Danish summer.
On the metro to the airport, we zoomed past a father and his child running through some grassy expanses with the backdrop of the sea. I remember feeling a sense of delight and ease, and recalled the term Hygge; that’s when I realized I had profoundly learned what it meant during my trip.
I won’t try to describe what Hygge is; I reckon you have to experience this for yourself to understand. But I’ll tell you some things when I was in Copenhagen that brought me Hygge, and also some that did not.
Things that brought Hygge
Things that did not bring Hygge

Can London follow Copenhagen's heat networks example?
All London boroughs are working to reach net zero, and decarbonising how we heat our buildings is a crucial part of that journey. One key solution here is the implementation of heat networks. These currently exist in pockets of London, but we must introduce new networks and connect more households to help us towards net zero.
In May, London Councils and The Danish Embassy in London worked together to take a group of London borough officers to visit the Greater Copenhagen area, a world leader in heat networks. The visit was funded by the State of Green (a not-for-profit, public-private partnership between the Danish government and the country’s three leading business associations) and provided valuable insights into Denmark’s successful adoption of heat networks and offered lessons that could be applied to our decarbonisation efforts in London and across the UK.
Denmark has made significant progress in adopting heat networks, with over 64% of Danish homes currently heated through this system. This figure is expected to rise to approximately 72% in the near future. Denmark’s’ heat network journey began in 1903 with the installation of the first district heating (DH) plant.
However, it was the 1970s oil crisis that triggered a rapid expansion in the use of coal-powered district heating, which was followed by the introduction of natural gas. Over time, Denmark has shifted towards incorporating energy from waste and biomass, and is actively exploring various waste heat sources to further reduce emissions — as we know London boroughs like Islington are also doing.
The Greater Copenhagen Heat Network
The Greater Copenhagen Heat Network stands out as an impressive example of a large-scale district heating system. It supplies heat to approximately 500,000 households — with almost all houses connected in the inner municipalities of the region. It relies on various heat producers, including combined heat and power (CHP) plants, waste-to-energy facilities, and reserve and peak load plants burning fossil fuels. The network also incorporates heat storage systems to ensure efficient and reliable distribution.
What did we visit?
During the visit, we had the opportunity to explore different aspects of Denmark’s heat network infrastructure and solutions. We learnt about the background of heat network development in the Greater Copenhagen region and witnessed initiatives such as the District Cooling system in Copenhagen, a large waste-to-energy facility in Roskilde, and the consumer-owned Greve Municipal District Heating company. We also observed smaller-scale innovative solutions, such as a Danfoss project to capture and recirculate heat from supermarket refrigerators in Energy Lab Nordhavn.
We gained insights into energy-renovated social housing and a low-temperature heat network in the Municipality of Albertslund. We also saw an exciting new heat pump system being installed to that extract energy from drinking water in Frederiksberg, in the heart of the city region of Copenhagen.
We learnt about the vital role of local government and municipal companies in planning, financing, developing, and operating heat networks in Denmark. The experience showcased the importance of effective and resourced local government to drive collaboration among stakeholders, all underpinned by strong regulation which gives price certainty to consumers.
We also learnt how heat networks have been expanding rapidly in response to global energy price increases, and that demand is higher for houses on heat networks.
The visit highlighted both some key differences and similarities between Denmark and the UK in terms of how we heat our buildings. However, both countries share similar climates, building characteristics, and ambitions for achieving net-zero emissions so sharing knowledge will help us both. We were happy to learn that the UK government is actively working with the Danish government to develop UK heat network policy, with a focus on introducing heat zoning which will help increase the uptake of heat networks.
This visit to Copenhagen offered valuable insights for London’s decarbonisation efforts. The Renewable Power for London Programme will be incorporating these as part of its Decentralised Energy workstream to help London Local Government accelerate our transition.

Before you actually begin your dream journey, your Copenhagen Trip Planner is here. Copenhagen is the largest city in the country and also the capital of Denmark. Sitting on the two coastal islands, Zealand and Amager, this beautiful city is full of historic attractions. Consulting your vacation guide can be a good option if you do not want to miss any particular places of interests here. Every year a huge number of tourists visit this city which still possesses a distinct touch of European culture. Copenhagen is packed with various great attractions and tourist spots. Here are some of the best places that you can include in your travel planner if you really want to make most of your time here.
Among the various interesting places in the city, including Christiansborg Palace in your Copenhagen Trip Planner as top priority can be a brilliant idea. Located in central Copenhagen, on a small island, this palace is still used by royal families as the seat of Danish Parliament, Prime Minister’s office, and Supreme Court. Boasting more than 800 years of history, this palace has plenty of attractions to offer you, such as the royal reception hall, the Chapel, the Ruins, and the Royal Stables. The tallest viewing platform of the city is in this palace which offers an excellent panoramic view of this beautiful city.
Tivoli Garden is basically an amusement park in Copenhagen and is a must visit for all tourists. Founded in the year of 1843, it is known as an international attraction and also a national treasure of Denmark. With more than twenty types of different rides, various cafes and restaurants, Tivoli Gardens has become an absolute wonderland for the visitors. It is also the second oldest functioning amusement park in Denmark.
Your trips to this Danish capital may remain incomplete if you do not add a visit to the Little Mermaid in your Copenhagen Trip Planner. Made of bronze and granite, this sculpture was a gift to the city from the Danish brewer C. Jacobsen. Apart from being the city’s most famous tourist attraction, it is also the official emblem of the city.
If the history and culture of a new city are something that truly interests you then your journey guide may suggest you visit the National Museum of Denmark. You can find exhibitions from almost all the different periods and ages here. Exhibitions from the Stone Age, the Middle Ages, the Viking Ages, the renaissance period and modern Danish history are perfectly displayed here.
Nyhavn Harbour can also be there in your travel plan. At the very end of the harbor, you can witness the anchor which is kept there as a memorial of those Danish sailors who lost their lives during World War II. With the brightly painted houses by the harbor and the museum ships, this place happens to be the most featured one in the photographs, describing the city.
If you have not yet included Bakken in your Copenhagen Trip Planner, then it’s high time that you would. Being the oldest amusement park in the world, Bakken is a wonderful green area where you can enjoy various exciting adventure rides. In the entire Scandinavia, it is the only amusement park that has more rides than any other in the country.
By including these most-visited places of Copenhagen in your vacation plan, you can have the most unforgettable experience in your life. Let’s keep your Copenhagen Trip Planner with you as your best guide and start exploring the majestic city Copenhagen.

It only takes me about four days in Copenhagen before I start Googling “Copenhagen apartments for rent” and “Can Americans buy property in Denmark?”. I love how easy it is to walk everywhere, how stylish it is, how friendly the people are, and (of course) how delicious the food is. We planned our trip to Europe around dinner at Noma. While Noma was worth the pilgrimage, it was far from the only good meal of our trip. Here’s my recap of our Copenhagen dining adventures.

There’s a particular kind of focus that lives in voiceover. Not just technical — emotional, too.
As an actor, I’ve found something grounding in the simplicity of sound: a way to stay close to character, even between larger productions. Whether for narration, commercials, or more character-driven work, I approach VO as an extension of acting, just pared down to its essentials.

I’m a New York City girl.
I grew up in the neighborhood of Washington Heights, the area of Manhattan north of Harlem.
On the street I lived, everyone knew everyone. Apartment doors were often left open so kids could run back and forth. If we were out late —which meant once the streetlights were on — we’d be told by an adult, any adult, it was time to go home.
Home for me was on the fifth floor of a tenement building. And our apartment stood out in that drab building because our windows were covered with climbing blue morning glory my father planted every spring.
Those flowers were a bright spot on an otherwise colorless city street.
It’s years since we were back, and this summer it was a trip down memory lane when my husband Billy and I visited “the City”.
Billy grew up in Greenwich Village. Long the home of artists, his father, the abstract expressionist painter Harold Anton, had among his contemporaries, Jackson Pollock, as well as the…

ISRAELS PLADS
Copenhagen, Denmark
Introduction
Israels Plads is an urban plaza situated in Copenhagen, Denmark. It was conceptualised by Sweco Architects and Cobe in 2007 when the Copenhagen municipality invited Danish architects to reconstruct Copenhagen’s largest public square, which had fallen into disrepair as a derelict parking lot. [1] This essay will analyse the aftermath of the project to determine how successful the architects were in terms of heritage integration, user experience, and inclusivity.
Copenhagen is the capital and most populous city of Denmark. It was previously a Viking fishing village, and became the capital in the early 15th century. Since the early 2000’s Copenhagen has seen some strong urban and cultural development, led by the Copenhagen Municipality, through investments in its institutions and infrastructure. Israels Plads is one such urban regeneration project.
According to Cobe, the idea of transforming Israels Plads was to celebrate the significance of the history of the square, and to revitalize it, by turning it into a “vibrant, diverse plaza for leisure and sport, used by all kinds of people.” [7] Right from the get-go, we see that the architects placed a lot of importance on heritage integration, user experience and inclusivity.
The new site consists of an underground car park, with two blocks of buildings (a retail park and a private educational institute) to the North-West and South-East, along with two large market halls (“Torvehallerne”, which opened in 2011 and quickly became very popular, currently housing numerous cafés) to the North-East. The Plads also provides a link to a massive park (“Ørstedsparken”) to the South-West (Fig 1), acting as a transition from the bustling city to the serene park. [7]
Figure 1 Israels Plads seen as an urban carpet (Cobe, 2014) Edited by author
Above the underground car park, the plaza acts as a multifunction space, housing a large playground, sports arena, skatepark, and areas for people-watching. At the centre of the square is an “egg-shaped area” (Fig 2), used by nearby schools as an extended recreational zone for all age groups. [2]
Figure 2: Landscaping Plan of the Site (Cobe, 2014) Edited by author
History
The space has historical significance dating back to the 13th century when Denmark built their stone wall fortifications and established a central plaza at this spot, where the city ended in a ring of protective ramparts. During the city’s extension in the late 19th century, with the demolition of the old city walls (that were now outdated defence mechanisms), the site became a vibrant market square. Israels Plads is placed on top of these historic ramparts (Fig 3).
Figure 3 Diagram of the city’s old fortifications, and Israels Plads’ location relative to the ramparts (Cobe, 2014)
According to Zerlang (2008), the square served as a starting point and meeting point for the forces of modern life [1], since its inception in the 1870s (Fig 4) and its renaming in 1968 as “Israels Plads”, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the “rescue of the Danish Jews”.[3]
Israels Plads was previously the home of Grønttorvet (1889–1958), a major market for fresh produce known for its special atmosphere (Fig 5). Due to the increase in traffic around the market and growing logistics needs, the market was relocated and the once-bustling square degenerated into an inner-city eyesore and occasional parking lot (Fig 6). [2]
Figure 4: The site being used as a market in 1889–1954
Figure 5: The Food Market, around 1990 (Copenhagen by Design, 2015)
“The plaza used to be empty, especially in the evening, and there were a lot of drug dealers” — Hans Peter Hagens (Architect of the Torvehallerne, adjacent to Israels Plads) [13]
Figure 6: The site’s usage as a parking lot in the 1950’s — 1990's
City Scale
The main reason for the decline of Israels Plads was the city and traffic planners’ inability and unwillingness to put city space and city life high on their agenda. Attempting to ensure the best conditions for car traffic, along with the mismanagement of the city-planning sector has led to multiple public squares such as this one being converted to dingy parking lots, teeming with crime and making the city unsafe, unsustainable and unhealthy. [4]
Jan Gehl, in his book “Cities for People”, criticises the Copenhagen municipality, for putting a low priority on public space, pedestrianism and the role of city space as a meeting place for urban dwellers. However, in recent decades, the government has realised its folly, and started reversing its erroneous moves by restructuring their street network, removing driving lanes and parking places in a deliberate process to create better and safer conditions for bicycle traffic. [4] The city of Copenhagen has a goal for its residents to “spend 20% more time in public spaces by 2025,” [7] and Copenhagen’s bicycles now save 90,000 tons of CO2 every year. Gehl notes that “[Copenhagen] has significantly improved conditions for life in city space in recent decades. Pedestrian traffic has grown, and the number of recreational optional activities has swelled.” [4] It is important to note that Gehl uses the term “optional” to describe activities that can only be done in good conditions, as opposed to “necessary” activities, such as going to school/work and grocery shopping, which have to be done regardless of the weather conditions. One by one the parking places in the city centre have been turned into squares that accommodate public life. [4]
Figure 7: The new and improved Israels Plads (Cobe, 2014)
Recent Developments
A change was triggered in the area of Israels Plads, due to the decision to erect the two market halls (Torvehallerne) on the site, evoking the “aura of the old vegetable market”. [2] The council’s brief for the reconstruction of Israels Plads demanded that the design concept should relate itself to the “history of the square, to the architecture of the surrounding houses, to the Ørstedspark at the southern end of the square and the Botanical Garden and the market halls at the northern end of the square”. [1]
The winning submission by Cobe and Sweco Architects envisaged a “flying carpet” spread across the entire square, where the cars would be “swept under the rug” with underground parking and organically shaped areas that are punched out of the surface to provide a variety of public recreational functions (Fig 7 and 8). [2]
Figure 8: The layers of Israels Plads, as envisioned by Sweco Architects and Cobe (Cobe, 2014)
User Experience
Zerlang (2008) declares that in the modern city, experiences are staged, and architects increasingly treat urban space with the eye of a scenographer. [1] Understanding that the consideration for the individual and their experiences presents a major challenge for modern urban planning, the question of “experiences” had a very high priority in the commission. The Council added a demand that the concept should consider the activities on the square, and also the pre-existing activities of the school children from the Zahles Skole (adjacent to Israels Plads), and the potential activities of the new-arranged square. [1]
The transformation of the public square focuses on its revitalisation as a living urban space [2]. Gehl (2010) urged urban planners and architects to reinforce pedestrianism as an integrated city policy to develop “lively, safe, sustainable and healthy” cities. He also ascertains that it is equally urgent to strengthen the social function of city space as a meeting place. [4]
Israels Plads provides a cohesive structure that offers “short walking distances, attractive public spaces, and a variation of urban functions”. These elements increase activity and the feeling of security in and around the space. [4]
Studies from inner-city shopping streets in Copenhagen show happenings, events and building sites where we can watch people perform, play music, etc. attract far more people to linger and watch than shops along building facades. Studies of benches and chairs in city space show correspondingly that seats with the best view of city life are used far more frequently than those that do not offer a view of other people. [4] The seating areas in Israels Plads are positioned so that people-watching is facilitated. The sloping sides of the sunken playing field can serve both as a barrier and as seating. [2] Wedge-shaped staircases at the western and eastern corners of the square offer a good view from an elevated position (Fig 9). [2]
Figure 9: Users seated on the wedge-shaped stairs, enjoying a sunny day (Cobe, 2014)
“The plaza has opened up to the historical landscape next door. The tree and water elements of the park are echoed on the plaza surface, and circles have been cut out to accentuate the big trees standing on the transition between city and park” (Fig 10) [7]
Figure 10: The cutouts on the plaza used to accentuate the trees. (Copenhagen Design News, 2020)
The cut-outs feature round bench formations underneath the trees, where people can observe the life unfolding on the plaza, a pre-requisite for Gehl’s ideal public space (Fig 11). The localised light zones of areas sheltered by trees also create an intimate setting for groups of people to gather and enjoy the night. The overheads and multiple sources of illumination, according to Schaack (2018), allow for visibility and facial recognition, which is crucial for users to trust their environment and the people using it. [3]
Figure 11: Round bench formations, ideal for people-watching (Copenhagen Design News, 2020)
Cobe’s founder, Dan Stubbergaard appreciates that Israels Plads has become a public meeting place and a playground for three different schools all year round. [7] It also helps that the design incorporates skateable aspects into the architecture of the space. Activities such as skateboarding, basketball and scootering are encouraged, which invites a lot more schoolchildren into the space. [11] Even the lighting is optimised for play. Four different lighting systems illustrate the complexity of the space at night. One of them illuminates the centre of the plaza to answer the need for visibility of sports users, basketball players and skateboarders. [3]
Figure 12: The public uses the Plads even in unfavourable weather conditions (Cobe, 2014)
Heritage Integration
“[The plaza] has a sculptural expression that refers to its historical past as part of the fortifications” [3] “Along the facades, a band of traditional Copenhagen pavement with granite slabs and Nordic cobblestones runs around the square (Fig 13), connecting the granite plate to its surroundings.” [8] These material choices are a throwback to traditional Danish building methods, and also match the colourful historical facades from the 18th century.
Figure 13: Nordic cobblestones and demarcation strips around Israels Plads (Copenhagen Design News, 2020)
The square itself often became the scene of political demonstrations in the 1880s [1] Similar to the 1880s, the square is still used for political demonstrations. In May 2019, the Revolutionary Antifascists group, organised a demonstration at the Israels Plads. [9] More recently, in October 2021, students of the University of Copenhagen assembled at the Plads to protest the University’s investment in Pro-Israeli companies that are involved in the demolition of Palestinian homes and building the Apartheid wall [10]. It is interesting to see how the Israels Plads’ usage has differed only very slightly from its original uses before the 1950s. Copenhagen also hosts WorldPride, the international festival celebrating the LGBTQ+ community, and one of the parades goes through the Israels Plads. [12]
Inclusivity
“This is where children play during recess, where friends meet for a beer after work, and where Copenhageners meet for flea markets (Fig 14) on Saturdays” [7]
Figure 14: The Flea Market that opens up on the Plads on Saturdays (Cobe, 2014)
An issue that I came across quite often when researching the inclusivity of such spaces, is the prevalence of anti-homeless architecture and exclusionary design, whether on purpose or a subconscious choice. A space such as this cannot be celebrated for its inclusivity, if it does not support ALL its citizens, including the homeless, individuals struggling with addiction, and the unemployed. Israels Plads has round benches with metal dividers (Fig 11), making them uncomfortable to sleep on, while the long tiered seating (Fig 9) lacks privacy and is open to the elements, which discourages anyone from taking refuge overnight. [15]
This goes against the policies of Jan Gehl’s “Humanist City” [4], pushing Copenhagen’s most vulnerable citizens out of the public space. Nina Hoegh (Director of Projekt Udenfor (Project Outside)) agrees, stating that catering urban design exclusively to the needs of the middle class in this way sends an implicit message about whom the city values. [15] Public space should be accessible and welcoming for all, without privileging one person or group over another. [16]
“Homelessness must be eradicated, but this process won’t happen overnight. Public places need to design for this reality, not ignore it” [16] Therefore I affirm that the architects of the Israels Plads have not been successful in their efforts to make the space inclusive.
Purpose Fulfilment
The architects have designed a method of directing cloudburst water into an artificial creek, which leads to a large water reserve in the adjacent park. However, their wish that the creek is an aesthetic and pleasant water feature during all other times did not come true, as the “creek” is almost always dry (Fig 15), and may be a hazard for a skateboarding student, or a person with a vision impairment. [7] The Danish Design Review also noted that the fountains and water channel at the park end are rarely running. [14]
Figure 15: The “Artifical Creek”, currently dry (Copenhagen by Design, 2015)
Despite its shortcomings, the plaza does serve as a new public space adding to the social and environment of Copenhagen, while fulfilling the still-existing demand for car parking in the city. The design of the space follows the policy of Copenhagen to be a sustainable and user-friendly city by connecting to the neighbouring park and food market, offering a recreational space with seating areas and sports facilities. [3] Israels Plads has accomplished its goal of being a multi-use space, seeing that it serves as a schoolyard during the daytime, a public basketball court and skate park during the afternoon, a “dining room” in the evening, and a flea market during the weekend. It is quite difficult to design a space where there is minimum clash between these activities, yet Cobe and Sweco Architects have managed to do it.
Figure 16: A Google Earth capture of the site by the author
Some of these new and old car-free squares seem deserted while others teem with life. The difference comes down to the fact that some squares have only been designed to “ferry” pedestrians across, while others seize the opportunity to provide an experience, so that people combine walking and staying in the area. Studies show that the latter type of square registers an activity level of between “10, 20, and sometimes 30 times higher than transit squares” [5] There is no point in having a sheer amount of space if it is not correctly designed, and this is why I believe Israels Plads has been so successful in attracting the populace of Copenhagen as a public space where children can play, adults can people-watch, and almost everyone can enjoy.

Let me start by saying, I'm a huge fan of the S-train network in Copenhagen, Denmark, and especially for the simple and direct communication the transit map of the network provides. The design of the existing map is clean and simple. But it still has in my opinion some flaws and are missing some vital details.
So I have tried to make my own revised S-train map for Copenhagen, based of course on the existing map of the network. With tweaks and improvement to make it easier to navigate as a user.
Just want to see the new map, jump straight to it here.
If you want an in-depth analysis and understanding of the Copenhagen transit map and network and what it looks like today:

Copenhagen surprised me in the best way. It’s not loud or flashy, but quietly brilliant — measured, functional, and full of life in subtle ways. It might not be for everyone, but for me personally, this was the best city I’ve visited so far.
Here’s a breakdown of my impressions, what’s worth seeing, and what (and where) to eat.
Copenhagen feels like it was designed for a self-contained urban human — someone who values clean lines, efficient systems, and doesn’t need the sun to be in their top three happiness factors.
It’s expensive, but everything you get feels fair. There’s no sense of being ripped off — just a steady, Nordic standard of quality. English is almost a second official language, spoken equally well by both the young and the old. That stood out and made everything smoother.
The people are polite, helpful, but emotionally reserved. Not cold, not snobby — just calmly distant. The city itself is beautifully quiet: no diesel engines, no honking, no chaos. Cash is barely accepted, tips are not expected, and digital payments are the norm.
Public transport is flawless — fast, clean, reliable, and not overcrowded. The metro system especially impressed me. The cycling culture is on another level: wide, protected bike lanes on both sides of the street, and visibly fewer cars and parking spots than in Zagreb.
It’s not as immigrant-friendly as, say, London, and that affects the atmosphere slightly. Still, Copenhagen delivers a kind of living standard and order that’s rare anywhere else.
Home of CarlsbergMore than just a brewery tour. This place ties together Danish beer, scientific progress, and art collecting. Jacob and Carl Jacobsen — father and son — are the central figures here. The father was a master brewer, the son added branding finesse and a love of the arts. They even established their own science lab, where in 1883 they solved the problem of “beer sickness” (a sudden souring of beer) by isolating pure yeast. Today, they’ve created a keg that triples shelf life. The visit includes a tour and beer tastings.
GlyptoteketA stunning museum founded by the Jacobsen family, housing collections of Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Danish, and French art. My favorites were the sarcophagi, the mummies, and The Prodigal Son sculpture. The building itself is a piece of art.
Tivoli GardensThe second-oldest amusement park in the world and the inspiration for Disneyland. It’s charming and atmospheric, though pricey. I took my first and probably last rollercoaster ride here. Worth it for the vibe alone.
Danish Design MuseumDesign is taken seriously here — from childhood education to everyday product aesthetics. We saw an exhibition on the development of Irma, a 137-year-old supermarket brand that brought graphic design into daily life. Another focused on natural, innovative materials (chairs from mushrooms, lamps made from cow intestines, dresses from milk-industry waste). Unfortunately, the furniture design exhibit was closed for renovations.
NyhavnA classic Copenhagen postcard: colorful houses along a canal, boats bobbing in the water. It’s a bit of a tourist trap, but still worth seeing — especially if the sun comes out. HC Andersen once lived in one of these houses while writing his first fairy tale.
Freetown ChristianiaA self-declared autonomous neighborhood built on former military land. Around 1,000 people live there — hippies, artists, and others drawn to alternative living. It’s more a sociological curiosity than an actual utopia. Don’t expect magic, but it’s interesting for a short visit.
Rosenborg Castle & KastelletRosenborg is a small Renaissance castle built by Christian IV in the early 1600s. It’s beautifully preserved. Nearby, Kastellet is a pentagon-shaped military fortress, still in use today and perfect for a peaceful stroll.
Food in Copenhagen is pricey. Meals range from 110 to 250 DKK (€15–€34), pastries from 40 DKK (€5.50), and craft beers between 60–80 DKK (€8–€11). But the quality makes it worthwhile.
Here’s what stood out:
Gasoline GrillNamed one of the top 27 burgers in the world by Bloomberg — and the only one from Europe. It’s served from a small former gas station with four cheerful employees. Probably the best burger I’ve ever had.
Juno the BakeryThe cardamom bun here genuinely moved people to tears. The founder is a former Noma chef, and it shows. The almond croissant and pain au chocolat are also top-tier.
Format Café (inside the Design Museum)New Nordic simplicity done right. The carrot soup with tarragon oil, cream, almonds, and sourdough was exceptional. The open sandwich with chicken, beetroot, capers, kale, horseradish, and a mystery cream was surprisingly rich and complex. Easily one of the best meals.
SeksA stylish brunch spot. The chive-and-pepper omelet was solid, the apple pancake with cream excellent, and the Moroccan green tea unforgettable. Small portions, though.
Warpigs BrewpubTexas BBQ in a Danish setting. Three meats (smoked pork, beef, spicy sausage), mac & cheese, beans, slaw, and on-site craft beer. Heavy, indulgent, and very American in vibe — but worth it.
Broens Street Food MarketGreat spot on the docks. We had organic fish & chips with an IPA under the sun. Simple, fresh, satisfying.
Sankt Peders BakeryThe oldest bakery in Copenhagen, open since 1652. Try the Wednesday cinnamon roll — sold only on Wednesdays. They make up to 4,000 in a single day.
Absalon FolkehusetA unique community lunch in a converted Lutheran church. We had rice with spinach, almonds, coriander, and a peppery sauce. At just 60 DKK, it was the cheapest cooked meal we found — and still delicious.
Pølser Hot DogsThe Danish street food staple. Tried two: one at Carlsberg and one at John’s Hotdog Deli at the main station (Bourdain-approved). Both were solid, nothing mind-blowing.
GRØDA porridge-focused mini-chain. The classic version with apples, cinnamon, roasted almonds, and caramel was pure comfort food.
Pico PizzaStandard, good pizza. Clean, consistent, and just what you need after a few fancier meals.
Copenhagen isn’t trying to win you over with flash or charm. It doesn’t need to. It simply works — quietly, confidently, and beautifully. It’s a place that respects both the individual and the collective experience. For someone who appreciates subtle details, structure, and thoughtful living, this city delivers on every level.
Without exaggeration, this is the best city I’ve ever visited — but I’d never move there, unless the sun files for residency too. 😆

Welcome to the United Nations Career Journey podcast where we interview colleagues working for the United Nations all over the world. Our conversations explore their fascinating career paths, what career satisfaction means to them and how they keep learning and developing on the job. My name is Alessia and our conversation today is with Paul Anderton from the United Nations Development Programme in Copenhagen in Denmark.
Welcome to the Career Journey Podcast, Paul, thank you very much for joining us. And it’s a pleasure to have you as our guest speaker today. Would you like to introduce yourself?
Hello there Alessia. Greetings, everyone. Yes, certainly. Thanks so much for having me. My name is Paul Anderton. I’m originally from the United Kingdom, but I’ve lived and worked in 11 different countries in my life now, including the last three years here in Denmark in Copenhagen. I am an international servant, international civil servant with the UNDP. As you just mentioned, I work as an HR manager for the Leadership Development team in the Office of Human Resources, in the UNDP’s Talent Development Unit. That would do is as a starting point. So back to you, Alessia.
Yes, thank you, Paul. That’s really interesting that you lived in 11 different countries. And so how did you become interested in this field?
I think when I go back and look at the course of my life, something fairly major changed for me when I was nine years old, when I moved from a small village where I was living in England, a small village that had more sheep than than people actually, that was very homogeneous. And because of my father’s work, we moved to Brussels in Belgium, one of the most international cities in Europe. I went to an international school, and all of a sudden, I went from going to a small rural primary school to a big international school, where I was sitting next to a boy from Tanzania, and a girl from Venezuela, and a boy from Bangladesh and a girl from Japan. And that really had an impact on me at that young age, and really made me interested both in travelling the world and seeing other places, learning, made me intensely curious about the world. And also made me passionate about the feeling of connectedness, the feeling that all of these different people in all different cultures around the world, we are all interdependent, and that an organisation like the United Nations really has an important role to play. And eventually that will be something that I will be able to, to contribute to. So, I guess that kind of international perspective was something that was influencing me from quite a young age, which I maybe didn’t realize so much at the time. But when I look at the kind of the path that my life took, both in terms of the places I ended up working, which includes Japan, and Zambia, Mexico, Nepal, I feel very lucky, very grateful for the possibilities that opened up for me to, to go to these kinds of places have an international career. And, you know, try to make the most of that, including my time here at UNDP.
Wow, thank you, Paul. That’s a really interesting story. I also went to an international school in my life here in Rome, and I do completely understand you when you say that you were sitting next to someone from Japan, someone from Bangladesh, I also had that experience. And it definitely gave me a bigger perspective of things of my life as well. So what does a typical day or week look like for you in this job?
So yeah, so maybe I should talk a bit more about what my job actually is. So as the manager of the leadership development team at UNDP, we’re overseeing all of the internal learning and development opportunities for UNDP’s leaders at all levels, and people managers, and that covers quite a wide range of of activities and programmes that we’re doing - obviously, a lot of online content, but also organising things like retreats, meetings and get-togethers. I would say that the one thing when we talk about a typical week is there is no such thing. There’s constantly different things that are being worked on, different projects, different initiatives. We have a really substantial work portfolio that we work towards with all the different leadership groups within UNDP. That’s Resident Representatives, whether it’s team leaders in country offices, keeping all those going while at the same time, UNDP is never shy to say okay, here’s a priority that we now need to give to you, whether that might be a Women’s Leadership Programme, or something related, due to inclusion of people with disabilities, so that variety is fascinating. The other thing that I think is absolutely essential for doing the job that I do is the kind of the communication and delegation with my team. So I’d say that the anchors are, in this, pretty variable and changing work schedule, the anchors are the regular team meetings, and one-on-one meetings I have with my team meetings. We have a distributed team, so we have a couple of people working with us here in Copenhagen, others who are located in other time zones and other parts of the world. And so therefore, it’s really important for us to have regular check-ins, to get on the same page in terms of what the work priorities are, who is doing what, who’s accountable for what, and I very much enjoy that part of the role as well, the people management, the getting to know other people. I found that the United Nations and UNDP in particular is a fascinating workplace, the people who work here are really interesting, have all kinds of fascinating stories. And I find that the best way that that we can kind of come and work together is to share those components of ourselves with each other that we’re most passionate about. That really elevates the team as a whole, and gets us motivated, even when we might be overwhelmed with a certain project or feeling tired, because we do we do have a lot of responsibility and a lot to do.
Okay, thank you. Wow, that was very descriptive and very useful for our listeners. And so what specific tools have been useful for you to develop career wise?
So in terms of tools, I was thinking, it’s in my career, it’s probably been less about kind of technical training or specific certification, so to speak, and more about kind of mindset and approach. So I think that some of the things in my career as a whole that have really helped me get to the point I am today includes things like agility, so being able to move from one thing to another, having, I guess, the self confidence that if I’m trying something that’s new to me that I can kind of fall back on the core skill set that I’ve kind of built up over time to get me through that, as well as the network of colleagues and others who can help me either with information or tips, mentor me through certain things to get me somewhere else. And when I was thinking about the idea of a career journey, my career — I don’t usually think of it in those terms, because it hasn’t ever really been kind of mapped out or planned to any great degree. The basic philosophy has been on my approach has been to be open to the opportunities that have come my way trying to follow my passions, which as I mentioned, have been around travel or around being an international civil servant. Also about international development work, that’s what my master’s degree is in, and I spent several years working as a development project manager and humanitarian worker before shifting more to an HQ role at UNDP. And that’s kind of incorporated some of the other skills and I guess, the different job titles that I’ve had over the years, all of those things have contributed different bits of pieces into the professional that I currently am. So I mentioned working in humanitarian worker in Zambia, Uganda in the past, but over time, I’ve also been a teacher, the university lecturer I’ve even though the short term jobs that I’ve had, whether that’s volunteering, I’ve done quite a bit of volunteering my life particularly with with refugees with the Red Cross, an International Rescue Committee, but also part time jobs as you know, things like a driver, a librarian, even a movie projectionist back in the day… All of these things have, you know, added little components into both my kind of my bank of experiences and skills, and also the way that I go about my job. So I mentioned kind of agility and moving from, from one thing to the next thing. Curiosity is also something that has been really important for my career, because that has meant that I have looked to keep growing and taking on different challenges, expanding the repertoire of things that I can do or will go put my hand up to take on. And in our team, the Talent Development Team here at UNDP, we often talk about the growth mindset, the idea that we’re constantly growing, we’re constantly evolving, we’re all on a continuous learning journey, where it’s not the case that — okay, after school in university, that’s it, your learning is done and you put it away. That’s not the way the world works. It’s not the way that work itself works. So, so that curiosity, agility, the growth mindset to keep trying new things. And I think, also important has been a willingness to take a few risks along the way. I kind of mentioned growing up in a small village in England, when I was young, I was pretty shy, I was not that confident. And I wouldn’t have dreamed, actually, that I would have taken on as many different things as I have done over the course of my life, taking chances to go and study for a year in the USA, where I didn’t know anyone, taking a first job after university in in Taiwan, part of the world where I didn’t speak the language, I didn’t know anyone, I have no idea what to expect. But it was a part of this…this kind of growth experience, and, led in all kinds of interesting directions.
Wow, that was really inspiring. I feel very inspired by that. Especially follow your passion. I feel like nowadays, it’s getting very competitive now, when you are in the search for jobs, but I do agree, follow your passion, agility, take risks, everything you mentioned. It’s nice to hear it once in a while. I feel like some people tend to forget, because of a lot of pressure in this in this environment with the job searching and stuff, especially after the pandemic, when you graduate as a student.
And I have to say as well, I can kind… in looking back, you tend to look at the highlights. There were plenty of lowlights along the way and plenty of moments of ‘oh my god, what is my next job gonna be’ or ‘what happens next’. And particularly when I think about my UN career, I’ve had every variety of contract there is, including being a pro bono volunteer, part time consultant, full time consultant, temporary appointment. I eventually got to a fixed term appointment, that was then abolished as opposed to, so went back not to having a post. I’ve gone through a team relocation, so all of these things are also happening, as well as along the way moments of great uncertainty about what what is the right thing to do? And where, where should I be, where should I be moving? And I do kind of see, not not just my career, but for all of us, our lives are a little bit in… in chapters that are being written as we go. And when you kind of look back at some of the completed chapters, it’s only then you can kind of see how everything came together. And I do sense that the moment that kind of the uncertainty and the questions that particularly young people have about, okay, what is our future going to look like? What kind of jobs am I going to have? What do I think about far from my career? It’s getting more and more challenging. And I think about that, in particular for for my daughters who are eleven and nine, so they still have a ways to go in their own education, but say, in 15/20 years from now, what the job market so to speak might look like is really hard to see. The speed at which the types of jobs that people are doing, or the jobs that people have, they’re just changing so rapidly. And that I think takes me back a little bit to what I was saying about being agile, being willing to change, and trying to build up your self-confidence that actually no, I will, be able to ride these waves and get someway good. And of course it helps a great deal ifunderneath that, the work that you’re doing or the place that you’re working connects to what you’re most passionate about.
Yes, yes, exactly. I agree with you. Overall, everything does move pretty fast, especially the market right now. But we’ll see, I guess, c’est la vie.
I think taking time to kind of really analyze and understand that for yourself. One thing I see that sometimes trips people up is that they might have certain expectations about what they think the world of work should be, or they joined a particular organisation and they have a certain idea — this is exactly what is gonna happen when I get there — And then maybe that’s not quite the reality. So I think the more research you can do, or the more analysis or reflection you can do, both in terms of the work and the job that you’re going into but also in terms of yourself and what you need or what you want to have in your career, that’s really going to help so. So take some time for self-reflection for analysis, and it might be that you see certain jobs where you think okay, well the job looks good, but actually, I’m not sure I fit in that organisation or vice versa, that’s an organisation I want to work for. But is that what they want to be doing? It’s not straightforward at all. And yeah, it’s something that yeah, I myself, I’m still in the middle of. You know, I’m mid career, I’ve probably got 15/20 years to go until until I’d be able to retire. So I’m also surfing the wave.
Yeah, you’re right. I think self-reflection comes with any age. But it’s definitely something that one should do once in a while, you know, especially when it comes to work. And just, overall, how you’re feeling with your job and what you want to do next.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, so one more question, which I believe it’s very important. What role does networking play in your career?
This is an interesting one, because I was thinking back to especially when I first joined the UN, I think I had a vision of networking that is quite different from how I see it now. Because back then, I had quite a hard view of of people who I saw as ‘networkers’. I thought that they were being a bit mercenary, maybe in terms of okay, to network, I need to find the people who are going to help me move up in my career, the people who are going to give me backing or information that’s going to get me a promotion, or get me where I want to be. And that all felt a bit inauthentic. And I think, certainly there are some people who take that approach to networking. But the way that I understand networking now, and how I’d recommend other people who maybe think more like me about it, who maybe don’t feel comfortable with that more aggressive approach to networking, is that really, networking is a long term thing. It’s something where you’re looking to make connections with people. And for me, I feel most comfortable when it’s authentic human connections in the workplace. And I mentioned before being curious, I am constantly curious about my colleagues, in terms of how did they come to UNDP or whichever partner we might be working with, what drives them? What are they passionate about? What do we have in common? And that I think helps the the immediate working relationship. But it also gives you this network of people who, in the future, they might come to you with a question you might go to them with something you want to ask about, there might be just kind of shared information, or just an awareness of, oh, okay, I know that person who’s really good at X, Y, and Z. I’ve got this one thing where I need some help with X, Y, and Z, I’ll just check in with them. And it kind of goes in both directions. So I guess my second recommendation would be not to see networking as something that you have to do to progress in your career, so much as something that can actually be an enjoyable human part of the work experience. We spend so much of our daily life at work, and one of the things I most appreciate about working in the UN is the incredibly diverse and interesting workforce that we have. That’s something that’s both meaningful to me and I think that’s been important in the work that I do and what whatever comes next. And one last thing, because it’s kind of, slightly off to the side, in terms of, of networking. I’ve been quite an active user of LinkedIn. And that’s something where you’ve got some virtual networking at play, which obviously, is not the same thing as what I’ve just been talking about. So on LinkedIn, you’ll have connections to some of your teammates, or people that you work with, or people that you know pretty well, then there’ll be looser connections to maybe people who are in your organisation, but you don’t know, or people who are outside your organisation in other places. And then there’s also connections to sometimes really random group of people who you have no idea who they are. But in that virtual space, there’s a different type of networking going on. And for me, the way that I use LinkedIn is pretty much in three ways. So one is to, to kind of help show the work that I do and the work that my team does to give to kind of highlight what it is that we’ve actually been working on, which can also help me as well in terms of remembering what we’ve what we’ve done over the years. Also, I think LinkedIn is very good in terms of being a good advocate for UNDP itself and for the UN itself, because there’s plenty of posts from different parts of UNDP or the UN system, in terms of the the good work that we’re doing, and I think anyone who works in the UN system, it is part of what we should be doing — helping to support and promote the UN values, you know, the amazing work that we are doing. And then the last thing is also in terms of some of the people who are looking for work themselves. So I regularly reshare links to job vacancy announcements or interesting career opportunities within UNDP or elsewhere that I think that people will find value in. So those are kind of two different strands of networking. I hope that makes sense.
Yes Paul, it completely does. I believe that when I started this internship, I think that the networking has given me a bigger perspective in the way that I network with my colleagues to enjoy the relationship and to get to know them and to understand where they’re coming from, what their values and missions are. This has been really nice, and I don’t know Paul, if you have anything else to say?
So thank you so much Alessia for having invited me to take part and thank you to anyone who’s made it to the end of this this interview. I appreciate you listening!
Thank you so much for coming and thank you all for listening. We hope our conversations will inspire you to keep learning and advancing in your careers. And make sure to share this episode with any social platform you all have. We will see you all for the next time!

What a weekend. I just had the pleasure to explore Copenhagen in Denmark for a bit. I took lots of photos with my beloved Fujifilm X100V and the conversion lenses. In this little article, I will share some of my favorite shots & spots from this trip.
All the photos you’ll see, have been edited with my presets. If you’re interested, you can get them here: www.chrisperkles.at
We arrived at a Wednesday night in the capital of Denmark, and we stayed in the Huxley Hotel in the center of the city. The location of the hotel made it easy to get everywhere by foot.
We started the first beautiful sunny fresh march day at Nyhavn, since it was next to our Hotel. The good thing was that on a Thursday morning, it was not too busy, and we could find a good spot for breakfast close to the water and in the sun.
After having some good brunch, we walked towards Kastellet along the water shore. Spotting some nice architecture and beautiful views.
Kastellet is something special. For me, as an old Stronghold gamer, this was very pleasant to see, how the castle was shaped and still used today.
After the castle, we walked back towards the center and checked out the Frederiks Kirke and Schloss Amalienborg. There we enjoyed a parade from the oldschool military.
Next on our list was Schloss Rosenborg and the attached garden. Since it was March, the garden was not that pretty because nothing was blooming. But the small palace was impressive.
Feeling: Hungry. So let’s get some food. In the area of Schloss Rosenborg, we found a place called Brdr. Price. Food was delicious, service was great and the location very pretty. 10/10 recommend.
Back on energy, we headed towards the Botanical Garden, but we’ve been too late, it was already closed. So the replacement program was the Rundetarn, an observatory with a beautiful view over Copenhagen.
That was the closing of our first day here. We spent a nice evening having some dinner and relaxing.
New day, new luck. We started the day with a quick breakfast and then heading towards the botanical garden again. This time we were on time.
In the evening we walked through the city, checked out some stores and just had a good time.
After all, this was a very beautiful trip, with some great food and beautiful weather. I can recommend copenhagen to everyone, but consider, that town is expensive as hell. The food compared to Austria is at least 50% — 100% more expensive. If you have any questions, send me a message on Instagram or leave a comment here.

Welcome, wanderlust-driven adventurers, to the enchanting city of Copenhagen! Nestled on the scenic shores of Denmark, this vibrant metropolis boasts a mesmerizing blend of rich history, modern design, and irresistible charm. I would always stop by Copenhagen if I needed to fly from the Kastrup Airport. It is the coolest capital in the Nordic country in my opinion. In this article, five must-do experiences will be unveiled. So, grab your sense of adventure and let’s dive into the heart of this magical Danish capital!
Escape the hustle and bustle of the city and find tranquility amidst the lush greenery of the Rosenborg Garden. Located in the heart of Copenhagen, this expansive park is the perfect spot to enjoy a leisurely picnic surrounded by natural beauty in the typical Nodic summer afternoon. Spread out your blanket on the soft grass, bask in the warm Danish sunshine, and savor a delicious spread of local treats, a nice Danish sandwich will be a great choice.
The garden’s meticulously embedded flowers, tranquil ponds, and majestic trees provide a picturesque backdrop for your picnic. As you indulge in your culinary delights, take a moment to admire the stunning Renaissance-style Rosenborg Castle, which stands as a guardian over the garden. Whether you’re seeking a romantic escape or a peaceful retreat with friends and family, picnicking in the Rosenborg Garden is an absolute must-do in Copenhagen.
Step into a world straight out of a Hans Christian Andersen story at the iconic Tivoli Gardens. This whimsical amusement park, dating back to 1843, exudes an atmosphere of wonder and nostalgia. Stroll through enchanting gardens, take a thrilling ride on the roller coasters, and enjoy live performances by talented musicians and actors. As dusk descends, Tivoli transforms into a mesmerizing wonderland of twinkling lights, with charming food stalls offering delicious treats. Tivoli Gardens truly encapsulates the essence of Copenhagen’s charm and should not be missed.
For those seeking retail therapy, Strøget is an absolute must. This bustling pedestrian street stretches across the heart of Copenhagen and is one of Europe’s longest shopping streets. Lose yourself in a retail wonderland as you walk by the high-end boutiques, trendy international brands, and Danish design stores one after another. But Strøget is not just about shopping — it’s a vibrant hub of entertainment, with street performers, charming cafés, and historical landmarks along the way, like Round Tower, City Hall and the Parliament building. Take your time to explore the side streets and hidden courtyards, where you’ll stumble upon unique treasures and delightful surprises.
At the end of the pedestrian street, you can see the most colorful corner of Copenhagen, Nyhavn. It gives you a chance to embrace the picturesque waterfront district that perfectly captures the city’s allure. Its vibrant row of colorful 17th-century townhouses will transport you to a time when sailors, artists, and dreamers roamed these very streets. Stroll along the canal, admiring the quaint boats floating on the water, and indulge in the delectable Danish pastries at the local cafés. Nyhavn is a haven for photographers, and you’ll find endless photo opportunities at every corner. Soak up the lively atmosphere, raise a glass of Carlsberg, and toast to the beauty of Copenhagen.
Prepare to enter a world within a world at Christiania, an autonomous neighborhood that defies convention and embraces its own unique spirit. Founded in the early 1970s, this self-proclaimed “freetown” is a haven for artists, musicians, activists, and free thinkers. Meander through the colorful streets, adorned with vibrant murals, and immerse yourself in the eclectic atmosphere. Discover artisanal shops, organic cafés, and offbeat music venues. While Christiania’s unconventional nature may not be for everyone, it offers a fascinating glimpse into a subculture that celebrates creativity and alternative lifestyles, concurring with a typical hedonist Danish image.
While you’re around the neighborhood, why not visit the top of the Vor Frelsers Kirke? From there, you can look over the whole city, with everything under your eyes. The church also preserves the oldest pipe organs in Copenhagen.
In Copenhagen, where fairy tales blend with regal history, a visit to both Amalienborg and the Little Mermaid promises a captivating journey through time and folklore. Begin your royal escapade at Amalienborg, the present royal castle and residence of the Danish royal family. Marvel at the elegant architecture as you explore the majestic palace complex, composed of four identical rococo-style palaces surrounding an enchanting courtyard. Witness the Changing of the Guard ceremony, where soldiers in their distinctive bearskin hats create a scene straight out of a storybook.
From the regal splendor of Amalienborg, venture to the tranquil shores of Langelinie to meet the iconic Little Mermaid. A short stroll along the promenade leads you to the petite bronze statue perched on a rock, gazing longingly into the sea. This beloved symbol of Copenhagen, inspired by Hans Christian Andersen’s enchanting tale, captures the imagination of visitors from around the world. If you are lucky, you may see swans along side with the mermaid, making this walk even more fairytale-like.
Copenhagen, with its blend of history and creativity, is a destination that promises to captivate every traveler. It is a perfect choice for those who come to visit Scandinavia for the first time. Whether you find yourself lost in the whimsical world of Tivoli Gardens, savoring the colorful sights of Nyhavn, or immersing yourself in the bohemian allure of Christiania, this enchanting city will leave an unforgettable mark on your soul.

My perfect day in CPH starts in Vesterbro, my favorite neighborhood in the city. Formerly a blue-collar neighborhood, it’s known for its hipsters, dive bars, and murals, so I feel right at home, thinking of the Mission District in San Francisco, my second home I left behind.
The main drag, Istegade is grungy and chic in turns: Central Station where Istegade begins crawls with junkies and hookers. Early in the morning, that area is fogged with old cigarette smoke and the clouded eyes of unseeing street-walkers. The Danes are modestly boastful about this last bastion of filth in their practical little city, and the fact that they invented the concept of modern porn as we know it.
My morning begins with pastries. I lived in Paris for years, but I might go out on a limb and say that the Danes’ pastry and bread-making skills are on par if not slightly above the French in general. Near the end of Istegade is BRØD, where a sandy-haired young Viking stands behind the counter and gruffly hands over fresh-baked bread, steaming heft and wholesomeness in his likeness.
One of the things you must do to fully enjoy CPH is rent a bike. The bike roads are so well-paved, the city so level, and the air so crisp, it’ll make you wonder what you did to deserve this bliss. Ride down the suspended bike-only bridge by Fisketorvet mall, and head to the docks for a canal tour, preferably one where they give you warm wine, or gløgg. (I swear I’m not choosing all of these words based on the funky-looking Danish “ø,” which is called a Faroese, you nerds.)
During the tour of the Copenhagen canals, you will learn many things about this watery city, like how it was founded in 1167, about the illustrious reign of King Christian IV, and their near-constant naval humiliations. But the most impressive of all is the newly built power plant, Amager Bakke, which imports waste from neighboring countries to generate energy. The smoke produced from the plant is 95 percent water, with which they aim to recreate the freshness of a mountaintop near the plant’s chimneys where the world’s largest man-made ski slope starts. If that is not doing the MOST good, I don’t know what is.
Back on land, it’ll be time for lunch. Torvehallerne is a fresh food market that delights the senses of food-obsessed world travelers and Copenhageners. Definitely have the smørrebrød, which is dark rye bread covered in all good things like smoked salmon, roast beef, or shrimp, smothered in aioli, nuts, and dill. After that you could check out the Design Museum, one of the best of its kind. But the mother of Danish design and supreme engenderer of material covetousness is Illums Bolighus downtown, the most spectacular design and living store I’ve been inside.
By the time I’ve had my fill of looking at pretty things I can’t afford it’ll be around 3 or 4pm, when people get off work. Yes, you heard me right. It’s time for a drink. A Danish friend told me Denmark has the highest per-capita consumption of coffee, ice cream, and beer. I didn’t check these facts, but I believe him because he’s a doctor.
Whatever you choose to drink, make sure to have a good view of the street to watch the commuting Danes. Other than the fact that they are ridiculously good-looking, one thing struck me as particularly notable: the amount of blond-haired children in the street accompanied not only by their beautiful mothers, but invariably by their fathers as well. Truly, I had never seen a city where so many men were catering to their children. This is the first place I’ve ever been where having kids and taking care of them isn’t emasculating for men or akin to career suicide for women. It was almost as though toxic masculinity had been wiped out. Maternity and paternity leave is mandated by law, and not a miserly few weeks for the mother only, but a whole year, that’s fifty-two weeks of paid leave to be shared between the parents. The government takes good care of its citizens.
Coming from San Francisco and Seoul, where none of my career-driven girlfriends dare having children until they are settled and secure well into their mid-thirties, I suddenly had the creeping suspicion that the rest of the world had got it all wrong. The Danes had figured life out. Everyone was well-fed, a feeling of wholesome well-being permeated the city with the brisk salty air coming off the Baltic Sea.
This was the ideal socialist Utopia, or the closest thing I’d ever seen. The possible future of feminism and mankind invigorated me. But looking around, my heart sank. No one here looked like me. People of color were rare and far in between: I would never belong here. I would always be considered a tourist, or worse, a Thai masseuse.
The Danes are kind but insular people who are sometimes described as cold by expats. Their days and weekends are filled with family picnics and parties that outsiders aren’t invited to. What they have, their culture, their practical sensibilities and husbandry of their surroundings, their dedication to the good life represented by hygge are treasures that should be protected.
But CPH is where one of the worst housing crisis in Europe is taking place for students, newcomers, and immigrants. Denmark receives less refugees per capita than any other Western European country excepting the UK. It is a far cry from what Denmark’s neighbor, Sweden is doing. The future and health of a city can be judged based on their treatment of outsiders, people who aren’t from there who want to move there. And it struck me as sad that some nationalists might cite Denmark as a good example to close their borders to people in need.
When I am about to be depressed by my own thoughts, it’s time to head to Christiania. Christiania Freetown is the jewel of Copenhagen, a radical morsel of prime real estate that hippies took over in the 70s smack-dab in the middle of the city. Until quite recently they didn’t pay for electricity or taxes, operating under their own laws. Before sunset is the ideal time to go there to check out the architecture, which is a euphemism for the only place that sells weed in the open in Denmark. Sit on the outdoor benches or by the water with a beer in hand and feel that brotherly love seep back into you.
When it becomes too cold to sit outside, I would head back towards Vesterbro to Kødbyens, the meat-packing district filled with restaurants and nightclubs to continue the night until the sun comes up. As I creep back home in the morning, the streets are quiet and subdued, foggy and windy like no one lives in this sleepy town. There is none of that anxious energy that makes a big city spin, spin, spin. Bukowski’s saying, “Find what you love and let it kill you,” is not a phrase that goes down well with the practical Danes nor with the soporific comforts offered by hygge.
And I love CPH because it helps me imagine a different life where I don’t have to kill myself for my career, or tamp down every instinct until I make something out of myself. If only one could belong here.

Have you ever arrived in a city so tired from traveling, but somehow the energy of the place wakes you up? That’s exactly what happened when I landed in Copenhagen…
We got to Copenhagen on Friday morning after a ridiculously early 6 AM flight, and we were dead tired. We didn’t have any time to lose so we set out for the hostel. We took the train to Steel House, which was hands down the best hostel we’ve been to yet. It had everything — pool, gym, cinema, you name it. We dropped our bags and headed to the city. Upon arrival we stopped and listened to a singer on the streets, it was super cool to see him perform.
Locating the Streets and Gasoline Grill
Copenhagen has an atmosphere that makes you just want to walk around. We walked around the streets, dropped by Rosenborg Castle, and let the city reveal itself. Somewhere along the way, hunger caught up with us, and we went to Gasoline Grill, which serves famous burgers. The burger was just what we needed and it set the tone for the day.
The Old Irish Pub and Barkowski’s
We continued walking and ended up at this place called “The Old Irish Pub,” where they had a live band playing. The atmosphere was just right with a good energy. We sat back, listened to the music, and just absorbed the atmosphere. It was a mix of locals and tourists, and it felt like one of those pubs you find on a college campus.
We finally checked into the hostel at 3pm and freshened up to then head back out into town. This time we headed to Barkowski’s, a restaurant/bar that was full of people. We had heard that they heard pull tables but didn’t see them at first sight. After an urgent search we headed downstairs to the basement and found the pool tables and asked some locals if we could play them. They were excited to play “The Americans” and spoke great english. We ended up beating them in a best-of-5 series and it felt very good to win. We hung out for a little while longer and listened to the jazz/rock that was playing, then called it a night.
CopenHot and relaxing, and partying at Rumors
The next morning, we were ready for something entirely new. We went to CopenHot, where they have hot tubs right on the water. It was busy, but in the best way possible — people were just hangin’ out, relaxing. We even did the ice plunge for a bit. The cold was terrible but the instant jump back into the hot tub made up for it. The soft music in the background made all this feel ultra peaceful. It was just the reset we needed.
Then we were hungry and went to War Pigs to get BBQ. As someone who is from Texas, I can vouch that it was some of the best BBQ I had had. The mac and cheese was phenomenal and it paired just right with the pulled pork sandwich. It was the ideal way to finish off a relaxing morning, and I would eat in again in an instant if I could.
We napped briefly, then prepared for the evening. We headed to The Jane, a former library turned bar. The music was just what you’d expect if you were in a library listening to music. It was definitely a first for me and it almost makes you feel like you are in a library. It had books on the walls and the lighting was very dim. It was a very mellow vibe.
Though that changed pretty quickly… We then headed to a club called Rumors. It was all EDM and sing-along tracks here, and the atmosphere was on a whole different level. People were dancing in what looked like a pit.. The music was blasting, and we got to feel what its like to almost be at a concert in Denmark. We met some locals, danced and then called it a night to end our trip.
The Copenhagen Vibe
By the time we got back to the hostel, I had concluded that Copenhagen somehow felt like Amsterdam — the buildings, the bars, the surprises around every corner. There’s a sense of never having any idea what’s gonna happen next and what place you will end up in. Everywhere we went was somewhere completely different and somehow we had a great time everywhere we went. And honestly, the music in this city ended up shaping the whole experience. It was the soundtrack to it all, establishing mood and rendering each moment a little more memorable.
Thanks for reading! If you enjoyed this post, make sure to follow my account for more travel stories and insights. Stay tuned for next week’s adventure .

After a long, dark, freezing, and often soul-crushing winter, Copenhagen slowly begins to come alive in April. It’s green and beautiful with colorful flowers all over the city.
And right in the middle of so many colors, when the cherry trees blossom, their delicate white and pink petals create a stunning contrast against the lush green grass and the clear blue sky.
Copenhagen is full of cherry blossom trees. You see them everywhere. They are in the gardens of tall buildings and standalone houses, in playgrounds, near water bodies, and even lining the roads.
This was quite surprising for me during my first year here. I always pictured Denmark as people biking through the streets, taking icy dips in the sea, and sipping coffee with Danish pastries in cozy cafés.
But cherry blossoms?
That was something I never expected.
This was one of the sweetest surprises that Copenhagen, the world’s happiest city, has given me.
I’ve travelled to over 20 countries, some just once, others many times, but Japan has always remained a dream. Though I have planned many times, a trip to…

Overview
Schrödinger’s cat was a thought experiment proposed by Erwin Schrödinger in a discussion with Albert Einstein in an attempt to illustrate the insufficiencies of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. The experiment questioned the validity of superposition and posed the largely unsolved question of at which point a superposition collapses into one of its possible states.
Superposition — Young’s Double Split Experiment
Superposition plays an essential role in the Copenhagen interpretation and thus Schrödinger’s thought experiment. It is the ability of a quantum system to simultaneously exist in multiple states until observed. The idea is demonstrated by Thomas Young’s double-slit experiment, where a beam of light is aimed at a barrier with two small vertical slits. The light that has passed through the slits is measured on a photographic plate. When one of the vertical slits is covered, a single line of light is observed on the photographic plate on the side of the uncovered slit. If both are left uncovered, however, rather than two lines of light, there are many more on the photographic plate. In route to the photographic plate, each photon exists in a state of each of its possible trajectories, demonstrating a concept called interference, which is essentially the superposition of waves.
In an attempt to further analyze the trajectories of the photons, experiments have been conducted to track their paths. Doing this, however, seems to disrupt the superposition of the photons, creating what would be expected by classical physics on the photographic plate, two lines of light mirroring the slits in the preceding barrier. It appears that the superposition of a particle can not be directly measured; its effects (interference) can only be observed.
Schrödinger’s Cat
Schrödinger’s Cat is a thought experiment that was proposed by Erwin Schrödinger in a discussion with Albert Einstein to highlight the seemingly ridiculous nature of the concepts of superposition used in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. The Copenhagen interpretation briefly states that a quantum system remains in a state of superposition until directly observed by the outside world. When observed, the superposition collapses into one of its possible states. For example, when the photons in Young’s double-slit experiment were measured, they collapsed into one of their possible trajectories, creating two lines of light.
Schrödinger, attempting to disprove the practicality of superposition, proposed a hypothetical in which a larger system was dependent on the superposition of a quantum particle. Schrödinger suggested that if a cat were placed inside a sealed box with a radioactive particle and a flask of poison and the poison was only released if the particle decayed and released radiation, the mortality of the cat would be subject to the state of the radioactive particle. Because the Copenhagen interpretation states that the radioactive particle is in a position of both decayed and not decayed, the cat, by extension, will be in a position of both alive and dead until observed by the outside world. The goal was not to propose the practicality of simultaneously dead and alive cats, instead the thought experiment emphasized the unrealistic implications the Copenhagen interpretation had at a larger scale.
The thought experiment had brought to light a question that is still largely unsolved today: “At what point does a particle stop existing as a superposition and collapse into one of its possible states?” The Copenhagen interpretation had assumed this would happen when an observation of the superposition takes place.
Von Neumann Interpretation
In response to the flaws of the Copenhagen interpretation, John von Neumann proposed the idea that the radioactive particle is observed by the device that detects radiation which is subsequently observed by the controlled flask holding the poison. The point at which the superposition of the particle collapses is not significant. The only point at which the superposition must collapse is when there is a conscious observer. Even this interpretation, however, has been rejected by a thought experiment proposed by Eugene Wigner called Wigner’s friend. Other interpretations include the ensemble interpretation, relational interpretation, and transactional interpretation all with the common goal of identifying at which point a superposition collapses, a question posed by Erwin Schrödinger’s famous thought experiment: Schrödinger’s cat.

“Jonathan just tested positive for Covid here this morning.” My son Dan called me from Copenhagen with the bad news. And he called just minutes before I was to fly there for a long-anticipated visit to Copenhagen, to visit Dan and his family. I was devastated. I knew it would be crazy at age 87 to head off to Copenhagen when someone in the household there had Covid. I canceled.
I had been reading and talking about Denmark for weeks and I found myself continuing to do research and hold forth on Denmark. And now, dear readers, I want to share some of the amazing information that I have learned and to tell you why what is going on in Denmark matters to each of us. Even if we never go there.
Denmark has been ranked as the best place on earth to live and also the best of all countries in terms of quality of life. It has been named as the least corrupt country in the world and number one in terms of protecting the environment and gender equality. It has been ranked the 2nd happiest country on earth, (after Finland) for…

Alright. I have completely fallen in love with Copenhagen. If I were to do college again, I would study abroad here… in the summer ; ). It’s seriously such a magical place — the parks, the bike lanes, the zero noise pollution, the food, the “hygge”… I could go on. Copenhagen is considered one of the happiest cities in the world, + I can totally see why.
Pro Tip — Bike… everywhere. Literally, everywhere.
1] Mad + Kaffe: MUST. HAVE. BRUNCH. HERE. They serve brunch until 12:30 every day. Wow. I can’t believe a spot like this is not in Chicago yet. This has been voted “best brunch in Copenhagen.”
2] Wulff + Konstali: Another — MUST. HAVE. BRUNCH. HERE. They serve brunch until 3 PM [even better!]. Go to the one on Ameagerbro, so that you can go to the beach after!
3] Grod: We went here for takeaway dinner, but I wish I could have come for breakfast! Everything is porridge based… sounds weird but it’s SO GOOD.
For Next Time (Brunch) — Baryl, Social, Bowl Market, Cafe Det Vide Has, Moeller Kaffe + Kokken
Coffee — Coffee Collective, Original Coffee, Statement Coffee, Prolog Coffee Bar
Bakeries — Sankt Peders Bageri [cinnamon rolls on Wednesdays! ++ Copenhagen’s oldest bakery!], Leckerbaer, Isoteket, , Juno The Bakery, Lilli Bakery, Hart Bageri, Meyers Bageri, Bageriet Brod
Sweets — Nicecream, ISTID, Social Foods, Granny’s House [in Torvehallerne]
1] La Banchina: Hands down favorite spot in Copenhagen for a few reasons: the food is incredible [apps = bread + olive oil, olives, + almonds… + then the starter, fish, vegetable, + dessert change every day!], THEN after dinner: jump in the water… + then warm up by the fire + SAUNA. They are also open for breakfast, which is probably so dreamy too.
2] Organic Boho: We stumbled upon this place on our way to Christiana [the hippy town] + WOW, obsessed. Get the burger with tempeh, + THE LOVE PLATE [my fav]. They have tons of beautiful drinks too — juices, smoothies, + rainbow lattes ; ).
3] 42Raw: I love that so many spots in Copenhagen have easy “takeaway” options. We ordered takeaway to bring on the Go Boat: acai bowl, green bowl [“this almost tastes too healthy” — Isaac], salad of the day, + chocolate PB cup. The sweet potato fries looked bomb, too.
4] Neighbourhood: Organic pizza + cocktails… what more do you need? Oh, + TRUFFLE POPCORN. Make sure to get the burrata love pizza.
5] Sprod: You know a place is good when they don’t have an English menu. We ordered the chicken sandwich to split as a snack… + then instantly ordered another one. SO YUM.
6] District Tonkin: This place has the “best banh mi in Copenhagen” + it lived up to the hype . Chicken lemongrass banh mi + pho = winning combo.
7] Souls: This won the most sustainable restaurant in Copenhagen, AND best vegan restaurant — so definitely go. The warm potato salad was liiiiiife. ++ the summer lemonade.
8] Aamanns Deli: A trip to Copenhagen is not complete without trying a smorresbrod. There’s a few Aamanns, depending on the experience you want — I liked the deli because you can eat it in the restaurant, or easily choose takeaway + bring it to a park!
9] Kodbyens Fiskebar: MUSSELS : ) This was the fanciest restaurant that we went to [on our last night]. It’s in the Meat Packing District… we hopped around to a few places — staying at each place for an hour while ordering: drink + one item from the menu to share, what we call #AppyHour.
10] Smag: The BEST salads + sandwiches, oh my gosh. Go before a picnic!
For Next Time — Morganstedt, SimpleRaw, dop, Bollyfood, WEDOFOOD, Gro Spiseri, Ma Poule [duck sandwich is apparently amazing], Kaf, California Kitchen, Mahalle CPH, Plantepolsen, Barabba, Amass [$$$$], Kadea [$$$$], Noma ; ) [$$$$ — named the best restaurant in the WORLD]
Markets — Copenhagen out did themselves with all the markets here. Like, WOW. Trovehallerne is obviously a must… make sure to get Smag, GROD, a chocolate peanut butter brownie from Granny’s House. Other fabulous markets are The Bridge Street Kitchen, Reffen, Rebel Food, + Tivoli Food Hall.
1] Mikkeller + Friends: Apparently the best spot for beer in Copenhagen.
2] WarPigs: Go for the beer, stay for the MEAT. Omg, literally — the brisket was to diiiiie for. *Make a stop here during #AppyHour.
3] Noho: Funky cocktails + hip vibe. *Make a stop here during #AppyHour.
4] Grab Wine… Literally Anywhere: Drink in a park, on the streets, by the lake, etc. It’s open container law!
For Next Time — Sidecar, BRUS, Baghaven, Himmeriget, Lidoeb, Malbeck Vinbar
1] ALL. THE. PARKS: Faelledparken, Svanemoelle Beach, The Citadel, Frederiksberg Gardens (*probably my fav because you get a shot of the zoo in the park + can see the elephants!), Superkilen, King’s Garden, Botanical Gardens… + more. If I lived here, I would spend every day in a park. They are all so gorgeous + unique. You must visit them all!
2] Walk Down These Streets:
3] Go Boat: We chose this over the Canal Tour [if I had time, I’d do both!] — you rent a boat to drive… yourself… with no experience required! Aha. It’s right next to the Islands Brygge Harbour Bath, which you should definitely go to on a sunny day. *Book ahead of time!
4] Tivoli: Copenhagen’s second oldest amusement park, + right in the center of town. It’s definitely worth a stop.
5] Visit The Cemeteries: Sounds creepy, but this is also a must. Vestre Cemetery + Assistens Cemetery are incredibly beautiful.
6] Christiania: The hippie commune — the only place hash/weed is legal in Copenhagen. Super funky to walk through... most people built their homes themselves! Couple things to note: I wouldn’t go there at night, no photos are allowed, + no running.
7] Shop Vintage: Check out this guide for the flea markets!
8] Wellness: I wasn’t able to test any of these out, but I heard great things about: YO Studios, NOR Nordic Health House, CopenHot, Hot Yoga CPH.
We stayed at Hotel SP34— incredible free breakfast every day, in a great spot in town [a bike store is like two seconds away… or you can rent bikes at the hotel], + WINE HOUR EVERY DAY! Also, there are a few other hotels close by in the same collective, so you can go there for wine hour, too ; ). Check out Brochner Hotels. / *One thing I will say is the room we booked was TINY.
There are so many components within Copenhagen that I want to bring back to Chicago — particularly BIKE LANES. ++ how they do brunch… + all the parks. I’m in loooooove. Please visit!
What did I miss? Let me know!
++ Elisabeth

Copenhagen, Denmark, has a unique and interesting transit system. When looking at it at first, most will just see the S-train network, that by any means is not the largest one in the world. But it’s a quite effective network. And when combined with the metro that got added to the Copenhagen transit network back in 2002 when the first 2 lines opened.
The S-train network has been running since 1934. It was the vision for the network, even before it was born that it should be 100% electrified. And it has been, from its start until today, it has only been running on electricity. This vision was part of some earlier work done by The Electrification Commission of 1926, that wanted to electrify many of the commuter rails in and around the suburbs of Copenhagen.
The first line opened the 3rd of April 1934, and ran from Klampenborg via Hellerup and Vanløse and terminated at Frederiksberg. This exact line is now defunct and does not exist in today's network. Along with a timetable…

My interest to explore Copenhagen stemmed from the immaculate design culture that I had heard of . In the quest to explore the origin of hygge life we left for about week’s adventure to Copenhagen.
Fun Fact: The Danish Royal Family holds the title of the oldest monarchy. If Queen Elizabeth visits she will need to bow down to the Queen and King of Denmark.
2. Food & Drink: During my visit, the surprising find for me has been the refined food scene here. Unlike other cities, I did not go here with a focus on devouring food all day but I was pleasantly surprised by the offerings. It could be the influence of René Redzepi’s Noma, which is seen as one of the best restaurants in the world potentially attracting a lot of culinary talent here. Although, I could not get reservation at Noma these are some restaurants that left me wanting more:
Similarly for drinks some spots to check out are:
3. Fashion & Art: When I travel, I love to check out local stores that depict the local style. For sartorial trends street style was definitely trending in the city. Most of the stores I went to showcased unisex easy to wear style. Some stores that were interesting to check out are:
You cannot leave Copenhagen without checking out the best in class design stores. Some to check out are:
4. Must see: As mentioned, Copenhagen is a beautiful city. To understand its past and present I would recommend you to check out these spots, which span all over the city and gives you a good idea on what Copenhagen is all about.
Nyhavn: Street with beautiful colorful building. Great for an evening stroll.
Garden Royal: Close to Aamann’s great to catch a break here and check the rose garden.
Supekilen: For all the reasons listed above highly recommend to check this out. Although a bit away from city center.
Freetown Christiania: This is a free commune which operates as a local body without any governance from local government. It is an interesting oasis in the middle of the city , which is worth checking out.
Nyboder houses: Built in 1757, these houses have lasted several city fires and provides a little flavor of the past.
Church of Savior: This church gives a great aerial view of the city. Worth climbing up the 700 stairs to check out the cityscapes.
Design Museum of Denmark: This museum provides Danish sensibility and evolution from everywhere across fashion, architecture, furniture.
5. Tips & Tricks: These are some quick tips that I wanted to leave you with while planning your trip.

I just got back from my two-week trip across most of Northern Europe. This is my third trip back to Europe. (My first was a summer abroad in Italy nearly 8 years ago and my second was another two-week trip in 2014 where we explored Dublin, London, Amsterdam, and Paris.) I daresay this was the best so far! Thom and I visited Stockholm, Copenhagen, Berlin, and again, Amsterdam this time around. In order to share our experience and to create a living record of its details, I’ve decided to write across a few posts on each city and its adventures. This first post serves to detail our overall travel plans, information on flights/places to stay, tips on light packing, and general advice for good travel. I should mention that I’m not an expert on any other these things but it’s worth sharing the little knowledge that I gained before, during, and after this trip.
To begin with, here are a few starting facts about our trip:
Let’s begin by discussing budget flights. Nine months before this vacation even happened I found some non-stop flights from Oakland to Stockholm for $600 a person. These flights kicked off the entire trip and made everything possible. I recall the very first time I ever flew to Europe. (Which was 8 years this summer!) It was to Genoa, Italy from Buffalo, NY. That flight had three stops (Buffalo to NYC, NYC to Frankfurt, and Frankfurt to Milan) and one train (Milan to Genoa) in order to get to my destination with a total of over 20+ hours at a hefty price of $1500. (Thanks Aer Lingus! 🖕) So to come across a flight that was only 10 hours and non-stop to my choice destination, it felt like fate...
Doesn’t that last sentence feel so inspiring? Statements and facts like those are the gold and shiny wrapper on the cheap bar of travel chocolate. Here’s the nitty-gritty of budget flying:
With some of the add-ons and extra taxes, our $600 tickets actually came to $711.30 a person. Our in-between flights from city to city were around $50 a person. (As compared to a train from Berlin to Amsterdam which was $120 a ticket.) In the end, you have to deal with the minor annoyances for that 💰deal.
Let’s move on to transportation.
Thom and I took public transit for the most part. (I’ll discuss the bicycling and Uber rides a bit later in some of my city posts.) For us, it’s a fun challenge learning a new city’s public transit. And unlike American public transportation, European public transportation is fast, convenient, and very, VERY reliable. Upon arriving at the Arlanda Airport, which is located just outside of Stockholm, we took the Arlanda Express Train that runs directly to the city center in just 20 minutes. (As compared to my 1.5 hour MUNI and BART trip to Oakland International Airport. 😑) Out of the four cities we visited, Berlin boasted the fastest and most reliable transportation (dat German innovation) with Amsterdam coming in at a close second. (Trams, trams everywhere!) All the trams, trains, and buses that we took were clean and clearly marked. My only complaint was the summer heat which was especially felt in the enclosed and non-air conditioned trains.
I plan to discuss each Airbnb in detail for each city post but in general our decision to use this service came from a few points:
Finally, let’s talk about packing. Much like my last Europe trip, I took a single backpack and personal bag with me. That was it! Now that this trip is over, I can say, quite proudly, that it was the best decision that I made for packing. After each city we visited, Thom and I both got a little better at packing our bags. It was a very efficient way to travel, IMO.
Here are some pros:
I admit that there are some cons involved with this kind of packing. While I can pack a mean bag, it doesn’t exclude the fact that the weight gets to you…no matter how light. If you’ve ever landed at an airport and took public transit into a city, the transfers mean a lot of walking between terminals and stations. The weight of the bag can cause a lot of stress on your neck and shoulders. Even this year, I packed a bag that weighed about 8 lbs total and after a while, say 20 minutes of walking, it can really push down on you. I should mention that my bag isn’t meant for hiking or true backpacking and therefore isn’t super ergonomic. I’m sure if I had chosen a small hiking backpack, my experience would be different. The bag that I took is just an everyday backpack for commuting which is why long walks with a lot of weight can easily become a small burden.
Backpacking can also force you to make some crucial decisions as to what you pack. One small error (should I bring a bathing suit?) and you’ll be forced to carry that item throughout the entire trip with much resentment. The last time we were in Europe, it rained for most of the trip. Thom brought an umbrella this year. He never needed it! 😂 🙃 Lessons learned.
A few surprising things that we did bring this year are:
I’ve only really traveled internationally in the summer months so packing has always been dictated by the warmer weather. I took mainly dresses with a single pair of jeans and shorts. A few shirts to mix it up and a hoodie with a jean jacket for cooler evenings/days. I took a pair of black flats since they’re so versatile and my Keds for comfort as I walked/biked everywhere. I kept toiletries to small sizes and bought anything else that might have run out.
Thom and I failed to exchange any currency prior to the trip. But I would recommend making that order with your bank if possible since ATMs abroad will charge you a fee for any withdrawals. Also, make the obligatory call to your bank letting them know that you are traveling abroad so that they don’t lock your card and account.
A kind co-worker provided us an extra SIM card and we had another already from past trips, so this year we both had data/service for our phones. Thankfully our SIM cards were both purchased in the Netherlands with Vodaphone. These cards worked in all the other countries we visited and we didn’t need to purchase new cards along the way.
Finally, I’ll add that we obtained Global Entry prior to the trip. It made entering the US very easy and fast when going through customs. If you are a frequent international flyer, consider getting Global Entry. Global Entry includes TSA PreCheck. So if you fly around the country frequently (which I do), it’s very convenient and handy for jumping those long security lines.
This post is a part of a series based on my recent two-week trip to Europe.

The Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics Is Not Idealist in Nature,https://medium.com/paul-austin-murphys-essays-on-philosophy/the-copenhagen-interpretation-of-quantum-mechanics-is-not-idealist-in-nature-797779e86290,"Sign up

The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics — and even quantum mechanics generally — has been both loosely and strongly associated with the philosophical position of idealism (see here).
Of course, there are almost as many varieties of idealism (from subjective idealism to absolute idealism to pluralist idealism) as there are idealists. So this isn’t the place to run through all of them. In any case, the kind of idealism I have in mind will become clear in this essay itself.
So take as an example the following passage (written in 2005) from Harry Nielsen:
“ Almost unbelievably perhaps, [the academics who developed quantum mechanics] chose to interpret the strangeness of quantum behaviour by denying the existence of physical reality. And as a standard textbook interpretation of quantum mechanics, physicists have been taught for the last 80 years that physical reality therefore only exists as a result of the act of observation. This is the ‘Copenhagen interpretation’ of quantum mechanics, developed in the late 1920’s by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. To quote Heisenberg: ‘I believe that the existence of the classical ‘path’ can be pregnantly formulated as follows: The ‘path’ comes into existence only when we observe it’.”
The passage above doesn’t actually mention “idealism” — yet the general gist seems to be that the Copenhagen interpretation is idealist (or at least subjectivist). And it isn’t at all odd that this writer thought this way about this interpretation of quantum mechanics.
So it’s important to stress that the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics is not idealist. Or at least the Copenhagen interpretation itself can be interpreted as not being idealist. That said, it is difficult to explain why that’s so. Indeed not many physicists — or even philosophers — have fully clarified why that is so.
Finally, there are stronger arguments which assert that quantum mechanics — if not the Copenhagen interpretation itself — is entirely subjectivist in nature. Yet there are clear differences between subjectivism and idealism. Indeed, Harry Nielsen’s words above can be interpreted as only claiming that the Copenhagen interpretation is subjectivist, not idealist.
Various philosophers (such as Karl Popper) have also argued against those who claim that quantum mechanics is subjectivist , let alone idealist (see Popper here).
It is therefore convenient that there’s a short and simple passage (as quoted in Karl Popper’s The Logic of Scientific Discovery) from the Austrian physicist Arthur March (1891–1957) which perfectly clarifies this issue.
Firstly, Arthur March makes an explicit anti-idealist statement. (It’s not clear if that was his main intention — indeed, it probably wasn’t.) He wrote:
“Naturally nobody is so mad as to assert that a body ceases to exist the moment we turn our backs to it [].”
[March was referring to quantum bodies such as particles; not cups, trees or human beings.]
An idealist, on the other hand, would argue that
a body ceases to exist the moment we turn our backs to it.
And that’s because, to an idealist, “a body” — and everything else — only exists in the individual mind or in some kind of collective mind. Thus, it does indeed cease to exist when “we turn our backs to it”. (Unless, that is, it still exists in the mind of God — as with Bishop Berkeley immaterialism, in some other being’s mind or in a collective mind.)
Arthur March, on the other had, stated that it is “mad [] to assert” that idealist position. Yet March did preface that phrase with the following words:
“One may say perhaps without fear of being misunderstood [] that for the physicist a body has reality only in the instant in which he observes it.”
It’s worth noting the phrase “for the physicist”.
This isn’t an expression of a philosophical view or even of a layperson’s position. As a physicist, March was speaking entirely as a physicist.
So even though it may be problematic to stress observation alone, this is still the stress of a physicist qua physicist. And, almost by definition, a physicist is only concerned with the observations of — and experiments on — a (in March’s word) body.
Thus March, qua physicist, stated that the
“[body] does cease, in the moment, to be an object of inquiry for the physicist”.
Why is that?
It’s
“because there exists no possibility of saying anything about it which is based on experiment”.
March’s statement above is true by definition. That is, what comes before the experiment can’t actually be part of the experiment. Or if someone does “say[] anything about it”, then what he says can’t be based on the experiment, and is therefore not itself physics. Indeed, even the mathematical formalism and/or the wave function required for the experiment has nothing to “say” about any bodies before the experiment.
The wave function has just been mentioned.
Thus, the standard interpretation of the wave function is that — in itself — it has no physical interpretation. It is purely a mathematical function. A tool. Something physicists use to do things with. Of course, it can then be given a physical interpretation.
Take the Schrödinger equation.
This doesn’t tell us what the wave function is — other than in purely mathematical terms. The physical meaning of the equation — i.e., what entities, etc. are posited — is a product of the interpretation of quantum mechanics the physicist adopts.
And even when physicists do “guess” at the (as it were) before-observation, that too is only a use of the wave function; which, again, is a large abstract mathematical object made of smaller mathematical objects.
So, basically, Arthur March, qua physicist, wasn’t interested in what might have been the case before the experiment. And, presumably, he wasn’t that interested in what was the case — i.e., in the experimental area — after he took off his white coat and packed up his bags to go home. Alternatively, if he was interested in both the before and after of the experiment, then it was as a philosopher or a layperson, not as a physicist.
As hinted at in the introduction, it’s at least partly understandable that some people see the Copenhagen interpretation as being philosophically idealist in nature. In the passage in the introduction, for example, Harry Nielsen quoted Werner Heisenberg.
So I’ll help Nielson’s cause along by also quoting Heisenberg stating the following:
“[A]n ‘objective’ physics in this sense, i.e. a sharp division of the world into object and subject has indeed ceased to be possible.”
Such passages from Heisenberg and others have provided grist to the mill for various idealists, mystics, New Agers and whatnot. Yet even here (on my reading of idealism at least) an idealist simply can’t make any distinction at all between “object and subject”. (Of course, it’s possible that the word “object” can be defined in such as way that it squares with idealism.) That’s because (to an idealist) literally everything is in the individual’s (or experimenter’s) mind. (Either that, or everything is in a collective mind or in the mind of God.) In other words, there is simply no object in idealism — we only have a subject or subjects.

Here is my usual guide to Copenhagen for tourists who enjoy the culinary side of life and want to visit Copenhagen for the first time.
In general I tell Taxi to use taxa.dk +45 35353535 or use Donkey bikes with app or use the electric scooters.
Packing: Copenhagen is rainy and windy and chilly. Check weather forecast. Plenty swimming opportunities, so bring a towel and swimwear if you want to swim.
Inner city: This is the old town of Copenhagen. Think small streets, alleyways, and historic squares. The main (shopping) streets are Strøget and Købmagergade. Sights to see: Parliament (Christiansborg) and the Round Tower (Rundetårn). You will find two good wine bards here: Ved Stranden 10 and Den Vandrette as well as restaurant Musling.
Christianshavn: An old residential neighborhood full of canals and colorful houses. Sights to see: Cathedral of Copenhagen (Von Frue Kirke) and the Freetown Christiania. Try Rufino’s delicious pasta if you’re in the area or grab a beer at Barr in the evening sun. Restaurant 108 is also located here.
Vesterbro: The area is full of hip cafés, bars, galleries, music venues, and restaurants. The main streets are Istedgade and Sønder Boulevard. Sights to see: the meatpacking district (Kødbyen), where you can pick up Rosio Sanchez’s delicious food (ex-Noma) at Hija de Sanchez, enjoy coffee at Prolog or dine at Fiskebaren. Also, check out Rosio’s new opened place Sanchez on Istedgade.
Nørrebro: This area is often described as the most diverse part of Copenhagen. You’ll find vintage clothing stores, antique shops, café’s, and authentic Danish bodegas (bars). The most interesting streets are Jægersborggade, Stefansgade, Griffenfeldsgade, Guldbergsgade, Nørrebrogade, Ravnsborggade, and Blågårdsgade. Swing by Bæst for pizza if you’re near Guldbergsgade.
Østerbro: in an old bourgeois, residential neighborhood. Among other things, you’ll find Copenhagen’s largest park, Fælledparken, here; interesting streets: Østerbrogade, the stretch closest to The Lakes (Søerne) and Nordre Frihavnsgade. Sights to see: Kastellet (an old family fortress), Svanmøllen beach, and Juno Bakery.
Amager: Copenhagen airport is situated here. You can reach the inner city by metro in 17 minutes. Islands Brygge is worth a visit — and a swim! Sights to see: The wild landscape of Amager Fælled, Amager Strandpark (the beach), and Helgoland (a traditional sea bathhouse from 1913, that is open for everyone during the summer months).
Refshaleøen: This is the area of Copenhagen where a lot of top restaurants are based. Recently, the peninsula has been in constant development. Check out restaurant Amass, LA Banchina, and Lille bakery.
Restaurants, bars, and coffee shops:
Here, we have composed a small list of our favorite restaurants in town. We’ve also added our favorite wine bars, coffee spots, and hang-outs.

When people hear ‘Danish,’ they typically think of Danish pastry, a multilayered sweet pastry with various fillings like cheese or a berry sauce. Or they think of Danish cheese.
From the moment I landed in Copenhagen, locals and people from my program told me to try the numerous famous bakeries in the city. Of course, as a foodie, I couldn’t say no.
But what I didn’t realize was how central of a gathering place bakeries are for Copenhageners (is that what they call them?). Their fast-paced life accompanies grabbing a pastry and cappuccino on their way to the office, or as a casual meet-up spot for friends as they get off work around 3 or 4 pm.
When I look back via camera roll at the delicious, warm, and fluffy pastries I tried, it evokes more than longing to have the level of freshness and quality these pastries have at an affordable price. It sucks me right back into highs and lows during my study abroad, new friendships blossoming, and lessons learned.
Here are five moments (and pastries) I am happy to share from my study abroad experience in Copenhagen:
A week into my stay, I found myself wandering through the streets near Kongens Nytorv, the city center filled with people, shops, and the famous Nyhavn canal. I was walking home after a class excursion feeling hungry and exhausted.
I was still figuring out public transportation (bus or train?) and I had unsuccessfully made any plans with new friends.
The homesickness and loneliness were starting to sink in.
I stumbled upon the nearest coffee shop, Farumhus, which translates to “farmhouse.” I walked in and ordered the Kanelstang, a cinnamon Danish pastry but elegantly twisted in various ways, depending on the bakery.
The place was about to close, so the lady ringing me up offered me an extra pastry for free. her kindness was a small act but stirred a few tears for me, sprouting a tiny sense of belonging in this new country.
Biting into the Kanelstang felt like a warm hug as well, with the generous layers of cinnamon and the intricate swirls, perfect for ripping pieces as I sat on a bench and people-watched for the evening.
I’ve been to this bakery twice during my stay and both times were with new friends I had made. My Food and Identity professor recommended this bakery, located in the Meatpacking District, to our class after a field study in the area.
My friends and I sat outside the bakery in Enghave Plads: this utopian park area where families, friends, and children gathered to chat, play, and spend time together. How I long for areas like these in the US. It was a great area to break the ice over delicious treats and get to know each other more.
As an Indian, trying a cardamom bun was absolutely out of my comfort zone. But strangely it’s a popular pastry option in Copenhagen. But the lemon tart was gorgeous. A light and fluffy meringue, with the tart lemon flavor, dare I say — it’s almost better than a key lime pie (shocker! as a Floridian.)
I was well into my study abroad and just completed my second session. Life was good, I was finally getting used to navigating the area, and made some good friends and memories. But I was longing for one of my favorite moments of my stay: my partner visiting me.
I purposely avoided a few attractions and restaurants to try when he got here, which included Skt. Peders Bageri, which translates to St. Peter’s bakery. A cozy bakery that hails as one of the oldest in Copenhagen, they’re known for their Wednesday snails (cinnamon rolls) that I regretfully did not try. I know nothing about authentic Danish food, but this certainly felt what ‘authentic’ would be.
I tried their plain croissant which was indubitably the BEST croissant I’ve had in my life (I think about it often..) and had to snag a blueberry pastry (pictured) as I saw a worker carry it out fresh from the oven.
Even trying my partner’s picks of pastries, every single item here was divine, fresh, heartwarming, perfectly sweet, with golden flaky crusts. This certainly ranks as the best bakery I tried on this list.
When I was down to a week left in Copenhagen, my friend and I scrambled to try the missing bakeries like Juno (pictured left), famous for its cardamom bun. This was the only bakery I waited an hour in line for. Would I say it was worth it? Maybe, if they had more options available.
But Juno sticks to what they do best and people line up for it, fostering this humming excitement waiting in line as people socialize — standing, sitting at tables, across the street if there’s no room — it feels like a hidden pocket of hygge [hue-gah], the epitome of Danish comfort and coziness.
I really was on my croissant high, trying one in both places, searching for a crust so flaky a knife would scrap across beautifully, a hint of sweetness and saltiness, and the soft multitude of layers inside.
After a long day of souvenir shopping my friend and I sat at Original Coffee, located in the heart of the Strøget shopping district. It’s located on the top floor of Illum, a department store, and serves as an excellent place to look at the city and reflect on the city.
We thought back on everything we got to experience and do, what we learned, whether would we even come back to Copenhagen, and when? What about a different place to study abroad? It certainly was a wistful atmosphere as we enjoyed our last few days being abroad.
My last ‘Danish’ meal before I headed to the airport to fly home, Joe and the Juice is the only place on this list that has a location back in the US. Their pricey smoothies and juices, along with the default Danish pastries, are available on every other corner of Copenhagen. They’re delicious and healthy. It’s no surprise that they’re one of the top food chains in Denmark.
Yet, it had me feeling nostalgic. Before coming to Copenhagen, I had heard and seen this chain but passed it off as a pricey, overly healthy spot that wasn’t worth going to.
However, coming to Copenhagen shook up my perspective on things, and now I was willing to try the very same spot in its original country. Studying abroad pushed me to try foods, and seek out places I would never go to back home. In Orlando, I’m so used to going to the same few spots, complaining about nothing new to do, and sending myself in the loop of my weekly routines.
But when I was in this brand new city, I was wide-eyed, ready to explore, and curious about each corner, hidden gem shawarma spot, an interesting castle, or nature an hour’s ride away.
I just hope to carry this newfound excitement in exploration as I explore my city and reminisce about my summer studying abroad in Copenhagen.

The unique mix of one-man play and opera was in town. The always charismatic John Malkovich came with disturbing confessions, the sopranos Chen Reiss and Susanne Langbein sang beautiful opera arias, and the Vienna Philharmonic played Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Vivaldi to make sure to deliver an unforgettable experience.
The Story
The story is about Jack Unterweger, the serial killer, the writer; the unloved child.
He murdered prostitutes and was sentenced to life in prison. In prison, he started to write poems, plays, and short stories and eventually earned literary respect. Two Nobel laureates in literature (Günter Grass and Elfriede Jelinek) were campaigning for Unterweger’s release because they believed that he was the proof that even the most repulsive people can be converted through art. His biography called Purgatory became a bestseller. Convinced that he was a changed man, he got released on parole. While he was invited to talk shows and other events, he still strangled and murdered prostitutes in Vienna, Graz, Prague, and Los Angeles. The FBI caught him after two years, and after being sentenced again he killed himself in his cell.
This play is meant to be his second biography.

(a to-do list at the bottom)
A city that mostly moves to the rhythm of cycles. With 350km of bicycle tracks, it’s a city where legs and bicycles are synonymous. Silences and blank expressions can be easily mistaken for snobbery, while in fact being softness, simplicity, and kindness of the locals. The cinnamon swirls are sweet and the coffee is strong, old guys play chess in Wednesday evening clubs and old ladies bike by faster than both of us.
I was educated on what makes a city truly ‘emotionally intelligent’ by the architects of a smart city, and something they said that has become my rule to observe was that — a city is not defined by the buildings it has or makes, its energy is defined by the spaces “between” those buildings. Copenhagen is a city where urban development has been based on and around its nature and green cover- that’s really the true beauty of this place. They make it easy to carry luggage without using cars, to walk, bike to work or run back home through lakes and gardens without worrying about traffic or breaking rules. It is truly a sustainably intelligent city.
Areas in Copenhagen are spread out wide, and very self-sustained in terms of food, coffee, parks and culture. Someone living in Frederiksberg doesn’t need to come into Indre-by and someone in Christiania has no actual need to go into Vesterbro. While I loved the neighborhood local vibe of Norrebero and Frederiksberg, I did feel like my eventual place of stay around HC Andersons Boulevard. From airbnbs to eco-hotels, the average rate in Copenhagen doesn’t vary too much if you’re a last-minute nomad like me but I highly recommend at least 2 days in the hotel I stayed in (details at the bottom)
Eat & Drink- only my 2023 favorites, in no way exhaustive :)
Stay- my personal favorite is the Manon Les Suites Hotel — an eco hotel with the best of comfort meets conscious in a central location. If you prefer an Airbnb, check the ones around Norrebro and make sure you check step free access.
Getting Around- Rent an e-bike but not from a hotel.
Yoga - I’ll always check out yoga studios in every city as a personal rule and my favorite one here was ‘Rive Gauche’. The weekly pass makes it easier on the pocket than a one time pay.
Places to Run/Walk- The Lakes, Rosenborg Gardens, Frederiksberg Garden

Grundtvigs Church was erected in commemoration of the great Danish priest, poet, and reformer N.F.S. Grundtvig (1783–1882). This monumental church is referred to in modern terms as a gothic cathedral. Master builder and architect Peder Vilhelm Jensen Klint (1853–1930) died before the church was finished. The task was entrusted to his son architect and designer Kaare Klint (1888–1954), who completed the building of the church in 1940. Kaare Klint has also designed the chairs for the Grundtvigs Church — a chair made of beech wood with wickerwork seat — a Danish furniture design classic. Despite its massive size, the church seems to exude an atmosphere of calm contentment. Perhaps it is the appeal of the regular yellow brickwork forming the sole decoration of the church.

Conceived as an iconic building, which create awareness of cancer without stigmatizing the patients. Designed as a number of small houses combined into one, the center provides the space needed for a modern health facility, without losing the comforting scale of the individual. The houses are connected by raised roof shaped like a Japanese paper art origami, which gives the building a characteristic signature.

The close coexistence between private and communal spaces, often separated only by a thin door, makes this hall of residence quite unique. In fact, the dialogue between individuality and communality forms the very basis for the architecture and layout of Tietgenkollegiet.
Tietgenkollegiet was the result of an architecture competition organised by the Nordea Denmark Foundation with the intention of building a visionary version of the hall of residence of tomorrow. Lundgaard and Tranberg’s round building won the competition. On both the architectural and metaphorical fronts, it is all about inclusion, community and equality.
Rued Langgaards Vej 10–18, Ørestad North
Built for The Medical Association housing scheme and initially were known as Lægeforeningens Boliger. These well-built but relatively inexpensive houses for poor families were some of the first social housing in Copenhagen and were built on the initiative of doctor Emil Hornemann as an immediate and practical response to a cholera epidemic in Copenhagen in 1853.

Cirkelbroen
Cirkelbroen celebrates pedestrians. It reflects the daily life and intimacy that you find around the canal in the Christianshavn neighbourhood, its houseboats and sailing boats, the unique life on the ramparts. Copenhagen’s harbour was once a centre of maritime activity, and Cirkelbroen is a testimony to that history. While working on the bridge, I remembered the fishing boats I saw as a child in Iceland. In the harbour, the boats were often moored right next to each other, and it sometimes seemed that you could even cross the harbour just by walking from boat to boat.
Christianshavns Kanal, København K
The Kalvebod Waves
When addressing this infamously gloomy and desolated side of the harbor, the architects put their focus on two major design aspects: to create urban continuity and to locate the new structure on the sunny spots in the water.
Facing Southeast, the quay has fantastic sun conditions until the early afternoon, but to attract the public after working hours the architects needed to study the course of the shadows casted by the huge buildings along the promenade. The two new main piers are located in the shadow-free zones and programmed as active islands on the water. The project then re-connects those islands to the urban network and to makes them blend naturally into the city’s infrastructure. Two bridges link the tip of the main piers back to the old quay, creating two inner water-basins for watersport activities.
Superkilen
Superkilen is a park that supports diversity. It is a world exhibition of furniture and everyday objects from all over the world, including benches, lampposts, trash cans and plants — requisites that every contemporary park should include and that the future visitors of the park have helped to select. Superkilen reattributes motifs from garden history. In the garden, the translocation of an ideal, the reproduction of another place, such as a far off landscape, is a common theme through time. As the Chinese reference the mountain ranges with the miniature rocks, the Japanese the ocean with their rippled gravel, or how the Greek ruins are showcased as replicas in the English gardens. Superkilen is a contemporary, urban version of a universal garden.
Radio House
Politikens Boghal
With two floors filled with books written in Danish and English, Politikens Boghal is fairly-often considered one of the top choices for book lovers in Copenhagen. The warm bookstore associated with Politiken, one of the largest newspapers in the country, has been welcoming locals and foreigners since 1915. On its selves, visitors can find old and new releases of everything from fiction and poetry to nature and hobby books. Moreover, special events such as concerts, speeches, and presentations take place regularly throughout the year attracting the city’s intellectual crowd.

Cinnober Bookstore
Cinnober has been standing in the heart of the city center for approximately 10 years. Its founders, Ulla Welinder and Morten Voigt, have a great passion for graphic design and illustration. Therefore, a big part of their book selection consists of magazines and books that showcase the best of design, architecture, and art. Make sure to stop by while exploring the area around the Round Tower and rummage through the bookstore’s collection of local artists’ prints and paper products. Visitors might even find a special souvenir to take back home.
Cinnober Bookstore, Landemærket 9, Copenhagen
Palermo Hollywood
The colourful tropical storm that is Palermo Hollywood is the brightest workspace and concept store in all of Nørrebro. Its a modern mash-up, where art and pop culture, sensuality and seriousness, fun and quality — and especially GOLD & GLITTER — go hand in hand. The shop stocks contemporary english books from modern feminism to colouring books, stylish stationary and selected fashion accessories. Pop on down and feel the vibes the girls are bound to make you smile.

My brother, who’s a volunteer, greeted me in pink sunglasses, with a big smile, and an “I haven’t slept yet”. It’s Saturday, 9.30 at Ungdomsøen. In the short distance, I heard an intense bass blasting into the greyscale sky.
We dropped my bag at the camping area. Spending time at major festivals throughout the summer made me notice how clean it was. Despite me arriving four days into the festival, no trash was lingering around, no broken pavilions, no lonely crying.
As I got a tour around the island, I started to understand why there seemed to be an invisible cloud of respect and love. No brands were screaming their logos into my face, no careless investors were occupied with my amount of money. When you build with a pure heart, you attract pure hearts and pure behaviour.
It’s 11 in the morning. At Astral we sat down for a moment. Platforms vibrating with the music were occupied by sleeping cuddles, stretching bodies and tired dancers. The ambience sound playing was in my head the sound of the universe. The projections on the walls allowed my imagination to be imagination, as I closed my eyes and landed on planet Kune.
Close to noon, I understood that time is irrelevant. 15 people were dancing to an after-hour groove at Space. The atmosphere was uplifted, yet exhausted. A magical mix. At Vessel, the sound was fast, edged and deep. Several people came to say hi, saying that they haven’t seen me all week. As I explained that I just arrived, I was greeted with hugs, smiles and “please enjoy”.
I sent my brother to sleep, agreeing to meet again at night. At the harbour, I asked about the food, as I started to feel hungry for lunch. There’s no third-party involved, all food was thought and created at and by the festival.
People arrived at the same destination for a bite. Some before finally going to bed, some for a wake-up meal. They all smiled at me.
I spent the daytime napping, walking around, talking to people. In Copenhagen, I am so used to introducing myself with my job, my place of living. My commercialised existence. Here, no one cared about my fancy title, yearly income or place of birth. I met Daniel from Romania, Ash from Australia, Olivia and Lukas from Denmark, Toni from Hungary, Anne from France. English was default, as the world united on a small island in the middle of Øresund.
As the night sat, a few hours of sleep had done wonders to the face of my dear brother. He and his girlfriend gave me a tour around the many tunnels before we grabbed dinner in the kitchen. Tomato soup and a Moroccan stew warmed me up as my body was thankful for a fresh and homemade meal made with love and appreciation for its ingredients.
A beer and a drink later, I found myself in front of the speakers at Space. The darker it got, the more magical it all seemed. The stage was sculptured in wood as visuals reflected, played and enhanced the artwork. I couldn’t stop looking, moving, smiling.
I have spent many years feeling awkward, feeling wrong, feeling like the one on the outside. As if I was born on the wrong side of the glass, peeking in on the many people moving their hips, choking alcohol and aggressive consumption culture. I spent the summer missing Copenhagen 10 years ago. Back when Saxons, KB18, Christiania, Ungdomshuset and pirate parties were dominating the underground with heavy drum N bass, dubstep, techno, jungle and everything between and outside. But there, in front of the Space speakers, I finally felt like I did 10 years ago, I felt like I was on the right side of the glass.
At Vessel, I arrived at a deep and evil sound. The screens reflected my inner stage, as I let go. Of whatever was on the mainland, whatever was in the world, whatever was on my worried mind. I no longer cared for time, schedules, work or hate. All I cared about was dancing with people who like me, gave up modern slavery for a moment, only to be slaves of the bass. And damn, that bass deserved my soul.
The night was a pendulum between Space, Vessel, Amphi, Astral and water views. I got lost several times, but it didn’t feel like getting lost. I noticed how the clean behaviour continued into the dark. Trash was being sorted, pocket ashtrays used, water drank. Once in a while, someone in a red Kune-shirt asked me if I was feeling all right, they were the safer space guards. The funny thing is, that a small island with young people and 24 hours music sounds like a recipe for chaos and uncontrolled madness — but never have I visited a festival where I felt safer. People knew what they were doing, and did it with respect. For each other, for Kune and for themselves.
As the sun peaked above the horizon, I started to feel my sore feet at Vessel. We sat down, a random group of people. We shared a moment. Thoughts and ideas were aired, and I understood, that this is the place where the ‘angry young people’ smile. Not because they party, but because they feel free to let dreams touch reality. I came down, feeling like I landed on a soft pillow of utopian hope.
Thank you, Kune. Your revolution is heartfelt, honest and kind. I’ll carry it with me until I’ll see you again next year.

By Kai Chen
I studied abroad in Copenhagen last semester through DIS Copenhagen. Copenhagen is gorgeous! The colorful buildings, the cozy cafes, and the endless green spaces all make for the perfect European vibe. As soon as I got off the plane, I knew I was in for an incredible adventure.
As someone who is passionate about foreign languages, I was stoked to dive headfirst into Danish culture and start learning the language. The Danes are all about hygge (coziness), and the language has fun words and phrases you won’t find anywhere else. Plus, the locals were super patient with my attempts to speak Danish and were always down to teach me new words, as is the case with pretty much everywhere else I’ve been to in Europe.
Taking economics classes in Copenhagen has been a unique and enriching experience. One key difference between these courses and those at Duke University is the practical approach to learning in Danish economics classes. Through field trips to France and Belgium, I saw firsthand how economic principles are applied in real-world contexts. Traveling to those countries as part of one of my economics classes gave me invaluable insights into different economic systems and policies and how they impact societies. This hands-on approach to learning economics allowed me to directly apply the knowledge I gained in class and see its real-world implications, a departure from my classes at Duke that did not typically involve field trips. Another notable distinction was the informal relationship with professors in Denmark, as I could address them by their first names, creating a more relaxed and approachable learning environment. This unique blend of practicality and informality in my economics class in Copenhagen has broadened my perspective on the subject and enriched my overall learning experience.
But the best part? Getting to travel all over Europe! Copenhagen is such a perfect home base for exploring other countries. I hopped on trains and planes to visit cities like Hamburg, Amsterdam, and Paris. It was amazing to see each culture’s differences through their architectures, and I love to explore those cultures through their nature, and oftentimes, museums as well.
Back in Denmark, I loved exploring all the cool neighborhoods of Copenhagen. From the hipster vibes of Nørrebro to the quaint streets of Christianshavn, there was always something new to see. And the food? Don’t even get me started. Danish pastries, smørrebrød, and hot dogs (yes, hot dogs) were some of my favorites.
And let’s not forget about the people! I made some of the coolest friends during my study abroad program from all over the world. We bonded over our love of travel, languages, and hygge, and we still keep in touch today.
Overall, my study abroad experience in Copenhagen was one for the books. I got to immerse myself in a new language and culture, travel Europe, and make lifelong friends. If you’re into languages and travel like me, I can’t recommend studying abroad enough!

This project is an international and interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers, artists, and educators for a meaningful, fair, and forward-looking participation of youth in sustainable spatial planning processes.

In the beginning of March 2023 we met in Copenhagen for a 3-day WP4 workshop focused on the ongoing development of our PwY decision support tool (DST) that is a deliverable of the Working Package 4. During these days, members of the Swedish team from Södertörn University met with colleagues from Copenhagen University for hands-on activities meant to advance our project on selected aspects of the decision support tool.
Image: collective activity for identifying relevant stakeholder and methods.
During these three days, we revised findings from WP2 and WP3. Work package 2 focuses on the study of current challenges and opportunities planners and other professional face in Sweden, Netherlands and Denmark in relation to the involvement of youth in spatial planning. Work package 3 focuses on testing, exploring and piloting with different participatory methods and it seeks to understand if and how these allow youth to participate in meaningful ways. In this sense, WP4 and its deliverable, the decision support tool, brings all that research insight together in an integrated way.
Image: Sofia Lundmark facilitating an activity for the workshop.
The workshop was facilitated by our team collaborator Sofia Lundmark, Senior Lecturer at Media Technology Department at Södertörn University. Sofia use methods from design studies to facilitate the sessions and led us over key questions.
Our project team is a combination of collaborators with different scientific backgrounds and experiences who are connected by an interest in interdisciplinary approaches to sustainability and urban planning. This diversity allows us to borrow tools and perspectives from each other’s discipline, stay fresh and be creative. This is particularly important when developing and designing a tool meant for use in different national contexts and by different stakeholders.
But what is the Planning with Youth decision support tool and whom is it meant to support?
Decision support tools are a compilation of information and data organized in a systemic way meant to assist professionals with their day-to-day work. A DST does not give a final answer as such but gives access to needed information and data for the professional to consider and use in decision-making processes on a given matter.
Planning and urban governance is a field with many decisions support tools and systems. But very few are developed in the context of youth and children participatory processes. Our objective is to contribute with a new tool for planners and practitioners to use when needing to prepare and delivery participatory processes that are meaningful for children and young people.
The DST will provide planners and practitioners with key information about methods for involving children and young people in participatory planning. We envision for the PwY tool to become a useful instrument. For the Swedish context, this is particularly relevant considering that from 2021 and following the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child, planners are obliged by law to include children and youth in participatory spatial planning processes. You can read more about the Swedish context and its challenges in this article produced by members of our team.
Furthermore, even in countries that have not enforced the inclusion of youth in urban planning, this remains an ongoing and necessary challenge that aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Ultimately, we hope that by using the DST urban planners will get the support they need to create (with youth) cities that are more democratic, sustainable and accessible and reflect the needs and uses of the entire population.

Copenhagen inspiration from one friend of a friend to another
I recently booked a weekend in Stockholm to visit some friends who’d moved there. To make the most of being in the area, I added a few days somewhere I heard people consistently rave about: Copenhagen.
▶️ Instagram Highlights️️▶ Copenhagen Google Map▶ Visit Copenhagen Official Website
I put up a call for tips on my Instagram right before going and received so many wonderful tips that I felt I should make a guide linking it all together. The result is a combination of the top things recommended, with a bit of Stubborn Travel curation and personal favourites. I hope it can help as a quick planning aid to this delightful city, home to the happiest people on Earth.
A huge thank you to the awesome travellers and locals who contributed, especially Amalie, Courtenay, James, Nina and Caitlin.

Welcome to the United Nations Career Journey Podcast, where we interview colleagues working for the United Nations all around the world. Our conversations explore their fascinating career paths, what career satisfaction means to them, and how they keep learning and developing on the job. My name is Petra, and today, our conversation is with Iina Paarma who works as a Chief of the Talent Development Unit at the UNDP’s Office of Human Resources based in Copenhagen, Denmark. Welcome to the Career Journey Podcast Iina, it’s good to see you. And thank you very much for joining us. It’s a pleasure to have you as our guest speaker on the podcast.
Hi, Petra. Thank you. It’s my pleasure to be here with you today.
Thank you again. And could you introduce yourself to our listeners?
Absolutely. So, my name is Iina Paarma. And as Petra said, I’m the Chief of the Talent Development Unit at UNDP. I’m also a proud mother of two children. And I grew up in Finland and sometime in my early teenage years, I started dreaming of an international career in international development.
Lovely, thank you very much. My first question that I want to ask about your career is how did you begin your career? It can be internships, or maybe first job, so what was the start of your career?
Well, during my studies, I did have a chance to do an internship in my home country’s representation office in Vienna, in Austria. And I also studied one term in Geneva, as an exchange student during my master’s studies. And another one actually in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. But after completing my master’s degrees, I actually landed a job in the private sector, and then actually another job in the private sector. But somewhere during those years, I did realize that the sort of the dream to be part of the UN, or the international community, had actually never really disappeared. And so, I started applying for jobs in different international organizations. This was already around the time when I was approaching 30. It took it took almost three years, but then late 2012, I got my first assignment with UNOPS, actually here in Copenhagen, and I spent a number of years in that agency. And then, in 2017, I joined UNDP, in New York City after having applied for a position that I found on UNDP Jobs site.
Thank you for this introduction, Iina. And how was the transition into getting into UNDP, after spending time in the private sector and also in another UN organization? And also, which specific tools have been useful for you for this transition, and during this transition?
Yeah, I mean, when I joined the UN, then in 2012, early 2013, that’s when I was coming from the private sector, and I joined UNOPS in Copenhagen. So that transition wasn’t actually that, you know, that big one. It was really a dream to come true. But in terms of specific tools that have been useful, I think, first of all, I’ve tried to do my job as well as I only can. And secondly, you know, I have hopped on every opportunity that was given to me. And early on in the UN, in UNOPS, I also had fantastic bosses who believed in me and took me to meetings, and, you know, let me job shadow them. And that has been incredibly powerful, and I am really, forever grateful for this. And it was a pivotal steppingstone for me to be able to be sort of, on-the-job mentored by my people manager early on in my UN days. Then in terms of tools in general, I mean, I learned incredibly much from interactions with others. So, in that sense, the transition to the UN wasn’t a difficult one, it was a fascinating one.
That’s very good to hear. And I think these points are can be very useful for someone who is trying to look for maybe inspiration or ways to do that step to get into the UN system, but also just career tips in general. So, thank you so much for, for sharing those. So, your role as the Chief of the Talent Development Unit, could you explain a little bit to our listeners what is it about, what are some of the tasks that are a part of your daily job?
Yeah. So, you know, UNDP, we’re a big organization, we are close to 20,000 people in 170 countries. So, this role is really to lead the Talent Development Unit that focuses on leadership development, people manager development, career experiences, capability development. So, we have the three sort of main components in the unit. And overall, we are catering for the talent needs of the whole organization. We are really looking at talent development and learning as something that happens in the flow of work. It’s, it’s not a one-off sort of exercise, it’s sort of part of our DNA as an organization. We believe that creating a learning organization is something that is embedded in every aspect of the organization. And UNDP puts a lot of effort in talent development, we see that as a catalyst for organizational performance, for sure. But also, people’s careers, their career development, and their professional development.
This is great, and working with learning and talents, that must be something very rewarding for you as well, to help the people to develop themselves. But I would like to ask you my next question, and that is, what do you like the most about your role? What aspects of your job of your current job bring you career satisfaction?
I think for me, I am a people person. So definitely teamwork and learning from others. And the fact that I do feel very privileged to have the opportunity to work with people from all over the world, it is extremely rewarding to constantly, you know, develop oneself as one hears about other people’s perspectives based on their backgrounds, you know, be it educational, or cultural, or other backgrounds. The UN is also a big part of my identity. So, so serving this greater purpose of the UN is something that brings me enormous satisfaction. So then when I think about the current role, our team is not in the frontlines of international development. But what brings us satisfaction is the fact that we can develop the ones who are closer to our beneficiaries. And we can see that directly translated into better results on the ground.
That sounds great. And I think this is something that is a big motivating factor for many people working at the UN. And you also mentioned that it was your dream, when you were younger, that, you know, you really wanted to work for the UN. So, it’s actually great that it’s now a part of your daily motivation and career satisfaction. On the other hand, what are some of the more challenging, perhaps, aspects of your job? Or something that you need to continuously work with? Could you just share some of those with our listeners?
Yeah, you know, I think in terms of challenges, this is a global organization that’s present in 170 countries like I mentioned, and this means that someone is always awake, and the work never stops. So, I would say, you know, UN colleagues in general are very committed, you know, hardworking people. So, it’s very easy to sort of get into that sort of ‘someone is always awake’ mode. So, I would say that what I’m trying to learn is to manage myself in such a way that I allow enough time to rest and recharge, so as to be the best version of myself in the workplace.
That’s very good to highlight because I think this topic is very important. And to highlight the need for, you know, strengthening your resilience and well-being is something very important. So, thank you for bringing that to the discussion. And that actually kind of leads to my next question. Sometimes our mental health can be challenged by big changes, challenging moments, and it can take a toll on how we feel about our careers. So my next question is, could you share a time in your career where you had some big changes in responsibilities of your role, and how did you approach it and what did you learn from it?
Yeah, I think, I think maybe the sort of critical juncture for me was when I joined UNDP, in 2017, and moved to New York, the new role was quite different from my previous role and UNDP, as an organization also worked in a very different way than my previous organization. So I think I learned to appreciate that it takes some time to grasp the new context and asking the right questions and understanding that, you know, one should not assume that what worked well in your previous role and organization is, is sort of directly applicable in the in the new content, or in the new context. I think the learnings maybe happened, sort of, in some kind of internal after-action review and reflection, also now in hindsight, realizing that UN, especially when it comes to relocations, those are not only your decisions, if you have family members who are joining you, and so, so certainly reflecting afterwards, the appreciation of the willingness of my family to join me and also looking back at not only those years, but also throughout my career in the UN, as someone who was raising children as well, I am having such gratitude and sort of humility. And understanding that those people around me, you know, grandparents and relatives and their immediate family members have certainly been enablers for me, and for that I am, I am very grateful.
That’s lovely, thank you so much for sharing that. And, yeah, I can totally imagine that these changes of relocating to a different country, different continent, changing your are a big milestone in everyone’s lifetime. And so sharing those learning outcomes might be very useful and good to hear, and I’m sure a lot of our listeners can relate to it as well. Talking about living abroad and having different international experiences, experiences from different career paths and career experiences, what are some of the best tips you have gathered throughout your career so far, when it comes to either creating a career that you like, creating a satisfying career, or just navigating a career in general?
Well, I think it’s important to follow your heart and your passion, when you enjoy what you do, it makes, it makes it all so much easier. And it shows also in the results you deliver, you know, when I grew up, the mentality was a little bit like, you know, job is a job, and then life happens outside of the job, and you should sort of play the same card, you know, study hard and get a job that you can have until you retire. And, you know, we all know, especially the young generations, that those days are over. So, I think maybe, you know, understanding that these type of career moves and career aspirations, they always come with a certain risk. You can’t have it all, you know, you should always in mind, you follow your passion, and understand that that’s not necessarily always the most sort of stable path. But if that’s what you truly want, you should go for it. And then I think in general, I mean, when it comes to sort of career tips, I’m not sure if I’m the best one to share any of those. Once someone much wiser than me told me that, you know, essentially, there are two ways to plan your career, either you go with the flow, or you have clear goals of the type of roles and profiles you’re aspiring for, and then, you know, you make a roadmap and follow that path. Honestly, I have personally been one of the sorts of go with the flow type of profiles. And, you know, that has worked for me. I have jumped on the opportunities that had been in front of me, and sometimes it’s been daunting, but I would say, you know, go for it. All jobs are extremely valuable. You learn things in whatever role you have, for however short time you would have that, you know, it teaches you about the role itself, but it also allows you to meet different people who might have different tips.
These are really great tips and advice and I’m sure the listeners will find it very helpful because I think it’s always good to be reminded of, you know, following the passion and having that as the guiding… guiding light of when you’re trying to navigate through the career so, so thank you very much for that. I’d like to ask you, where would you like to be career-wise in the next coming years? Or do you have any maybe aspirations as well? I know you just shared with us that you prefer to, you know, maybe go with the flow. But is there anything you’d like to achieve in the next coming years in terms of your career?
Oh, thanks for the question. You know, I love my current role. I‘ve been in this role for some 18 months. And I feel that I still have quite a lot to give in this current position. And then future will show what’s the what’s next in in store for me.
Well thank you very much, and I wish you all the best! I really enjoyed our conversation. And I found it very interesting and insightful. And yeah, I hope you had a good time as well.
Absolutely. My pleasure Petra, and keep up with the great job, great work that you’re doing here with the podcast.
Thank you very much! And thank you to all our listeners. We hope you enjoyed this episode and that our conversations will inspire you to keep learning and advancing in your careers. If you liked the episode, please share it with your friends and colleagues, and make sure to tune in for the next one.

Just about a year ago I moved into this incredibly small and beautiful country called Denmark all the way from India to pursue my PhD. I had dreamt about it for a long time and it was so surreal when I actually landed in Copenhagen. Noone back home understood why I chose this strange far away cold land when I could have been applying to top universities in the US; hustling away in pursuit of an empire I had no desire to build in the first place. To me, a safe, happy and a peaceful place would make moving my entire life to another country absolutely worth it. Copenhagen consistently ranked among the top three livable cities in the world while Denmark is popularly known for being one of the happiest countries across the entire world. I knew that as an expat the rules would be different; I wouldn’t share the same benefits that the Danes enjoy and perhaps, my opinions about the happiness index would be different from how the Danes perceive it. That is not say that the index is wrong because it is indeed the opinions of the Danish citizens that actually matter.
My priorities in life were always different. I didn’t care about owning a car and a house to display how successful I was in my social circle. To me, peace of mind, having just enough of what you need and want, and respect were above materialistic desires. That is not to say that money didn’t matter to me. I want to be wealthy in terms of experiences, good health, healthy relationships and money is just a part of wealth. As an overly anxious, introverted and sensitive person, I learnt from a very young age what my triggers were and how to cope with them and so I knew that working in an annoyingly bureaucratic corporate structure and culture was not for me. While I have financially successful friends I really respect and admire, I have no desire to talk the same language as them. I started working young and ensured that I would never have to borrow money from my parents anymore whether it was for my education or materialistic pursuits. If I couldn’t afford it, I wouldn’t buy it. I chose academia simply because at the time it gave me the freedom to think, read, and write the way I wanted and I was given due credit for it. I wanted to move away right after my Masters but my father was clear that unless I had a scholarship, it wouldn’t be worth it. And, that’s when it all began! A six year long journey post my Masters making peanuts but doing what I loved, saving just enough to finally take the leap. I had my eyes on Denmark for many reasons, the most important being safety and gender equality.
One year down and I wouldn’t call it perfect but I know it in my gut that I made the right choice. They ask, what was the biggest culture shock for you when you moved here? I laugh! Because India has given me far more cultural shocks than I expect to experience anywhere else. I have lived in different parts of India and navigated life across language and cultural barriers. We were united by the delicious food and our diversity itself! I am grateful for my journey from a tiny Indian town noone knows of to this beautiful city where I am living the life I always dreamt of. Life in India prepared me for life in a strange country I had absolutely no connection to. The struggles are not unfamiliar— a different language, the lack of a social circle, having to find an affordable living arrangement, getting familiar with the rules and regulations. Things that took me a while getting adjusted to was the right-hand traffic and the fact that there was barely any traffic :D Sure, the weather is rough and the winters are dark and the Danes are reserved (you know the stereotype), but every single day I am in awe of how this tiny little dot on the world map evolved into an architectural beauty, home to some of the largest MNCs and holding an impressive reputation of being politically progressive.
Danmark er virkelig et dejligt land! There was not a single day when a Dane refused to help a “confused” me trying to get used to the city. Often they would greet with a pleasant smile and would appreciate you trying to speak a little bit of broken Danish while making small talk. I deliberately chose to work with a Danish supervisor for two reasons — first I wanted to push myself to work with unfamiliar people (since Indians tend to flock to each other everywhere in the world; I am guilty of this too) and second, I had some serious toxic boss baggage from India that I knew would ease off in the flat heirarchical structure Scandanivian countries are famous for. Wait, I could call my seniors by their first names and they wouldn’t mind? And did you say they don’t call you after work hours (they never call you at all if you are lucky)? Also, you are not obligated to respond to their emails after 5 pm? Wait, did they ask for my opinion? Oh wait, the professors consider their PhD students “colleagues” and not slaves? And…whaaattt!! I am paid a living wage as a PhD student? To me, this was a dream! This is where I felt I could become a well-rounded person whose opinions were equally important and my gender didn’t decide how much I was paid.
I won’t lie I did have my own insecurities (thanks to our colonial past and the ensuing inferiority complex). I was in this land full of white people with beautiful blue/green eyes and blond hair, ones I had only seen on Television up until I moved to Denmark. Soon enough I realised we are bonded by similar desires and experiences that is only natural to the humankind and it is not the color of our skin but our openness to embracing the unknown that really mattered. Sure, I felt unseen many times in a conversation across a table that only white people could connect to (endless discussions over the origins of wine and cheese like we talk about chai and samosas) but this would be followed by a few empathetic people (or those afraid to be perceived as politically incorrect…kidding!) displaying a little bit of curiosity into my culture. I was suddenly representing India in these conversations; not my tiny hometown, not the cities that I lived in but the rich and diverse country that India is. I was educating people who had these preconceived biases against the Indians, some of which were quite ridiculous and rude to be frank (if you don’t eat red meat, you are religious; most of India is polluted, poor and filthy). Some of them had ill-informed opinions about Hinduism and the political situation in the country! On the other hand I was surprised by how India was perceived by Europeans in general. Many considered it to be the land of CEOs, shooting for the galaxies, full of lucrative investment opportunities, ofcourse Bollywood and interestingly home to the good “green stuff” (if you know what I mean ;)). Some applauded me for the bold choice to move to a cold country all the way from India while some struggled to grasp why any South Asian would want to move to this part of the world. I just enjoyed the ride! I am not one to get offended easily. It is only natural to have your prejudices but come to me with an open mind and I will answer all your questions. How you frame your words and the way you speak them tells me a bit about your upbringing and the conscious efforts you put into educating yourself to get rid of your biases often shaped by problematic western constructs. So hey! It has nothing to do with the color of your skin. You can be brown, white, black, straight, gay, queer and whatever you identify as and still be a vile person. In Denmark though, I have mostly met the nicest and most open minded people. They are not intrusive (which unfortunately we Indians could be most of the time), they are polite and respectful of other’s time and space, they call a spade a spade and they really do have a wonderful life outside of work (hygge anyone???). This is the place where I feel my own person, where nobody cares about my age, gender, marital status and whether or not I have kids. I am a far more evolved person than I was when I first moved here and I am doing things I never believed I would be able to do.
So that’s my first Medium post here, a short story of an Indian smalltowner in Denmark. Not sure if I would still call this the happiest place in the world but this sure is the happiest I have ever been :)

I remember well the last days before I left my Vilnius. Days, where I have been walking in the city, going to the places that I have always wanted to, but did not have time for it, spending time with my family and meeting with good old friends. Those days were great. However, the time flies fast. And even though I was quite excited to start a new life in a foreign country, I was also a bit worried. Who will be my new friends? When will Ifind a job? Will I like the studies? How will Copenhagen greet me? After a year of living here, I have found some answers.
Copenhagen greeted me with big white clouds and the hustle in the airport. The hustle of the people greeting their fellow travelers and the hustle of the people running for their planes. An airport is a place where people come and go. And I was one of the many arrived to Copenhagen. I remember that I was not at all impressed by Copenhagen in the first days. So many buildings so similar to each other, so few green spaces compressed between them and cyclists with their angry faces.
It is now, a year after living in Copenhagen, I understand that Copenhagen has so much to offer. Small details matter in this city and it feels like the community is trying to make it with a personal touch. Buildings in different neighborhoods do not look alike and there are very nice green spaces within the city. Only my perception of cyclists did not change.
Nevertheless, I came here to study Organizational Innovations and Entrepreneurship (OIE) — a masters program organized by Copenhagen Business School (CBS). The program offered quite an interesting path of studying, combining theoretical knowledge and practical classes with the most diverse class that I’ve been a part of in my life.
The beginning of the studies was quite interesting. We’ve had an introduction week, organized by previous OIE students, where we had a chance to visit some of the most prominent startup hubs and companies in Copenhagen, mingle together and get to know what awaits us in the future.
And the future was…
Studies at OIE program comprise of two different sets of subjects divided into 4 quarters throughout the first year. One subject will be practical (lectures which are happening in Studio) and the other one — theoretical. On the second year of education students are allowed to choose between exchange, electives, summer university or internship. Or it can be a mix of everything (up to 30 ECTS credits). After that — only master thesis and graduation, where everybody is happy :)
But let’s get back to the first year with compulsory subjects. As it was mentioned before there were 4 quarters with different focuses:
Furthermore, we have also had an elective course — study trip to Silicon Valley, where we have met 28 different companies throughout 2 weeks. You can read more about it in my previous stories on Medium (beginning, part 1, part 2).
As the courses implied, we have been working hard on different business ideas every quarter. I remember it like yesterday:
Q1. Developing an app for finding people/friends with similar interests
Q2. Developing a lip balm for winter sports enthuziasts
Q3. Developing a YouTube channel about local undiscovered places
Q4. Researching the “precariat” & changing spaces (in our case — CPH Village and containers made livable).
Plus we’ve had some of the theoretical classes related to the classical understanding of entrepreneurship, strategic management of innovations, the art of innovation (like design-driven innovation) and some other interesting activities combined together.
Last, but not least, CBS really tries hard to develop in us the entrepreneurial spirit, creating opportunities for the students to go further and make the ideas real. As part of our program, we have been also introduced to Copenhagen School of Entrepreneurship, whereas we, if there is any business idea, could try to get in and use the co-working spaces, advisors and other useful programs for free throughout the different stages of development.
Overall, the OIE program allows to develop the skills and abilities, necessary for becoming an entrepreneur or working with innovations within different fields. Plus, if you have a business idea — you can go for it. Nevertheless, the living costs in Copenhagen are not cheap and a big part of a Danish student life will be described in the next chapter.
Most of the students in Denmark are combining studies with student jobs. That’s a fact. Even though they are generously paid by the government scheme called SU, they are still working as part-time employees in different companies, starting from cafes and bars and ending with study-related jobs.
As my finances did not allow me to live here for two years without having an actual job, I started to look for the new opportunities in Copenhagen. Even though it took me some time (including exams and other activities) to find an actual first job (to be precise — 4 months), I had a great experience learning how the Danish job market operates.
Throughout the 4-month period I had 6 job interviews with different companies, where I had a chance to present myself and also get to know the other side of the table. In the end, I have landed a job at a local food chain, where I have been working as Operations Assistant, learning to deal with numbers, revenues, Excel and developing programs. Nevertheless, during the summer situation has changed and I have to find a new job, which I would like to learn from most, combining my previous experience with my skills and knowledge.
One lesson that I have learned throughout the year — try to be more unique in every aspect that goes throughout the job search adventure. And, the most important, show the companies what you can bring to the advertised position and show that you are a valuable person worth the salary that you will get while working there.
Pro tip: students from EU — if you have a part-time job, working min. 10–12 hours/week — apply for a student scholarship (SU) to be equal with Danish students. More info: www.su.dk
What is a student life without fun? The answer is easy — it is not a student life. People, with whom you are studying, can bring a lot of joy, happiness and adventures throughout the years that you will be studying together and, most probably, they will become the friends for life.
I had the honor to meet with people from different countries and cultures, with whom I had a lot of fun and great things done together. Copenhagen is a great city, where if you want to do something — you will find it. It offers a wide variety of events, places, bars, cafes, parks where you can hang out with your friends, meet even more people and learn about Danish traditions. And, the most important thing, not to be lonely, because sometimes that feeling of being such can come.
Last year I have visited many different places and hometowns of my friends — Bornholm, Aalborg, San Francisco, Asturias. I have also participated in many local traditional events and learned more about Danish culture and who are Danes. Funny enough, but while being in Denmark, I have learned a lot about Mexican culture :) I had a lovely Christmas-New Year’s Eve period, seeing the local traditions and participating in them, seeing how Danes can be welcoming and how cozy are their homes.
Pro tip: check out the Survival Guide in Denmark, it is a great guide to find almost everything you need before your arrival or during your stay.
The first year in Denmark was an amazing experience. The weather was great (4 months of sun in a row), the people are awesome, the studies and the job gave me lots of new skills and knowledge.
I believe that the next year will be even better, with more interesting discoveries, experiences and amazing people. Especially now, when everybody will be back in Copenhagen and will be ready to rock’n’roll.

Copenhagen, Denmark (population of 799,033 as of 2020)
Copenhagen aims to be the world’s first carbon-neutral capital city by 2025 (The CPH 2025 Climate Plan, Copenhagen — Urban Development). Politically, the city also intends to demonstrate how it is possible for big cities to combine growth, development, and an enhanced quality of life while reducing carbon emissions at the same time. This goal sets Copenhagen as a frontrunner in the international arena.
Copenhagen designed its Climate Plan Roadmap in three phases and set on the first phase of the net-zero journey in 2013 with the ultimate goal to become carbon neutral by 2025. The plan was developed in line with the emergence of new knowledge and technology, as continued innovation allowed to make carbon reduction strategies possible and at scale. At the same time, the CPH 2025 Climate Plan seeks to enhance the quality of life for Copenhageners using carbon neutrality goals to change behavior and stimulate innovation, job creation and investments.
By 2018, Copenhagen has successfully achieved a reduction of carbon emissions per capita by 57% while the city’s population grew by 22%. This reduction was mostly due to the green conversion of power-generation and district heating systems from coal to biomass and the erection of wind turbines.
Figures 5, 6: Copenhagen carbon emissions actual and projected, 2005–2025
According to Figure 6, while the 2018 progress has been remarkable, it will require significant additional efforts to reach the 2025 targets. This aggressive goal is based on the city’s climate plan’s four pillars: (1) Energy consumption, (2) Energy production, (3) Mobility with reduced emissions, and (4) City Administration initiatives.
Energy consumption. This pillar primarily focuses on achieving energy efficiency for district heating and transitioning from oil to renewable energy systems. City of Copenhagen collaborates with large building owners on efficient management of their properties by monitoring their energy consumption and optimizing building operations.
Energy production. Copenhagen is powered mostly by renewable energy with more than 50% of electricity supplied by wind and solar, and approximately 80% of all electricity coming from renewable energy sources including bioenergy and geothermal energy (“A record year: Wind and solar supplied more than half of Denmark’s electricity in 2020.” State of Green). The city has ambitious efforts to add at least 460MW from wind turbines by 2025.
Mobility covers two groups of transportation: road and maritime. The city plans to convert all its public busses, road and harbor busses, to renewable energy sources and run on electricity, biodiesel, bioethanol, biogas, natural gas-electric hybrids or hydrogen fuel cell busses. The city is looking to expand public transportation and promote the use of bicycles to travel around the city. In addition to achieving a reduction of CO2 emissions, this initiative will have the benefit of significantly less street noise and reduced local air pollution (“Copenhagen aims to become a carbon neutral capital/Sustainable Transit.” Green City Times).
City Administration. This category sets an example for the Administration to lead the way to reduce the city’s energy consumption, green procurement and transition of the city’s vehicles and infrastructure to operate on alternative fuels. This is important in stimulating public-private partnerships, cooperation with other municipalities and other organizations, and engaging the citizens in the green transformation.
Copenhagen is showing an impressive reduction in carbon emissions. Two specific projects the city is proud of are EnergyLab Nordhavn and seawater use for cooling (“This is how Copenhagen plans to go carbon neutral by 2025.” World Economic Forum). EnergyLab Nordhavn is located in Copenhagen’s waterfront city district North Harbor. The EnergyLab was launched in 2015 in close partnership between academia, industry, utilities, and local government to design a full-scale smart city energy lab with innovative solutions in the areas such as intelligent waste handling, low-temperature district heating, clean public transportation, and super cycle highways. This project is looking at the whole energy system as one, integrating heat, electricity, and transport and testing new solutions such as large batteries and EVs to reduce peak load on the grid, intelligent heating of buildings, and a heat pump and storage system to improve flexibility and optimize local district heating network (“Cities 100: Copenhagen’s new Nordhavn neighborhood is a center of innovation for small energy systems.” C40 Knowledge).
Copenhagen also uses seawater from the harbor for its cooling system with the potential to cut emissions by 70% and keep about 80,000 tons of carbon out of the city’s direct atmosphere. In addition to the climate and environmental benefits, it costs less, takes up less space and it makes no noise. It works by pumping seawater of about 6C, using this water for the district water supply and returning water at about 16C back to the harbor (“Seawater keeps Copenhagen buildings cool.” Climate Change Adaptation).
This is a case study for the main article, Urban Path to Net-Zero: Leading Strategies of the Most Energy-Efficient Cities.

This is a short summary of what I saw in the conference, what I liked and didn't like and what I think was most interesting or worth notice considering my personal preferences and needs.
It was my first international conference and also the biggest conference I've attended so far, so please take that into account when reading this.
The conference had a good amount of different topics, I was satisfied with the balance between topics related with soft and hard skills, although, some of the mandatory talks could be frustrating to some people due to the lack of technical points or a practical guides.
Talks presented by partners (sponsors) weren’t simply trying to sell their solution, but were tackling problems or showing general solutions that can benefit you or your company even if you don’t use the partner specific solution. It was great to see the power of Kafka, GraphQL and Erlang/Elixir.
I was happy to be able to catch up on some topics like AI and quantum computing, the talks in general were well presented, not too long or too short and relevant. I felt that some topics should have had less talks considering that talks on similar subject were already present as part of the mandatory talks (AI and machine learning for example). I believed that the topics could had been better distributed (maximum number of talks per topic). On another side I understand that some redundancy is built-in for the different days and for people that might not be able to attend certain talks due do conflicts with parallel sessions. I understand that it’s not an easy to solve problem, and even with these remarks the overall experience was incredibly positive.
On a personal note I really liked the talk from Saša Jurić about Erlang and Elixir, seeing what Erlang and Elixir can do really gave me the extra push needed to dive into it. The talk from Adam Tornhill ""Prioritizing Technical Debt as if Time and Money Matters"" gave me a new perspective and even actionable points (although not easy) to deal with the trade-off between improving existing code and adding new features. Finally I was surprised with the extreme digitization in China presented by Christina Boutrup, it gave great insights which I believe are not on the radar of standard western people.
I currently live in Switzerland and I have to say that the Danes seemed to me to be even more punctual and organized! No real issues with talks being late or running over time, the duration and number of breaks helping to keep your attention on each talk you attend. Registration and overall logistical organization was very good ( quality of the food and amount of options was great).
The area for partners was cool and well structured, good amount of swag and most partners were easy to interact and have a good conversation during the quick breaks between talks.
One point that I really didn’t like was the amount of talks that were not being recorded, I don’t have enough conference experience to know how much this is common practice but feeling forced to attend to certain talks that might, or not, be of interest just for fear of missing out isn’t a great feeling in my opinion.
I didn't know most of the speakers, but was satisfied with the quality of the talks. As celebrities go, it was cool to see Steve Wozniak in person!
Most of the talks contributed more or less in the same way and a lot of them helped me into catching up with the current state of the industry (at least in a high-level view).
I'm less scared about AI and I think the field still has to evolve a lot before an AI tries to destroy humanity, still I would bet that many people will have their jobs taken by AI based solutions, but it's difficult to say how fast this will happen even for specialists in the field.
China is really a place to pay attention to, we can learn from them, as they seem to be able to foster innovation despite being very restrictive on their market and ideas.
Machine learning is finding more efficient and precise methods to do things in ways that humans can't understand, so it’s something I think everyone should pay more attention to as the results so far are already impressive (and seem to be less dangerous than what we normally associate with AI apocalypse, although strongly related).
Elixir is really awesome and I need to start experimenting and learning asap.
There are different ways to handle the trade-off between adding new functionality and improving existing code, I have much to learn!
The new perspective from Adam Tornhill is something that I believe will have an immediate positive impact on my daily work as in any fast paced and competitive business it’s part of the day to day job to weight the benefits of improving existing code versus the many new features that business requires in the short and long term. This talk gave me a different perspective on how to look at the problem and directions on what needs to be considered on a more technical and practical stand for me to be able to keep the best balance between business value added and the long term evolution of our platforms, while also keeping our 24/5 high frequency trading system competitive.
As a possible mid/long term contribution I think I would like to partner with our big data and BI teams and see what I can do using machine learning to improve the overall business. I now, more than before, believe that machine learning can really help businesses to take big leaps forward in ways that we humans simply can’t predict.
I wish I have the time and opportunity to put some Elixir in action at Swissquote as I believe that the very nature of the business can benefit immensely from the platform features (Erlang/Elixir) that support high availability, fast recovery and the benefits of the actor based model (processes in Elixir). Perfect for my needs in the Forex business line!
Thank you for you attention.

GUEST ENTRY: Pleo’s Jeppe Rindom gives his opinion on Copenhagen’s current ability to attract the best of the best.
Hi! My name is Jeppe Rindom and I am CEO and co-founder of Pleo, a fintech startup that automates expense reporting.
In 2015, my former colleague from Tradeshift, Niccolo, and I founded Pleo in Copenhagen. We had and still have big and global ambitions but with the limited access to digital talent in Denmark, we wondered, right from the beginning, if we would ever be able to scale a global company without moving our base.
It is evident that digital graduates are produced at a much slower pace than what our fellow startups (and desperate ‘we-fear-disruption’ corporates) are screaming for. But hey, our country has pretty architecture, bikes, great food, and the happiest people in the world. So, as bold entrepreneurs we figured; ‘let’s not bring Pleo to the talent — Let’s bring the talent to Pleo!’
Fast forward 30 months, our organisation now counts +40 employees and more than half are non-Danes. What a great success one might conclude, but actually I would argue the opposite, because only in one single case did we, as a company, succeed in convincing an international candidate to relocate to Denmark. And in this specific case, the relocation was caused by a strong friendship to an existing employee.
We consider Pleo a fairly attractive workplace. We’ve been recognized with international prizes and have attracted substantial investments from venture capital firms. I believed so much in our ability to attract international talent that I naively wrote a blog post with the title ‘Let’s conquer the World, not each other!’, which was a shout to the Danish digital ecosystem to hire internationally instead of stealing talent locally. Yet, we’ve never been able do so. But Why?
The Danish ‘package’ is not competitive
As much as I am proud of the Danish welfare system as well as the Capital of Copenhagen, I have come to the conclusion that the Danish ‘package’ sounds much more compelling than it is.
A classic Danish startup package looks somewhat like this:
1) a non-competitive salary, which is really no news if you want to work in startups.
2) high taxation due to our welfare system. Here you might say ‘you get what you pay for’, but that’s actually not true. Most candidates we’ve tried to relocate have a 3 to 7 year perspective for staying in Denmark. They are at a stage in their lives, where access to free education, free healthcare etc. is of very little value.
3) a high cost of living. Being a foreigner without a place to stay in Copenhagen is really tough. Even if you’re willing to settle for just a room in a shared apartment, you will likely end up paying +€1K a month.
On point 1 and 3, Copenhagen is not much different from cities like London, Paris and Stockholm but on taxation, our offering is much worse. And that’s not only a shame, it’s a deal breaker.
So, how have we made it to first base?
I’ve always had mixed feelings when it comes to our ‘open’ (read: free for EU citizens) education system. Today, I praise myself lucky. It saved my a.. Big Time. When we were 1.5 year into the journey, we, as everybody else, couldn’t recruit Danish digital talent, and when our team turned 15 employees, I was still the only Dane. Looking around me, I realised that everyone else were here because of our good and open education system. Luckily for us, many had decided to stay after graduation and in hindsight, I should have done more to build relationships to schools and universities and would encourage any startup to do so.
Second, we right from the beginning had an international company culture. My co-founder is Italian so the Danish way was really never an option. It was of course an obvious thing for us, as our ambitions goes far beyond Danish borders, but our strong international company culture has also become a strong selling point when we hire. Today, Pleo has 14 different nationalities and we still have strong focus on maintaining a welcoming, family-like company culture.
Third, we have had a lot of media attention both inside and outside of Denmark. Today, it mostly relates to our business traction, but in the beginning we did serious efforts to create some buzz, both in terms of being present at conferences, startup events and constantly trying to get media coverage. That helped us tremendously — also in our recruiting.
Fourth, our foreign employees have been great at enabling their networks. Because of that, we today have a handful of engineers working remotely. And it has worked surprisingly well, not something I expected initially and that I believe is strong correlated to the fact that all remote workers were familiar with other Pleo folks (and vice versa) right from the beginning. So get your employees to enable their networks! Chances are that they already know a handful of relevant candidates.
We praise ourselves lucky to have made it to first base. But I fear that more challenges will come when targeting second base and growing our product organisation from 15 to 50 in the foreseeable future.
The bigger picture
We have to join forces on promoting Copenhagen as a European techhub. Organisations like CPHFTW and Copenhagen Capacity are doing a great job building, empowering, and promoting our tech community. But there’s a need for more ambassadors spreading great stories of the Danish tech ecosystem. We just hired a candidate who chose to move to Denmark before having a job. She decided to seek opportunities in Copenhagen (and relocate from Madrid) due to her positive perception of the Copenhagen startup scene. What a win!
We also need shared living at a reasonable price for foreign workers, who relocate to Denmark. Shared living initiatives such as LifeX have also proved to be social catalysts in the tech community. A place to meet like minded people outside of work. Being a foreigner and having social success in Denmark can be hard. Let’s admit it, Danes are pretty reserved when it comes to being inclusive of foreigners. Foreigners with a social headstart are more likely to stick around.
Lastly, I want to come back to our taxation. Our tax society has previously been creative, when facing the lack of talent. In the 90’s, we invented ‘expert taxation’ (in Danish: Forskerordningen), a favourable tax system for researchers and well paid employees recruited abroad. At that point in time, most of the Danish growth arrived from research-heavy organisations.
Today, our world is upside down. Big corporates face challenges maintaining growth and leadership positions and younger growth companies are contributing increasingly to the economic growth.
I strongly encourage Denmark to expand the ‘expert taxation’ agreement, so that tax incentives are created for medium-income but much-needed digital talent moving to Denmark.
Because there is no way we can scale our businesses without help from abroad. So let’s spread those great stories, let’s do our utmost to welcome foreign talent and let’s continue to push our politicians for more attractive framework conditions.
Jeppe

""Why Copenhagen?"" has been the common question when we told people we got married there. I am a Cambodian; my husband is English; and we live in Berlin. Wouldn't it make more sense to get married in Berlin, England, or Cambodia?
Yes, we did have a big fat wedding celebration in Cambodia. But more to that later. What I'm talking about is the legal/civil wedding where you sign a paper that legally binds you as husband and wife.
So… Yes, we live in Berlin. No, we don't speak very good German. This makes it hard because (1) we will then need an official translator at the wedding, (2) it would be tough throughout the whole application because of the limited German, (3) the paperwork is just too much. This article here could tell you more about everything you need to do to get married in Germany. One of the most ridiculous document you need to provide — in my opinion — is the Ehefähigkeitszeugnis aka Certificate of no impediment to marriage from your country of origin (and if I'm not mistaken, from all the countries you have lived at prior to Germany). Did I also mention certified copy of birth certificate? It's not easy business to get that for some countries.
And ""why not the UK then""? Which is actually a good question. UK is a bit simpler (probably because it's all in English so we could understand stuffs), but then we found out there is this requirement that ""In order to actually start the marriage process, you and your partner have to have been living in the UK for at least 7 days prior to notifying a designated registrar office of your plans to marry"". Read more from this article.
So yeah. Getting married in Germany seems hard. Getting married in the UK was also tricky. Thanks to the sponsored Google ads, we found out that a lot of expats in Europe goes to Denmark to get married. It looked like Copenhagen was the Vegas of Europe! No joke! Looking deeper, it was not like Vegas. There's no drive-through or laundry weddings. I know, disappointing right? But still, everyone claimed it was the best decision one could do if one of us are not German and not willing to go through the bureaucracy. So yeah, we decided to do Copenhagen.
There is literally this website that we found: https://gettingmarriedindenmark.com/ that provided a very clear step by step explanation of what to do. (FYI this is not a sponsored post or anything, I'm simply sharing information) They also provide the consultation service that helps you through with a fee. Honestly, the process is simple enough that you probably would not need the service, but we got it just for the peace of mind (and admit it — less stress for the bride).
So here is what we did.
Voila! Now you just need to turn up for the wedding!
We got married at Copenhagen city hall. Everything was straightforward and relaxing, and the whole ceremony was done in less than 10 minutes. We did not even have to bring any witnesses — they have those if we need. The people who performed the ceremony was nice and friendly, and we felt really comfortable. You can do vows too if you like. We didn't though. None of us really like to say emotional stuffs, so we skipped it. We simply said ""I do""and exchanged rings, and kissed. And oh, we signed the papers too.
It was just the two of us. So simple. So easy. Not a care in the world about guests, how we looked, or anything going wrong. We focused on getting married and did exactly JUST that.
As you could see, we dressed up a little though and had a photographer to capture the moment. You can skip all these and just rock up. I told the consultant agency what I was looking for, and they gave me some recommendations. However, there's plenty of photography, makeup, and flower services at different price points that you could go for if you google or check on instagram. They are pretty nice and friendly too, so just send them a text with your needs. Some people also opted for the fancier packages where you get married it at your own venue or a little off the bustling city center area.
None at all. We spent a bit of money but it was smooth and I recommend any expats living in Germany or Europe that struggles with the bureaucracy where they live to consider Copenhagen as their wedding destination. You can make it a little holiday and even invite people you care about to attend the ceremony.
Lots of love, from the newly Mrs ❤ Let me know if you have any questions or would like to know which photography and makeup service we used.

Alex Martin shares his love of history with people in Copenhagen, Denmark, through his job as a tour guide. This last Tuesday, April 5th, Martin led a food focused tour with a group of students from Semester at Sea.
Semester at Sea is a floating university where students from all over the world spend the semester taking classes on a ship, the MV World Odyssey. During the semester students get to travel to 10–13 different countries. While in country, they can travel independently or with field programs organized by Semester at Sea and tour companies from each country. Martin’s tour was with a group of journalism students.
Martin has been living in Copenhagen for 20 years. He started working as a tour guide because of his love for the city and his love for history. Because of his wide range of knowledge, he is able to lead tours related to a variety of topics. This tour focused on the food scene in Copenhagen, but just the day before Martin led another tour with Semester at Sea that focused on social movements with a group of political science students. Martin introduced the group of journalism students to the rich history of food in Denmark by telling them the story of rye bread, and its importance in the country. According to him, rye bread is a staple in most Nordic cultures because of its rich nutrients. The bread uses flour made from rye grain instead of wheat grain and includes a variety of seeds. Historically, people used to even put wood shavings in it to bulk up its nutritious value. Danish farmers used to use this bread as an edible plate and bring their leftovers to the fields for lunch, creating an open-faced sandwich called the smorgasbord. This practical and inexpensive dish was later adopted by bars who would serve it to clients in effort to get them to buy more drinks. The public really enjoyed these sandwiches and began to request specific flavors. The bars responded to this interest by making the smorgasbord a permanent item on the menu, and restaurants soon followed. Smorgasbord is now considered the national dish of Denmark and, although it has practical roots, it is presented as a delicate, elegant dish at many dining establishments.
After teaching the students about the history of rye bread and smorgasbord, Martin brought them to CPH Cooking Class to try and make the dish themselves. The group prepared three different variations of the dish. The first variation was vegetarian and consisted of buttered rye, boiled potatoes, mustard mayo, fried onions, and dill. The second was rye topped with chicken salad made of shredded chicken, mayo, green apple, green onion, and herbs. The last variation was fried fish and vegetables served on top of rye with lemon. Martin said the fish was a red spotted fish popular in Denmark because of its supply in the North Atlantic. The group was able to eat their creations with popular fruit juices while having time to ask Martin and the CPH Cooking Class staff questions before heading off to their next activity.
A short bus ride took Martin and his students to Reffen, a famous Copenhagen food market where the stands are made of recycled shipping containers. Martin explained that Denmark is one of the most sustainability focused countries in the world with a huge emphasis on recycling. Making food stands out of old shipping containers near the capitol’s shipping port is just one of the innovative Danish techniques that Martin taught about. He also pointed out a complex of student housing made from the recycled containers, a garbage incinerator that creates power for the city and has an artificial ski hill on top of it, a group of windmills near the coast, the importance of bikes in the city, and the use of recycled materials in Copenhagen’s hippie commune, Christiania. He gave the students free time to explore the food market, interview business owners, and taste more unique dishes. According to Martin, Reffen is a great place for aspiring chefs and business owners to enter Copenhagen’s already dense food industry.
For their last stop, Martin took the students to one of his personal favorite spots, Halls on the Plaza in the city center. This food market offers many take home options and is conveniently located downtown, making it a popular spot for Copenhagen residents on their way home from work. The plaza consists of two buildings constructed on top of an underground recycling complex. While it is expensive to rent a space at, the heavily trafficked area generates steady business making it another great place for people trying to enter the city’s food industry. Martin’s personal favorite things to buy at the plaza are fish cakes and chocolates.
Bellies full of Danish food and heads full of information, Martin took the group of students back to their ship. When asked if he likes his job he replied, “I get to learn new things every day, what’s not to like?”
Thank you to Kris Kodrich and Semester at Sea for facilitating this field class.

I would like to share my overall impressions about the flight to the Faroe Islands and why I chose this airline.
The company made its first flight on March 1988. Since then, much has changed, and the company has become larger. Now Atlantic Airways has 184 employees. The fleet consists of 3 planes and 2 helicopters, the aircrafts are relatively new, including the brand new Airbus A320NEO and Leonardo AW139 helicopters. The airplanes and helicopters are named after the outstanding artists of the Faroe Islands.
The decision to fly to the Faroe Islands came very spontaneously, and there was little to no time for deliberation and plans. However, at the same time, I was pleasantly surprised by the cost of tickets, even when buying a mere 10 days before the departure.
As an experienced tourist, I decided to register on the site and get a frequent flyer card, but something went wrong, and I was confronted with an error on the website. Looking ahead, I would say that this is the only minus that I can note. In any case, I was not upset, as the primary goal was to buy flight tickets, and this can be done without any registration.
Go to the airline’s website, and right on the main page, you can immediately see all direct destinations:
North
South
There is also an option — to see the calendar of low prices.
The process of buying tickets is quite simple, all prices on the website are in Danish kroner. Choosing a date, you can see prices for a few days back and forth, which will allow you to find the best option.
You can also buy tickets using mobile apps on iOS and Android devices.
You can use the app or web to Check-in online, and you don’t need to print out boarding passes, you can use them directly from the mobile app.
Before buying tickets, I recommend checking the information if you need a visa since the Faroe Islands have their own permission.
Information on countries whose residents need a visa can be found here.
If you still need a visa, the list of embassies can be found here.
The Faroe Islands are not part of the Schengen Area, and therefore you can’t get here using a Danish visa. You must apply directly for an Island visa.
After all the preparations had been completed, finally the long-awaited day of the departure had arrived. The route consisted of a stop off in Copenhagen then onto Vagar.
Check-in and baggage drop-off at the airport closes half an hour before a flight. If you have luggage, you can choose 2 options:
In the first case, the airport staff will help you arrange everything. Although if you decide to use the second option, you need to scan the boarding pass and select passengers with luggage, after which the machine prints a sticker that must be attached to the suitcase. After that, just a few meters away is the baggage drop-off point. If your baggage weighs more than 20 kg, it’s classified as heavy so you will need to attach a special tag to it, which you will find right next to the scanner.
Wave goodbye to your luggage and head to the gate for boarding. If you are departing from Copenhagen Airport, I would highly recommend you to arrive early, as there are a lot of shops and various cafes inside.
The gate was in a small remote wing of the terminal. Most of all, I was worried about company loyalty to hand luggage. The hand luggage restrictions are 55x40x25 cm and 8kg weight plus a laptop bag.
As I noticed, there were no questions from the airport staff regarding the size and quantity of hand luggage and boarding was speedy.
I flew on the brand new AIRBUS A320NEO, and my impressions were only the most positive, not only from the plane but also from what was happening inside.
I was almost the last person to board the plane, and this did not hinder me from putting my suitcase on the luggage rack. The shelves were not full, even despite the fact I was flying to a cold country, and people would need a lot of outerwear.
I think it’s not worth saying however that the seats were in excellent condition as the plane is still new. You are able to change the position of the chair and headrest.
I was surprised by the mobile device holder, as well as USB charging for each seat.
Atlantic Airways provides an app for passengers. The main functionality is
How to get the app? Connect to WIFI AtlanticAirFi and open airfi.aero in a browser.
Atlantic Review Magazine is published 4 times a year and has been available to airline users since 1990. On the airline’s website, you can find all the old publications since 2010. The journal tells about the sights, entertainment, and events on the islands, as well as historical information.
Oh, what a delicious sandwich, you can create songs about it ;)
A selection of free drinks provided on board: sweet soda, juices, and coffee or tea.
I especially recommend you to try tomato juice. I would even say that it is not juice, but a ready-made cocktail with spices, incredibly tasty for spicy lovers.
Food can be ordered in several ways:
You can order sandwiches or rolls as well as desserts and drinks, but if you travel in the morning, breakfast may be your choice too.
A feature of the menu was the opportunity to try craft beer, specially brewed in collaboration with the brewery and the airline.
Föroya Bjór fly WIT me
Atlantic Airways asked Föroya Bjór to brew beer specifically for passengers, and as a result, we got a fly WIT me. This is Belgian Witbier (Bière Blanche), and experts say that the best place to drink beer you can have at an altitude of 10,000 meters. Föroya Bjór is the oldest brewery in the Faroe Islands and was founded in 1888.
Okkara Hop in the Air
Another beer is Indian Pale Ale brewed together with Okkara, which has been brewing beer since 2010 and is very famous for its collaborations with other breweries.
If you are planning a trip to the Faroe Islands, this airline may surprise you.
Read my blog, and you will find a lot of useful information for traveling around Europe.

Healthy. Organic. Paleo restaurant
Inspired by our latest trip to Berlin and how much wifey and I enjoyed the #SexyGood healthy delicious Simply Keto restaurant/cafe in Berlin, Germany, I realised how much I had enjoyed a similar experience last August when we had gone to Copenhagen Denmark.
The entire #SexyGood + links to the 3 visits to Simply Keto can be captured here https://medium.com/@abhijitpradhan/the-launch-of-the-true-life-metric-95a305856195
We had done a short 5 day trip to this amazing city for the following reasons
After paying homage to the Coffee Collective at their roastery outlet in Godthabsvej/Freidricksburg, we came to the famed Torvehallerne, the hip and happening food hall ( there are 2 big halls ).
And while hunting for lunch options, my eyes settled on Palæo which I had read about earlier. Luckily, as one could pick up food from any kiosk and sit together in one place, I didn’t have to worry about wifey, who was frankly not too interested in the place ! ( It took her a trip to Berlin last month to finally nudge her !). She looked at the different food options, but her attention quickly wandered off and she came back with a multi cheese platter as her lunch !
I went to the counter and the person taking orders was friendly and helpful. The place was more a snack/fast food/smoothie kind of place. Apparently there was a “restauranty” style Paleo outlet somewhere else in the city, but she told me the food was essentially the same.
I ordered a salad which was heavy on keto bread, avocado, nuts, berries, etc.
She suggested I go for the Sweet Potato chips. I did. And my main course was a “grass fed” Hot dog with the sausage wrapped in an egg omelette.
I was in seventh heaven as one did not get such treats back home-especially the grass fed hot dog !
The other thing that struck me after reaching Copenhagen was the sheer quality of their produce. Especially the vegetables. I told wifey that I could happily give up meat for ever, if I get a constant supply of such awesome vegetables. This theme continued throughout the trip and even in the Michelin starred restaurants that we ate in and loved, the vegetables were like from another planet !! #Swoon
Torvehallerne became a very convenient lunch spot for us. It was next to the hub station, Norreport, so it was connected to all places in the city ( Metro, train, bus) and dinners were strategically chosen and booked by wifey to feed her chef soul, so basically I got a license to have most of my lunches at Palæo ! Yay ! Think I did at least 3 :)
My favourite dish was discovered when I ordered their burger. The same friendly order taker told me the bread used for the burger was not as heavy as their regular bread as it used more seeds than nuts. Cool !
I loved it. The meat was obviously grass fed beef and from the first bite I was transported to my school days where my dream meal was in one of the fast food burger joints ( Hardees, Dairy Queen etc.) and my favourite dish used to the burger ( specifically the Mushroom & Swiss burger in Hardees).
I ensured that I had the burger again in my next and last visit here !
This experience gave me hope that Sexy and Good can co-exist and my recent trip to Berlin and Simply Keto has only reinforced that hope !! Also, it was heartening to know that Michelin star chef Thomas Rode Andersen was behind the design of the menu ! #SexyGood in action !https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/mar/02/fast-food-restaurant-caveman-diet-copenhagen
I had turned “Paleo” way back in 2012 and in fact tried to use that approach while running marathons but it didn’t work as after 30 k of running, the system would just revolt and scream for quick carbs. Energy gels, potatoes. I was eating more and more unhealthy stuff just to fuel my runs !
It was only in 2016 where I discovered “Keto” which actually gives me hope of plugging that energy crash issue that I always faced on the longer runs.
Paleo can be seen as High Protein ( which I realised was not actually good for me) + Low Carb + Low Fat whereas Keto is High Fat + Moderate Protein ( a crucial tweak) and Low Carb
When ( and if ) your body adapts to the High fat and low carb component of Keto, it slowly starts prefering to burn fat as a fuel ( which is far cleaner) rather than the extremely dirty and volatile carbs as source of fuel. I know now that if I had managed this during my marathoning days, it would have made a world of difference ! I don’t do long runs anymore as it took me a very long time to get over a knee injury and I realised that my body thrives on high intense short bursts of activity rather than the prolonged abuse that I was subjecting it to + after the recent Paris + Berlin trip, I re-connected with “walking” as it probably activates health in my system better than any other activity ! Wow.
The above is a short recap of how I arrived at #SexyGood in terms of diet, nutrition and exercise.

When this Airbnb host in London decided to be an Airbnb guest in design-conscious Copenhagen, he found much to be inspired by in the galleries and museums. If you’re also looking for design/art inspiration, here are three spots you should include when visiting Copenhagen. (Although just being in the city itself seems to activate latent design genes…)
The SMK houses 700 years’ worth of Danish and Nordic art and sculpture with a clear demarcation between the original architecture built in 1896 and the stunning, light-filled modernist section built 100 years later. If you like a chronological context, you can work your way from the front and understand the big themes through the centuries with clever diversions into more obscure and ‘problematic’ branches every so often.
A short train trip north of Copenhagen takes you to another repository of modern art in a stunning waterside setting, housed in an architectural marvel.
Louisiana (named after the original owners three wives, all named Louise) is a day trip in itself. The permanent collection boasts works by Picasso, Klein, Arp, Moore, Warhol, Hockney, Giacometti and oodles more. The current exhibitions included a immersive retrospective of Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama, Lucien Freud and ‘Africa’, a hugely thoughtful and surprising treatise on architecture, art and culture from the continent today.
If Copenhagen can’t have a stunning museum of design, what hope is there for anywhere else? The museum has the lofty twin ambitions to both serve ‘as a source of inspiration for people active in industry’ while making ‘contemporary consumers both critically aware and discerning’.
This translates of course into a whole lot of #chairporn…
So, despite ostensibly taking a break from London, Airbnb and design, I find myself filled with a better understanding of how Danish design works. Now to bring some of that all important hygge to Kith & Kine.
Kith & Kine is a stylish two-bed property close to all the hip/tech action in Shoreditch, London. Come and stay and see how far we’ve got recreating some Danish hygge…

“Travel has been the fire that has shaped my current self, accumulating layers of complexity in my thinking, thoughts, and actions as a result of my journey’s successes and failures.” Gabriela Trofin-Tatár
My Erasmus University exchange in Odense, Denmark, during the spring semester of 2006 was an unforgettable chapter in my life. Immersed in the vibrant atmosphere of Tehnisk Kollegium, I discovered the power of collaborative learning through teamwork, an experience that would profoundly shape my educational journey.
Moreover, during the semester, I traveled both in Denmark and abroad, expanding my horizons and becoming more curious about my studies.
In the following sections, I invite you to read about events and places that had a positive impact on my love for Denmark and my cultural awareness during that time.

I am not often in Copenhagen. It is a one-hour drive from where I live. And I can get my shopping and entertainment needs covered closer to home. But I do go there occasionally. And when I do, I see reminders of our racist past everywhere.
I will start with a disclaimer. I am a white dude, who is soon approaching 40. I am a history buff. And I have always tried to fight racism where I can. But I am aware I can not fully escape my racist history.
Many Europeans acknowledge the blatant racism in the U.S. But they falsely believe that it is a uniquely American problem. It is not. The slave ships that brought these slaves to the U.S. sailed from our harbors.
Racism is a European invention. We had to invent it in order to justify our atrocities against people of color. And guess what. We think our invention was so smart, that we Europeans call the historic period where we shipped slaves and exploited our colonies “The Age of Enlightenment”.
Yes, racism is systemic. And trying to censor this truth in our classrooms will not make it untrue.

Based on a meeting in Copenhagen, one call to Australia, a number of tweets, Linkedin and Yammer posts, the word was spread and the first #ResponsiveOrg meetup in Copenhagen became reality Thursday 27. November 2014 — read about the preparation here ,
Eager to meet the people who signed up for #ResponsiveCoffee in Copenhagen on Meetup.com I got to the cafe about 30 minutes early…
tables where placed in a corner, and the coffee was just about to brew — we where ready to meet.
All interested and curious we gathered and the talking started by one to one introductions as people showed up, then the non existing agenda developed in this way:
6 men joined — Kenneth has listed ResponsiveOrg Copenhagen relevant tweets here — and here are the names of the 6 men at the first meetup
admitted - it looks a bit as a bunch of..
“..handsome, thoroughly clever, perfectly plump men in our prime” as Karlsson on the roof says
The conversation touched diversity and all agreed it is needed for future meetups. Also discussing the need for a meetup in english, which is obviously is an option if non Danish-speaking wants to join — please let us know at meetup.com or as a comment here.
I am not really sure, but I know that I have found likeminded people whom I want to share my experiences with, and I am sure they will share interesting angles on topics that relates to #futureofwork, #ResponsiveOrg, #worklikeanetwork — add the # you like, or tell the story as Matt Partovi
http://player.vimeo.com/103393370
One thing it instantly brougth was Kenneths scoop.it on Leadership a ressource of inspiration for future topics, and so much more.
And the all participants was featured in this tweet
Wanting to get into a series of meetups, the next meetup is planned as #ResponsiveMorning for the 14. January at 9:30 - you can signup via meetup.com
Do you want to give a 10 minute speak about a topic you care about? If so suggest a topic for the meetup, and suggest a topic anyway.
A big thanks to all of you showing up, and for those of you who showed interested but couldn’t find the time, come by in the future.
To all of you who liked, retweetet and shared the posts to make the noise — most appreciated!

August 4, Sabbatical Day 23
Sunday did not go at all like I had planned. I walk out of my apartment at 10:40am, planning to bike to church (that starts at 11am), only for rain drops to start falling. So I pivot to taking the train … only that adds to my travel time and makes me 10 minutes late to church. And I’m sleepy in my movie-theater seat in the back of the auditorium, fighting heavy eyelids. And if we’re being honest, I don’t get much out of the guest pastor speaking.
But I’ve still got the entire day, right? Only it’s pouring when I walk out of church, so I linger a little longer in the lobby, game-planning my day on my phone.
Church attendees are slowly making their way out (this church takes place in a hotel conference center). And one makes it’s way over to me. Glasses, ash-blonde air a little ruffled, lanky and crooked smile. No rain jacket.
“Were you at Hillsong?” He asks in heavily accented English.
“Yes, I’m visiting Copenhagen and every time I’ve come to the city before, I have come to church here.”
He proceeds to tell me that he just moved to Copenhagen last week from Bratislava, Slovakia. He’s staying in a hostel now, but wants to live by the beach. He tells me about the bike he bought from a guy a month ago (the guy just left it on the street for him to buy!), and how it was locked up on the street for the last month waiting for his return. I tell him about my journey to Copenhagen, my sabbatical.
Eventually I see the rain lightening up, and say my goodbyes. I walk off to the metro, planning on taking it to Norrebro to get this focaccia sandwich I dreamed about getting last visit. And just as I make it down the escalator, I hear an alarm going off.
“Evacuate immediately,” it says.
So everyone makes there way back up the elevator, crowing under the metro awning outside, because — mind you — it’s still raining. Sirens start in the distance, and a fire truck rounds the corner.
I make the call to try for the bus instead, since clearly this train station won’t be opening back up anytime soon. I walk back past the church, past the Slovak, and to a bus station a block away. The bus is 10 minutes late, but finally arrives. By this point, it’s nearing 2pm, and the sun has broken through — you’d hardly know it was so nasty 30 minutes ago.
I get my focaccia sandwich from Rondo, inhale it, and start walking back to my apartment to pick up my bike. I think I take a wrong turn somewhere along the way, because it’s taking longer than I anticipated. I’m cutting through Fælledparken, and start realizing — if I want to go visit Grundtvigs church, I need to do it now, since they close at 4 and are closed Monday. So once again, I backtrack to the bus station. And what do you know, the heavens open up midway. I wait under a tree for a couple minutes, waiting for it to lighten up, then make my way to the bus stop. The bus is late, which I’m starting to realize is a Copenhagen trend. I start seeing a bunch of people walking in the same direction with jerseys, and realize there’s a match on today. Do I want to go? I calculate the time it takes to get to the church, take a quick spin, then go back to my apartment to change, then go to the game. It’s a lot, so I decide against. This is all being thought through while I’m on the bus.
Eventually I get to the church … only to walk up and find that it’s closed due to water damage. And honestly, I’m more bummed about the hour of travel time round trip than the actual church being closed.
So I make my way back to my apartment, changing out of my church clothes and swapping my bag for coffee shop books and journals. There’s one right around the corner from my apartment that a guy from Hagen Espresso in London recommended. It’s pretty full for 4pm when I get there, so I snag a seat inside since there’s not a seat open outside to enjoy this gorgeous weather.
But right after my drink is delivered, one does open up, so I gather up my bag and cortado and relocate. I’m sitting outside for around 20 minutes before I see a young guy — who I think is not Danish — walk into the shop. He’s by himself, wearing a Cyprus cap, along with a green market tote bag.
He sits at the table to left of me, back to the street, while I’m facing the street, Mere Christianity in hand. I keep eying him — do I make conversation with this fellow traveler? After all, sometimes I’ve found some of my best travel moments behind starting a conversation. But how to start — do I ask him about Cyprus?
At this point, I pull out my phone that’s plugged into my power bank. And that’s my opening (or rather, his).
“Do you have a USB-C cable?” He asks, once again in accented English. “I have a power bank, I just need the cord.”
And this, reader, is where I thank God once again that I bought a power bank with several types of cords.
“No, but this has one in it. Here, you take it,” I insist. “Are you visiting Copenhagen?”
“Yes, I just arrived today.”
“Oh, and where are you from?”
“I’m from Ukraine, but I’m living in Italy now.”
“Oh, where in Italy?” I ask, thinking about my January trip there.
Outside of Florence, he tells me. “I’ve hitch-hiked here from Florence.”
Cue my jaw dropping.
“I first went to Berlin, where I stayed with some friends. Then hitchhiked here. I wanted an adventure, and I had things that I wanted to figure out for life. But now I think I know what I need to do next, so I’m going to just fly home. Plus hitchhiking is exhausting.”
The conversation that follows is not one that I could have predicted.
I find out more about his life — He lived in Italy from 2019 to February 2022, making money so he could come back to Ukraine flush with cash — rich in their eyes. This is when he says he thought his dream, ideal life would start. But he didn’t have to explain it too much — Russia invaded a month later. Eventually he got out of Ukraine (which he didn’t explain, but I know means avoided being conscripted). Back to Italy, working in services industry — a textile manufacturer, I think.
He said his life was comfortable, but he didn’t want to blink and life fly by. I asked him what his realization was, and he answered, “I need to leave Italy.” He has various gripes with Italy and Italians — lack of openness and diversity, lack of parks, lack of opportunities to connect with others. He also doesn’t know what to do work wise — he’s tried a lot of different things.
I couldn’t help but think at this point — “Oh buddy. You’re searching for a happy life, but that’s never going to satisfy.”
I ask him what brings him joy, and he says talking with people — at some points he struggles to find the words in English. He likes providing advice, or crisis management, as he says.
He asks about me, too. I tell him about my sabbatical, about processing life, what I want to do next.
“How satisfied are you with your life? Put a number on it.”
I tell him that while I love my life, of course there are things I’d love to be different. I’d love to be married, I’d love for experience physical healing. 75%, I say.
“That’s pretty high.”
We talk some about singleness — I say there are things I could not do if I was married. Like working with the youth kids that bring me so much joy. I probably could not do a trip like this if I was married. That’s when I’m surprised to find out he’s married (no ring). Just left his wife back in Italy to hitchhike for a bit.
I explain that in the south in the U.S., people get married younger. My sisters both married young.
“Do you feel pressure to? From your family?” He asks.
“Not really.” It’s more the pressure of my own timeline. But my parents don’t quite understand the different world I am dating in, and find themselves befuddled that being asked out is so non-existent for so many of my friends.
We shut the coffee shop down, and move to a bench next door. At some point, he has me follow him on Instagram so we can keep up with one another. How much, we’ll see. Near the end of our conversation, he asks me, “So what’s your plan from here?”
I clarify — “Do you mean for today, this trip, or my life?”
“For your life.”
Oof. How to answer this?
“Here’s the thing, I can make plans for my life, but ultimately, I could die tomorrow –“ He recoils a bit at this — “I mean, I hope not, but I know where I would be if I did. And here’s the thing, as great as all this is,” I wave my hand at the street in front of me, “Heaven is better. So I can make plans, my life is not my own. My life belongs to God. He has plans for me. One of the things I love about God is I can do x or y, but he’s going to use it regardless for my good and his glory.”
He’s watching me as I talk and I don’t know if I’ve entirely lost him. I feel the need for honesty not pontifications.
“Listen, is it easy to say that? Absolutely not. I want to be tight fisted with my life. I have to remind myself regular to let go, because I know his plan for me is so much better.”
He doesn’t respond to any of this, and that’s okay. I don’t need him to. The conversation peters out some from there — but before we part, I ask to take his picture and he acquiesces.
We stand — he’s VERY TALL — and bends at both the knees and the waist to give me a very awkward hug. “Don’t die tomorrow,” he tells me.
I smile at that, and tell him I’ll try not to.
I walk off in the direction of the grocery, reeling a bit. Did the last hour and a half just happen? I’ve never had a conversation with a stranger like that before.
I rewind through my day — the delays and redirects and ending up at Prolog Coffee outside at 4pm. It would be easy to look at my encounter with Bogdan (that’s his name) in a silo. But I can see the fingerprints streaking across the window of my day, and I can see how the fact that I ended up there was not happenstance. Who knows if any of that will stick with him, but it was as much for me as it was for him.
There’s this rewiring starting to happen inside of me on this trip.
Life with God is an adventure. I’ve said that before, but I’ve thought about it more in the large-scale sense. Adventure of career, dating, etc.
But now, now I’m starting to realize that every day is an adventure. To look at the margins — or lack of — and invite him in. Surprise me, God.

When I arrived in Copenhagen six years ago, after a particularly hard year in New York, I needed to regroup, re-think and reinvent myself. I was stressed out, exhausted and confused — everything you’d expect a New Yorker to be. My salvation came from the most unexpected source — a bicycle.
If in New York cycling was saved for hipsters, exercise fanatics and tourists at that time, in Copenhagen, it was (and is) the main mode of transportation. Bike roads run alongside car roads there, with dedicated traffic lights, and bicyclists are respected and given priority. In return, they obey strict rules and laws. The whole thing is very civilized. No yelling, no honking, no confusion.
After two weeks of taking overpriced buses like a tourist and gawking at masses of bicycles at intersections, I gave in and bought a used bike. Little did I know, my rusty two-wheeled companion was to become my best friend in Denmark’s cold capital and my best chance at finding happiness.

My old friend Kathrine invited us to stay with her a while at her new tiny house in Copenhagen. For our first night out, she looked at a number of options: There was a weird performance art piece by The Center for Militant Futurologi, drummers were needed for a climate change demonstration on two tallships sailing down whatever the big river in the middle of the city is called (I swear I can’t find this information anywhere), and a jam session was brewing in Freetown Christiania. Kathrine said her best bet was a metal show at a small bar called Lygtens Kro, with a headliner from Sweden (Gothenburg, naturally) who played in the style of the 1980s. “Power metal?” I asked, and her boyfriend said that sounded right to him. I became partly acquainted with the numerous highly-specific metal subgenres back in my nightclub days, and I do my best to keep up as the lexicon matures; but I’m never sure what names to use.
So we met at the Metro station, hit the bar, and got a round of Golden Ladies (a slightly-higher-priced form of Tuborg lager, analogous to ordering a Miller Genuine Draft instead of a Miller High Life). The opening band, I thought, was good but not great. They could use a new guitarist. Still, it was enjoyable enough, stoner rock with a vein of grunge in there that might have resulted more from a lack of rehearsal than an aesthetic choice. I figured this was what would be on the menu tonight. I couldn’t have been more wrong. After a short set break, during which I smoked a comically tiny joint outside, the headliners took the stage sans announcement and began to play. I happened to be near the door that was nearest the stage, headed straight in, and got myself an enviable position in the very front of the room to see and hear a band called Hypnos.
Holy shit, these boys could play. There was an Iron Maiden thing happening, sometimes escalating into Queensryche territory or putting its root down into Soundgarden. If you know those bands, then a certain kind of metal vocals are playing in your head now that speaks to a certain era of rock — “No one sings like you anymore,” as the late great Chris Cornell lamented — and you’re right on the money. This singer Linus Johansson was extra fun — a sensuous and playful front man with frizzy blond hair and a porno mustache, with a voice like Geoff Tate and moves like Robert Plant, graceful arms and serpentine torso, with penetrating eye contact at such close quarters. This bar didn’t even have a stage, so I was just standing right in front of these guys, able to really get into what the players were doing, and they were doing plenty. The lead guitarist, Pontus Isebring, was positively fucking rad, an inspired shredder in a paroxysm behind his veil of dark brown hair yet locked in tight with the rhythm section. To call them a rhythm section is to undersell them a bit, in fact: The younger-looking second guitarist Oskar Wersall often harmonized with solos and melodies note for note, leaving the chugging rhythmic floor to dead-serious bassist Anton Kallmin; and even that mustachioed and muttonchopped warrior was doing some pretty fancy shit when space opened up on the bottom end. Drummer Oskar Brindmark was a beast and a scientist, not a drop of sweat on his brow as he assembled and deconstructed patterns with breakneck speed. They were one sick five-piece metal outfit, my friends. This isn’t even my kind of music, particularly, but I know greatness when it’s blasting me in the face.
It wasn’t all about technical chops, either. Part of what made Hypnos so much fun to watch was that they were all having so much fun, enjoying one another’s company on stage in a way that lots of bands fail to do even in their honeymoon years. Anton and Oskar W. stepped in to share backup vocals on a single mic, eyes flashing and heads bobbing at one another. Linus couldn’t get enough of Pontus’ solos — every time the latter cut loose, the former sidled up real close and let his own fingers wiggle up and down his mic stand in a celebratory air guitar dance that brought to mind Bowie/Ronson in the Spiders From Mars years. I guess this singer isn’t even the original guy — he joined the band in 2017 — but having watched them play I can hardly imagine Hypnos without him. That this band remains so infatuated with the stage and with each other on their fifteenth year of performing says much about their special chemistry, and for an audience member it makes all the difference.
At the end of the set, Linus asked us to make sure and buy something at the merch table. “We don’t have any money!” he cheerfully informed us. Sadly, I hadn’t a dime to spare at that very broke point in my own independently-booked tour of Europe; so the best I could offer was my congratulations and this article. Hypnos seems to be on tour at all times, releasing music on The Sign Records that you can buy right now and generally doing the work of a rock and roll band in the prime of life. You should find an opportunity to see them play live, ideally in a small venue, and bring enough cash for the CD or the t-shirt or whatever. Folks like us are out here scraping by in 21st-century showbiz, even living metal gods from Sweden, and time shovels dirt over all of us soon enough. It’s up to the fans to keep the scene alive. As long as there are heads in the club, Hypnos is sure to keep them banging.

[Note from Massimo: This article by my friend Jim Baggott is a bit on the technical side. But if you care about our deep understanding of the world, or about the nature of science, or about the relationship between science and philosophy, enjoy.]
I read Massimo’s essay “Physicists don’t know what the world is like, at bottom” (29 May 2020, also here) with considerable interest. And no little frustration. In the epilogue of my new book Quantum Reality (published in the US in September) I close with a brief analysis of a survey of attitudes on the interpretation of quantum mechanics that was conducted among physicists in 2011. Massimo’s essay concerned a more recent (and more extensive) survey published in 2016, which I’d overlooked. Thankfully, in most respects both surveys produced similar results.
Massimo observed that, despite all the popular media attention given to fantastical interpretations which invoke the existence of multiple, parallel universes, the Copenhagen interpretation remains the most favored. (And I heaved a sigh of relief, as this was true also in 2011.)
But what I found even more fascinating is that the 2016 survey, conducted by Sujeevan Sivasundaram and Kristian Hvidtfelt Nielsen at Aarhus University in Denmark, included questions which allowed them to go beyond this simple statement of…

I took fairly easy train ride from Stockholm, through Malmo, and then over a gigantic bridge that spans the sea between Malmo and Copenhagen. I had no idea what to expect from Copenhagen, but somehow I knew I was going to enjoy my week in the home of Carlsberg. It turned out to be one of my favourite cities in Europe and the first time I stayed in a hostel with triple bunk beds.
Copenhagen was a fascinating city with an interesting mix of old and modern architecture in addition to many parks areas and canals. The bike lanes were also the best i’d used in Europe. I was able to skateboard on them anywhere I wanted in the city without having to go on the actual roads at all.
Apparently there was a study done about the Copenhagen bike lanes and the conclusion was that it was actually faster to use the bike lanes to bike to your destination than to drive within the city.
Copenhagen also had what I consider one of the best modern art museum that I visited in Europe, the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art.
Set a bit outside of the city on the coast, the building is at first unassuming by appearing to be a diminutive house, but when you enter it opens into a vast underground exhibit area.
In the surrounding grounds there was a pond with a small forest and various sculptures perched around some walking trails.
There were also some large open lawn areas with more sculptures and installations overlooking the sea. It was a beautiful place.
After being in the Copenhagen for a few days I could notice some contrasts between there and the Stockholm, most notably the liquor laws. Stockholm’s laws were more conservative than the redundant Canadian laws, forcing you to buy alcohol from specific government run liquor stores that close around 7 pm on weekdays, 3 pm on Saturdays and are completely closed on Sundays. Furthermore it was illegal to drink outside of establishments, and the latest almost all bars and clubs stay open till was 3 am. In contrast, in Copenhagen you can drink on the streets, buy alcohol from the corner store and party all night if you want to.
An interesting thing to note is the bottle deposit is so high on beers cans and bottles in Copenhagen that anytime I was sitting in a park enjoying a beer with some friends there would be at least five people coming up to you to ask for your empties, which was great because you never had to concern yourself with finding a garbage can to dispose of them. Win for the Danish.
During my week in Copenhagen I went to three music festivals. The best one was a free festival the city put on in the middle of a park called the King’s Garden that had a castle on a hill. Everybody was chilling on the grass drinking beers and enjoying one of the nicest days of the summer while music blared from a stage set up underneath the castle. I met some friendly people and ended up being invited over to somebody’s house for some after party drinks.
One of the most compelling aspects about Copenhagen was the existence of Freetown Christiania. Christiania is a place that exists in the city center of a Copenhagen, which is a self-proclaimed republic that stemmed from squatters living there since the 1970s. Christiania is it’s own world.
There were only about 800 official residents living there that have built themselves all kinds of strange houses and have even built their own schools to teach their children their own curriculum.
Street art was splashed everywhere all over the buildings and there were numerous small cafes and restaurants around that only accept cash.
The part about Christiania that most people come for though was the open selling and consumption of marijuana. There was a street called ‘pusher street’ that was lined with at least 20 stalls selling all kinds of hash, marijuana and edibles.
Here you can buy a joint, light it up, smoke it and nobody will bother you. It is fascinating that such a place existed right in the middle of one of the most modern cities in Europe. Still what happens in Christiania was technically illegal so the residents had established two rules for visitors. The first rule was no running, because if people are running the residents assume it’s a police raid and they will start to run away as well. I later met some Danish dude that told me if you are caught running in Christiania you will receive quite the beating. The second rule was no photos, which was unfortunate because there are some many cool art installations and works of street are littered around the self-proclaimed republic.
Still I was able to sneak a photo or two, but there was one instance where I took a photo of the entrance sign with a resident in the photo and he came up to me and made me delete the photo from my phone.
In the end for me Copenhagen was an ideal blend of south Europe and Scandinavia. It was a clean, organized, well thought out city that has a little bit of everything for everybody where you didn’t have to look over your shoulder to go drink a beer. I actually looked into immigrating there, but unfortunately I would have had to learn the Danish language, which, according to one of my Swedish friends, takes the Danish more time than any other group of children in the world to learn their native language.

Fermion Physics
The Copenhagen interpretation is one of the most popular interpretations of quantum mechanics, and it is the orthodoxy in physics. It is usually related to all the weird things about quantum mechanics you may have heard, like Schrodinger’s Cat. But what if I told you that the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics — is wrong? Here’s why
Before I write the rest of this article, I want to say that my beliefs here are not the orthodoxy in the physics world — most physicists believe the copenhagen interpretation and most of the rest don’t care. I’m not claiming to have made some new discovery. What I’m doing here is providing an argument against the Copenhagen interpretation. I’m not saying it is a complete fabrication. But what must be kept in mind is that most physicists believe the copenhagen interpretation simply because that is what is usually taught in universities. Many don’t really care to look for actual justifications or an alternative explanation. A majority of physicists agreeing does not make them correct, and it also does not make them wrong. Even though the measurement problem is not a settled issue, the arguments I present here will be as objective as possible and as reasonable as possible. If you disagree with any of my arguments, great! Tell me why I’m wrong in the comments. With all that said, let’s begin.
It would be great to start out by defining the copenhagen interpretation. The Copenhagen interpretation turns out to not be well defined, and there is many disagreement between self identified proponents, but the copenhagen interpretation could be summed up as
These are the postulates of the Copenhagen interpretation.
The way the copenhagen interpretation is formulated is already problematic. It does not define what a measurement is, it does not talk about the eigenvalue of a system before a measurement, and it does not say why the wave function is related to the probability density. It turns out that this is by design. The copenhagen interpretation is intentionally formulated to be vague, and to just describe what is measured. If a scientist walks into a lab, and does a measurement, the wave function will indeed tell the scientist how likely he will get that measurement. The copenhagen interpretation could be thought as the instructions a medicine container has. “Take 1 pill each day and your sore throat will be cleared.” These instructions do not tell you how the pill clears your throat, it does not say what the pill is doing inside your body, it just tells you what happens. The same thing happens with the copenhagen interpretation. It just tells you what you’re gonna (likely) get, and dodges all other questions. For many physicists, this is satisfactory. They have a theory that can predict stuff, so why will they care more about what’s going on beyond the math? I will respond to this point later, but right now I want to give more arguments about why the Copenhagen interpretation is wrong.
Like I said earlier, it doesn’t say what counts as a measurement. Does the measurer have to be conscious? Does the measurer play by the rules of quantum mechanics? Does the measurer have to be outside the system? It doesn’t answer these. Does the system before measurement even have an energy? It doesn’t answer this either. All it does is it tells you what you might get. Some people will try to answer these questions though and still claim they are copenhaganists. A common answer is that before measured, the system is in “all states at once” or “smeared out into a wave”. This is not the copenhagen interpretation; it’s an objectively false description of quantum mechanics that I debunked in this article.
Another statement is that the object does not have a definite value before measured. This statement, though not directly incorrect, is going a step further and talks about the actual nature of a particle before measurement. The copenhagen interpretation only talks about probabilities before measurement (states are probabilistic), not the status of a particle having a certain quality before measurement. So if that stance is taken, then it is no longer the copenhagen interpretation. That stance is also very problematic: If I never observe an atom decay, does that mean that it does not having a decay status at all (ex. it has neither decayed nor not decayed)? This statement is an oxymoron. An object can either decay, or not decay. This is one of the basic principles of logic: a is not “not a” by definition. Some people decide to bite the bullet, and accept that oxymorons can still be true. This is a philosophy called “trivialism”, which is a topic for next time.
A common belief among Copenhaganists is that the measurement devices have to be outside the system. This makes sense, since the opposite would apply that systems can measure themselves, which would imply that systems always exist as having definite eigenvalues since they are constantly measuring themselves. It is this element of the Copenhagen interpretation that destroys itself from the inside. What I want to stress is that what follows is not personal interpretation, but actual undisputed fact about quantum mechanics. When we have 1 particle in our system, the wave function is a function of that one particle: it maps the locations/momenta/energies of that particles into another dimension (the axis of the wave function). In other words, it is a function that maps one input to an output. For 2 particles, the wave function is a function of 2 particles. For 3 particles, the wave function is a function of 3 particles. You get the idea. What I’m describing here is what is called “configuration space”, the space that contains all possible configurations of a system. We can go higher and higher and higher. Quantum mechanics implies that there is a wave function that is a function of every single particle in the universe. Again, this isn’t an assumption or interpretation. It is just quantum mechanics itself: The wave function if a function of n-particles in an n+1 dimensional configuration space. Just replace n to the number of all particles. So now we know that there is a wavefunction of the universe. What does this mean under the Copenhagen interpretation? Well the Copenhagen interpretation requires the measurer to be outside the system, but the system in question is the universe! This means that for the wave function to collapse, then someone outside the universe would have to measure the universe — but wouldn’t this person also be a part of the system? So you’d need another person outside everything else in the system to measure the person inside the system, and you get an infinite regress. Unless you believe that there is someone outside the universe that is collapsing wave functions left and right, then this is huge trouble for copenhaganists. Again, what we did was just normal quantum mechanics. We showed that the Copenhagen interpretation cannot even reconcile with this without postulating an infinite regress of measurers outside of our universe. Now since we actually do measure things inside the universe, this is a direct contradiction of what is implied by the Copenhagen interpretation, making the copenhagen interpretation (the way it is usually presented), false. Someone could try to save copenhagen by saying that systems can measure themselves, but that would mean that a system will have a definite value prior to us measuring it (since it had already measured itself), which would be a hidden-variable theory — something many copenhaganists are against: you can’t have your measurement device and eat it too.
Some people say, “we shouldn’t ask about what happens before it was measured since we aren’t measuring it.” This statement is self defeating. Quantum mechanics talks about probabilities before measurement, so with the logic, the copenhagen interpretation shouldn’t be talked about at all — no quantum mechanics should be talked about at all. But the stance itself is one on quantum mechanics, so it is a self defeating point. This is somewhat analogous to what happened to philosophical logical positivism.
Some people simply don’t care: a usual statement they give is “well all the interpretations lead to the same results”. The people who genuinely believe this are a danger to the progression of physics. It is no secret that particle physics has been somewhat stagnant over recent years. And in my opinion, it is precisely because of people like this: the moderate. The moderate does not care about any deeper insight or intuition in what their mathematics describes. All they care about is performing a calculation. But physics isn’t just about performing calculations — it shouldn’t be just about calculations. Did Newton study the nature of light just to perform a calculation? Did Einstein theorize atoms just to perform a calculation? Did Georges Lemaitre, when he theorized the Big Bang, do so just to perform a calculation? The answer to all 3 of these, if you haven’t gotten it already, is no. These physicists did physics to better understand the world around them. They wanted to understand what made the universe tick. They wanted to fundamentally know the nature of material objects. All of these discoveries of course used calculations, and needed calculations, but calculations are what physicists use to guide them into understanding nature — they do not do calculations for the sake of calculations. One who only does physics for calculations is no different than a calculator; they do not need a job, because a calculator can do it for them — probably better. The reason as to why we do not have many “New Einsteins” or “New Diracs” is because many physicists of this modern age do not question the very meaning of the equations they write. They do not care to see beyond the math. They do not bother to ponder where the lure of physics is leading them — they only care about publishing that paper with some calculation. It was Galileo questioning the geocentric model that contributed to heliocentrism, it was Newton questioning the epicycles that gave us Newton’s laws of gravitation, it was Einstein questioning the works of Newton — looking deeper into the meaning behind the math — that gave us general relativity. It was even Einstein’s challenges towards the quantum mechanics orthodoxy that sparked even more interest in the subject, and an increase in much new exciting material like Bell’s Theorem and Entanglement that became something bigger than intended. All of this started with people looking beyond the math and asking: “what does this all really mean at a fundamental level?” If physics has lost people like that, then it has lost everything.

After I left Amsterdam, I traveled to the beautiful, and quite similar, city of Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark. This Scandinavian city located in between the Danish mainland of Jutland and Sweden is surrounded by the sea on three sides, giving Copenhagen some of the most splendid waterside views next to the many canals, harbors, wharfs, and rivers found throughout the city.
Copenhagen has become one of my favorite cities in Europe. I enjoy its relaxed atmosphere, its abundance of picturesque sights, and its friendly people. Denmark has often been ranked the happiest country in the world, and I can see why. In addition to having a beautiful capital city, the Danes take time to enjoy life, often lounging with friends next to the waterfront, having drinks together at a cozy bar, or cruising on yachts and sailboats. When I studied abroad in Hong Kong in the summer of 2016 (right before my freshman year of college), many of the students I met there were Danish, and I learned that Danes travel quite often and are encouraged to do so with lots of vacation days and financial sponsorship for university students. This societal emphasis on enjoying life makes the typical Dane a happy and amiable individual.
The Danish lifestyle also contributes to the well-being of its citizens. American-style fast food is rare here, and people often eat healthy meals sourced from the surrounding countryside and the sea…

Danish Lockdown Diary

The thing that struck me after my first few days in Copenhagen is that the city feels, at once, foreign and familiar. Familiar, not because I’d been before, but because it feels livable and relatable. Foreign, because it’s dissimilar enough to be interesting.
After spending a month digesting and absorbing life in the Danish capital, I’ve learned some of its norms, and more importantly, a few insights on what can help you feel a little more integrated as you’re settling into this fine city.
Getting Around: Biking is going to be your most efficient — and exhilarating — mode for getting around the city. Be mindful, however, of cycling etiquette and left-hand turns. Cyclists use hand signals here like they’re a new form of communication. Look for the upward raise of the left hand to signal one is stopping on the curb or shuffling to pedal up to make a left hand turn (what they call a box turn, or the “Copenhagen Left”). Refer to diagram below:
It’s super confusing until you do it.
Catching the train or metro from the airport is easy, and takes just 13 minutes to arrive in the city center. Uber is also available, though I’ve found their estimated arrival times to be consistently inconsistent, so if you’re in a rush, better to hail a cab.
Dining: The Danes eat well, and by well, I mean flavor-forward and nutrient dense. Decent attention is being paid to sourcing ecologically and locally, though farmers markets are hard to come by. The closest example is the stalls at Torvehallerne. A few chefs are working to change this, but en masse, it’s slow.
There’s no shortage of delicious smørrebrød. A couple of my favorite establishments include Aamanns and Schønnemann’s. Aamanns is a bit more progressive; Schønnemann’s more traditional. They have an incredibly diverse selection of snaps, which is the classic accompaniment to a Danish lunch of smørrebrød.
Christian Puglisi, one of the two most notable chefs in Copenhagen, owns an empire of four establishments: Relæ, Manfreds, Bæst, and Mirabelle, a bakery. His founding story between Relæe and Manfreds (originally published in Fool Magazine) is a fun one, and worth a read.
And delighting nearly every palate, former Noma chef Rosio Sanchez, originally from Chicago and with Mexican roots, is upping the global taco game with her handmade tortillas and house made cheese, made with Danish milk and cheese cultures shipped in from Mexico. Her tacos are ridiculously good and unique in flavor.
Move that body: While you’re loading up on all the carbs from rye bread (rugbrød) and beer (øl), think about taking a jog or a dip in the ocean at Kastrup Søbad.
The Danes love their exercise. Jogging around The Lakes is popular, as is through the public park, Superkilen.
Danish design: Danes love usefulness, clean lines, minimal pigment, and natural materials. From wooden countertops and bathroom paneling, to slate and tile floors, brick and stone, the home is an expression of the natural resources of the region. As it gets dark early in the evening in the winter months, you’ll find the custom of large, round, warm sailing lamps in many establishments, especially low-hanging to emphasize contrast and focus on the activity at hand. Candles burn nearly everywhere. They provide warmth and the symbolism of energy, when all the world outside is oft grey, damp, and moody.
Sights: Rundetårn is a remarkable monument to explore. The round tower, dating to the 17th century, was built as an astronomical observatory. Most notable is its equestrian staircase — and one of the best views above the city.
A visit to the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, just 30 minutes north of the city by train, is a must.
Fashion: In terms of fashion, CPH is the capital for the sharpest in Scandinavian style. Home to brands like Norse Projects, Wood Wood, Henrik Vibskov, Dansk, Libertine Libertine, Mads Nørgaard, Won Hundred, and Samsøe & Samsøe, it is the Scandinavian capital to compose your look.
Hay House is a perennial must for lifestyle house and writing wares.
Where to stay: Airbnb is a great option for longer-term housing. If you want a place to simply crash for a few nights in style, I recommend the newly-opened boutique hotel, SP34, from the Brochner Group. They have a strong pillow game, and all of their furniture is custom.
In terms of neighborhoods to call home in central Copenhagen, Vesterbro is up and coming. Quiet, mainly residential, it is home to the Meatpacking District with a small handful of restaurants, galleries, and clubs. Dyrehaven is popular among Danes and expats alike. There are also a few co-working spaces clustering and a burgeoning tech scene in this neighborhood.
Adjacent is the town of Frederiksburg. Technically it’s a town surrounded by Copenhagen, but it’s literally in the middle of the city. Today the neighborhood is primarily residential, though it is home to a few great cafés and green spaces. One of the notable boulevards for taking in the scenery is Frederiksberg Allé.
Nørrebro is my preferred neighborhood, primarily due to its proximity to Christian Puglisi’s empire (Bæst, Mirabelle, Relæ, Manfred’s), Superkilen and the famous cemetery Assistens Kirkegården, the center of the city, and one of the best bars — The Barking Dog (and its accompanying shop which sells rare liquors by the 100g).
You, of course, have the city center, Københaven K. Tons of shopping, cafés, cobblestone streets, and palaces. Lastly, a few small neighborhoods linger to the east, namely Christianshavn, which encompasses a few smaller neighborhoods, including the rapidly evolving area where the future Noma will be located.
With the grey, brisk autumn days, you might fancy a coffee to keep you warm and awake. I recommend Coffee Collective, Enghave Kaffe, Democratic Coffee, and Koppi.

Having experienced the issue of connecting someone only to later find out their real age, I’ve always been a fan of this a film, which is a nuanced take on romance that explores maturity, emotions, love, social norms, human dynamics, traumas, and human development. It borderlines on problematic and creepy, but carefully treads that path in an artful and truthful way.
The primary dynamic is the relationship of Effy, from Copehagen, and William, who is an American trying to locate his Danish grandfather, who we later learn was a Nazi and a bad father.
This film does an excellent job of making it difficult to first know Effy’s age. She smokes and is first introduced working at a hotel, which an American could easily attribute to someone older than 14.
Considering the actress who played her was 20 at the time of filming, the character is believable as possibly older, but the actress also does a great job of channeling younger mannerisms and making her age ambiguous.

Nordic countries have many gems waiting for a hungry explorer to discover. The places which surprise though often lie in unexpected corners — food stalls in Reffen or Broens Gadekøkken, offering a taste of home origins of generations who migrated to Denmark decades ago, or refined restaurants which skilfully combine cooking and tradition. There is much more than Noma, Geranium, or Jordnær. For example, Michelin-Green-Starred restaurant ARK is by far my favourite vegetarian destination in the world (and here I mean all 38 countries I have travelled to).
This article is divided into four sections:
Copenhagen breakfast options are poor. If pastry for a morning bite is not enough and you are the type who needs a fulfilling meal in the morning, I have bad news for you.
Quality = money formula is incorporated in The Sixteen Twelves and Riviera, but the rest of the places — Ø12, Sonny, Darcy’s Kaffe, Atelier September, or Wulff & Konstali — are somewhat overpriced, standard in taste, indecently simple eateries.
Let’s start with the places I can genuinely recommend.
The Sixteen Twelves must be squeezed in every tourist’s tight schedule! The cafe serves comfort food, but the savour combinations can surprise even the pickiest foodies! For example, stracciatella and pickled rhubarb, or turmeric pickled egg and goat cheese, or brioche with salted and roasted coconut…Yummy! The drinks vary from mango lassi to turmeric latte so make sure to try one of those.
The demand is ridiculously high, so I recommend arriving at the opening or during the week.
Summary:
🌱 A few vegetarian options.⭐ 4/5 for interesting taste combos and iconic turmeric egg.💸 €20–30/ person
Riviera offers granola, toasts, summer salad, scrambled eggs, and many traditional Danish pastries such as tebirkes (remonse bun with poppy seeds) or kardemummabullar (cardamon bun). It is just good for its price. Scandinavian spacious interior with wooden tables and chairs is warm and welcoming, and there is a terrace for all resistant to cold.
Summary:
🌱 Plenty of vegetarian options.⭐ 4/5 for good quality of morning meals.💸 €20–30/ person
A bustling spot called Ø12 won’t be a local’s first choice, but if one is on lookout for a homelike breakfast and coffee, Ø12 checks all the boxes. I usually take the pancakes with fresh berries and vanilla cream, but there are other options such as avocado on sourdough bread, Benedict eggs, or oatmeal. Fresh juices taste excellent and brewed coffee is good as well. The food won’t leave anyone on a cloud nine but should at least satisfy one’s hunger.
Summary:
🌱 A few vegetarian options.⭐ 3/5 for a regular breakfast.💸 €20–30/ person
Atelier September closes the breakfast list. The food is rather standard in taste, and the portions are on the smaller side. If you suddenly find yourself in the city center and crave a quick familiar bite, this will do. The breakfast covers all the popular positions: pancakes with berries, avocado toast, yogurt with granola, eggs on bread, and so on.
Summary:
🌱 A few vegetarian options.⭐ 3/5 for a regular breakfast.💸 €7–30/ person
Probably one of the top-three restaurants in the world I have been so far is ARK. Vegan to its core, distinguished with a Michelin Green Star, ARK served the hellishly delicious tasting menu with the dish I will probably never forget — a vegan version of Chawanmushi.
As per the authentic Nordic philosophy, the restaurant strives for sustainability, and in my humble opinion, they are doing an amazing job! ARK has its own fungi farm, serves natural wines and creates its magic using only local ingredients!
Along with mentioned above Chawanmushi where egg was replaced with asparagus foam, I savoured burnt cabbage leaves with tomato, camomile, and red wine infusion, caviar made of black garlic seeds, peas and beans with Koji sauce and elderflower vinegar, and the most surprising dessert I have ever eaten — carrot creme patissiere with carrot pieces, coco crisps and rice paper soaked in Calvados and dill oil. I think before, I had never imagined that dill and carrot flavours marry so well together.
Summary:
🌱 100% vegan.⭐ 5/5 for making vegan food perfect.💸 €175 for a menu without wine/ non-alcoholic pairing
Bistro Lupa is a more affordable sister of ARK. It is a vegan restaurant with a won’t-remember-the-next-day interior, but excellent service and tasting menu. I strongly encourage you to add a serving of Lupa’s mushrooms once you embark on a tasting journey. Same as ARK’s, the core idea of the bistro is to use every piece, slice and crumb of ingredients in the dishes it serves. Fruits, vegetables, flowers, and herbs are being served together and each of the products opens up differently, depending on the combination. The amount of food on the tasting menu feels just right and if one goes for a la carte, five dishes for two people is sufficient (plus a portion of milk buns).
Summary:
🌱 100% vegan.⭐ 5/5 for making vegan food perfect.💸 €70 for a menu without wine/ non-alcoholic pairing
Aamanns 1921 is on the pricier side and offers traditional Scandinavian open-faced sandwiches. I was happy enough to have the opportunity to try one of those considered that original recipes always taste either fish or meat.
Two smørrebrøds make a perfect portion for one, and I tried a vegetarian, and a fish option — only to realise that smørrebrød is just not my cup of tea. Aamanns 1921 is worth a try, however, if meat and fish is what you like, head to Restaurant Schønnemann (book in advance!).
Summary:
🌱 3 vegetarian smørrebrøds.⭐ 3/5 for vegetarian options.💸 €40–50 for two smørrebrøds and a glass of wine.
There are many pizza places like Pizzeria Luca or Corsa pizza, but I prefer a place with a more nonchalant vibe — Flere Fugle. It is located in the underground neighbourhood Nordvest, and makes a good stop for lunch before taking a stroll along the rapidly developing area. Flere Fugle offers excellent coffee, but if you want to make an adventure out of the regular lunch time, go for coffee to Kaffedepartementet, and take a look at the The Library at Rentemestervej — a book heaven for kids :)
Summary:
🌱 A few vegetarian options.⭐ 5/5 for the chill vibe.💸 €19–25 for a pizza.
It is difficult to find a bad bakery in Copenhagen (with one exception mentioned in the ‘Eateries which are not there yet’ section). My top pastry shops are probably Skt. Peders Bageri, Flere Fugle, and Riviera. Depends on the area I am in when the sugar craving hits. First one is a go-to for pistachio cruffins, and traditional Danish pastries, last two are responsible for aromatic cardamon buns which are my favourite among all the pastries.
The traditional, the oldest, the Danish one — Skt. Peders Bageri. After a long dispute with a friend we concluded that the cardamon rolls they make are the tastiest in Copenhagen. I can also justify why a pistachio cruffin magically appears in my beg every time I pass the bakery (look for those between 10–13 every day as after 13 they disappear quickly).
💸 €5 for a bun.
Riviera is another decent pastry shop. What is nice about the bakery is that it is very spacious, making it a cozy place for snack and some reading. It also offers breakfasts for those who become hungry once they smell coffee :)
💸 €5 for a bun.
If you are on the hunt for traditional Danish desserts, Conditori La Glace is the right place! A wide range of cakes, candies, desserts, cookies and an excellent tea collection make La Glace a lovely place to sit, reflect, read a book and enjoy the treat (works only if one arrives before the tourists pour in). I always take Kartoffelkager which is best of all (you can get one of those in Sweet Valentine in Torvehallerne as well).
💸 €11 for a slice of cake.
Juno the bakery is a very mainstream bakery, targeted at tourists. Their cardamon rolls are indeed delicious, but not exceptional or different from Skt. Peders Bageri, Riviera or Flere Fugle. If you are on a curious side and strolling around Østerbro — go for it, but consider the lines in the morning and during lunchtime.
💸 €5 is what you will pay for a bun.
The beloved Copenhagen spot Hart Bageri (there are few around the city) makes the best cheesecake in town (and no one can convince me that it’s not true). Their crispy sourdough bread makes an impression as well.
💸 €14 for a slice of cheesecake and a coffee.
Another must-visit bakery is Andersen Bakery. They make sweets, candies, and desserts of all possible kinds. Here you can also grab a sandwich and sip a coffee in the sun.
💸 €14 for a slice of cheesecake and a coffee.
This is the pastry shop I visit every time I am in Copenhagen. Small, cozy, Leckerbaer reminds me of a doll house with doll-like cookies. It is slightly overpriced but serves as an excellent present.
💸 €19 for an 8-cookie box.
I tried a 5-course menu in Høst in June 2024, and to my disappointment I liked only one of the dishes. Even the surprise treats which Høst generously brought didn’t convince me. The food tasted just fine but not enough for that price.
The beetroot with raspberries and goat cheese had an interesting crispy texture and was quite tasty but the rest disappeared from my taste buds’ memory as soon as I left the restaurant. Considering the opinions on the internet, their pescatarian or meat menu is much better, so if one doesn’t have any preferences, Høst might be considered a place worth trying.
Summary:
🌱 Vegetarian 3 or 5-course menu.⭐ 3/5 for nice treats along the meals.💸 €70 for a menu without wine/ non-alcoholic pairing
If I were to describe Theo in two words, they would be salty and hard. I tried a smaller dish, which were potato gnocchi, and a main course — agnolotti with zucchini, lemon, and riccota. Both were quite similar in taste, and so salty, that it was difficult to taste each of the meal components (I didn't feel the sage at all, even though it has a strong flavour).
Summary:
🌱 A few vegetarian options with one vegetarian main dish.⭐ 2/5 for vegetarian options.💸 €50–70 for a la carte lunch.
A place in Torvehallerne called Il_mattarello serves basic pasta made on spot. The word ‘basic’ perfectly describes the pasta’s flavour, and I can reassure you there are better bistros for a pasta or a quick lunch.
Summary:
🌱 One or two vegetarian pastas.⭐ 2/5 for making their own pasta.💸 €20 for a pasta
Mexican street food chain Hija de Sanchez might provide delicious tacos with pork but tacos with kale were far from good. And I am not talking kale here. The meal was extremely greasy, and oil was almost the only flavour on my tongue.
Summary:
🌱 Vegetarian tacos as the only option.⭐ 2/5 for trying.💸 €15 for a portion of three.
Regarding the bakeries I didn’t like. Albatross & Venner in Torvehallerne left me unimpressed. It is definitely not the place to look for Danish pastries.
Regarding the breakfast eateries I didn’t like. Sonny, Darcy’s Kaffe, and Wulff & Konstali are overpriced and not worth your time. The portions often aren’t big enough and should be called snacks instead.
I am always on the lookout for new places, so this story is being updated on a regular basis :)

Just a day after landing back in UK, I was going off to Copenhagen for the family trip! Mom was flying off in the morning due to her flight being booked way before mine, and it being Norwegian airlines. Thus, she left by 6.45am and landed in Copenhagen airport at around 1pm. We booked the Zleep Hotel Copenhagen Arena, which was about 2 metro stops away from the airport. She took the train from the airport to ørestad station, then walked a few minutes to the hotel. It was a budget hotel — no kettle, coffee maker etc, just a shower with a 2-in-1 shower gel/shampoo, and a little study desk by the side near the windows. Very sparse and minimalistic, but suitable for just an overnight stay.
My flight was with RyanAir at 1855, so right after I cooked lunch and did my last minute checks, I left for Victoria station, carrying my backpack and duffel bag. I packed dinner already, so I wouldn’t have to buy expensive airport food. I took the Victoria line to Tottenham Hale station, whereby I then took the Stansted Express to Stansted airport. It was a pretty long journey — 1.5hrs in total, but quite smooth. It was crowded, as expected, since it’s the summer holidays and people are just taking this opportunity to travel again. I reached the airport around 3.45pm, and started queuing for check-in. It was crazy crowded and the queue moved so slowly, since there were tons of people and families travelling. After an hour’s worth of queuing and holding my pee, I finally reached the counter to check in and print my boarding pass. Heng I could sneak in my duffel bag! :P I then proceeded to the security departure area, which again was crowded but managed to get through it in good time. I was done by 1705, so I headed to Joe & The Juice to grab a table and eat my dinner. After that, I waited at the sitting area to just while away my time till it was time for the gate to be announced.
I waited… and waited… and waited until 1830, and I got really worried then — the gate hasn’t been announced yet and it was almost flight time. I went to the information counter, and the girl informed us that the flight had been delayed to 2130! Holy shit, that was another 2 hours wait in that goddamned airport! I felt awful — I was still jetlagged and really tired by then, and was getting a little hungry too. Plus, it was so inconvenient to drink water cause I’d have to lug all my stuff with me every time I went to the toilet, so I tried not to drink too much but was really thirsty. I read my ebook, then watched 2 episodes of “The Office” to try and kill time while saving my phone batteries. Finally, they announced the gate at 2030, and I walked to gate 42. It was a full flight, and lots of people were also tired like me. I queued in the non-priority lane, and finally boarded at the front of the plane since my seat was 12C. We had to wait in the drizzling rain whilst they slowly got us from the airport building, along the tarmac and up into the plane. God, I was so tired. We only departed at around 10pm, and landed at 11.30pm. I slept for the whole flight, but was still tired anyway. I was supposed to make my way to the Zleep hotel myself like Mom did, but since my flight got delayed and it was midnight by the time I’d make it through immigration customs, Mom kindly waited for me at the airport. Good thing too — the metro stopped at midnight, and the trains would only come every hourly. Hence, after walking from T2 to the customs, we took a cab to the hotel. It was really expensive to take a cab — 200DKK which was around 40SGD. Jesus christ. Stuff here is crazy expensive. Anyway, once I got to the room 529, I dumped my stuff, took a shower and started charging my phones. Slept and woke up at 6am.
Woke up early, probably due to being slightly jetlagged. Did some stretching and stuff, then headed down with Mom for a cuppa tea and coffee for her. Their Rooibos tea was really nice — so I had a 2–3 cups of it. We then walked around the outside area, passing by Burger King and Fields (supposed to be the largest shopping mall), before Papa arrived at around 8+am where he would meet us at the hotel. After he dumped his stuff in the room, took a shower, we walked to the Orestad station and took the metro to Christianshavn station, then took bus 2A to the Refshaleøen (Refshalevej) area, whereby we would be able to find the Grønt Marked. Refshaleøen is an old industrial area, home to huge shipyards and wastewater treatment plants. The Grønt Marked is a non-profit farmers market organisation in Copenhagen, with small individual farmers selling home-grown, local, fresh and seasonal produce such as kale, tomatoes, berries and potatoes. They even sold honey schnapps! They appear in different parts of Copenhagen depending on which Sunday it is, so since we’re here on the 1st Sunday, it’s located at Refshaleøen, the original location of the market’s beginnings. There were a few other visitors as well, and lots of them were queueing up to buy food from Lille Bakery, which was located at the end of the market. Whilst Mom and Papa bought their breakfast pastries — mushroom roll, jam cookie, berliner (some kind of sugared donut), and black coffee — I went to buy my tomatoes and blackberries. We left by 10.30am to catch the 2A bus back to Christianhavn, and walked around the area. We strolled along the canal, seeing lots of yachts and boathouses, as well as stopping by the Bolia showroom. Bolia’s stuff is really nice — typical minimalistic yet beautiful Scandinavian style furniture and decor, lots of beige and earthy tones, wool and ceramic materials used. We walked until around 11.30pm, then slowly turned back to make our way back to the hotel to pick up our luggage and head for lunch at Ciao Pasta, which was located near our apartment. We decided to go for lunch first, since we could only check into the apartment at 1pm. However, by the time we took the train and walked to the apartment, it was already 1pm. It was located at Gasværksvej 11, Ground floor, København 1656. Kinda old looking and when we arrived the cleaning lady was still there. There were 3 separate bedrooms, 1 big open concept kitchen, a living room and 1 toilet to share. There were basic amenities like cooking utensils, cups and bowls, and a little utility closet off to the side of the kitchen (vacuum, more soap, random stuff all dumped there). In the toilet, it was really spartan looking — just 1 toilet right beside the sink, opposite was a Miel washing machine and dryer on top, the tiled shower on the right. We just dumped our stuff, then tried to figure out how to get the door key, cause I realised that we needed one to be able to get back in. We spent a good 10–15mins trying and calling for help, but no answer. Our saviour came in the form of an upstairs neighbour who heard our troubles, and solved the issue by figuring out that the key to the door was in the lockbox, and that the lockbox code wasn’t to unlock the door, which we had thought to be so. Thus, we were saved and could finally go for lunch. Well, more of Mom and I going and then Mom dabaoing back lunch, since Kai had landed and Papa wanted to meet him to make sure he got to the apartment cause Kai is useless that way. Mom got the meat lovers pasta for them and herself the veggie loves, whilst I had my special order of the ciao lovers pasta with garlic, chili and added vegetables. The pasta was tortellini with some truffle filling, but I mostly ate the filling and veg cause the pasta was too much. Papa of course was pissed off with the whole apartment, making the usual black face and cursing his head off. Mom of course, felt awful and tried to convince him to go to ah hotel instead, but alas, no. How unfortunate.
Anyway, after I finished lunch, I headed to the nearby supermarket, Superbrugsen, to get some body soap (apartment only had shampoo and bar soap), salad, yoghurt (they only had skyr but same same), and some strawberries. Made it back only by 3+pm, and boy did everyone’s faces look like shit. It was drizzling by then, so the cloudy weather didn’t make anything better. I ate some yoghurt and berries, then after resting a bit, decided to go out and explore some more. Might as well see as much as I could instead of wasting the time away cooped up in the apartment with angry men. I walked towards the Palads Cinema, which was really pink and blocky. The Palads Cinema first opened its doors to the public more than 100 years ago in 1912. At the time, it was located in the former central railway station which had ceased operation a year prior. The cinema was extensively renovated in 1955 and was further updated in the 1970s. In 1989 the cinema received its signature coat of paint which itself attracts thousands of visitors every year. I then walked past the Axel Towers, which was designed by Danish architect Lene Tranberg and opened in 2017. Very modern looking, consisting of five interconnected towers, the tallest of which reaches a height of 61 meters. Whilst walking along the streets, I noticed how clean they were, and also how few rubbish bins were out — it was like Japan where they expected you to keep your trash with you and not litter. There were also lots of Burger King’s and 7-Eleven — their 7-Eleven was very fancy, almost like an M&S in the train stations back in UK kind of fancy. I walked past a Warhammer store and an Animerch store too, which sold little anime trinkets like keychains and soft toys. There was a Hard Rock Cafe too, which was my toilet stop. After the Palads cinema, I passed by the Wallmans Cirkusbygingen, which hosted cabaret acts and dancing. I then proceeded onwards to the City Hall Square, aka Radhuspladsen, and saw the Copenhagen City Hall. Just a very grand looking building, first opened in 1905. t was designed by Danish architect Martin Nyrop who drew inspiration from Siena City Hall and put elements of the Italian style in a Danish context. I passed by the Tivoli Gardens, but didn’t go in since family wanted to go there tomorrow or after. As I walked along the streets of Indre By, there was a Mentos promotion going on, with sales people just giving out free mini bottles of Mentol chewing gum. After a few minutes walk — all of these destinations were within 10–15minutes walking distance of each other — I ended up at Nytorv and Gammeltorv, 2 adjoining squares in the city. Gammeltorv is the oldest square in Copenhagen, dating back to the city’s foundation in the 12th century. Its most distinguishable feature is the Caritas Fountain, the oldest fountain in Copenhagen. Nytorv was created by King Christian IV and is located just to the other side of the former city hall. This old city hall, however, burned down in 1795 and was rebuilt in a different location on Nytorv. I then walked to the Church of Our Lady (Vor Frue Kirke), the city’s most important church and also known as Copenhagen Cathedral. The original church was built soon after the city’s foundation in the 12th century, but fell victim to a devastating fire in the early 14th century. The building has Neo-Classical architecture, and the inside was a large vaulted domed ceiling with lots of columnades at its sides. It was quiet and peaceful, and the white colours of the inside was soothing to the eye. I left the church and walked towards the Round Tower (Rundetaarn). It was this really tall brick tower that was erected in the 17th century under Christian IV, and functions as an astronomical observatory. You could pay to go inside the tower and see stuff, but seeing how boring the brochure looked, plus with a time limit (I had a dinner booking at 1730, and it was already 1630), I decided to make a slow journey back in the drizzle. Yup, still drizzling and cloudy and windy. I passed by Skindergrade Gyde along the way back, which was just a bunch of colourful old looking houses. I made a short stop to see the nearby supermarket Irma, which was much closer to our apartment and sold the skyr yogurt which I’m eating here, Thise. I reached back by around 1715, dropped off my backpack and charged my phone, then headed out again with mom for my dinner booking at Maple Casual Dining. I had pre-ordered the chicken thighs with asparagus instead of the potatoes, and the chef made an alternative sauce of olive oil, herbs and sliced chili. Really tasty, though kind of oily. Oh well. I ordered an extra bowl of veg (broccolini, green beans and asparagus), and it was really good. Mom accompanied me by ordering their mixed berries Nordic sorbet, but the sorbet looked more like ice cream, and her dessert came with these cocoa looking cereal. Of course, to appease Mom, I went back and ate more yoghurt. They were heading out for dinner with Kit and Emily at some other Restaurant Puk at 1930, so left by 1900. I had my shower and then tea afterwards, and just chilled and wind down. Ah, so peaceful without the angry men. I wish they’d just go and stay at a hotel rather than try to live with this and make everyone unhappy. I’m just really sad Mom has to deal with all their unhappiness and cursing, despite planning everything as best she could and scrambling after the funeral happenings. Also, such a waste that she couldn’t come on my little exploration today to see the sights despite the cloudy weather, cause the next few days are forecast to be rainy as well.
After their dinner, Kit and Emily are coming to the apartment to eat durian, so there goes the post-dinner peace and quiet, plus having to smell durian the whole night probably. Also, with only a single toilet to share, one can only pray that Papa doesn’t clog the toilet and that the windows can air it out enough.
Woke up at 5am, then tried to sleep more till 5.15am but couldn’t so just got up and made tea. It was sort of light by then, and there were some people on the street. Alas, it was still drizzling a little bit, so I’m not sure what the plan is for today. Did my usual wake up warm-ups, and hydrated. The Jing green tea and black tea Mom gave me was kinda light, not very strong flavour — oh well. Anyway, Mom got up at around 6am, then after washing up, we re-explored the utilities room and found: body wash, more body wash, and a ton of bin bags. So we actually didn’t have to buy body soap yesterday… dang it. So we decided to use the body soap provided as hand soap instead in the toilet, and the little body wash bottles as hand soap in the kitchen. Yesterday night Kit and Emily didn’t come over for durian as they said they were too full from dinner, and would come over tonight instead. So while waiting for stuff to open, I decided to just read and then drink more water and tea before heading out.
Mom and I left around 7.30am to head out for our morning journey, since Kai and Papa were not up for it and still sleeping, respectively. We walked to the København H metro station, then took the M4 train to Marmorkirken stop. I bought my Copenhagen City card which allowed us to ride all the public transport and access all the different attractions/museums in the city for different duration of times — 48hrs, 96hrs, 120hrs etc. So after getting off at our stop, we actually realised that right outside the station was Frederik’s Church, aka the Marble Church. It’s best known for its outstanding rococo interiors and its striking dome which dominates the cityscape. It was drizzling and really windy, but still manageable. We walked past Khmer Cuisine, a SPAR grocery store, and even a Michelin/Chaine restaurant Bistro Boheme. On our way to the Kastellet, we walked past the Churchill park, then crossed the Kastellet Bridge to enter the area proper. Also known as the Citadel, it is a star-shaped fortress that was once a crucial part of the city’s defense system. Although it is still under the command of the Danish Armed Forces today, it is also a popular recreational space for the locals — there were still people jogging and walking their dogs, even in the grey weather! The barracks were a nice brick red colour. After that, we made our way to the Little Mermaid statue, and on the way saw the Søfartsmonumentet, which is a huge statue dedicated to civilian Danish sailors who have lost their lives during WWI. The Little Mermaid statue was kind of small, being only 1.25m tall and just parked right in the middle of the sea. It was unveiled on 23 August 1913, presented by Danish brewer Carl Jacobsen as a gift to the City of Copenhagen. The sculpture is made of bronze and granite, and inspired by the Hans Christian Andersen’s fairytale of the same name, “Den Lille Havfrue” (The Little Mermaid). Carl Jacobsen fell in love with the character after watching a ballet performance based on the fairytale at the Royal Danish Theatre, so much so that he commissioned the sculptor Edvard Eriksen to create the sculpture of the mermaid. Fun fact: Erikson’s wife, Eline Eriksen, actually posed for the statue! After that, we walked a little further to find the Gefion Fountain, which is a huge fountain donated to the city by the Carlsberg Foundation, depicting the Norse goddess Gefjon driving a wagon pulled by oxen. According to legend, it was Gefjon who plowed the Danish island of Zealand out of Sweden. The Swedish king Gylfe supposedly offered her as much land as she could plow out within a day and a night. In order to accomplish this crazy challenge, Gefjon transformed her sons into oxen, which are seen pulling the plow. Just off to the side is the St. Alban’s Church (English Church), which was currently under restoration works. It was built in the late 19th century in a distinct British Gothic Revival style (aka Victorian style). The church has served the British-Anglican community in Copenhagen ever since and is one of the few churches with services in English today. It’s quite a beautiful structure, just a shame that we couldn’t go inside today. Since we finished seeing the few main sites in the area — and all within an hour! — we decided to head back to the apartment. After taking the train back to the København H metro station, I bought a squash and some fresh tomatoes from the outside grocer. Mom went to the train station to buy some coffee and pastries for breakfast for her and the angry men from Lagkagehuset — 1 espresso, 1 cappuccino, 1 raspberry swirl, 1 chocolate cinnamon swirl, 1 bread thing and 1 almond croissant. We then walked back and got back around 9.30am. After that, it was kind of chill time till they finally decide what to do — mostly the plan is to do indoors stuff as it’s drizzly and gloomy weather. Anyway, there was a lot of mixed up planning for where to go and etc after they finished breakfast, and there was a scramble for me to book another lunch for 6 at 1230pm at Restaurant Havfruen, which I was going for lunch to at today.
Anyway, we ultimately decided to head to the Amalienborg Palace, which is the residence of the Danish royal family since the 18th Century, after the original residence of the royal family — Christianborg Palace — burned down. Parts of the palace are open to the public, while others are reserved exclusively for the royal family. Whether any of them are at home is indicated by the flags hoisted at the palace or the changing of the guards. It was really drizzly and windy when we headed out, and waiting for bus 23 was quite miserable as there was no shelter. We took the bus to the Odd Fellow Palæet stop, then walked a short distance to enter the Palace. We were in time for the changing of the guards too, which was like that in Buckingham Palace. After that, we went to see the inside of one of the buildings available for viewing, and it was quite a short tour — only 2 levels, and just some old furniture and paintings to see. The museum shop was also really small — I got a bunch of postcards and a diorama of the palace, whilst mom got a bunch of fridge magnets. After that, mom and I left first for lunch, which was booked at 1230, but by the time we walked there it was already 1pm. Kai and Papa would settle their own lunch and meet us back at the Frederik’s Church after lunch, where we would go inside to see the interior. On the way to Restaurant Havfruen, we passed by Nyhavn, which was just a row of colourful buildings located along the harbour. We passed by the Royal Danish Playhouse as well, which is this really modern blocky looking building. It’s a mix of brick, stainless steel and glass, with some parts of the building hovering over the water and supported by Venetian-style crooked columns. The restaurant was quite small, and packed. I had already pre-ordered my baked salmon with asparagus, whilst Mom had the fish and chips. The food came relatively fast, and just in time too, cause shortly after we ordered there came a big group of 12 angmohs, American I think from their accent. The food was quite delicious, and while waiting to be served, I ate my blackberries, strawberries and tomatoes. After we finished lunch, I was still a little hungry, and wanted to eat my yoghurt but alas, it was back at the apartment. We strolled back to the church, passing by a little souvenir shop where Mom bought more magnets. We waited for Kai and Papa inside the church, and they finally arrived at 2.35pm. After a short look inside, which wasn’t very impressive unfortunately, we took the metro back to our apartment. Kai and Papa decided to go see the War Museum, so thank god it was only Mom and I. We went back and I got to eat more yoghurt to fill up a little, then we took the bus to Strøget, which was their version of Orchard Road. Not very impressive — just small versions of branded shops like Gucci, LV, COS etc. We also went into their shopping mall, Illum, but also quite chiam lah. We walked on a little further, and saw the Helligaands Kirken on the way to the metro. We then dropped by Lidl for me to buy dinner vegetables — kale, zucchini, red onions and edamame. And we made it back just in time before the guys got back. Mom kindly helped me chop my stuff up and then we just boiled everything in a pot. Ate dinner around 6pm, then waited until they left before showering and having some tea. They had dinner at nearby Ristorante Buono, which I had actually looked up for food but they didn’t reply my email. I planned tomorrow’s activities with Mom before she left for dinner, so she could discuss it with the rest of them during dinnertime. At least by the time they left for dinner, it had stopped raining and seemed ok. They came back around 9pm, and then ate the durian that Papa brought. Emily seemed ok, and it was nice to chat with her again. We discussed tomorrow’s plan, which was thankfully free and easy, just to meet at 5.30pm at Noma. Then, lo and behold, the neighbours smelled the durian smell and reported it to the fire station as a suspected gas leak. So there came 2 firetrucks, and the firemen came into our flat to investigate a gas leak. My god. REAL FIREMEN! IN THEIR SUITS AND EVERYTHING WITH THE TRUCKS!
Holy jesus. They came into and out of the apartment several times, carrying their carbon monoxide detector and trying to find the source of the “leak”. Oh boy, was Kai so pissed off. Mom opened the windows to try and air the flat out so the scent wouldn’t linger, and bagged up the trash for disposal tomorrow. I’m not sure what time they left by, cause I went to sleep first.
Woke up at 5.40am, and surprisingly Papa was awake too — or maybe not so surprising, since he has jet lag too, and worse than us. the day is gloomy but dry, which is at least 1 blessing there. Had my usual tea, and just read and started to revise a little about my case discussion for the PEG interview with Papa. Sian — the more I revise, and when discussing with him, the more stress and worried I get. And this is in addition to the OSCE retake I have to also prepare for once I get back from Copenhagen. Stress, stress stress. Waiting for Mom to wake up before I can finally move out and start walking to Nyboder, which is a block of red, orange and yellow coloured buildings, and people still live there too! They once served as the homes of Danish sailors and their families, and were barracks under the command of the Danish Navy. Eventually, 8am came around and Mom still wasn’t awake, so I decided to head off first and let her sleep in. I changed and walked to Nyboder, taking a straight route through Strøget, seeing the different stores and eateries along the way. It wasn’t rainy but crazy gusty today, and the wind was so strong that you had moments of just standing still trying to keep upright. Along the way, I saw a few wall murals that were quite nice, but incomparable to those in Argentina. I saw the houses in Nyboder, and I guess they were quite pretty, but nothing very impressive. Walked till the end of the block, whereby I saw the statue of Christian IV. I also saw a Jewish church nearby. I then began walking towards the Botanical Gardens, and passed by the SMK Museum at the same time. The gloomy clouds were beginning to clear a little, such that there was some sunshine coming through — makes all the difference man. The garden was ok — I was never really into all the plants and stuff, and it was too early for the Palm house to be open (most things open at 10am here). Mom finally woke up by 9am, so she called and we agreed to meet at the gardens. After seeing some of the sights, we walked to the nearby Museum of Natural History, which was part of the University of Copenhagen, where they were showcasing two special exhibitions: Monkeys — A Primate Story and the Wildlife Photographer of The Year. They also had a mineral exhibition going on, but we skipped that cause it was just looking at rocks and stones. The photography exhibition had a few different categories to look at, and the showcase was for the year’s 100 best images. They were really beautiful and so HD to look at. It was quite a short exhibit, so we finished it pretty fast. We then went to the museum shop, where I got this hand-sewn lion plushie thing, whilst Mom got some mineral stones. Before heading to the Rosenberg castle, we stopped by at a nearby coffee shop, Espresso House, so that Mom could get herself some breakfast. She ordered a cappucino, and had a cinnamon roll and a cinnamon-cardamom bun to go. After that, we went to the Rosenberg Castle, built in the early 1600s and one of Christian IV’s architectural projects. The castle contains Denmark’s crown jewels, and outside was the King’s Garden (Kongens Have), which has been open to the public since 1770. We toured the whole castle, seeing the many paintings and furniture they had — they even had a fancy toilet that was all tiles! Lots of gold stuff, ivory dioramas and handicrafts, plus fancy weaponry like muskets that were inlaid with mother-of-pearl engravings and decorations. The basement levels housed the crown and the more precious items, but beyond that, that was it. So far, all the palaces are pretty ok, not as impressive as I’d thought they’d be. After that, we headed back to the apartment for lunchtime, or at least for my lunch. I stopped by the Coop 365 discount supermarket and bought 2 more boxes of strawberries (they were really sweet!), and a Skyr yoghurt cause I was running out. Cooked the same meal as last night’s dinner — onions, zucchini, squash, tomatoes, kale. Mom had 1/3 of her bun for lunch, as she wanted to save her stomach for tonight’s Noma dinner. Basically everyone but me was saving their stomach for Noma. We finished lunch around 2pm, then left around 30mins later to go to Nyhavn to walk a bit due to the good weather, which would eventually lead us to Kongens Nytorv.
We took the bus to Nyhavn, and it passed by the Royal Library (Det Kongelige Bibliotek), which is the national library and one of the largest libraries in the world. We also passed by BLOX, which is this really modern building that was recently built in 2018 and houses the Danish Architecture Center. Lots of glass and concrete, steel beams. Walking towards Kongens Nytorv, which is the largest square in Copenhagen, which was laid out in the 17th century by King Christian V. After its completion, several notable buildings were erected around the square. To the south lies the Royal Danish Theatre from 1874; to the east Charlottenborg Palace; to the west Hotel D’Angleterre and Magasin du Nord department store; and to the north Thott Palace. In the centre of the square is an equestrian statue of the king himself. After that, we walked towards Agnete and the Merman, which is a collection of bronze statues submerged in one of the city’s numerous canals. They depict a merman and his seven sons, urging his daughter Agnete to return to them. This was done by Danish sculptor Suste Bonnen, who was inspired by a traditional Danish folk story “Agnete og Havmanden”. When we went, it was barely visible in the waters, so I felt kind of cheated… Along the way, we passed by the Charlottenborg Palace, which was originally constructed in the 17th century as a city palace for the half-brother of King Christian V. Since 1754, it has served as the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, and also houses the art gallery Kunsthal Charlottenborg. The building boasts a Dutch Baroque style with Italian influences.
Our last stop before heading to Freetown Christiana was Holmens Bro — a bridge which is one of the 9 bridges connecting the island of Slotsholmen with the rest of Copenhagen. Nearby lies the Holmens Kirke (Church of Holmen), first built as an anchor forge in the 16th century but was converted into a church by King Christian IV in the early 17th century. We walked to Freetown Christiana, which is an autonomous district of Copenhagen that openly sells weed and cannabis. In 1971, a group of hippies broke down the barricades and began squatting there. Nowadays, approximately 900 people live in the area, comprising a community that has its own rules and regulations completely independent of the Danish government. They also have restaurants and cafes there, like the Sunshine bakery and Cafe Loppen. We walked around taking pictures of the colourful murals, but made sure to respect the online rule of not taking pictures of the drug dealers or anyone. When we were there, the scnet of weed as so strong — choking, almost. There was also a police raid happening at the same time, so we left to avoid any trouble. I wasn’t afraid per se, since it was still daylight and there were other tourists and families around, but definitely wary of the environment since it was drugs and weed all around. Nice murals, but Argentina’s are way more colourful and expressive. We backtracked to the entrance, then went to the nearby hotel for a toilet break before heading to Noma for dinner at 5pm. We actually passed by Kit and Emily on the way to the hotel, and they had just finished their canal tour and were going to see the Freetown now. We took the bus 2A to Margretheholm (Refshalevej) stop, and walked a little bit to reach Noma, which was recognisable by the bunch of greenhouses. There were other guests already there too, waiting for their dinner to begin. Papa and Kai had been there since around 4.30pm, and were just waiting for the rest of us to arrive. It was really windy out still, but at least sunny-ish. There was a greenhouse where they grew all their herbs and flowers, which would be harvested and used in tonight’s Vegetable Season dinner. After we all arrived, they brought us to our table and began the dinner — 12–13 dishes with 2 desserts, accompanied by a mix of non-alcoholic juices and tea (you could choose the alcoholic option too). It was beautiful and simple, and the tastes of the food prepared was exceptional. Small portions but very flavourful, lots of that tangy and sourish element incorporated into the dishes. They used a lot of fresh produce, such as oyster mushrooms, flowers, zucchini flowers. Each dish had a drink paired with it for either 1–2 courses. Dessert was a special “onigiri” — ice cream shaped into the triangular shape wrapped in a blueberry leather, and a dish of berries with this delicious almond-tasting sauce. Also, a piece of chocolate with a bunch of flowers on it. Yes, the first time in the past few years that I’ve decided to let myself eat dessert. Who cares about it tonight — Papa paid a hefty 700SGD for this, so I’m not gonna waste it. Plus, it’s a sign from Gonggong that the whole family was supposed to come for this dinner, so I will not let him down. I really enjoyed the dinner, and I think everyone else was impressed too. However, Kai and Kit were obviously still hungry, with Kai searching for dinner options to eat afterwards. But by the time we ended, it was already 9.30pm, so a lot of places have closed for the night except some burger places which Kai was too lazy to go and dabao from. After we finished dinner, we had some tea and then got the opportunity to tour the kitchen area. We got to see their fermenting area, which was like a science lab with some chim looking tools, and their huge buckets of kombucha and fermented items, like lupin and oyster mushroom fermented solutions. They cleaned up and closed shop by 9pm, with some of the staff sitting at the staff canteen polishing the silverware and tidying things up. During dinner, we discussed tomorrow’s plan, and eventually settled on leaving it free and easy again — Kit, Emily and Kai were planning to go to the aquarium in the morning, whilst Mom and I planned on seeing the Christianborg Palace in the morning, then afternoon going to see the SMK Art musem and Torvehallerne. We all took a cab back, as it was already dark out and got back to the apartment by 10pm. Kai didn’t want to go out to buy food, so decided to be hungry and sleep. Poor Kai, he should’ve eaten some lunch :/
Happy National Day! Can’t believe we’re celebrating it, or not really, here in Copenhagen with its gloomy skies and rainy days. Woke up at 5.30am as usual, but just a little tired, not too much. Did my usual warm up activities and tea, then did some Googling to see what could be open. Ultimately, I saw that the zoo was open at 9am, and was just a 30min walk from our apartment. So my plan was to go the nearby park at 8am, walk and chill until 9am, then see the zoo stuff till whatever time. I didn’t intend to eat lunch today, but an early dinner, so will just go straight from the zoo to the Glypotek museum, since Kit wanted to go there in the morning and meet Mom. Then, I probably will head to the Christianborg Palace, followed by the Medicine Museum and Design museum, seeing how the timing goes. We left for the Søndermarken shortly after 7.45am, taking a slow stroll in the drizzle and strong winds. The Søndermarken is one of Denmark’s oldest palace gardens, and is part of the gardens surrounding Frederiksberg Palace. At the end of the 18th century, Søndermarken was redesigned as a romantic landscape garden with meandering paths, allowing access to the Norwegian House, The Cisterns and the Chinese Pavilion. You could even get a view of the elephants in the Copenhagen Zoo! We walked along the paths and saw the Frederiksberg Palace, a yellow stately building, then continued onwards to the Chinese Pavilion. It was just a small little pavilion, quite cute. Mom realised her shoe was coming apart due to the rain, so we decided to go to a nearby cafe to warm up and rest a little. We walked out of the park and to a nearby cafe, Thiemers Kaffebar — very aesthetic and bookish, nice and small. Mom ordered a cappucino and ate a bit of her muffin thing from yesterday. We sat there for a while, then when it was around 8.50am, we left to take a slow walk to the Copenhagen zoo. It was pretty empty since we were the first few stragglers in at the moment of opening, and so we had free rein of the place. We decided to just make a loop around the area, and we managed to see the lions, tigers, elephants, penguins, seals etc. Most of the animals were hiding in shelter due to the crappy weather — poor guys, having to deal with this kind of climate. I saw a claw machine — 25DKK for a chance to win! The soft toys inside were monkey and tiger plushies, whereas the plushies in the out-of-order machine at the Elephant House had red pandas and elephants. Well, losers can’t be choosers! We didn’t have any coins with us, so I went to change a 100DKK into 20DKK coins to play. Upon my first try, I managed to get the claw to grab not only one, but two monkey plushies! :D First time I’ve ever been so lucky on the claw machine in my life! After that, we just finished up at the museum shop, and then left for the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek.
Mom had arranged for us to meet Kit and Emily there, but apparently Emily as busy working in the morning so they missed it completely. We took bus 7A from the Zoologisk Have stop to Hovedbanegården, Tivoli stop, then walked a little to reach the museum. The Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek is one of the most famous art museums in Copenhagen, primarily exhibiting sculpture from Ancient Rome, Greece and Egypt, in addition to showcasing a wide collection of Danish and French art. The founder is Carl Jacobsen. The permanent exhibitions were:
Then there were the special exhibits:
It was quite small for the special exhibits, and the other ones were just huge rooms full of sculptures and paintings, that my mind went numb after a few rooms. Nope, can’t do art for too long. I managed to finish it within 2 hours, and we actually met up with Kai and Papa there. The museum shop wasn’t very impressive too, so quite a letdown for Mom especially. Since I wasn’t having lunch with them, and wanted to go back for tea instead, I left first at around 12.05pm to take the bus back to our apartment. They would be having lunch at Restaurant Havfruen at Nyhavn, then I’m not sure what their afternoon plans are. For myself, I took the bus in the wrong direction for 1 stop, then swapped direction and got back by 1230pm. Had some warm tea and water, and updated the blog and read my emails.
After resting a little, I headed out to the Christianborg Palace. Unfortunately, it was still drizzling and cold, but whatever. Took the bus there and walked a little to enter the castle. Being blur, I queued up to go up and see the Tower, which would provide a view over Slotsholmen. I took the lift up to the top, but the view was ok, nothing special or wow. I guess the weather also kind of destroyed the opportunity to take a nice city view. After that, I found the right entrance to enter the palace, and toured the Royal Reception Rooms (Great Hall, Queen’s tapestries). The tapestries were really beautiful and vibrant, and it is said that these tapestries were made to mark the occasion of Her Majesty Queen Margrethe II’s 50th birthday in 1990, by ordering a gift of 11 tapestries. Bjørn Nørgaard painted the full-size sketches upon which the tapestries were woven, and they depict 1000 years of Danish history. I considered going to the ruins, but saw that it was a long queue, and it was almost 3pm. The Medicine museum closed at 4pm, so I took the M3/M4 to the Marmorkirken station and walked to the museum. It was quite small, and I finished it within 10 mins — nothing very good to see, all old stuff and quite terrible honestly. Along the way I passed by a 19th Century Russian Orthodox church, Skt Aleksander Nevskij Kirke, and a random small Roman church. A short walk away was the Design museum, and the queue was super long so I decided to just go to the gift shop and buy Mom a magnet. Mom they all met for lunch and had a seafood platter to share, but Kit and Emily left first cause they had a booking at the Rosenberg Castle. Mom, Papa and Kai then had dessert at the nearby Vaffelbageren Nyhavn, where they had churros with Bailey’s ice cream and some softserve too. They then walked along the Nyhavn canal and also to Strøget, before taking the bus back. I dropped by the 365 discount store near the Marmorkirken station, getting zucchini and pumpkin and skyr before heading back. So coincidentally, they got back just a few minutes before I did!
The moment I got back, I just dropped off my stuff and started prepping with Mom for dinner, eating my yoghurt and strawberries whilst waiting. I’m quite proud of myself for accomplishing so many destinations today, alone too! Of course, I wish Mom could’ve been there with me to see the sights, but oh well. Had dinner and finished by 1730, while everyone else went to nap before dinner. Tonight, they’re going to that Michelin place Bistro Boheme for a 1915 dinner. Hopefully it’s nice. Meanwhile, I will chill and slowly warm up at the apartment — I think I’ve done enough outdoor walking for today.
Man, I was really tired yesterday night — must be from all that walking, plus falling on my left knee yesterday at the zoo. I lay in bed just as they got home from dinner — Mom said the portions were good size, but food was so-so. Oh well. Usual wake up routine, and everyone else got up at around 7+am. We were going to the Kronborg castle this morning, to try and beat the hordes of tourists that would be sure to come later in the day. We would be meeting Kit and Emily at the Kobenhavn Hovedb. station and take the RE train to Helsingør station, where we would still have to walk a little bit to get to the castle itself. Today’s weather looks better — not raining, but still cool and windy. Fingers crossed it gets warmer and slightly sunnier as predicted by the weather report. We left by 8.30am to get to the station where we got the 8.42am train to Helsingør. It was around an hour’s journey there, and not much to see along the way. Kai was rather unhappy at the rush, cause he didn’t manage to get his breakfast. When we reached, it was kind of gloomy, and I found a cafe for Kai to get some food in before we went to the castle. The nearby Cafe Karisma was very quaint and nice, very coffeeshop vibes — Papa had an apple pie and hot chocolate with whipped cream, Kai had the spicy chicken sandwich and a cuppacino. We decided to wait for Kit and Emily at the cafe and then together we go to the castle. Whilst they were eating their breakfast, I decided to walk around the old town streets of Helsingør, seeing a few of the sights. It began to drizzle a little whilst I was walking the streets.
The first stop I had was to see St. Olaf’s Church, which was situated on the same spot where the city’s first church was built over 800 years ago. St. Olaf’s Church got its present look back in 1559, and it could therefore celebrate its 450th anniversary in 2009. The oldest parts of the church wall, however, are from the 13th century. The first church was established here on what was once the beach of the castle at the time, Drekrog, before Kronborg was built over it. The church takes its name from its guardian saint, the Norwegian Viking king and national saint, Olaf the Holy, who managed to both unify and Christianise Norway. When Erik of Pomerania began collecting the Sound Dues, St. Olaf’s Church underwent a transformation. The church had to keep up with Elsinore’s growing importance for the country, and it was therefore expanded several times. Since 1961, St. Olaf’s Church has formally become a cathedral, due to the fact that northern Zealand became an independent diocese. On the east gable of the church one can see a door leading to a burial vault. Above it, there is seen a skull and crossbones, the symbol of death. The French inscription reads: Thus do we all become. Inside the church, the interior is dominated by an 11.5-metre tall altarpiece from 1664. The altarpiece is constructed of 19 reliefs, depicting the life of Jesus Christ. There is also a treasure trove of Renaissance and Baroque art, such as the pulpit, from the year 1567. There is a yellow house, which lies on Sct. Annagade 6, that faces the church with a large mural — this was the childhood home of the composer Diderik Buxtehude (1637–1707). In the years 1660–1668, he was the organist at the Church of St.Mary, and he was known as one of the 17th century’s most important composers, inspiring famous composers such as Johan Sebastian Bach and Georg Friedrich Handel. The paintings on the gable across from Buxthehude’s house in Sct. Annagade depict the era of the Sound Dues. They show the cosmopolitan rich and very vibrant mercantile town, which for over 400 years profited greatly off the many ships that had to stop and pay the Sound dues. Along a small side street was GI Færgestræde, a very aesthetic cobblestone alleyway.
The second church I saw was St. Mary’s Church and the Carmelite Priory. St. Mary’s Church, together with the Carmelite Priory, is one of Northern Europe’s best preserved priories from the Middle Ages. The priory was founded in 1430, shortly after the introduction of the Sound Dues, when Erik of Pomerania invited the Carmelite monks, the so-called Whitefriars, to Elsinore. The church and priory were completed in their present form around the year 1500. After the Reformation, the priory was converted to a hospital in 1541. The priory also housed Elsinore’s grammar school, and in the 1800s it was a retirement home for those deemed in worthy need. Inside the church the floor is covered in numerous, partly worn down gravestones, which originate from the time where it was possible for wealthy citizens to buy a burial site in the church. The church’s prestigious chalk murals were made from 1440–1500. A main attraction is the church organ which was put there in 1662–63 — this was the same organ that Diderik Buxtehude used while he was the church organist. Following the Protestant Reformation, the church was intially desolate, but was later used as a stable for traveller’s horses. It was on the brink of being torn down, but due to the many foreigners in the city, Frederick I gave it to the German and Dutch congregation. From 1576, sermons were performed exclusively in German. In 1851, the German sermons were halted, but the many German inscriptions still bear witness to the long period where it served as a German church.
I also managed to find a few different murals that were painted on the sides of the buildings: Soul of the Walls; the Middle Ages and the Sound Dues; History of the Churches; and the Maritime History. Very beautiful, colourful large murals. There was also a side street, Stengade 64–76, which has a row of beautiful 16th-century stone houses part of the Sound Dues residences. They are merchant houses from a time when Elsinore was flush with the profits of international trade. By 1426, Erik of Pomerania had given the city certain special mercantile privileges, and for a time Elsinore was Denmark’s second largest city. Erik of Pomerania had pushed for the development of the city by ordering its citizens to “build your city, increase its size and improve it with good merchant houses.” To encourage this, the King tempted the residents with tax cuts: If you built your house out of stone, you would not have to pay taxes for 10 years. (Those who built their houses out of wood only had five years without taxation!) The houses were built concurrently with King Frederick lI’s construction of Kronborg. It is obvious that the houses were built with the assistance of the same foreign craftsmen that were building for the King. The buildings in Stengade 72 and 74 are called “Leyel’s Houses.” For a number of years, they were owned by the Leyel family, an aristocratic bloodline of Scottish descent who came to be very influential in the city. For the house in no. 72, the windows are encased in stone, whilst no. 74 has a stepped gable. Across the front of the building there is a band of limestone with Gothic writing, and upon it there is written in Latin: “For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth. And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.” The horizontal bands were made during the Renaissance. In no. 76, it is the house of customs officer David Hansen. The property is one of the oldest pre-served private residences in Elsinore, built in 1579. The front of the building features bands of sandstone, and it is richly decorated. Above the windows, one can see a row of small busts. Two of the busts, made as portraits of a man and a woman, wear outfits from the time of Frederick II.
I then backtracked as it was around 10.30am, and after a quick toilet break, we walked to the Kronborg Castle. It was a short distance away, and thankfully the large tour groups hadn’t come yet. Kronborg Castle (aka Hamlet’s Castle) was the actual site that Shakespeare set Hamlet in — so you could see lots of Hamlet inspired souvenirs, and also staff doing tours in Hamlet outfits. Kronborg Castle has existed at Helsingør (Elsinore) since 1420. It’s been burned to the ground and rebuilt since, but always maintained its vital position at the head of the Øresund Sound. Ships passing into the Baltic Sea paid tolls at Kronborg Castle,and Helsingør was once one of the most important towns in Europe. In 2000, Kronborg Castle became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was quite nice, with the usual moat and large imposing walls. After touring the inside of the castle, which just showed some rooms and tapestries, I went to climb the Cannon Tower — 145 curving steps up to the top, and you got a pretty good view of the harbour. Gloomy day though, so the view wasn’t so breathtaking. After that, I explored the Casemates, which were the castle’s underground system of corridors and rooms. It was so dark and cramped, and I had to stoop many times to make my way through the tunnels, and at times having to use my flashlight just to light my way. I can only imagine how shitty and creepy it is at night… Oh boy. After seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, I regrouped with the rest of the family (they stayed for the short tour of the castle), and I went with Mom to see the chapel. Then, because I wanted to go off and see more stuff, knowing how slow the rest of them are, I left first. I went to the see their exhibition on “Monsters — Beastly beings with big emotions”. It was about monsters of the past, such as the basilisk, Kraken, with these monsters recreated from recycled materials by artist Shane Brox. His inspiration for this exhibition was human emotions — how everyone can feel and be a monster in their lives. He wanted to start a conversation about emotions in a fun and exciting way, because making the emotions visual through the monsters provide a creative and interactive way to explore this topic. It was quite a short exhibit, and the monsters were very cute. The souvenir shop sold these monster plushies, but they were unfortunately really expensive. Instead, I got myself this Kronborg castle coin. Before leaving the castle, I went up to see the flag bastion, which also provided a view of the sound. I finished everything by around 12pm, then walked to see the Museet for Sofart, or the Maritime Museum of Denmark, since it was just outside the castle. It was all about the shipping industry and history in early Denmark, and it also had on a special exhibition on the Haenyeo divers, showcasing photos and telling their stories. It was quite short and sweet, and I finished within 30mins. After that, I walked to see the Han statue (Han af elmgreen og dragset), this metallic sculpture of some guy on a rock. Then, I walked a little bit further to see the Dancer’s Fountain (Danserindebrønden af Rudolph Tegner), before heading back to the station to catch the RE train at 1303 back to Kobenhavn Hovedb. station. Mom and Kit they all had a light lunch at Helsingør, before taking the 1418 train back. The moment I got back, I went to the apartment and ate my strawberries and skyr with nuts for lunch. After resting a little and charging my phone, I planned to meet Mom directly at Torvehallerne. Torvehallerne is a food market selling fresh produce and fish, in addition to little stalls selling a variety of foods — smørrebrøds, pastries, empanadas, ice cream and more. I bought a few cherry tomatoes from the Torvehallernes Frugt & Grønt, which was located between the two glass halls — it sold such a wide variety of fruits and vegetables — tomatoes, purple carrots and cabbage, apricots, pumpkins — everything so beautiful and vibrant and FRESH! I wish I could’ve bought one of each to try… ah well. Mom bought the classic Danish treat flødeboller, which is a chocolate-covered cream balls topped with different stuff like pistachio, almonds, marzipan, from the famous stall Summerbird. It was packed with people, and just amazing to see the huge variety of foods available. By then, the gloomy weather had cleared and it was nice and cool, with some sunshine. We visited the nearby Flying Tiger shop, then walked to SMK, the National Gallery of Denmark. The National Gallery of Denmark (Statens Museum for Kunst) features Danish and international art from the past seven centuries. It features art from past and present Danish paintings and sculptures, French art, European art, as well as a special exhibit on Baroque art. Pretty nice, but too much art for my brain to handle. We finished it all within an hour, and then went back to the apartment to cook dinner. Initially, Mom told me she would have dinner with me, but as expected, she didn’t keep her word. She wasn’t willing to buy something back to eat with my cooked dinner, so I just told her to go eat with the guys at the Japanese restaurant they booked, Tokyo Restaurant. Ah well, what’s new there, right? At least she helped to cut and wash up I guess. Whilst the dinner was cooking, I made a quick trip down to Irma to buy another tub of Skyr, just to appease Mom that I was eating more food though I already ate at least 1kg worth of Skyr for lunch. Ah well, let’s hope I don’t get too fat then.
Quite happy with all the sights I managed to see today — basically everything that’s on my list and more, so that’s great. Tomorrow I plan to walk around in the morning until the Round Tower opens at 10am, then head to Tivoli to finally ride the rides and see it at 11am. Head for lunch, then see what else I can fill in the afternoon with.
Woke up at 6am, and surprised I managed to get a decent amount of sleep with the noise that was happening upstairs. Don’t know what they’re doing, but there was a lot of loud thumping noises and music too. Today’s weather looks good, as it is partially sunny and bright, so I think a good amount of walking is in order since its a rare decent weather. I found a few smorgesbrod places, since that’s something I haven’t tried and Mom too, and I think the best options are still at Tolverhavernne. But I also located a Vietnamese spring roll place, so I might go there after the bread, and then to La Galette for the buckwheat galettes and sweet crepes for the rest of them. After Mom woke up and had her coffee, I told her the plan and then got ready to leave. Papa wanted to come with us this morning, and as Kai was still sleeping, we decided to just let him be and inform him via Whatsapp that we were out. I was fine with Papa coming along, but made it clear to him that Mom and I would keep walking on first, and he could take his time to take his pictures. I decided to walk towards Vestre Kirkegård, where there was supposed to be a park. Along the way, there were some pretty nice murals to see — one of the wall murals was 85 years old, as we were kindly informed by this old gentleman. We also entered the Christ Church (Kristkirken), and it was a nice old church. We didn’t exactly reach the park, as it was almost 9am by then, and I had planned to go to the Planetarium before the Round Tower. Emily messaged me, and we decided to meet up at 10.20am at the Round Tower to go up together. So Mom and I backtracked to the Planetarium, which opened at 9.30am and saw the very very short exhibition on the Cosmos (about the Big Bang theory, stars, black holes), seeing a real moon rock and a very artsy exhibit on the Rings of Saturn. The museum shop was small, and they were selling popcorn which smelled so good. After that, we took the M3/M4 to Nørreport station, where we dropped by the Taffelbay bakery for Mom to get some breakfast — she got 3 small things to eat (almond florentine, like a little tart; a Berlinervaffel, looks like a dacquoise with a crunchy nut base and filled with mocha cream; and a Limonetti, a light Italian wreath cake with lemon zest) plus a cappucino. After sitting a while, we made our way to the Round Tower, passing by Normal and some lifestyle shop that looked like a Scandinavian version of Muji (we visited after the Round Tower). We met Emily, Papa and Kai there, and went up the tower together. There were just a few things to see, with the ultimate conclusion at the tower top where you could get a 360 view of the cityscape. There was also an exhibit on Meisen Kimono. The meisen kimono became popular in Japan in the first half of the 20th century. This happened after a cultural and technological exchange between Japan and the West made it possible to manufacture kimonos at lower costs than previously, when the silk kimono was preserved for the upper classes. Now, ordinary Japanese people were able to buy fashionable silk kimonos in bold new designs inspired by European art. Over the past 30 years, Danish artist and textile designer Henriette Fris has built up an impressive private collection of these kimonos. Her interest in kimonos was sparked when she was taught by a Japanese silk painter. Since then, she has collected over 100 unique and hand-sewn kimonos dating back to the heyday of the Meisen kimono between 1910 and 1955. During this period, Western art movements such as Art Nouveau, Art Deco, De Stijl and Cubism had a strong influence on Japanese artists’ kimono designs, and these kimonos later re-inspired Western textile design. The exhibition showcases long and short kimonos from Henriette Fris’ private collection. They sold some Japanese crafts like the cat and tote bags featuring the corgi and Japanese landscapes, but crazy expensive. After finishing the tower, Mom and I went to see Tivoli Amusement Park and the Tivoli gardens, passing through Jorck’s Passage. Along the way, we passed by the Frue Plads Marked, a 3-day craft fair that was occurring from the 10th- 11th Aug. It was full of people milling around the various artisan craft stalls, with most stalls selling ceramic handicrafts like cups, plates, and decorative vases. They were all so beautiful to look at, and the minimalistic designs and muted palettes were just so aesthetically pleasing. I wish I could buy a few of the pieces to bring back, but they were crazy expensive. There were a few stores also selling wool clothing and leather items, but mostly ceramic items. Mom and I decided to get a souvenir from the fair, this chameleon looking thing by a female artist — Mom got a vase and I got the chameleon thing itself. Though it was expensive, I decided it was worth the cost as I “made it up” from not going out for meals, plus I definitely did not intend to come back to Copenhagen again. Nope, just not appealing enough unlike Japan or Italy. By then, the sky had turned really gloomy and grey again, and we decided to drop off our stuff at the apartment first and refill water before heading to Tivoli. When we reached, it was packed like sardines, as by the time we arrived it was 11.30am. We managed to skip the queue with our Copenhagen card, but the card only guaranteed us a free entrance but not free access to the rides, where you had to pay 50–90DKK per ride. Nope. So we just walked around the fairgrounds and looked at the rides, seeing the very pathetic Tivoli aquarium, and generally just being disappointed by the whole thing. I believe it’s been overly hyped up, and that in reality it was just another amusement park, and not even as good as Disney World/Sea Japan. Oh boy, will Papa be disappointed. Anyway, we finished walking around, then took the train to Nørreport station to meet everyone else at Tolverhavernne Food Hall for lunch. We got there around 1310, and found Kai and Emily walking around, whilst Papa went to find a seat. Mom queued up a long time for the Hallernes Smørrebrød, getting the chicken salad (homemade chicken salad, bacon, and chervil), Danish meatball (meatball made with pork and veal, homemade potato salad, and thyme), Fish cake (fish cake made with cod, served with dill mayonnaise and hand-peeled shrimps) and I think the last one was Roast pork (roast pork with crispy crackling, homemade pickled red cabbage, and cucumber salad). Emily bought a hotdog thing to share, which Papa ended up eating the whole thing plus a Smørrebrød; Kai also got a hotdog too. Emily also bought cherries, figs, white and black cranberries to share, but ended up bringing back the cranberries cause it wasn’t popular. I got smørrebrød from Rørt: “leftovers” which was organic up-cycled vegetables from MATR, mushrooms, Jerusalem artichoke mayo, pickled cabbage and fried buckwheat on toasted rye; and their “Green Crush” which was smashed avocado, tomato relish, chili and coriander on toasted rye. After walking to find Papa, I finally settled to eat my first ever smørrebrød and it was DELICIOUS! My god, I loved the umami taste of it all, and just so creamy and tasty wow. Emily also got a green apple gelato since Papa ate her hotdog. Oh, I also got my purple carrot for dinner, and Kai bought chocolates for Heidi. After we finished up, we walked a short distance to La Galette, a French restaurant that is inspired by the Asterix French cartoon character. They served a variety of savoury buckwheat pancakes as well as sweet crepes — I ordered the Asterix (ratatouille, egg and chives), whilst Papa had the egg, bacon and ham one, Emily ordered the Confiture (sweet with black currant jam) and Mom had the Crêpe flambée (with banana and Grand Marnier). Mom got twice the dose of alcohol as the guy’s lighter didn’t work the first time round, so he came back with a fresh cup of alcohol to light up. It was really tasty and light, not heavy at all or overly salty. I really liked it, and am glad I decided to go for it today and not miss out. After we finished, Mom and I headed back to let me eat some yoghurt and strawberries, whilst the rest of them went to the aquarium. Kit unfortunately was feeling feverish this morning, so missed out the whole day’s outing, but thankfully was feeling better by lunchtime so would join for dinner. After yoghurt, Mom and I went to the Christianborg Palace, as Mom wanted to see the tapestries. I went with her to finish my tour of the place, seeing the ruins (just a bunch of rocks) and the kitchens (very boring). I bought Mom a magnet of the palace, and after that we departed back for the apartment. Papa was back before us, and that was cause he was tired and also Kai messed up. Apparently, he went to the wrong aquarium which wasn’t covered by the Copenhagen card, and entry was 120DKK. Papa didn’t want to pay entry, so left first. Oh well. I realised that Kai’s been creating a lot of negative energy this whole trip, making snide remarks about Kit to Emily, or making Kit seem like such a lazy shit who got lucky in life. He doesn’t even consider the fact that it may be embarrassing Kit or even Emily, and that maybe Kit actually is jealous of Kai being able to be a doctor. Jesus Christ. Anyway, got back and cooked dinner, finishing up my Thise skyr and feeling sad when I finished it cause I just wanted to keep eating more… oh well. Mom they all were going to El Meson for dinner, a Spanish tapas place. Hopefully the food is good, and no more food poisoning for tomorrow we’re all flying back. Papa’s flight was at 11am so he would set out first, while Mom, Kai and I would go to the airport later as our flights were around 2pm. I pray that Ryanair doesn’t delay the flights again, if not I’ll be so pissed. Really happy and proud of myself for eating the lunch out today and not caring about the salt/sugar content, but just embracing the delicious foods as is. I guess I knew that I would go back to eating a salt-free diet from tomorrow onwards again, and never intend to come back to Copenhagen, so 1 meal won’t kill me. And maybe it’ll actually help heal me. Oh yes, also am very surprised by how trusting the Danish people are — they just leave their bikes unlocked, supermarkets leave produce outside with no cameras or security guards watching. And their MRT station also uses a tap-in/out card that not everyone has to use, with no one really checking. Gosh.
Ah, last morning here in Copenhagen before heading back to the awful reality of life in the UK and school and OSCE retakes and PEG. Woke up at 6.30am, then did the usual warm up and tea time. Papa was up already cause his flight was at 11+am, so planned to leave the flat by 9.30am. Last night’s dinner was so-so according to Mom — they had meatballs, sausage, Iberico ham, paella etc. They wanted the grilled lambchops but they ran out! Anyway, they got back at midnight, as after dinner they went to Tivoli to see the lights. Mom said that all the rides were closed already, and they actually see Rick Astley performing live! Oh man, what a treat it would’ve been. Anyway, packed all the stuff to let Mom bring back on my behalf, and then I changed and left by 7.30am for Juno Bakery. Apparently, it was a really really famous and good bakery as it was opened by former cook of Noma, Emil Glaser. Their cardamom rolls are the most famous, and so I decided to try and get it for breakfast for Mom, Papa and Kai. The bakery was located at Århusgade, and I decided to talk a nice morning walk along the Peblinge Sø, which is like a river, and along the way saw some murals and this island of birds (Fugleøen, on Google Maps). The walk was nice and peaceful, and today was much warmer than usual despite it being cloudy. Lots of people out running and cycling, and the streets were quiet with few cars. By the time I reached the bakery, it was a really long queue. Suddenly, Mom told me that she wanted us all to leave at the same time as Papa, so I very stressed to get back on time. I queued, and bought 3 cardamom buns, 2 pistachio and 2 almond danish. I then chionged back for the flat, taking the M4 from Nordhavn station back to Kobehavn. Speed-walked back to the flat, and managed to get there by 9.30am for Papa and Mom to have a whole bun for themselves, fresh and hot (well, lukewarm). They really liked it, saying the pastry was soft and delicious. :D
After that, we took the train to the Copenhagen airport, and checked in. No queue for Papa’s business class, but a small queue for my Ryanair flight. Thankfully we reached by 10.30am, so hardly anyone there yet. Got my boarding pass and then proceeded through security. Kai was grumpy as shit, having to suddenly rush at the sudden change of plans and not being able to have a proper slow, sit-down breakfast. Oh well. After passing through security, the duty free shops and other shops inside the airport were pretty nice. I just walked around a little while waiting for Mom and Kai to pass through, and after a while managed to meet up with Kit and Emily. They had lunch at Yo! Sushi, and we all convened there eventually. After resting a while, and unfortunately not finding a 7-Eleven, I had to go to my boarding gate, F105. Sian, everyone else’s gate was C-something but mine had to be the furthest away. I was really tired and had a headache, but just powered through it anyway. No lunch, except for a few cherry tomatoes and nuts. Why can’t airports have shops selling greek yoghurt or skyr? Dang it man. Anyway, I’m just glad that the flight wasn’t delayed this time, though we did depart late by 20mins. Full flight, and I was so tired I dozed off for the majority of the flight. We landed at around 3.10pm, and then I went to the Stansted Express for the 3.43pm train to Tottenham Hale Court. Unfortunately, the train journey was extended, due to some guy trespassing on the tracks so yeah. After a 10min delay, we finally continued on and reached the station at around 4.30pm. I walked to the Victoria station line, and took another 30min journey back. By the time I reached Warwick, it was 5.05pm already, and Mom and Kai had just reached before me. Heidi was there already too — she was cooking them dinner tonight. I ate a few spoonfuls of yoghurt then got cooking, as Mom kindly helped me go sainsbury and the market man to buy veg and fruits. Man, was I so tired and my head was pounding. Whilst cooking, I boiled water to refill my bottles and unpacked at the same time. Only finished cooking by 6pm, and then finished by 6.30pm. Finally took a shower, and just updating the blog now. Man I am so tired…
Oh well, it was a pretty ok family trip, though lots of unhappiness and rough patches the first few days — ok, mostly everyday there’s something wrong. Just like today, Kit didn’t even bother saying or hugging me goodbye unlike he did with Kai and Mom. Guess I should just give up on him too.

This is a post about a couple of museums that I visited while I was in Copenhagen. As I was more determined nto not make my holiday into a busman’s trip, I somehow managed to find myself in yet another museum…
Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, or the New Carlsberg Museum, was founded by the same founder who launched the beer brand. The founding collection of the museum was the private collections of the Carl Jakobson. I wasn’t aware of how close the museum was from my hotel and had passed it many times while looking for other attractions.
The highlight of my visit was definitely the winter garden. When I was reading the information on tripadivsor, I thought it was another botanical garden. I didn’t realise how wrong I was until I arrived.
What greeted me first was a stream of different sounds: recordings of both natural sounds, such as birds’ chirping and wind, and artificial sounds. I heard something that reminded me the strange music of a theremin or a glass armonica. Sometimes the melody turned into a high pitch, but most of time it was as if the ruffling leaves were murmuring. The winter garden was smaller than I expected, but the magical sound somehow enlarged the place. I was lucky enough to secure a seat at the cafe next to the garden, and enjoyed a light lunch as if I were in the jungle (a very cold one indeed).
Another thing worth mentioned was a literary project for eight selected sculptures. Invited guest writers were asked to write a short passage, giving the marbles voice and perspectives. I was relieved when learning that the text was all translated in English and juxtaposed with Danish. Nevertheless, this was the moment when I wish I had mastered a foreign language so I didn’t need to rely on translation.
The visit was rather short, as a heavy rain in the morning soaked me through and I had to go back to my hotel to give an online talk to the Museum studies students at the Uni. Leicester. It was a fine museum; a typical “private-collection-turned-museum”. I appreciate the attempt of the literary projects, giving the collections new meaning.
2. Medicinsk Museion (Medical Museum), 1 Sep
I was over the moon when I learned that there was another medical museum in Copenhagen. No surprise, it is a university-affiliated museum, transformed with collections previously used in lectures. At first, I couldn’t find it upon arriving at the address: There was no sign on the street, but a thick wooden door. I then realised that thise must have been the feelings for many visitors when they went to the Whipple Museum: Being discouraged by the intimidating door, fearing that whatever was behind the door was far too important to be disturbed.
Originally I thought it was going to be another small and quirky museum that had no choice but to take advantage of every inch of space possible, that the arrangement and curation were going to be limited. However, I was surprised to find that first of all, the space was bigger than I thought (at least bigger than Whipple), and that there was a certain curatorial logic that went through different galleries. From a display that asked visitor to reflect upon difficult choices during Covid, to an interactive game about factors that extend or shorten humans’ lives expectancy, permanent displays showed a wide coverage of various yet common aspects regarding health and medicine. I especially appreciate the display of instruments for the visually impaired, such as Braille, typewriters, and computers. As a person who is severely myopic, I understand how these tools can make a huge difference to the blind.
www.museion.ku.dk
The Exhibitions “The Body Collected” exceeded my expectations. Making the best use of the human remains collected since the 18th century, the exhibition discussed life, death, deformity, and disease from macro to micro. Exhibitions as such always attracted people who simply wanted to snap pictures of the “freaks” and the “deformed”, i.e. skeletal remains or samples left by people with disability. I don’t deny that the power of genes never stops amazing me, yet every time I see a giggling teenager (usually they were there only because of some private summer camp, and that a cultural visit was a must to satisfy the parents) laughing while taking pictures of “things”, I understand more why there are rules in UK museums that forbid people from any photography. Visitors should always be reminded of the magnitude of historical superstition, prejudice, misunderstanding, and the emotions that accompanied all stillborns of deformity and victims of disease when being presented with human remains. On the other side, UK museums are probably the only country that actually put out signs that forbid photography when it comes to human remains, and not every museum abides the rule (e.g. archaeological remains). It is always surprising to see no effort is made in European medical museums to remind people of the ethics and respect, but truly, what position museums have to do so?
Before my visit ended at a strange temporary exhibition on germs and intestinal health (about digestion and of course, waste), I gladly found that I could buy acopy of the display text for “The Body Collected”, English available. I didn’t have time to read all the labels, but the book provided wonderful, high-res photos of the collections, accompanied with paragraphs written by the curators who explained the context and stories of the dead. After reading the book, I felt that the body parts, severed and partially presented, reclaimed a bit of humanity. It as very important for me.
3. Danish Architecture Centre, 5 Sep
I wasn’t planning on visiting the DAC, but eventually stepped inside since it was included as free entry in my Copenhagne Pass. I’m glad that I did visit this place, as it was very informative.
I had heard many positive comments about Danish architecture, that it was one of the best when talking about modern design. Although I never pay any attention on architecture, I can still apreciate the curatorial decision made in the gallery that presented the philosphy and creativity of Danish architecture. One thing I took away was the importance of techniques to make bricks and bricklaying, as well as the design to let all Copenhagen citizens enjoy water. When looking at the illustration, I remembered the long jetty that I walked by every morning in front of my hotel, where I imagined would be fully packed with swimmers in summer.
I did not visit that many museums when I was in Copenhagen; instead, I went to a few famous historical royal palaces. As my attention now is more focus on how museums manage and care for their collections on the public side, I don’t think I know enough to critique the management of royal palaces and heritage sites. As magnificent as they are, I don’t intend to make this blog into a travel diary.
Copenhagen was a beautiful place that reminded me of Amsterdam: Water, canal, bikes, and clear sky above neat city planning. Yet it is indeed a city of its own distinctive charm.
This blog post was very much delayed in publishing, as I was soon caught in a whirl wind of work and life changes when I came back to the UK: New job, new role, things to learn, etc..

Copenhagen Food: A Tasty Tour of the Danish Capital’s Culinary Delights,https://denmarkinnewyork.medium.com/copenhagen-food-a-tasty-tour-of-the-danish-capitals-culinary-delights-473a0eb80461,"Sign up

A new cookbook revealing the hidden gems of Copenhagen cuisine is set to take American readers by storm later this month as Trine Hahnemann’s Copenhagen Food arrives in bookstores across the country.
The Danish chef and food entrepreneur’s latest work is a sprawling exploration of her hometown and the hyggelig cafés and restaurants that make it a unique standout in the global gastronomic map. Chapters covering eight boroughs, including Nyhavn & Gammelholm, Frederiksstaden, Christianshavn, Central Copenhagen, Vesterbro & Frederiksberg, Nørrebro, and Østerbro, and also Outside Copenhagen, are paired with over 70 local and traditional recipes and Trine’s own personal stories of living in and rediscovering each neighbourhood.
#DenmarkInNY met up with Trine Hahnemann to discuss her view on how Copenhagen food culture stands out from the rest of New Nordic cuisine and what the sophisticated New York palate can learn from Copenhagen’s food culture.
DKNY: Can you tell me a little bit about yourself and how you became inspired to produce a cookbook about Copenhagen food culture?
TH: I am native to Copenhagen and I have lived here all my life (a part from a few years in New York and London). I have worked in food for more than 25 years and I thought that now that Copenhagen has become a recognized gastronomic destination I would really like to write about the everyday food culture and how Copenhagen forms part of my history. I also wanted to go back to the roots and tell about where we are coming from.
DKNY: Is there something special that characterises Copenhagen food culture and distinguishes it from the rest of New Nordic cuisine?
TH: Yes, the ‘smørrebrød’ (open sandwiches). The bread culture — especially rye bread. And, of course, all the soft sweet buns we eat where the most iconic Danish is “kanelkringle.” Then the most diffuse traditional fast food is the hotdog, which comes in traditional, modern and organic versions.
DKNY: New Nordic cuisine has built a broad fan base over the past few years but it is now a known entity. Can Copenhagen food culture help maintain New Nordic’s popularity?
TH: Copenhagen is at the epicentre [of New Nordic cuisine] and at the same time finding its own identity away from New Nordic. Restaurants with food from around the world are opening here and I think seasonal, terroir and traditional and cutting-edge sustainable solutions are the future of Copenhagen restaurants.
DKNY: New York is a very diverse city when it comes to food. Is there something that New Yorkers learn from Copenhagen’s food culture?
TH: I would say the culture around eating out is relaxed. Hygge is important in sharing a meal. The other unique aspect is the local produce and the diversity of the seasons. We have more like 12 seasons instead of four, in part because many things only grow here for a very short time. Moreover, restaurants work directly with producers. We are close to the country and distances are short therefore local collaborations are easier.
DKNY: What is a staple of Copenhagen food culture that New Yorkers absolutely need to discover?
TH: The smørrebrød and trying out the lunch culture of having smørrebrød, beer and snaps at some of the classic lunch restaurants thereby trying the whole flow of a Danish lunch. The other thing is bicycling around and trying the different street food markets.

I did not have a single Danish when I was travelling in Copenhagen. Regret? Maybe.
I was in Copenhagen for holiday between 29 Aug and 6 Sep. It was a trip that I had been waiting for a long time, despite the fact that it might not seem so according to the post here: It seems that I just got back from Amsterdam, and whoosh, I was on holiday again! Only I knew I badly needed a holiday. I was aware that if I didn’t have any break before I started my new job at the MAA, I probably would’ve lost my mind.
As usual, it was a busman’s holiday, i.e. plenty of museums and heritage sites. This post will talk about the aquariums and botanical garden I visited.
I remember that we had to choose from five different topics for the last module (Specialisms) prior to the research dissertation in postgrad. The options were Museum & Knowledge (which I ended up with), Digital Museum, Education, Heritage, and Green Museum. The last option did not receive anyone signing up, and I felt really bad for Prof Unwin, but that was the first time when I learned that “green museum” wasn’t limited to environmental activists and climate crisis issues, but included collection-wise aspects.
When talking about the museum sector, botanical gardens are often included, e.g. The Cambridge Botanical Garden is part of the University Cambridge Museums (UCM). It is because the plant sciences associated with developing knowledge, and to conserve both tangible and intangible assest (in this case, the living plants in botanical garden and the pressed dried seeds and specimens in a herbarium) is as equally fundamental as other types of museum professions. On the basis of caring and protecting living plants, including zoos as a type of museum isn’t an idea so strange. An interesting and simple metaphor I now often use for explaining to outsiders is that a botanical garden is for living plants, a herbarium for the dead, a zoo and an aquarium for living animals, and finally a museum of natural science (usually iconic with a whale skeleton, or even better, a dinosaur) is for the dead, such as taxidermy.
A little sidenote to my postgrad and green museum course is that doing a two-month placement studies at the Leicester Zoo was one of the 200 available posts then. I don’t think anyone chose to spend a summer with zoo animals. Nevertheless, it makes sense to me now.
When I was planning for Copenhagen, I learned that Den Blå Planet (National Aquarium Denmark), an aquarium close to the airport, was the biggest aquarium in northern Europe. I was immediately attracted by the wonderful photos of blue water and the cool sea tunnel and booked the ticket when it was available. It had been probably more than twenty years since I last visited an aquarium.
I had no idea what to expect when I stepped inside, which was probably why I discovered surprise one after another. Indeed, large built-in-wall fish tanks were wonderful, but I appreciated the touch-screen beside each tank that explained what the sea animals were, where to find them, and if they were endangered. That was a great deal information. There was only one short-coming: Some touch screens mentioned an audio guide from the aquarium official app, which I did download, but it did not work at all.
Here are a few features that I really liked during my visit, and I think they are, though not unique in aquariums and zoos, equally functional as traditional education role of a museum.
There were four “shows” that I participated: One was touching sea stars and flounders, with a staff member explaining the species; one was letting the doctor fish eat the dead skin on my hand; one was an hourly feeding show for the cownose ray; the last one was watching the staff feeding the Amazonian pirahnas.
These shows are slightly different in types and they represent how zoos and aquariums engage with audiences. First one is direct interaction with the collections (in this case, living animals) with supervision and demonstration, and the interaction is part of the experience. Second one is similar to the first, but without supervision. In my case, I was playing with the doctor fish while reading the panels about these funny creatures. Third one is a mixture of fundamental animal conservation and education programme, since feeding the cownose rays are behind-the-scene task brought to the front for the visitors. It was also a direct interaction since the explainer gave away little shrimp pieces for kids to feed the ray. Finally, the last one is just as the third one, but without the visitors actually feeding. I’m pretty sure the reputation of pirahnas played a part.
One thing in common is that both staff members and the wall panels were the integral part of the whole experience. I learned a lot more than I expected, especially about the Amazonian pirahnas, that they didn’t really munch on people immediately if a poor sould fell into the water. Contrary to the stereotypical image portrayed by Hollywood movies, the fish are actually afraid of humans since we are larger. They also have natural risk aversement, which is against things that move, so it is unlikely that they would actively attack a drowning human. I learned about these facts by asking the conservator, and she did say that movies had more influence than them. It is exactly like the movie Jaws, which makes people think sharks will pursue swimmers no matter what, despite most cases suggest otherwise.
This might come across more of an independent situation, where the staff members were dedicated to telling people how sea animals become part of huamans’ diet. Whereas in museums, I seldom hear or read that some collections are good for making a house decoration or have high value in the market (perhaps topics alike would appear in marketing meetings, but I doubt that general public would be interested in knowing what decisions were made to produce the souvenirs they take home with!).
When I was poking (gently) the star fish, the conservator, a passionate young man, explained to me that some other fish I had touched were flounders, which were common on dinner plate. I told him that sea urchins were delicious, too in Asia. He agreed and said that such things were important to teach the children, that how their food came from. To be honest, I was a bit surprised by his candor, but really appreciated.
I also recalled reading an article years ago, which talked about how Taiwan “celebrated more seafood culture rather than sea culture”. As an island, and actually, one of the islands of defining status in both Austrolasian linguistic family and Oceanic diaspora, Taiwanese do not have a high literay in respecting and living in peace with the sea. Surely we consume tons of seafood, and most of us, though may not recognise the formal names, are good at distinguishing levels of freshness. Yet seafood is only one tiny party of living amid the ocean. The eagerness of the conservator, who took pride in educating the kids on learning the food source, made me wonder if an aquarium could strike a balance between modern scientific conservation and anthropological understanding for sea/ocean.
Here are some of the photos I took, of things I found worth remembering. Regretably, sometimes I forgot to note what the fish tank label said. The caption is about what I remember.
2. Botanical Garden, 3 Sep 2023
Besides visiting an aquarium, I also went to the Botanical Garden of the University of Copenhagen. Having stayed in the UK and Europe for some time though, I find it interesting how the Europeans emphasise and advertise greenhouses with tropical and exotic plants, which are usually bananas, cocoa, and palm trees. What I mean by “interesting” is that these greenhouses, though after centuries, far gone by the time they were built when anything “oriental” would definitely be a showstopper, are still being considered a highlight for visitors nowadays. I am always amused by the idea how my father would say, that his daughter travels far just to see bananas while she can see them in the garden!
I also feel a bit embarrased whenever I visit any botanical garden or herbarium, because I a) don’t know anything about horticulture or botany. b) am terrible at keeping plants alive. and c) even though I tried to take notes, the Latin terms and many English names never intend to stay in my mind very long. I am a bit worried that I didn’t make the best use of such invaluable resource.
The Botanical Garden, besides featured greenhouses of palm trees and bananas (it was incredibly steamy, so warm and wet that I couldn’t breathe. It was a sign that I had been transformed by the European climate!), boasted its butterfly room. I was not prepared for it; I thought the butterflies were specimens, or we would see them behind glass. I was sorrily wrong…
I don’t like butterflies. There are many things I don’t like that surprise people, and butterflies are one of them. I’m squeamish when seeing them: thin legs, fragile fat body, and I never am able to predict which way they fly towards to. I find them incredibly beautiful, though, especially if I don’t have to duck.
I couldn’t say out loud about how I felt about butterflies, because clearly everyone was amazed, feeling like living a Snow White’s daily life. I also felt a bit sad, because Taiwan used to be called the island of butterflies, and I only got to experience a brief moment of the name in a foreign country.
There was a large part of the Botanical Garden close due to reconstruction and conservation, so I didn’t get to wander around. Nevertheless, it was a wonderful visit. I will have to visit the one in Cambridge (shamefully I still haven’t been there) to compare the two.
It was nice to step out of my confort zone to see what other public educational space looked like. It was a valuable experience, especially the aquarium, as I don’t think there is anything as such in the UK (or maybe I should look closer!).

Copenhagen is unlike other European cities. It was apparent the moment when, exhausted after a 12 hour plane ride and turned away from our hotel for arriving too early, we decided to brave a nippy morning for a stroll around the city.
It was past 8am but the Radshuspladsen, or City Hall Square and “bustling heart of Copenhagen”, and the Stroget, a pedestrian street in the old city, is still eerily empty.
Where are the tenacious tourists? In fact, where is everyone? Are we in the right place?
One of the few souls we saw were these guys standing in the middle of a square, turning a decapitated cow on a spit.
Freezing, we gravitated to the warmth of the open fire like a bunch of hobos.
“That is the biggest lamb I’ve seen,” said the husband, whose brains have obviously stopped functioning in the cold.
“Oh, its a cow…and it will only be ready in a few hours,” says the blond-hair, blue-eyed one casually, like it’s perfectly normal to be roasting a whole cow out on the streets like this. “I’ve been up since last night getting this thing ready so, yeah, it’s just a few more hours to go.”
We might have missed a fine Viking feast but we did end up in Holm’s Bager, an ugly modern bakery which serves perhaps the most exquisite takeout sandwiches in the world. It was also our first time trying tebirkes, or Danish poppy seed rolls.
By this time, the city was coming slowly to life and, with freshly made sandwiches in hand, we continued to Slotholmen, or Castle Island, where the Christiansborg Palace, the Parliament, the Supreme Court, Ministry of Finance and the Borsen — the former World Trade Centre of Scandinavia — all reside. We were content with admiring these fine collection of buildings from the outside (although all we really wanted to do at this point was to go back to our hotel room and hibernate).
Standing there shivering in my cardigan and boots however, I saw more badassery… namely, a bunch of Viking descendants swimming competitively in the river in nothing more than swimsuits and trunks in 12 °C weather.
The Andersen Hotel was a fine place to crash, if not for its flawed check-in process. We were treated to a free wine hour after emerging from a good long nap, and played chess in the lobby while the weather continued to suck.
It was also close to the Skydebanehaven, a public park filled with climbing frames, a sand pit, a wading pool as well as stuff that would’ve been stolen / destroyed a long time ago if this had been another country, like balls and trikes. It was not just better than the city parks in Europe, it was free.
Copenhagen has several castles you can visit, but we decided on Rosenborg Castle because it was supposed to be the most captivating of the lot. And I totally understood why: its owner, King Christian IV, was a lover and fighter par excellence, with his hipster braid and Roman toga.
At his finest hour at the age of 67, after being injured by shrapnel during a naval battle against Sweden, he bounced right back up and continued waging war as if nothing happened. Not only that: he also had the shrapnel pieces removed from his eye and forehead later and made into earrings as a gift for his mistress.
The castle is infused with the personality of its owner: There was the room of mirrors — not to be mistaken for the less hedonistic Hall of Mirrors in Versailles — where he dunked the dingus in; there was the room where he reclined on a throne carved entirely from narwhal tusk; there was the room where he breathed in his last breath at the ripe old age of 70, after fathering 25 kids (with two wives and three mistresses).
Then, there was also the treasury, which looked like P. Diddy or Jay-Z’s personal wardrobe, where you can ogle at his golden crown and various other objects dripping in jewels.
It was hard not to walk out of the Rosenborg without wondering who, really, are these people? Why do they make Chuck Norris look like a pansy? And what do they eat, apart from whole headless animals?
Some of these questions were answered during our visit to the National Museum — which should be renamed the House of Horrors for its macabre exhibitions (see below). It started out innocently enough: we began with stuff left behind by their long dead — but no doubt, once strapping — Viking ancestors, like horned helmets and rune stones proclaiming heroic deeds.
And once you walk further in thinking what a nice, family-friendly museum this is, the museum delivers its sucker punch: bones animals and humans, mummified corpses, the head of a little girl who met a gruesome end — no doubt a victim of sacrifice. Further proof that you don’t wanna mess with these guys.
Then, as if wandering through halls containing dead bodies and decapitated heads weren’t creepy enough, there was also a charming area devoted entirely to old-fashioned doll houses. And a scary Hitler puppet for effect.
The children’s section — supposedly excellent — was closed while we were there but we managed to quell our disappointment by having a go at dressing up in the height of 17th century Danish fashion. Our littlest one, unfortunately, refused to humiliate himself, so here’s the three of us.
We eventually made our way to Christiana, a “free city” that sprung up in 1971, when 700 free-spirited Danes established a squatters’ colony in abandoned military barracks just a stone’s throw away from the parliament. They have survived multiple police crackdowns and skyrocketing property prices to remain standing today, several decades later, as a ragtag community of idealists, hippies, potheads, and artists who formed their own rules and built their own homes.
I was, however, rather skeptical: descendants of possibly the most fearsome people on earth, now enlightened new-age hipsters? Who believe in free love? And who would rather go vegan than a-pillaging?
I NEED TO SEE THESE PEOPLE FOR MYSELF.
And so we went — the kids mesmerized by all the rainbow colors and recycled art around them.
Down Pusher Street we went too, although we didn’t realize until we saw a bags of grass on a cart staffed by a shifty-eyed man.
We went to Nemoland, hoping to get some falafel and hummus but was put off by all the cigarette smoke. So we had Thai food at the beautiful Cafeloppen where the waitress was high-as-a-kite but the food was great.
And then we explored some more. We saw plenty of tourists; other families with young children; a guy, in handcuffs, getting escorted away by three policemen. I was especially delighted to come across a smoky little tavern where a bunch of old Asian grandpas and grandmas sat around, smoking hashish and being all ‘Whats Upppp’ instead of tending to the grandchildren like they do over here. That just made my day.
We ended up in a derelict-looking building that would’ve made any sane person nervous, but was actually home to a really great little art gallery. A group of musicians were inside, playing folk music.
My kids started flailing their arms and stomping around to the tune and, before I could rush over and restrain them like a panicked nurse at a mental hospital, a lady stopped me with a nod and a smile.
“It’s ok. Just let them be.”
And she handed them a cookie each.
She didn’t look like she was ready to take me on with an axe or something. She just seemed very kind, which was so unlike the Parisian lady in Montmartre who burned my son’s cheek with her cigarette and snapped at my husband for not being careful, or the Norwegian ladies who glared at us as our kids jumped around in the back of a stationary car during a ferry crossing.
I felt, at that moment, that we came to the right place. Even if we did see someone being arrested, we came to the right place.
And you know what? Copenhagen may not win a beauty or popularity contest anytime soon, but the people here are something else.
STAY Andersen Hotel Clarion Hotel Copenhagen Airport Sleek, modern rooms a short, indoor walk from the arrivals hall and copious breakfast make this place a great bet for those staying two nights or less. Also located less than a five minute indoor walk to the train station, where regular train takes you right to the city centre in just ten minutes. Early check-ins possible. $$ Generous, good quality breakfast (think smoked salmon, jamon iberico and amazing croissants), free wine hours, comfortable rooms and excellent location in the middle of the city. Unfortunately however, the CONCEPT24, which is unique to the hotel and means that your room is available for 24 hours after check-in, is absolutely useless, especially during peak tourist season. $$$

Previous: San Francisco — Copenhagen Scandinavian Airlines SK936 Flight Report
However short time I have in a city, I still enjoy taking public transportation not to save money, but to experience subways and buses in different countries as much as possible. So I took M2 metro line from airport to downtown Copenhagen. It was a 20 min short ride, but cost as many as 30 DKK ($4.5). Scandinavian price is no joke even to a Bay Area resident like me.
Copenhagen metro: not the best I’ve taken, but pretty comfortable and clean, definitely a far cry from the US ones.
I planned to start from the City Hall at the western end of downtown area, and made my way to the famous Little Mermaid statue in the east, which would cover most of Copenhagen’s central area. That is from the statue of Anderson to the statue to one of the most famous characters he created. As I walked out the metro station, to my surprise, I saw a sea of flags of not Denmark, but Palestine. It was in the midst of the Hamas-Israeli war, shortly after the Israeli army entered the Gaza Strip.
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has always been one that’s close to my heart. Personally having been to both Israel and Palestine, I’ve heard stories from both sides, and attended events of various sorts from both sides as well. So I stayed here to observe for a while, seeing the impassioned crowds waving the flags and chanting the political slogan “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.”
In the middle of chaos, I took some time to walk toward the other end of the plaza to see Mr Hans Christian Anderson, arguably the most famous person every tourist to Copenhagen would come to visit. Anderson sit on his chair with a top hat, looking at the other side, seemingly not paying attention to the ongoing protests on the plaza at all. He seemed to see these quite often and just wanted to chill.
As I decided to leave the plaza and began my walking tour, the rally also ended. So I followed the crowds to the Strøget, the famous pedestrian, car-free street in Copenhagen. The street seemed to be a touristy area with many souvenir stores, many of which were named “Viking” conveniently, and “exotic” restaurants. In retrospect, I really should have had dinner here.
Flyers on the wall were about the Palestine rally I saw earlier.
With crowds still chanting Palestinian slogans, I continued walking down the Strøget, while occastionally left the crowds to explore some stores briefly. A huge pulpit was seen placed next to this fountain, where Quran was played loudly admist the Scandinavian night. Seeing a group of mid-age Danish people sitting on the other side of the plaza hanging out and drinking, I wondered how they thought about the scene. Did they embrace such diversity or else?
Continuing walking eastward, architectures looked more and more modern. Fountains and statues could be seen once in a while. Then a market full of crowds came to my sight. Even thought it was still early November, the Christmas market had already taken place.
I personally can’t stand sitting outside in such a cold weather, but it seemed fitting to the Danish. People dressing in heavy jackets came together to chill, drink beers ,and share sausages and desserts on this Saturday night. The price for everything looked insanely high though. As a sausage cost nearly $20, I just observed the crowds.
I also visited a department store that fortunately was still open. Such stores are good places to observe local lives, so I always make them top on my list when I travel. Everything in the supermarket, from vegetables to seafood, seemed very pricey. Even though I later found my conversion rate was a little bit off, these prices were still way higher than in the Bay Area, which was already one of the most expensive places in the world.
As I walked pass the seafood counter and saw a lady sorting out seafood, a surreal feeling occurred to me. Travel brought me to this random place to encounter this random person, which wouldn’t have had anything to do with my life otherwise.
This is exactly what I travel for.
I planned to have dinner in the department store, but it didn’t really have a food court (only one serving desserts and wine). So I continued walking. Finally seeing Danish flags outside souvenir stores after a while.
This iconic building with all the dazzling lights was also a department store (for some reason I forgot to take any photo inside). I have arrived at the Kongens Nytorv (lit king’s new market) and Nyhavn (lit New harbor) area. This is also where the postcard-worthy photos of the colorful facades and old ships were taken (something along these lines). There was a McDonald right outside the department store, but I didn’t feel like having it as my only meal in Denmark. Big mistake, but we’ll come back to this.
To my disappointment, the facades were not very well-lit, which made them not very colorful. Both sides of Nyhavn were full of fancy restaurants that would probably cost me an arm to eat and a leg to dine inside (seriously $60 for a simple meal?) I was unsure whether these were tourist traps, or just typical Scandinavian prices.
Walking to the end of the harbor, I took a photo of the iconic new opera building across the harbor, under chilling winds. I thought the Little Mermaid, as popular as it is, has to be located in somewhere full of crowds. However the lively vibe I had experienced so far suddenly faded away. I realized it was really just the walkable Strøget area that was lively, and now I had encountered another side of Copenhagen.
Amalienborg was the official residence of the Danish royal family, where the Queen of Denmark resides today! However, it was only serenity that I could experience at night. A few royal guards wearing huge bearskin hats were patrolling the plaza. They would walk from one end of the building to a specific corner, stand still, turn around, and walk back to the original spot, so disciplined and well trained as if they were programmed robots. But as the palace where the head of state resides, I felt the security level was way lower than expected.
So on the plaza in this tranquil night, there were really only the royal guards wearing bearskin hats, King Frederick V on the horseback (he was actually king of both Denmark and Norway, when these two countries used to be one), and myself. I was observing both of them, while both the king and the guards were just going about their day (or night), ignoring my presence.
I was desperate to have dinner at any time, but few restaurants could be found. I made a small detour to a nearby street, where there were Khmer, Thai, and Vietnamese restaurants, presumably opened by immigrants. My experience told me that these places would offer foods at reasonable price. However, they all turned out to be high-end restaurants that cost $40 a meal.
Other restaurants I went to either was closed, or cost even more. I really wondered how an average person got to survive here.
At least I was glad to see the Danish road signs! Whoever plays Geoguessr would recognize this typical Danish signs, screaming Denmark, at first glance.
So I was approaching my destination, the Little Mermaid, walking in hunger and increasingly brutal winds. I realized the statue was located in a coastal park, with no stores or restaurants around as I imagined before. My final shot to not starve would be this seafood restaurant on the way there.
I almost thought the place was closed too, because I couldn’t even open the door as fierce winds blew onto it. It turned out to be a food court with many restaurants to choose from, ranging from seafood, authentic Mexican food, Argentinian grills……. and even Japanese sushi.
I ended up having this poke bowl as my only meal in Copenhagen. The famous Hawaiian and Californian-inspired dish that came with fish, avocado and random vegetables. Seriously it could not be less Danish than this. After I came out from the much needed restroom, I wondered how funny it would be to write about this journey, sharing about the authentic Danish food that Danish people get to eat in their everyday lives. I really should have eaten McDonalds or Burger King, or even the Chinese restaurant I first saw.
But hey, at least I had walked across nearly all of Copenhagen!
After such an authentic Danish dining experience, I went on to see something truly Danish: the Little Mermaid. The coastal park seemed to be a fun place to visit during the day, with good trails to bike if I hadn’t been carrying a 10kg backpack. Few tourists would visit the Little Mermaid in such a chilly night. In fact, only two local Danish dudes were there chatting. They came to me asking for cigarettes, which was indeed very fitting for this setting. Too bad I didn’t have one.
On my way walking to the metro station, I realized I had drunk too much water when I had the Danish delights, and my bladder couldn’t stand anymore. Unlike my dinner, I had no luck this time — absolutely nowhere was open in 10pm; the public restroom at train station was hopelessly occupied forever; however neat and clean Copenhagen’s metro was, it didn’t have any restroom in the station.
I tried to focus on my brain instead of my bladder. At one point I almost had no options but to take metro all the way to the airport, just for its guaranteed public restrooms. The department store and McDonalds in downtown, only 2 stations away from here, finally occurred to me. As I ran out the metro, the former seemed to be closed, but the latter, fortunately, was open.
I ran all the way to the basement, rushing into the restroom, only to see some ladies waiting in line. As I quickly turned back and about to ran out, a lady said “it’s fine! it’s both genders!”
“I promise I’ll eat McDonald next time Im in this city.” I pondered, As I used the gender-neutral restroom.
Walking out of McDonalds, I took metro to Ørestad. This is where I would stay tonight, somewhere with reasonable price and only two stations from the airport. Since my flight would depart 8am the next day, proximity was the top priority.
I walked through the already closed shopping mall and exited via the confusing parking lot stairs to avoid the ruthless freezing winds.
The hotel was a good deal for what I paid in such an expensive city. But my room turned out to be the final room down the hallway. This is very scary and something I would like to avoid at all cost. Legend has it that, the final room down the hallway always……
had the worst wi-fi signals…….took me forever to upload my Strava activity.
And was I only 5 hours into the trip? Why did I feel it’s already been 5 full days…….

I originally wrote this article in Danish for Politiken Byrum. Here’s the English translation.
Copenhagen is about to get a unique opportunity to learn from other global cities when it hosts the C40 Cities Conference. The question is whether a city as smug as Copenhagen is willing to exploit the opportunity. I doubt it.
The C40 network is bolstered by strong city brands with renowned mayors and is trying to act as a counterweight to national governments and their molasses-like politics, with an agenda strong on action. Cities are an absolute key in the fight against climate change but we’re not exploiting their potential near enough. Copenhagen is in the C40 club, since the city’s status quo is on a high level. Perhaps Lord Mayor Frank Jensen might even drag his bike out of the garage for the event. THAT would be epic.
It is clearly an advantage to work internationally in urban planning and design and say that I come from Copenhagen. It gives street cred. In 2007, I coined the word copenhagenize as a way of describing how other cities could be inspired by all the — back then — exciting things the city was doing. The word hit a nerve around the world.
It is quite telling that I came upon copenhagenize rather than something like denmarkification. Regardless of which political block is at the nation’s helm, the state still focuses on motorways and car sales, as though it’s still 1955. They haven’t understood the concept of induced demand — if you make more space for cars, you get more cars. It is hard to see the difference between the different transport ministers. The latest incarnation has recently been in Oslo to “look at electric cars”. We don’t need fewer cars in Denmark. No no no. Just different cars.
For years I have put Copenhagen on a pedestal regarding sustainable development and I have been an eager exporter of inspiration and transferable solutions with Copenhagen as a role model. I’ve worked in over 100 cities and, with my tv-series about urbanism The Life-Sized City — I curate so many amazing things that are happening in cities around the world. For 12 years I have taken hundreds of politicians, policymakers and professionals around my city on bicycle urbanism tours and I have given countless keynotes and interviews about the city. The pedestal, however, is getting wobbly.
Where arriving home in Copenhagen from my travels used to be pure pleasure, it is now often a bit of a bummer. There are simply so many amazing things happening out there in the world that Copenhagen is looking more and more old school. The brand is dusty and tired. Lately I have to answer puzzled questions from colleagues like, “why the hell did you build a Metro instead of reestablishing the tram network you removed in 1972?!” As on urban planning colleague from France put it, “car-centric cities build metros and people-friendly cities build tramlines”.
I live in Frederiksberg, a city in its own right in the heart of Copenhagen. It’s too small to be in the fancy C40 club but brags ad nauseum about being “The Green Heart of the Capital”. Here on the corner of Godthåbsvej and Nordre Fasanvej, where I’m writing these words, more than 30,000 cars groan past my windows. Windows that are consistently dirtier than any other apartment I’ve lived in in the capital. Frederiksberg is building underground parking garages but without removing the same number of street parking spots. Induced demand is a foreign concept to them, too. It’s wild to think that with the current parking licence fees for residents (only about €100 per year) it takes 900 years to pay off one underground car parking spot. Rumour has it the parking prices will increase, but let’s see if they actually rise to a price that makes sense. It costs 50,000 Danish kroner (€6700) just to paint and maintain an on-street parking spot. So the fee should be at least that.
The city is throwing around taxpayer money like it’s going out of style in the form — among other things — of expensive noise reducing asphalt. If you lower the speed limit from 50 km/h to 30 km/h it will give you the same noise reduction in our densely-populated neighbourhoods as the new asphalt — for a lot less money. The Black Heart of the Capital.
I’m an optimist but I’m also an impatient idealist. I simply have to be inspired in my daily work in order to bother continuing. Luckily there is inspiration to be had around the world. If Copenhagen dares to stand up and kick their laurels aside, here’s a quick and dirty list of modern ideas they can learn from.
Former Mayor of Paris from 2001–2014, Bertrand Delanoë spelled it out perfectly: “The fact is that cars no longer have a place in the big cities of our time”. He is far from alone on this. The woman who took over from him, Anne Hidalgo, is trying to continue where Delanoë left off. Mayors around the world have been quoted for similar, modern statements. It is simply the new normal to work towards fewer cars in a city. Okay, maybe not THAT new. Since the 1990s, French cities with over 100,000 inhabitants have been obliged by national law to develop mobility plans that would reduce car traffic and strengthen public transport, walking and cycling. Maybe when the current transport minister is done with looking at those Norwegian cars he could get started on intelligent legislation.
What else do we have? Hmm.
Over the past four years Oslo of all places has removed over 5000 car parking spots and made it impossible to drive into the city center unless you live there. Amsterdam plans to remove 10,000 parking spots for cars between now and 2025 in favour of making the city safer and adding public space. Helsinki is almost proud when they say it won’t be necessary to own a car in the city in the near future. They’re putting their money on MaaS (mobility as a service) instead. Vancouver is trying to turn the transport budget paradigm on its head — money goes to public transport, walking and cycling first and whatever is left goes to cars.
Now it’s getting awkward. Congestion charges. The national government promised us on around Copenhagen a few years and then failed to deliver. They’re a success in Stockholm, Oslo, Milan, London and Singapore and there is now serious talk of implementing them in many cities, including New York and Belgian cities. Are you as tired as me that your tax money goes to benefiting motorists who don’t even live in — or pay taxes in — your city? Shouldn’t we try to get some of that money back? Other cities have done the math.
Soon 85% of all the streets in Paris will be 30 km/h zones and the “30 Zone” movement that started in Germany in 1986 continues to roll. Soon Central London will slow down to 30 km/h like over 150 cities around Europe. Outside my windows it’s 50 km/h — in Denmark’s most densely-populated city.
I can go on. Ljubljana is in the midst of a massive green paradigm shift. Mexico has an official “laboratory for the city” created to think out of the box. Barcelona is developing people-friendly “superblocks” to reestablish life in the streets after the destructive reign of the automobile. Dublin has banned large trucks from the city center. Several cities are rebuilding or expanding their tram networks. Large logistics companies like DHL and UPS have been using — for a few years — cargo bikes for their last-mile logistics in over 75 EU cities.
Just look at Malmö, Sweden. You can literally see it from Copenhagen. They have a policy to strengthen density, they’re working on being the world’s most skateboard friendly city and they’ve built a bike-friendly apartment building without car parking.
Back to Copenhagen. Things are going well. So well that we don’t need to think about doing it better and maintaining our leadership position. World’s best and safest bicycle city — sure, until further notice. Massive investments in climate change adaptation. Super. But think about it. We have so much money that we have lost touch with reality.
The City just completed a bombastic new waste incinerator called Amager Bakke right near the city centre. One of the greatest singular vanity projects in recent memory. Oooh, there’s a ski hill on top! Nevermind that we don’t generate enough garbage to fill it and we have to import garbage from abroad to make it break even.
Is there really talk of a harbour tunnel that will pump more cars into the city when other cities are removing their last-century, fossil fuel infrastructure motorways? No serious action on affordable housing? More car parking spots that will just give us more cars? The same mistakes in the Nordhavn development that we didn’t learn from after the Ørestad and Carlsberg City disasters?
Imagine if Nordhavn was designed to be the world’s most sustainable development — like a huge version of Vauban in Germany — by using the whole arsenal of modern solutions. THAT is leadership. But no, all we have at the moment is a pile of marketing hype about being C02 neutral in 2015. A plan that activates my bullshit detector like never before.
Copenhagen thinks it’s in the boxing ring with the great fighters but in reality the city is merely the hot bikini-clad woman holding up the sign in between rounds. It is time to send copenhagenize into retirement. Personally, I’m more excited to see what vancouverism, barcelonification or osloism — or whatever the next one will be — has to offer up as inspiration.
When the cities of the world come to C40 in Copenhagen, we need to shut up and sit up straight. We need to listen. We need to learn.

📆 Flight Date: 20/11/2022📌 Nyhavn, Copenhagen — Denmark
During our stay in Gothenburg, we planned a 2-day weekend trip to Copenhagen. We hopped on a fast train that took us to Copenhagen in just 3 hours, arriving early in the morning. It was a delightful city to explore and wander around. We wished it were a bit warmer, but unfortunately, the weather was so cold that evening, it had snowed for the first time that year.
Nyhavn is a historic harbour area and one of the symbols of Copenhagen. Built-in the early 17th century, this region was originally used as a trading port. It is renowned for its colourful and distinctive buildings, its atmosphere steeped in history, and its maritime heritage. In the past, Nyhavn was a popular stop for sailors, hosting various cultures over time. Today, it has become a vibrant meeting point for tourists and locals alike, with lively cafes, restaurants, and charming colourful houses.
It was a day when we set out early in the morning to explore the city. While wandering around, I kept an eye out for a suitable place to fly the drone. When we arrived at the famous Nyhavn area, I found an open and quiet space near the river and decided to take off from there. It was an extremely cold day, and the wind was blowing very strongly, making it challenging to control the drone at times.
After taking off, the city looked stunning from above, and I captured a few photographs. Then, I spotted a tourist boat moving along the river towards Nyhavn, and I immediately started recording a video. Slowly progressing alongside the boat, I maneuvered through the streets.
And I took one more photograph of the city.
In my second video, I reversed the process, moving backward away from the river.
In my third video, I kept the drone stationary and, while facing the river, slowly elevated the camera towards the sky.
And finally, my one of my personal favourites is below. In this video, I captured the famous colorful houses and boats by moving the drone parallel to them. Due to the wind, I had to make 2–3 attempts while filming, but in the end, I believe it was worth it.
You can find detailed information about drone flying permissions in Denmark here. Although I have a drone license from the Turkish Directorate General of Civil Aviation, I didn’t possess the required license to fly in urban areas in Denmark. Unfortunately, I flew for a very brief period without obtaining permission. I made sure to stay away from people and buildings during the flight.
The indispensable element of my Northern European shots, the wind, challenged me once again. In fact, I couldn’t feel my fingertips due to the cold for a while after the shoot. Copenhagen was a beautiful city, and the buildings provided delightful scenery.
My point: 9/10
I’m considering adding my past flights here as a memento, so the dates mentioned in the writings I’ve added may belong to the last two years.

If you visit Copenhagen during the colder months, eating your way through their amazing bakeries is one of the best ways to spend your time (and to gain a few pounds of padding to protect you from the cold). We visited 9 bakeries in 5 days. Copenhagen’s bakeries rivaled the ones I tried in Stockholm (reviewed here). While I loved them all, we agreed there was one clear favorite. The list below is loosely in reverse rank order and rated as good, great, or amazing.

Part two: Getting an apartment
So you’ve moved to Copenhagen (or you’re about to!) and you read my last post, so you know that you need an apartment before you can get set up for absolutely anything else (health care, bank account, nemID, etc.). Here’s what I learned…
First, Set your expectations.It took us over 3 weeks to get an apartment in Copenhagen, and I was working on it every single day. We had to move between two different Airbnb’s because it kept taking longer than we thought. We have both a dog and a cat, and it was the middle of winter so it wasn’t much fun to trek around the city. Hopefully for you it will be faster!
In terms of what’s available here… Many Danish bathrooms are very small, to the point where you have to shower over your toilet (ew). And most do not have bathtubs. Pets make it extra-difficult to find a place. Many buildings are walk-ups (we are on the 4th floor with no elevator). However, there is plenty of hardwood and natural light and Danish modern design sensibility YAY!
Invest in the apps.Almost every apartment rental site costs money. Try a few (Boligsurf and Boligportal are decent) and pay for trial subscriptions, but put a note in your calendar to cancel the subscriptions when they are about to auto renew because they are not cheap. DBA is the equivalent of Craigslist and can have some good options, especially if you are willing to do a short term rental and then find a full-time spot later. However, it’s important to have a permanent address in order to get your CPR number, which is your key to everything else (see my last post).
Prepare for the competition.Competition can be fierce in Copenhagen. Come ready to see apartments with your proof of residency/income/employment, passports, and willingness to pay, just like you would in NYC, SF, or DC. Some places require you to fill out an application, others don’t. Bottom line, if you love it, don’t hesitate. On the flip side, the Danes have a more… relaxed pace, especially now during the summer months, so getting a showing can take time. Keep pushing if you have a good feeling about a place!
A note on agents.If you see an apartment that you kind of like, but it’s already gone, or not quite right, ask the person showing it what else they have on the market. Use them as a filter for similar quality apartments. But, keep in mind that buildings rented out by agents are also more expensive because they get a cut.
Be ready to shell out.In Copenhagen it is standard to pay an extra 3 months of rent on top of your 1st month’s rent as a damage deposit. Some places also charge 2–3 months on top of that as a deposit for the last few months rent. So, you are likely to pay between 4–7 months rent on day one. For a 1 bedroom 15.000dk apartment, that could add up to as much as 105.000dk, or $16,500 USD. As I mentioned in the last post, paying your first payment can be tricky without a local bank account, which first requires you to have a local address (so bizzare). I found Transferwise to be pretty useful for those first few overseas payments.
New vs. old?In Copenhagen, deciding between new vs. old is not the difference between modern luxuries and convenience, or personality and affordability. Some of the new construction buildings we saw had few luxuries, were located on the fringes of town (pretty inconvenient), but were more affordable, while some of the older buildings we saw had no character, or a few modern luxuries and conveniences, but at a much higher price. In other words, don’t be fooled by the age of the building!
In Copenhagen, a 15min bike ride is considered far. The city is really not that big, but I’d recommend choosing just a few neighborhoods that are close to where you want to spend your time, especially for when the weather gets uglier. You can find both expensive and affordable apartments in each neighborhood, though as a general rule it’s more expensive the closer to the center you are. When you start searching, you will see Københaven S, V, SV, N, O, K, etc. These refer to the areas of the town, but not the neighborhoods…
I have not even included Vanløsem Brønshøj-Husum, or Bispebjerg, because I’m assuming that if you’re moving to Copenhagen for a short time, you’d rather be in the middle of things.
K CENTER/CENTRUM
Centrum AKA Indre By: Can be a bit more expensive, not good for dogs, full of tourists, but super convenient to get anywhere. Good shopping, restaurants, scenic canals, museums…
VWEST/VEST
Valby: Families and more affordable housing over one big hill from the center. You can even get a whole house out there, I hear! The neighborhood of Carlsberg Byen, right on the edge of Frederiksberg is in heavy construction, and may be a cool area to check out in the next year or two.
Vesterbro and Kødbyen (meat packing): Can be loud, but also super hip and fun. Home to many cafes and bars and boutique shops. I found it hard to find apartments here.
N NORTH/NORD
Nørrebro: One of the most-multicultural neighborhoods in Copenhagen. A bit more crime, but also a lot of amazing culture — food, art, shops, etc. We spend a lot of time here.
Ø EAST/ØST
Østerbro: Quiet and family-friendly with lots of beautiful old character buildings. Close to “the lakes” (not what I think of as lakes, but beautiful for jogging and strolling) and the best bakery in town. All my friends live here.
Nordhavn: lots of newer construction buildings, right on the ocean! I hear the swimming is great.
SSOUTH/SYD
Islands Brygge: Copenhagen charm, if you want to live right on the water. But keep in mind that everyone else also wants to be right on the water all summer.
Amagerbro: A bit more crime here, but affordable and interesting. A short train or bikeride to the center.
Amager: Further out from the center, but closer to the beach, and the airport. Some areas feel pretty soul-less to me with back-to-back office buildings. But, I’m sure there are some awesome affordable apartment gems out here, and a whole lot of nature.
Christianshavn: Home to many houseboats, and also the famous Freetown Christiania. The neighborhood is just across from the center, and close to NOMA, you know, just in case. For cheaper eats, there’s also the new food hall at Reffen nearby.
Sydhavnen: Here there are A LOT of newer buildings that you can get into quickly, which are not too expensive. But, it feels a bit separated from the city by the railroad tracks, and much of this area is still being developed. Pro: it’s also right on the water.
And finally,
FREDERIKSBERGFrederiksberg is an island (figuratively, not literally) in the middle of Copenhagen. Even though it’s quite central, it’s a completely different byen, or city, which means different regulations, street signs, taxes, etc. It’s quiet and convenient, with lots of old character buildings, boutique shops and a gorgeous park. We love it.
My 5 step process to find the best apartments in any city
Start with what you need (and what you want).Whenever my husband and I move to a new place, we spend an hour or so writing up post-its with everything we’d like to have in our new apartment. Usually it’s based on learnings of what we liked or didn’t like in the last place. Once we’ve written everything that we can imagine (it’s light and bright, there’s outdoor space, a bathtub!), we’ll rank them by importance to our quality of life, debating back and forth until we both feel satisfied that this vision of an apartment is representative of our needs, and then our wants. This way, if only one of us is available during househunting, then we also have a good guide to make decisions with.
Know your budget.Choosing an apartment can be a very emotional process, so having an anchor to return to helps when it’s time for serious decision-making. I like to start with a “spending plan” for how much I think I’ll make and spend in my new city/neighborhood, then determine the high and low end of our rental budget, and clarifying what we would be giving up if you went with the high end. Don’t forget to factor in all the moving costs before, during, and after the move, like movers, new furniture, and damage deposits.
Visualize your ideal.Since I’m a visual person and a designer, I also often make a moodboard of what I want the space to look and feel like. It helps me check whether I’ve found the right place, or just a “good enough” place. My husband and I have been building this Moodboard for our House for the last 5 or 6 years, and I think it’s helped us understand each other’s sense of style.
Start early.Before I arrive in a new place, I get on all the local apps and start evaluating the market to find out what’s available, what would be a realistic price range, and how the neighborhoods compare — Airbnb neighborhoods and people who have recently moved to the city can be a good gut check. Many people told us to start trying to rent an apartment before we arrived in Copenhagen, but I think that’s bad advice, because it doesn’t allow you to…
…trust your gut.Now that I know what I can afford, where I’d like to be, and what’s most important to me, it’s time to let my intuition do the work. If it feels too good to be true, or I have a sneaking suspicion that there’s something off, I try to listen to that warning. After all, this is the place we’ll call home.

It was the day before Onam. I was sitting in the beautiful Frederiksberg Gardens in Copenhagen. It was a beautiful sunny day and all around us families were picnicking, children running around, and dogs dozing. This is what I would consider a perfect afternoon and I was soaking in every second of it. But, in the back of my mind I was also thinking about what I would be doing if I was home. (Currently, we do not have a permanent address). I would be cooking dal for Sambhar and chopping vegetables for Avial; defrosting packets of grated coconut to go into each of the five or six dishes I usually make. As an immigrant (now going on 12 years), cooking is how I feel at home. Cooking is, as some might say, my love language. Vishu and Onam are when that instinct comes out in full force. As much as I am enjoying this Europe sojourn, being in a different place every week and even cooking in new kitchens, not having Sadhya on Onam is a recipe for homesickness.
Home is a complicated concept; but one way I think of it is that home is the place where most of my food memories and cravings are anchored. That day in Copenhagen, we had bought a couple of things from a bakery (or bageri) to eat at the park. One of them was a cardamom bun or kardemommabolle which every Copenhagen food blog I consulted had recommended. As I bit into the beautifully glazed and twisted cardamom bun, nostalgia flooded my senses. Although, I had never eaten a kardemommabolle before, it felt so intensely familiar. That mix of sugar and cardamom and the soft melt-in-your-mouth bread, transported me home to Kerala. For a moment, I was a little girl eating one of those buns stuffed with sweetened coconut, flavored with cardamom. It reminded me of other confections that used this formula, now replaced by cakes and cookies in most Kerala bakeries, whose names I have long forgotten.
Food nostalgia can often hit you in unexpected places and ways. The smell of a particular mix of ingredients hitting hot oil, the texture of a dessert, and even the flavor of something you have never eaten before can bring back memories of familiar foods, places, and people. So why had this kardemommabolle transported me from Copenhagen to Kerala?
Cardamom—elam, elakka, elakaya in Malayalam—is the quintessential dessert flavoring in Kerala cuisine. This is not surprising given that some of the world’s best cardamom is grown in Kerala. Cardamom goes into our payasams (delicately flavored milk-based dessert), ela-ada (rice flour pie stuffed with jaggery-sweetened and cardamom spiced coconut filling that is steamed in banana leaves), and unnakaya (steamed and pounded plantain shaped into beautiful oval shapes, stuffed with sweetened and cardamom spiced coconut, then fried). It is used to flavor spiced black tea or Sulaimani of the Malabar region (which in my humble opinion is superior to the milky cardamom tea of the North). It is also used to flavor breads and cakes that became a part of Kerala cuisine, as a legacy of British colonial presence. When I first moved to the US, before Cinnabon kiosks opened up in Indian malls, I was slightly puzzled by the prolific use of cinnamon in American desserts. In Kerala, cinnamon is very much a savory spice. It is cardamom, and occasionally cloves, that are used to flavor sweet treats, although they are also key in savory dishes such as stew and biriyani.
We also revere cardamom for its supposed medicinal properties. You can pop a few pods into your pocket or handbag and chew on the seeds as a mouth freshener or to suppress nausea or motion sickness. Eladi Lehyam, an Ayurvedic paste with cardamom as its main ingredient is used to treat sore throat and cough, and an ubiquitous item in the medicine cabinets of Malayalis. (As I write this, I can almost recall the metallic methol taste of the Lehyam at the back of my throat). Eladi Thailam, or cardamom oil is used for head and body massages. Thus, cardamom is familiar not just to our taste buds, but all our senses. So how did this “queen of spices” make its way to Scandinavia and into the delectable kardemommabolle?
The Danish had some trading posts in India, including the southern port of Tranquebar, which it held as a colony for more than a two-hundred years. (Danish discourse seem to avoid the term colony and refer to Tranquebar as a trading post, but they did build a fort there). In the heyday of Danish East India Trade Company it had factories along the southern coast including—Edava—a town near Varkala, not far from a part of the Western Ghats known as the Cardamom Hills. So does the origin of the delectable Cardamon bun that transported me to Kerala on that Onam-eve lie in Denmark’s trade with South India?
Online sleuthing tells me that the creation of cardamom bun predates Scandinavian presence in Asia. Although I happened to have my first cardamom bun in Denmark, everyone (on the internet) seems to agree that it is a Swedish invention, where it is known as Kardemummabullar. Before the Portuguese explorer, Vasco Da Gama, landed in Calicut on the Malabar coast—my hometown and the heart of the spice trade at the time—spices were coming to Europe via the Middle East. The spice trade is believed to have started as early as 2000 BCE along the silk route, and was over the centuries controlled by Arabs, Venetians, and Genoans. The demand for spices played a key role in creating the first international trade routes and the European quest to cut out middle men and get to the source of the spices was a driving force of the “age of exploration” or as the colonized like us call it — the colonial era. Spices were making their way to Europe and shaping its cuisines well before Europeans themselves arrived at South and Southeast Asian shores in its pursuit.
One theory dates the arrival of cardamom in Sweden all the way back to the time of the Vikings. Supposedly, cardamom was brought back to the region by Viking explorers who made their way to Istanbul (then Constantinople) sometime in the 11th century. Another theory suggests that cardamom was introduced to Scandinavia by the Moors. This theory cites the appearance of cardamom in Scandinavian recipes in the mid-1400s and the “Moorish” influence of those recipes. This of course does not indicate a specific time or place, and might refer to the Maghreb or Al-Andalus. Irrespective of how cardamom first arrived in Scandinavia, Tranquebar and the East India Companies of other European nations (including Sweden) played a part in it becoming an essential part of the cuisine. This “opening up” of the spice trade in the 15th century made cardamom and other spices, which were previously luxury goods meant for the kitchens of the elite, more accessible to working class Europeans, even as it paved the way for the colonization of South and Southeast Asia.
As I was connecting the historical dots of how cardamom made its way from Kerala to Scandinavia, I realized that I had brought my own cache of cardamom there in the form of my homemade garam masala. One of its key ingredients is green cardamom that my aunt gave me on my last trip to Kerala. I made some lovely (even if I say so myself) Malabari biriyani for dinner on one of my nights in Copenhagen.
Copenhagen’s beauty is in both the grandiose and the mundane. Spectacular palaces sit unpretentiously besides old housing blocks with stunning but understated brickwork; Museums housed in old impressive buildings are surrounded by shops selling Danish-designed furniture and home ware that could give any museums a run for their money; verdant home and apartment gardens that look unplanned and wild are no less aesthetic than the many perfectly manicured royal gardens of the city. As much as I loved everything about Copenhagen, it is not the place where I expected to become nostalgic about Kerala (although, we do consider ourselves more understated and subtle in our aesthetics compared to the rest of India).
Food is an archive of history, cultures, and exchange. Food can bring back memories, and reveal connections in the most unexpected ways. This is probably why Food Studies has emerged as a serious field of research to understand culture, migration, history, and politics. As a seafood lover, I enjoyed the many Smørrebrød (open-faced sandwich, usually topped with seafood) that we had in Denmark. But it did not remind me of the fish curries, fish fries, or other seafood dishes that form an essential part of Kerala cuisine. On the other hand, a humble cardamom bun made me nostalgic and sent me down a research rabbit-hole. I am looking forward to having many more of them when I get to Stockholm next week.

We sent podcast host and self-proclaimed “expert on everything” Markus Herrmann on a road trip across Europe to find out how cities embrace the future of urban space. In this episode, we’re in Copenhagen, a city that is known for its incredible bicycle infrastructure. But the Danish capital has more to offer, eg. an artificial ski slope.
When it comes to urban mobility, Copenhagen is immediately mentioned as a prime example. After all, the Danish capital is considered the European capital of cycling. But apart from two-meter-wide cycle paths, what makes the development of the cityscape, and the mobility associated with it, so special?
If you take a look at the figures on bicycles, Copenhagen’s special position quickly becomes clear. An impressive 45 percent of the inhabitants commute to work, school or university by bike, covering around 1.4 million kilometres every day. According to a study, even more people in the Greater Copenhagen area bike to work every day than in the entire USA. There are five times more bicycles than cars in the city center, and only 14 percent of inhabitants drive a car every day.
It’s clear that with so much cycling traffic, new records are being set. The cycle path at Nørrebrogade, for example, is the world’s busiest cycle path, with up to 40,000 cyclists a day. Not only there, but in the entire city area, about 1,000 kilometers of cycle paths provide the right connection. Of these, 200 kilometers alone are high-speed cycle paths — so-called Cykelsuperstier — which are particularly well-developed and designed to prioritize bike traffic. These cycle paths are three meters wide, and the traffic lights along them are synchronized to create a “green wave” so cyclists don’t have to stop at intersections.
But it’s also the small things that show further thought is being given to cyclists here. For example, rubbish bins are oriented diagonally towards the cyclists, and there are footrests at the traffic lights so that cyclists don’t have to get out of their saddles while waiting.
Those who would like to take advantage of the cyclists’ paradise themselves are best served by the city bikes from the Bycyklen public bike hire system. After a short registration, you can rent one of the e-bikes and start cycling right away.
Bycycklen city bikes already have a long tradition in Copenhagen. In May 1995, the first 1000 city bikes rolled through Copenhagen’s streets. And when Bill Clinton came to Denmark for a state visit in 1997, he received the “City Bike One” as an official guest gift.
As progressive as the rental bike system might be, there have still been some unexpected setbacks. Until recently, e-bikes were equipped with tablets, which not only allowed you to rent the bike but also to view a map and information about the surrounding area. Unfortunately, due to heavy vandalism last year, all tablets were removed from the bikes.
Even though Copenhagen is completely flat and it hardly ever snows, there is one rather unexpected way of getting around: downhill skiing! Since the beginning of 2019, Copenhagen has a new landmark, the “CopenHill”. A ski slope was built on the roof of a waste incineration plant, on whose dry ski slope you can ski almost 100 meters down into the valley.
It is hard to believe it, but the waste incineration plant Amager Bakke inside the urban ski slope is one of many building blocks for Copenhagen’s next big goal: the city wants to become climate neutral by 2025. If it succeeds, Copenhagen would be the world’s first CO2-neutral capital. Since 2009, a multi-faceted plan has been underway to achieve this goal. What starts with rather obvious measures such as solar panels on public buildings extends to the optimization of menus in canteens and kindergartens. Copenhagen is on its way to become a sustainable model for the whole world — not only on the cycle path.
Markus Herrmann is a blogger, author, and member of the successful podcast “Gästeliste Geisterbahn”. For Porsche, he is testing the mobility level of the Back 2 Tape metropolises in Europe.
The project “Back 2 Tape” is a cooperation between the Porsche Newsroom and music journalist Niko Backspin. It follows the tracks of hip hop in Europe. All further information on this project can be found in the Porsche Newsroom.
An important note: Markus’ trip through Europe as well as “Back 2 Tape” were produced before the outbreak of COVID-19. Porsche, Backspin and the involved agencies and artists are aware of their social responsibility and advise against such a trip at this time out of consideration for the health and well-being of all people.

I’m from Brazil and I’ve been living in Copenhagen for 2 years. In Brazil we have more than 2000 freshwater fish species, but Pike isn’t one of them and I’ve always wanted to catch big Pike, after watching on TV how violent this fish is.
Looking for Pike in a lake in the middle of the city (Valby, Copenhagen)
I live 3 km away from an urban lake, so it was the first lake I wanted to try fishing in Denmark. Last year, in 2019, I went there 2 times in the summer and didn’t catch anything, and I considered the lake just dead water.
I wanted to give the lake another try in the summer this year, one year after my last trip to it. It was a Saturday in August and I was immediately greeted by a small pike, caught in a small weightless spinner (known in Brazil as “varejeira”) rigged with a bombarda (a kind of float with weight). My first pike ever! I finally crossed this specie off of my list. But still, far away from the big pikes that I saw on TV. Anyway, on this same day, I ended up catching more than 50 small pikes. It was basically one pike per cast!
The next day, Sunday, I got there after lunch and ended up catching dozens of small pikes and even small perches. I decided to move around the lake, until at 18:00, my friend Ricardo cast a small spinner and hooked a big one, which immediately got off the hook, due to how small the lure was. He agreed on me throwing my big wobbler right where he lost the pike and finally, I hooked the big one!
In my mind, it was huge, because I was used to hooking only tiny pikes! Five minutes afterwards, I cast close to where I caught the big one and I hooked one which appeared to be twice bigger than the previous one! Spot on! I finally found the one I was looking for! Even the previous pike could now be considered “small” compared to this one!
Going Bigger
Afterwards, I went there almost on a daily basis after work and hooked medium to big pikes constantly. I even got a reasonably sized one in an ultralight set with 0.08mm braided line (thin as a hair).
One day I decided to try a “pen toy rod” that I bought from China for only US$ 3 and I hooked a lot of small pikes.
Suddenly, I saw a wave nearby, and it was the biggest pike I’ve ever seem. It was just taking a look at the small pikes that I was releasing, in a place where it’s probably 15 to 20cm deep. I switched to my bait casting set and a bigger lure. Unfortunately it ignored all my casts. I switched more than 10 different lures, until I got it… but my fluorocarbon leader was only 0.35mm and it cut the line. I was hectic. I quickly tied another leader (still 0.35mm) and put a 16cm lure, and then I cast in parallel to the shallow area where the pike was. Unfortunately it was gone, it was a sad 5 minutes for me. Anyway, I decided to keep casting the 16cm lure parallel to the shallow surface, until suddenly, I hooked it! After fighting it, I managed to bring it out of the water!
A very long but thin pike. The head itself was bigger than 25cm. My record pike so far! And to think that it all started with the toy rod that day.
Halloween Night Pike Fishing (Going even Bigger)
As a Halloween challenge, I made my own Halloween pike lure and I went night pike fishing at the same lake! The night delivered 3 big pikes, all above 100 cm, where one of them was a BIG FAT MAMA (big curved belly when you hold it), my biggest and heaviest pike, and I wonder if this one is the biggest in that lake? I ended up getting one with my custom lure and 2 with a Danish lure made especially for pikes.
I can now identify the pikes from my local lake from their patterns and from their scars, and I even started calling them by name, because I caught some of the pikes more than once the past 3 months, that’s also the magic and emotion of catch and release! For me, it’s a very happy moment to release the fish and see it swimming back!
Never underestimate your backyard lake!

Part One: Onboarding
Moving to Copenhagen can be pretty overwhelming, and I found all the sequenced steps to be frustratingly unclear. To help you avoid running around in circles, I’ve put together a step-by-step guide to beginning your awesome new life in Copenhagen.
Each step must be done in order, or you risk wasting a lot of time.
Once you have your proof of residency and an address, you’ve unlocked the next set of tasks.
With your NemID and CPR number set up, you are finally eligible to get your yellow card, and set up your online life.
The following steps can be done with a bit more leisure, but most within 90 days of arrival.
Leaving — If you were to ever leave Copenhagen (and really, who would?) you have to go in reverse order and remove yourself from all these systems. Read more here.

The story sounds familiar: A utopian city where the streets are clean, traffic is orderly, and the people are tall, beautiful, and calm. It’s the stuff science fiction novels are made of…
I didn’t have many expectations for each city that we visited during this trip but I had some thoughts going to Copenhagen.
Some quick backstory:
I’ve grown up to with the American work ethic of the “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” kind. So to come to a country where socialism plays an important part of the governing system, it immediately brought thoughts of lazy dependence on an overtaxed government from beatnik no-doers. I should say that most of my understanding of socialism spews from good ‘ole propaganda-filled American public education. It has led me to believe that socialism is THE anti-American way of living and is often told much like a scary bedtime story to caution wayward capitalist children about the tyranny of the Soviet Union. 👻
In reality, Denmark is not a socialist state but rather it upholds a socialist democratic practice. The objective is not for the state to own the means of production but rather it refers to a political philosophy that supports economic and social policies that promote social justice in a capitalist economy in a democratic way. Most people see this through the way they govern a tax-financed health care service. (Universal healthcare 🚑) Others might refer to it as a social welfare country due to its extensive services for children, the elderly and the poor. Denmark also provides special provisions for universal education, support for unions or collective bargaining, and sensible (ostensibly) government regulation of industry to preserve the environment and health and welfare of people within the jurisdiction of the country. Either way you spin it, the country operates with private and publicly run businesses and Copenhagen is considered to be one of the top ranked best city in the world for standard of living. So with that in mind, I came to Copenhagen with a lot of curiosity for the way everything worked and operated.
Here’s a breakdown of our trip to Copenhagen:
We arrived in the late afternoon of our first day. CPH was quite nice and fairly large. Having flown a lot domestically within the US, it was a night/day comparison to see a privately-owned airport. (As compared to the airports owned by the government much like the Port Authority NY/NJ) Even the bus lines are privately owned in Copenhagen and I was mostly impressed by the clear signage, cleanliness, and on-time reliability.
We decided to purchase the 72-hour CityPass ticket to get around on public transit since it encompassed the entirety of our stay in Copenhagen. (We got in late our first day and left at noon on our last for a total of three days.) Public transit is a bit pricey here. A one-way ticket throughout the 3-zones that the city encompasses is $36 DK or $5.39 USD. So to purchase their $200 DK 72-hour card, it only cost about $30 USD for three days. We didn’t rent bikes this time around but rather walked. If I return again, I would rent a bike for the entirety of our stay since the city was very bike friendly and central to most points of interest.
Our Airbnb was conveniently located just a few blocks from the Nørrebro Station. Thom and I really enjoyed our stay there. Our guests were very welcoming and the apartment was very comfortable. If you follow me on any other social media, then you’d know that I’ve already posted a short video of our stay.
A lot of the time making this video was spent find creative ways to shoot still video without a tripod though. 😝
The location of our Airbnb was absolutely great! Again, we were very close to public transit but also a short walk away from The Lakes, Copenhagen’s Botanical Gardens and parks, grocery stores, and the famous Torvehallerne.
On our first evening, we walked over the Lakes and ate at Thai Pan. I’ll admit that food is a bit pricey in Copenhagen in general, but this restaurant had a great three-course menu that provided us with a lot of leftovers for the next day. They make a super tasty coconut soup with chicken and mushrooms. That alone was well-worth the price and trip!
Also that first night, I received the best email that I could ever imagine:
Noma has an open spot for you and one other to dine on the following day. Would we care to join?
WOULD WE CARE TO JOIN??!! WOULD WE EVER!
I think that I’ll save that experience for it’s own special post since the meal was over 3.5 hours long and consisted of 14 courses and a tour of the kitchen and grounds. Long story short:
It. was. amazing. 😍
The other two days we spent walking around site-seeing. We visited:
One place that we did not have time to see was Tivoli Gardens. I still don’t know if I regret this or if this was something to easy miss. I haven’t been to a theme park since my short visit to Disney World over three years ago. The idea of long lines, large crowds, and rollercoasters just doesn’t appeal like it used to when I was 14. But Tivoli is one of the world’s oldest theme parks and has some beautiful gardens. If I had the chance again, I think that I would go to see and visit the grounds alone.
Here are some shots from our stay in Copenhagen:
Some shots around Christiania. You aren’t allowed to photograph some parts within the free state:
Out and about Copenhagen, including: The Lakes, Botanical Gardens, and Nyhavn:
And that was it! An overall great impression of the city. What really stuck out to me was the overall infrastructure of the city and how well maintained it is. I enjoyed the serenity found in the heart of the city and loved the fact that people were out and about strolling in the parks or by the Lakes late into the evenings. My only criticism is the near-perfect state of everything. There weren’t any brash forms of expression of any kind whether through the city itself or it’s people. It’s of no surprise that a place like Christiania had established it self so long ago. It acts as the only visual protest of all the conformity found throughout the rest of Copenhagen. Even staying in the multicultural Nørrebro neighborhood, I felt that there was a tragic loss of diversity, especially compared to places like Berlin and Amsterdam. (SO many blonde-haired, blue-eyed people everywhere in Copenhagen!)
It’s truly a give and take with this city with this ultimately in mind: High prices for a better standard of living.
My last take: Not to live in, but I would visit again.
This post is a part of a series based on my recent two-week trip to Europe.

In June, the Civic Commons Learning Network in partnership with the Better Block Foundation hosted Civic Commons Learning Journey: Copenhagen, a four-day study trip that immersed learning network members in the public life, policy and culture of the city. Through explorations of the city by bike and frank conversations with local leaders on the work they are pursuing, we considered how the city is building and sustaining public assets that deliver more public value. On our final day in Copenhagen, we hosted a workshop session to distill learning from the two dozen participants representing Akron, Detroit and Philadelphia.
Here are 10 key lessons from the trip:
Copenhagen is known as being one of the most liveable cities in the world. But it wasn’t always this way. In the early ’90s, the city faced bankruptcy. Seeing a bleak future, the leaders of the city came together to create several strategies for change. One of these was to focus on pilot projects. The city began to expand and scale pedestrian street conversions originally built in the 1960s and parking lots that, in the 1980s, had been transformed into public squares. The goal was to create visible changes quickly that would encourage the citizens to come together. Just as important as the pilot projects was following up with permanent investments when the pilots proved successful.
In the ’60s, many cities around the world expanded their freeway infrastructure by building elevated highways. But when this idea was proposed in Copenhagen people protested. In the ’90s, when the city was nearing bankruptcy and had little money to invest, it put the money where it could be stretched — toward bicycling infrastructure.
Copenhagenize, which highlights cycling life in Copenhagen, said that because infrastructure investments of the ’60s and ’90s made it easier to bike, more people started biking. In fact, now 56 percent of Copenhageners use a bike every day. By making bicycling the most convenient option, and by keeping the cycling infrastructure simple and legible, Copenhagen has made biking the easiest, fastest and cheapest mode of transportation. “Copenhageners are just as lazy as you are,” said Morten Kabell, COO of Copenhagenize. “Fifty percent of us only ride a bicycle because the city of Copenhagen has made it fast and easy.”
In Denmark, design is everything. Every single element of every single space has been designed with the user in mind. One small example: trash cans. Each trash can has a lip on the outside for cans and glass. This way, it’s easier for people who need those items to grab them for recycling.
The city has also found ways to maximize its spaces by taking down the fences and designing areas to support a wide variety of activities. An example: a large courtyard next to a marketplace that serves as both a schoolyard playground and common space with a basketball court. During lunch, multiple worlds collide in one cohesive space. And in terms of policy, the city is redesigning all of its schoolyards to be fenceless so they are open and welcoming to the community.
We ended our trip at Gehl Architects, where Mayra Madriz talked through the firm’s approach to building cities, highlighting the importance of design. “Consider urban life before urban space and urban space before buildings,” Mayra said.
Copenhagen’s architecture policy promotes a people-first approach. Chief City Architect Tina Saaby holds position of influence, advising politicians and city administrators alike. When a development proposal crosses her desk, her first question is, “Who is the landscape architect?” She recognizes that the space between buildings is where public life either thrives or fails to thrive.
When a crisis faces Copenhagen, the city’s response often comes in the form of investments in public life. While bankruptcy spurred some of the best bike infrastructure in the world, climate change catalyzed the concept of cloud burst parks. This network of green public spaces mitigates flooding by holding and filtering excess water. They also serve as a natural playscape.
For significant neighborhood-wide investments, the project managers from the city’s urban planning department don’t do their jobs from city hall or in an administrative building downtown. Instead, they work in the neighborhood’s culture house. For example, Eva Christensen and Sia Boensen, project managers in the neighborhood of Nørrebro, lead a diverse team of architects, planners and social scientists who will be based in the community for six years. Their mission involves co-creating a set of projects. Together with neighbors, they’ll reimagine Hans Tavsens Park as a cloud burst park that combines stormwater management with recreation, complete neighborhood-wide transportation planning and develop safe streets. But the city and the planning team see their work as much more than capital projects. The team is also interested in understanding existing social networks and the exploring the connecting between infrastructure investments and building social capital.
Whimsy. That was the one word that kept coming to mind when visiting the various parks and public spaces throughout Copenhagen. Trampolines embedded in sidewalks are just the start. Each park was unique, playful and a reflection of the neighborhood that surrounded it. For example, Monstrum, a playground design company, created the Crooked Houses in the Brumbley neighborhood. The houses can be climbed in and on, slid down and crawled between. They are a near-identical reflection of the neighborhood homes, yet slightly topsy-turvy.
But the parks in Copenhagen aren’t just about kids. They allow for unexpected moments of joy, relaxation and, in some cases, the thrill of fear for all ages. At Folkets Park, for example, a bridge was designed that wasn’t reflective of the community’s needs, so a new designer transformed the bridge into a parkour course. The bridge has self-moderating aspects (such as a second step that is too high for most children to make) to keep it safe while still allowing for a thrill. And many parks offer cafe kiosks for adults to buy a coffee and chat with a friend or a stranger.
From Torvehallerne to Reffen by Copenhagen Street Food, there is no shortage of great food markets in Copenhagen. These sites are serving as on-ramps for entrepreneurs to test their products. They make it easier for vendors to focus on their products, while providing shared services like bathrooms, seating, trash, permitting and marketing. They also happen to be public spaces capable of attracting people from every background, if they keep an eye on price points to ensure they remain welcoming to all. Reffen’s founder, Dan Husted, has proven his concept once before with a temporary food court that gained acclaim. He hopes to do the same with this new concept in a forgotten area. “We decide the primary colors, then we invite the public to paint the canvas,” he says.
Jacob Hartmann is an instigator turned city bureaucrat, and his Sharing Copenhagen mini-grants capture a spirit of “yes” in a way not often seen in municipal government. The grants are tied to the vision for the city and allow everyday citizens to test new ideas for change, from a floating sauna to a pop-up farm to a program that encourages hitchhiking. And when the easy answer is “no,” we can’t allow for that, he works with urban innovators to get to “maybe” — and sometimes asks for permission later. From inside city government, he has developed a program that fosters active citizen engagement in making the city more sustainable, and more fun.
Nearly every city has them: natural features that were once polluted and still carry the stigma of being dirty and unsafe. Just 15 years ago, the water in Copenhagen’s harbour was so polluted that it posed a health risk. Alongside unsexy municipal efforts to make the waters clean, like wastewater treatment plants and a modernized sewage system, the city also made public space investments like the harbour baths, parks and pathways along the water that have drastically changed the use and narrative of this waterfront. Now harbour baths are packed on warm summer days, a bicycle chef uses a harbourside spot as his homebase and a maritime education center cultivates oysters and mussels in the urban waterways.
There are many reasons Copenhagen is studied, imitated and beloved. The bicycling infrastructure alone makes it something to strive for. However, the city is not perfect. No city is. While we experienced many beautiful examples of infrastructure, public space and collaboration in Copenhagen, we were jarred by the discussion of race, immigration and who truly belonged. Or, perhaps, by the lack of discussion. In some of our conversations and experiences in the city, multiculturalism was characterized as a burden, rather than a value. This article offers context for what we witnessed.
It was a stark reminder of why Reimagining the Civic Commons holds socioeconomic mixing as a goal for public space investments. Bringing people of all backgrounds to share in public life and build trust will not happen without intention.
We realized that, while we went to Copenhagen to study and be inspired, our demonstrations cities are inspirational, too. Through their approach to revitalizing and connecting public assets, they are setting a new standard for advancing civic engagement and “creating the welcome.” This realization reflects the value of learning journeys: they create moments for team members to experience, to learn, and to reflect on our shared work with a fresh perspective.

Copenhagen is the best of Europe distilled into one city, the continent at its most perfect.
From the airport, we take the metro, a clean, modern train, glass-walled to let in the pale sunlight. The airport was like this too, not the gray, military aesthetic of Reykjavik where we had a layover, but a space with curves and glass and white paint.
The ride reminds me that I’m back in Europe. Well-dressed people in coats and scarves and shoes that click against the ground step on and off. The train moves with an almost silent whir down tracks that look new but must be at least a century old. Outside, red-brick houses flash by that make me think of England: the same gabled, tiled roofs, the same compactness.
Our hostel is in the Nørrebro district, at the end of a long, connected row of 19th century red-brick buildings. On the way, we pass falafel and shawarma places, cool, dark bars in tiny storefronts, and well-lit cafes where people work on laptops. There’s at least one bike shop on every street so far, and special bike lanes separated from the road where the cyclists breeze by with enviable nonchalance.
The hostel is simultaneously hip and cozy: long wooden tables, old, circular metal lamps shining dark yellow light, and a bar that sells both coffee and beer. Large windows look out onto the quiet street, where a row of parked bikes points down to a 19th century building, mostly brick but renovated to include a glass elevator, and a church on the adjacent block looming against the gray sky.
We check in with the receptionist, who like everyone here looks at once elegant and casual, with blonde hair in a ponytail and the sleeves of her gray sweater rolled up to reveal forearm tattoos. Our room is in a separate building, and we get there by following a trail of sheep painted onto the sidewalk.
Out primal need is sleep, but after washing up, we head out to find food. Yelp suggests a “toast bar” which proves to be excellent, with dark, rich coffee and sandwiches smothered in various melted cheeses. The barista is a guy with a beanie, a beard, and tattoos who talks in a loud, echoing voice and looks like he runs a bike shop part-time. There are a few others in the cafe, but two are on laptops and the other two are a couple who aren’t talking, which gives the room a strange silence. We sit at the window, where a candle drips white wax onto the counter. Outside, bundled up pedestrians walk small dogs. In the building facing us, a guy stands at the window, having an intense cell-phone conversation. Across the street is another cafe, with a black exterior, a dark interior, and a small chalkboard sign advertising pricey lunch specials. To the left is a park with a modernist sculpture of twisted metal bars and a brick apartment building with the words “FREE GAZA” written in large, white block letters.
At one point, the two women working on their laptops go outside to smoke. They leave their jackets inside and stand huddled in their sweaters, breathing out a mix of smoke and cold breath.
From there, we walk down to what I at first think is a river or a canal but later learn is an artificial lake, created back in the Middle Ages. Across the water, the houses have that grand, 19th century look: mansard roofs, symmetrical windows, brick and stucco painted various shades of red and white. They go on endlessly down the bank and remind me of Budapest, but with warmer colors. People walk dogs and linger along the grass and feed the swans. A couple sits on a bench, talking about sex in Danish-accented and perfectly articulate English. I notice that everyone in Copenhagen is as young as we are, as if the city exists only for millennials. Los Angeles by contrast always feels slightly older, a city for tired people in their late thirties and early forties.
We cross the lake at a large embankment, along a pedestrian path separated from the busy street by trees and manicured shrubbery and past a large white pavilion, late 19th or early 20th century, situated along the water. On the other side of the lake, the street becomes H.C. Andersens Boulevard, and the buildings are bigger are more varied. Across the street is a brick building that’s an unfortunate mix of architectural styles — a neo-Gothic crenelated tower centered between two large, gabled roofs, like an orphanage from a Dickens’ novel, 19th century kitsch — and beyond it rise the flat roofs of the 20th century and the shining glass walls of the 21st. We walk leisurely down the sidewalk in these buildings’ shadows while everything breezes by us, the bikes and the cars and the pedestrians walking briskly in coats and scarves, all moving with a comforting urban indifference.
Traffic here is the densest we’ve seen in Denmark, as busy as Wilshire or Santa Monica Boulevard. Somehow, though, it all seems more orderly, less chaotic, as if like everything else here, it too is better regulated.
#
In the center of the city and across from the train station sits Tivoli Gardens, an 1840s-era amusement park supposedly built to distract the country’s population from protesting the absolute monarchy, now bedecked with Christmas lights and related items: trees, gnomes, snowmen, a building lined with several austere Nutcrackers, a wooden reindeer that looks like a Trojan Horse, a strange mirrored wall mounted with polar bear heads wearing Santa hats. There are lots of children about, and the adults are mostly mothers in groups pushing strollers, or young couples enjoying the kitsch. The park is like Disneyland, and was in fact one of the inspirations, though it’s smaller and quainter and less corporate. There are different sections corresponding to regions of the world — some pagodas representing either China or Japan, domed mosques for the Middle East or India, a lighthouse and a pirate ship possibly signifying Europe. It’s only vaguely and benignly racist, and nothing out of the ordinary for the 19th century. Bronze statues from that era are sprinkled throughout the park, including one of the founder, Georg Carstensen, looking proud and dapper with his mustache and top hat.
We stroll leisurely through the crowds, past food stands and stores selling magnets and memorabilia. I buy a glogg, which tastes pleasantly warm on a day this cold, though the best part is getting to recycle the plastic cup in one of the futuristic red kiosks, which lowers my cup down into the void with a mechanical whir and then gives me back 5 kroner. It’s an extremely practical and efficient solution to incentivize recycling, which is probably why the United States would never use it.
In the middle of the park we find an octagonal glass theater, a replica of one built in the late 1800s, which Nazi sympathizers burned down in the 1940s. Out beyond the walls of Tivoli, meanwhile, rises city hall, red brick towers capped with green spires, built in the early 20th century but speaking much more of the 1600s.
In this moment, I feel very close to the past. Like the crenelations on city hall, it feels like a ring surrounding us. Take away the phones and the electric lights and make the coats longer and give everyone top hats and we might as well be in the 1800s when the park first opened. Take away the park and give everyone ruffled collars and we’d be in the 1600s. Only 600 years before that, and we’d all be Vikings in huts.
#
The National Gallery, or the Statens Museum for Kunst, is across the city, though still within walking distance. It’s colder now, so we pull our scarves tighter as we walk down the empty streets. Soon we reach the white stone of Christiansborg Palace, and across the canal from it, along Nybrogade, a row of picturesque 17th and 18th century houses, narrow and built against each other, painted red and white and dark-brown. The sunset above streaks the sky with wisps of purple and brings out the color of each building. Even the yellow construction crane is more vivid and seems a remnant of past centuries.
We reach a small bridge and cross it into a Christmas market selling gnome statues and wooden souvenirs, and food of course. I smell sausages and see mushrooms simmering in a vat of butter. Behind me, the sun dips behind two rows of houses on opposite sides of a canal, and paints the whole scene, including a distant bronze statue, in a cold, yellow light — a sunset-hued cityscape, postcard-perfect, on all sides colors like an artist’s palette.
The city darkens as we move across it, past contemporary shops and dark streets and cyclists. It’s only 4:00, but it feels much later. A languor settles over us, and I remember our lack of sleep.
We reach Rosenborg Slot, Christian IV’s 17th century palace, and we walk across the park behind it, down a path lined with trees whose bare branches meet overhead. The castle looks romantically sinister silhouetted through the trees, but also small, “like a toy castle” K______ says, especially next to the block-long 19th century houses stretching down the parallel street. The park and the castle remind me of Oxford — a small patch of the past preserved despite the various encroaching presents pushing in from all around.
Just past the park is the museum, a grand, 19th century building reminiscent of museums from Britain, built to reflect the glory of the nation, or whatever. We’re both tired and cold, but on the walk up the large steps I feel exhilaration.
Inside, we find familiar European art. There’s a Titian portrait of a gentleman staring thoughtfully off to the left, a painting by a follower of Bosch of tiny figures against a bleak brown landscape, and quite a few Lucas Cranachs — various women with big heads and weird chins, and one work titled Melancholy depicting three oddly shaped infants trying to push a stone ball through a hoop with sticks while a winged woman watches them wistfully and several witches ride goats in a distant corner. But the highlights of the museum are the Danish pieces, a tour through one of the lesser known traditions of European art. In the first room are portraits of Danish royals from the 17th century and 18th century, all painted by the same Swedish-born court painter, C.G. Pilo, and opposite them, portraits of the bourgeoisie by Jens Juel, the most prominent one of an odd-looking middle-class family standing before a plantation. The room’s juxtaposition is perfect, ingeniously displaying the fundamental change of the 18th century, the rise and triumph of the bourgeoisie in all their awkward glory.
The next room has allegorical and historical paintings, and the following room works from the Romantic Era inspired by Caspar David Friedrich. A late-19th century room has some vaguely orientalist paintings of reclining women by Elisabeth Baumann and a wonderful work by Carl Bloch, of a man and two women eating dinner at a table and staring in surprise back at the viewer, their wine carafes tellingly half-empty, a guilty look on the man’s face. I assume his wife must be the viewer, having just caught him in the early stages of what might have become a threesome.
There’s also a beautiful late-19th century piece by J.F. Willumsen, titled En bjergbestigerske (A Mountain Climber), of a woman in a white sweater standing in front of a mountain, her walking stick leaning casually behind her, her cloak hanging lightly off her shoulders, and her hip thrust to the side as she looks boldly into the distance. According to the plaque, Willumsen’s artistic movement was called vitalism, and vitality is exactly what the woman gives off. She is more alive than the inert, distant mountains, a triumph of humanity over nature, her fierce stare made bolder by the vaguely impressionistic style of the piece, the soft colors and the murky brush strokes.
Finally, there’s a room of paintings by Vilhelm Hammershøi: cold, melancholy portraits of empty artist’s studios and solitary women, like sad Vermeers. Everything is cast over in a gray-blue pallor, all bleak, forlorn — how appropriate for the dawn of the 20th century.
We leave around 6:00 PM, very tired now, and buy falafel and shawarma from near our apartment. We eat in the hostel common room, quickly, not talking, plastic bags and foil strewn everywhere. Back in our rooms, we shower and are asleep by 8:00.
#
Biking in Copenhagen is exhilarating. We sail without much effort along cold winds, over bridges, down through old buildings, along wall-paved, separated bike lanes. Cold air whips at my face and nose and my poorly wrapped scarf comes untangled in the wind, but it all feels glorious moving among the herd of cyclists, not worrying about passing cars, feeling safety in numbers. We stop at an intersection behind a cluster of ten bikes, mostly young people like ourselves, some mothers with babies strapped into tiny seats, a few older men who look fitter than me, everyone leaning gracefully to one side as they wait for the light to change.
#
Christiansborg Palace, the old seat of the monarchy and the current seat of Parliament, is largely a lesser-Versailles, a 20th-century reconstruction of the site’s various older palaces which all burned down. But amidst the standard set of stately and filigreed reception rooms we find the Great Hall, a room whose expensive chandeliers and 18th century allegorical ceiling are belied by the floor tiles’ 20th-century black and white pattern and, the room’s highlight, the 17 ultra-modern tapestries. They chronicle Denmark’s history, from the Viking era to the 21st century, and are done in a self-consciously non-Western style, reminiscent of Diego Rivera’s murals in Mexico City, with vivid, wild colors, bright reds and dark greens and deep purples. We take our time before several of them, using the laminated guides to identify the various figures. Some names I know — the Viking Kings Ragnar Lothbrok and Harald Bluetooth, the Arab traveler Ibn Fadlan, Margaret “the Lady King” of the medieval Kalmar Union — but most are unrecognizable, a rush of history that swirls together in all the bright color.
There’s one tapestry titled “The Future” depicting two men in suits hovering in a nebula of blue and purple, surrounded by floating microbes and crystals and drawings of atoms and solar systems, “the bionic men” as K______ calls them. The irony of course is that Denmark already is the future: a country with safe bike lanes and universal healthcare and free higher education and a minimum wage twice as high as the United States and 5 weeks paid vacation and 32 weeks paid family leave and 85% voter turnout and overall some of the happiest people in the world.
#
The National Museum has an impressive collection of historical artifacts. We spend most of our time on the bottom floor, amidst the pre-Viking stuff, prehistoric arrowheads and cerated harpoons and burnt animals bones offered as ritual sacrifices. There are large skeletons of an aurochs and an elk, and a grave from 5000 BC with the bones of a 40-year-old woman and her 3-year-old child. The description tell us she survived several blows to the head.
Farther down we reach the Bronze Age, where we find more bodies and objects preserved in bogs or unearthed from barrows: swords, helmets, shields, jewelry, a wooden folding chair from 1400 BC, a tree-trunk coffin from 1370 with the remains of the Egtved Girl, her ragged clothing, bits of her skin and teeth, and a large bronze belt. Later, in the Iron Age we find a metal carriage pulled up from a bog, with large wheels and small decorative details, and following that the Gundestrup cauldron, a large silver bowl decorated with strange non-Viking figures and animal imagery, evidence of Denmark’s early connections with the wider world. Beyond them, finally, is the Viking era, where we find shining swords and shields, drinking horns of various sizes, large rune stones etched with unfamiliar letters, and the remnants of a wooden longboat.
The museum’s most interesting item, though, is the Trundholm sun chariot, from 1800 BC: a bronze statue of the sun pulled along in a chariot by a small horse. The sun is still gilded on one side and shines brightly in the dark museum gallery
I find this evidence of Bronze Age spirituality particularly fascinating. In our modern world the word “religion” has developed such negative connotations, dogmatism, stupidity, intolerance. But everything in this museum, from this chariot to the Early Modern allegorical ceilings on the floor above us to the animal bones in the Paleolithic room, show the need for some kind of religion — perhaps not the ones we have today, that speak of abstract principles of righteousness and morality, but ones like these, of people who viewed the afterlife and the supernatural in the literal terms of their own small worlds, who buried themselves with the physical objects they imagined they might need in whatever awaited them hereafter.
What would we be buried with, I wonder? Our phones perhaps?
#
Later, at the Christiansborg Palace stables, I notice how similar the royal carriages look to the iron age wagon pulled up from the bog.
#
We walk back along Rantzausgade, looking for a place to eat. Signs of Danish coziness are everyone, people visible in windows seated around a table, not bundled up like we are, candles before them, all eating and drinking slowly while relaxing and talking, signs of community, of warmth, inviting from the cold. We see one such group in a well-lit interior, drinking wine around half-empty plates, and I can’t tell if it’s a restaurant or just young people having dinner at home. Because of all the glass walls and big windows, at night every interior becomes so well lit, so easy to see from the street. The lack of privacy feels deliberate, as if as if projecting this image of coziness is part of the charm of the city.
We find a small place, run by a woman who both cooks and takes orders. We sit at the well-lit window, next to the dark street and split a hummus sandwich, vegan chili, and a nice, fruity Danish IPA. Afterwards, K______ goes to sleep, but I stay up in hostel with a pilsner and write. Around me is the same atmosphere I saw in all the windows. A group of Spanish tourists are chatting at my long table, everyone in sweaters rolled up at the sleeves, their scarves and jackets piled on a chair in the corner. A candle flickers in a holder amidst their beers, and mellow music plays from overhead. I feel a pleasant warmth from the outside cold.
#
The buildings on the canal-side streets of Christianshavn are nicer, richer — some are older, painted red and ochre, and some are made of brick, and along the waterfront are a few modern apartments, red stone reinforced with black metal.
Nearby is an 18th century warehouse, a long, beige, brick building, bland, unassuming, rectangular. Now it houses an art gallery and the Michelin-starred restaurant Noma, supposedly the best in the world. Dinner there would have been 2000 KR (roughly 250 dollars) each, for 6 courses. Another tourist couple are taking pictures under the sign. It’s not yet open, and the inside is mostly dark, save for the candles flickering in the window. A white shape, probably a waiter, moves in the shadows beyond the yellow flames.
Beside the warehouse is an old wooden, ship, tied to the dock and resting silently in the water. A man sits on it, eyes closed, so still he’s almost part of the boat. Against the contemporary black steel of the apartment behind it, the ship looks particularly ancient.
The warehouse’s art gallery features an Icelandic artist, whose work deals with water and climate change and methods of measurement. One of the sculptures on the second floor is a ticking clock, which echoes through the bright and empty room.
Because of the new light wood flooring and the white, newly painted walls, it’s hard to imagine this gallery as a warehouse. I try to see the sacks of grain and barrels of herring that would have lined the walls, ready to load onto merchant ships like the one outside — but I can’t. The space seems like it was built not in 1767 but in 2015, as an artistic aperitif for the haute-bourgeois diners of Noma.
#
We have lunch at Copenhagen Street Food — a hipster food market located in a former paper factory — and then bike farther north towards Refshaleøen, an old industrial area that our guidebook recommended, now mostly used for warehouse parties. The ride up takes us off the main road and along a smaller bike path that winds between broad, grassy plains, and past varied and interesting buildings, some contemporary glass and steel, some pre-industrial brick and stone. We cross a small bridge, and a large fluttering Danish flag comes into view, and below it a statue of what looks like a merman holding aloft a smaller Danish flag, angled forward, like he’s carrying it into battle. In the distance is a strange-shaped factory, a square metal hulk with a rounded top, sending darkish-white smoke up into the grey sky. The sun is still hidden, as it has been all day, and the air is bitterly cold, but the sense of adventure is enough to keep us going. Wind whips at my face, my nose is numb, my cheeks stinging, and I can feel the cold through my gloves as they’re stretched across the handlebars — but we’re moving so quickly, flying around concrete roads, bouncing across gravel, following the memory of a Google Map through an unfamiliar landscape, past signs we can’t read, the grey warehouses growing larger ahead of us. Only a few cars pass us, one or two vans, one bus, a handful of cyclists, and so it feels to us as though the landscape is all ours, Denmark a private playground.
We reach the end of a gravel road, where it meets the water. Behind us is the Mikkeler warehouse. Cinder blocks lie stacked outside the sheds and a few old cars sit empty and rusting. Everything is quiet now, and the warehouse windows dark, and no one is about expect the solitary biker who’d pulled up to a building somewhere behind us. We walk our bikes across old metal tracks which run along the gravel next to the concrete barrier separating us from the water. It’s quiet, peaceful, and majestic, to look out across the water at the row of brick buildings, now the familiar skyline of Copenhagen, the grey sky bringing out their pre-modern red. Behind us, the word “Refshaleøen” looms, written in big black letters across a gray factory building.
We take in the landscape for several long moments, our hearts still beating from our bike ride. Evidence of history stands all around us, the 18th and 19th centuries in brick out across the water, the 20th in metal stretching out behind us — but right now, it feels emphatically like the present, nothing else but 21st century, and I don’t wish we were anytime else.
After a moment, a white car turns a corner to our right and approaches us with bright headlights. The spell broken, we mount our bikes and ride back into the city.
#
From there we bike to Nyhavn then up to Amalienborg Palace, where the queen lives. We watch the guards in blue and black doing a march, which makes me think of England and Buckingham Palace. The idea of monarchy seems even more absurd up here.
From there we go inside the large church we’d seen from across the canal. It’s big and grand, but I don’t feel impressed, perhaps because Christianity hasn’t figured so prominently here. It may be the country’s Protestantism, but also probably that the religion in general only reached Scandinavia in the late 900s. It’s been Protestant almost as long as it’s been Catholic, and it was pagan up until almost the Crusades. A thousand years of Church history and tradition don’t even exist here. Warehouses seem better symbols of Copenhagen than churches.
From there, we go to the Danish Design Museum, where we find among other things an exhibit on chairs. “The chair is one of the most culture-bearing objects we ever invented,” the description says. “It reveals everything about the age and society in which it was created.” A folding chair from the 20th century makes me think of the folding chair from the bog we saw yesterday at the history museum — as with the carriages, a consistency from past to present.
From there, we bike up to the Little Mermaid Statue. The sun has almost set now, and to our right over green hills rises a stone church, beautifully backlit against the fading day. We pass though the Kastellet, a star fortress from the 1600s, the walls now mostly crumbling stone. We walk our bikes between quaint red buildings and watch three soldiers conduct a flag ceremony. They look like Boy Scouts rather than grown men.
The Mermaid is naked, like a Greek statue, and very sad, sitting atop a pile of rocks and looking longingly out across the water. It’s 4:30 now, and practically dark. Across the canal, we can see Refshaleøen, where we just were, the black letters written on the gray building. It seems so far to have come in just half a day.
#
Rosenborg Palace is dark and poorly lit, as expected in a 17th century building, and outside the latticed windows rain falls from a gray sky. But inside, the various royal treasures sparkle: gilded chests, fine wooden cabinets, small objects of ivory and amber, paintings ranging from humble landscapes to wild allegories to austere portraits of men, women, and horses, all in all an impressive collection that takes us from the castle’s construction in 1606 under Christian IV to the end of Denmark’s absolute monarchy in 1848. On the top floor is the throne room with antechambers holding the King’s collections of glass and porcelain, and in the basement is the royal treasury, with crowns and scepters and gold rings. The palace’s most interesting object, though, is tucked away in a small glass case against a wall of one of the 19th century rooms: the pen King Frederick VII used to sign the 1849 constitution.
Afterwards, we go to the Worker’s Museum where instead of rooms glorifying individual Kings we find a space honoring the nameless millions of the 20th century. In the central hall where union leaders once met hang the flags of various labor organizations, most of them a vivid, socialist red against the beige walls. In one of the exhibits in the basement, several old union flags have been stitched together into a single red banner, now reading “HOPE NOT FEAR”.
One of the rooms has a small exhibit on Thorvald Stauning, Denmark’s first social democratic prime minister, elected in 1924, and the country’s longest serving PM of the 20th century. He came from a working class background and trained as a cigar sorter before getting involved in politics. We stare at his big, bearded face in some surprise. As we’d just learned, Denmark had still been an absolute monarchy only 74 years before. And now, 90 years after, it’s one of the world’s preeminent social democracies.
If Denmark can change that much so quickly, then why can’t we, the United States, already born as a republic?
#
The only thing that frustrates us here in Denmark is the small window for lunch. It’s 3:00 and we’re wandering Kødbyen, the former meatpacking district in Vesterbro, going warehouse to warehouse only to find that most of the bourgeois restaurants are closed until dinner at 6:00. The fish place our guidebook recommended is open till 3:30, but it looks too expensive. The Indian restaurant does take-out only. A pub serving beer and burgers is open all day, but it looks like something we could find in Los Angeles. Eventually, at 3:30, we sit down in a packed Italian place. Neither of us particularly wants Italian food, but we’re both hungry. After ten minutes, though, the waiters still haven’t brought us menus, so we get up and leave. The waitress gives us an irritated look as we button up our coats.
We eat ultimately at Øl & Brød, a slightly upscale lunch place attached to the Mikkeller bar we were at earlier, open till 4:00. The tables have white tablecloths and the clientele is mostly older, except for a group of six posh guys in their early 20s, all wearing sweaters over button-downs and with the same expensive haircut, like some Danish version of the Bullingdon Club. We’re too hungry to bother converting the prices on the menu until after we order. The food is delicious: 3 open faced sandwiches (smørrebrød) and a savory chicken tartelet filled with gravy.
When the bill comes, we have just enough cash to cover it.
#
One our final day, we wait on the empty platform for our mid-morning train to Stockholm. It was warmer earlier, and even a little sunny — but now the sky is gray again and the temperature dropping.
Now and then a train passes with the smooth sound of sliding metal, and the occasional bundled up pedestrian or cyclist moves by on the street above. But for the most part everything is quiet and almost desolate. The tracks would be abandoned-looking if they weren’t so pristine and well-maintained. But this ghost-town quality is an appropriate way to bid farewell to Copenhagen, as we felt it several times over the last few days, from Nørrebro to Refshaleøen to Kødbyen. As always, everyone must be inside now, staying warm behind the yellow lights.
In looking at all the buildings, I can’t help, of course, but note the mix of centuries: the brick train station of the early 20th century in the foreground, the elegant mansard roofs of the 19th century repeating down along the street, the distant concrete of the late 20th century, and out beyond the floating glass and steel of today.
Dominating the horizon is the ugly SAS hotel, a Le-Corbusier-inspired tower of misguided modernity. There was a brief section on it in the Design Museum, about how when it was constructed in the 1950s, the architect Arne Jacobsen sincerely believed it would be the pinnacle of architectural form, functionalism perfected. It looks even worse here than similar buildings do in the United States, too clumsy next to the elegant brick or the floating glass. But considering everything else we saw, its imperfection is forgivable.

Back in 2014, the news in Copenhagen was that the modal share bikes exploded between 2012 and 2013, from 36% to 45%. A whopping 9% increase in people arriving at a destination in the City of Copenhagen for work or education. That had never happened anywhere before. At the same time, the modal share for motorists fell from 27% to 23%.
We were in the midst of one of the greatest urban transport experiments in the world, and didn’t really realise it.
For years I’ve espoused the benefits of following the simple traffic planning guide at the top of this article. Prioritise the three, inherently inter-modal transport forms on the left — bikes, pedestrians and public transport — and make driving a car a pain the ass. Make it the slower option, make it more expensive and difficult, and you’re on your way to a bright transport future. I call it A2Bism. It’s what every human who has ever lived wants the most: to go quick from A to B. Humans are like rivers — we’ll always seek out the quickest route.
So what happened between 2012 and 2013 in Copenhagen? The City made it a pain in the ass to drive a car. Not on purpose, mind you. The construction of a new Metro line, with 17 stations, was underway and, in a glorious coincidence of bad municipal communication, the city also dug up streets to upgrade the pipes for our district heating. The city was one big squiggly line — primarily for cars. In biannual surveys since the 1990s, a continuous majority of Copenhageners have declared that their primary reason for riding a bike is the fact that it’s the quickest way from A2B. The City inadvertently enabled them to go to the next level, at the expense of car traffic.
Fast-forward to late 2019. The new Metro ring line has just opened. The contstruction hoarding has been removed and roads are returning to how they were before the work began. This great urban experiment is going to go one of two ways. Either the City learns from it and keeps that squiggly line or we just return to the car-centric status quo we started with.
I’ve never been a fan of the Metro expansion. A city this size doesn’t need a metro — it needs tramways like so many other cities in Europe. I don’t advocate shoving citizens underground. They should be on street level on foot, on bicycle and in trams. My colleagues around Europe basically point and laugh when I tell them that we have bus routes with 50,000 passengers a day and the City ISN’T building tramways. The main problem in Copenhagen is that we have so much money and we have delusions of grandeur.
But hey. I guess I didn’t succeed in talking the city out of building the metro expansion. The new M3 line doesn’t go anywhere new. It just spins around in a circle and goes to places that have been easily accessible by bike for over a century. The Metro has been falsely advertising travel times for years. Advertising station to station, but not the first and last mile to and from the station. I sent out a team a few years ago to map travel times using real world scenarios and — no surprise — the bike usually beats the Metro in Copenhagen.
There are more great statistics from the glorious period of 2012–2013. The average bike trip length in Copenhagen rose 35% from 3.2 km to 4.2 km between 2012 and 2013. That means that the oft-quoted statistic about how Copenhageners cycle 1.2 million km a day needed to be upgraded to 2,006,313 km per day.
When the results of the travel survey came out back in 2014, journalists were scrambling for answers. Two researchers at DTU were “surprised”. They were quoted in the Danish press as saying things like, “uh… the City’s new bridges and traffic calming on certain streets seem to have worked. Giving cyclists carrots encourage cycling.”
The detail they forgot was that the new cycling bridges weren’t finished yet, nor was the traffic calming on Amagerbrogade. The Nørrebrogade stretch is from 2008. Cycling rose on that street by 15% but that was BEFORE 2012. Duh. Basically, there hadn’t been much carrot dangling in this city for a few years. So forget about THAT hastily thunk up theory.
It was simply a combination of construction sites and district heating pipes being upgraded. It was a fantastic urban experiment.
In the original feasibility study for the new M3 line, I found an alarming statistic buried in the document. It was estimated that cycling levels in the city would drop by 2.8% after the completion of the new line. Then we saw that fantastic, unexpected rise of 9% between 2012 and 2013.
Can we now expect a drop in the modal share for bikes of 12% in Copenhagen? Perhaps. You read it here first.
Unless, of course, the City of Copenhagen has the cajones to embrace this experiment and use it to finally make The Leap — as described by author Chris Turner — into the future of our city. Expanding and widening the cycle tracks. Reallocating space from falling car traffic to bicycles and public transport. The new BRT route in Copenhagen is a good step. Let’s see how much farther we can go. Designing cities instead of engineering them.
They can listen to me or they can just listen to the simple logic of children.
The citizens have shown us that they will be on our side if we do the right thing.
Otherwise, this rich petri dish experiment will just rot and be forgotten.

Shortly after joining Tymit, I started hearing whispers about KotlinConf’25 in Copenhagen. I’d never been to an international conference before — let alone one dedicated to a language I use every day as a Junior Android Developer. The excitement was real! I couldn’t wait to see what the global Kotlin community looked like up close.
When I finally arrived, I was blown away by the energy. The event was so well organized — registration was fast, the talks started on time, and everything felt super professional. I had been worried that most of the sessions would be too advanced for me, but there was something for everyone, no matter your experience level.
What really struck me was seeing Kotlin’s potential in action. I already knew Kotlin was powerful, but it’s something else to be in a room full of developers from all over the world, sharing their passion for the language. The enthusiasm was contagious — even developers who don’t use Kotlin every day were getting inspired! I was especially surprised to see backend and even iOS developers interested in Kotlin Multiplatform. It made me realize that Kotlin is much bigger than just Android development; it’s a growing ecosystem with a place for everyone.
Attending KotlinConf with my Tymit team made the experience even better. We picked out talks together, grabbed lunch between sessions, and just enjoyed being part of the event as a team. It helped us bond and made the whole trip unforgettable.
The conference started with an inspiring keynote by Roman Elizarov, who walked us through how Kotlin has evolved and teased some amazing features coming soon. The talk that stood out most for our team was “Rich Errors in Kotlin” by Sébastien Deleuze, which introduced a new way to handle errors in Kotlin.
Day 1 Highlights:
Day 2 Highlights:
A lot of talks focused on AI and Kotlin Multiplatform, both of which I’m really excited about. I left the conference full of ideas for side projects and new tools to try at work.
We also got to see Junie, JetBrains’ new AI assistant for their IDEs like Android Studio. We’re planning to try it out on our team, hoping it’ll help us automate tasks and boost productivity.
The Rich Errors proposal especially caught our eye — we think it could make our app even more robust.
Overall, KotlinConf’25 was an amazing experience. I’m so grateful to Tymit for making it possible. If you ever get a chance to attend, don’t hesitate — you’ll come back inspired, connected, and ready to level up!

Copenhagen is my city. I still feel like that, even after having moved (far) away and not lived here for years. It still feels like home.
I’ve walked through its parks with my boys when they were little chubby babies sleeping in warm blankets in their prams.
I’ve cycled along its lakes for a decade on my way to work.
I’ve discussed world peace and literature and art with my friends at its cafes and bars for countless hours.
I know its streets and parks, and museums and galleries like the back of my hand.
And furthermore, it is home to my closest friends.
In other words, this place has a special place in my heart, which is also why this guide and description might be a tad bias. I hope you can bear with me.
I just spent ten days in Copenhagen. And from the moment I arrived, the special Copenhagen feeling seeped through my bones and made me feel at home and eager to get out walk and cycle and sit at the harbor area with a glass of white wine and wind in my hair.

The Danish National Opera House — opened in 2005—is located on a small island in Copenhagen’s inner harbor. It is one of the most technically advanced in the world. It is also one of the most expensive, costing a cool half a billion dollars.
Situated very strategically, the opera house is sited at the end of what is called the Amalienborg Axis in the very heart of Copenhagen, Denmark’s capital city. The Axis is equivalent to the National Mall in Washington D.C. It is a stone plaza that bisects the Queen’s residential compound, terminating at the Marble Church, the largest in Denmark, and a holy shrine. Directly opposite, and clearly visible across the harbor, sits the Opera House.
The bulk of the money to build it came from the A. P. Møller Foundation, who controls the enormous fortune of the founder of the gigantic Danish shipping company, Maersk. Møller himself has a reputation for being imperious and heavy-handed.
The imposing facade of the very Danish Modern glass and concrete Opera House looms over the harbor. It was designed by the prominent Danish architecture firm, Henning Larsen. Like most established architectural design firms, Henning Larsen is big and conservative, but not that conservative. As the story goes, A.P. Møller arbitrarily overrode some of Henning Larsen’s design decisions, and this did not please the architects. Møller’s ham-fisted meddling with the architect’s design is at the heart of this story of Danish rebellion.
Less than a mile from the Opera House is the autonomous neighborhood of Christiania, encompassed entirely within the city limits of Copenhagen. Formerly an Army barracks, Christiania was abandoned in the late 1960s only to be occupied by hippie squatters in the early 1970s. The authorities never bothered to kick them out and left them to their own devices, so they established their own informal government and rules. It’s home to several successful businesses like the eponymous cargo bicycles that are ubiquitous in bike-loving Copenhagen. Today, the community is home to about 850 people, most of whom are artists, craftsmen, performers, and other creative people who, like their hippie forbears, lean to the left politically.
Christiania, though, is famous for marijuana. For more than 40 years the Copenhagen authorities have turned a blind eye to widespread pot selling and smoking as long as it stayed within the boundaries of the former army base. Christiania residents confine pot sales to one short avenue, often called “Green Street.” Photography on Green Street is strictly forbidden, and brandishing a camera might get you summarily escorted out of town by a dozen offended citizens. Even though Christiania now has its own government, commerce, mayor, and many respectable full time residents, it remains a bold counter-culture statement right in the heart of conservative, Christian, Copenhagen, a living symbol of tolerance and independence. Christiania also proudly flies its own flag, which is orange with three yellow circles in a horizontal line. More than anything else, this iconic flag represents the anti-establishment spirit of Christiania.
The imposing Opera House, on the other hand, is an important civic building representing traditional values and the triumph of global trade and capitalism. But even vastly wealthy, self-important capitalists need to hire creative people, and it is unwise to abuse them, as A.P. Møller learned.
Long after the industrialist Møller forced the unwanted changes on Henning-Larsen’s design, and long after he innocently approved the lighting plan, which included the installation of three gigantic round chandeliers in the auditorium foyer, it gradually dawned on the good citizens of Copenhagen that the Henning-Larsen architectural firm had got the last laugh. At night, after it gets very dark, the entire Opera House glows a certain shade of orange, and the three giant round chandeliers shine a certain shade of yellow, all in a horizontal line with a characteristic spacing, all clearly visible from the Marble Church, the Amalienborg Axis, and the Queen’s Palace. It’s a gentle, subtle, anti-establishment gesture of defiance to those with more dollars than sense.
Heartwarming, isn’t it?

The Liberators: Unleashing Organizational Superpowers

Last week, we visited the LEGO Group’s office in Copenhagen. Where the office in Billund is hard to miss, the one in Copenhagen is nicely hidden in the city center. It reminded me of Harry Potter searching for platform nine-and-three-quarters. 😄
One reason for our visit was to gather feedback from real users of our product, Columinity. We can look long and hard into our crystal ball to search for clues about customers’ experiences or ask them instead. With 150 active teams, it shouldn’t be too difficult to find someone using it. 🔎
During our session, we focused on talking with various Agile Coaches using it to support their teams in continuously improving based on scientific insights and evidence-based feedback.
We *almost* started a classic open discussion (the horror 😱)…
Luckily, the idea of running a lightweight version of the Liberating Structure “User Experience Fishbowl” came to mind. This seemed to make sense, given our goal of collecting real users’ experiences. 🤔
The flow was simple:1. A small group of Agile Coaches positioned themselves in a circle in the center. For about 10 minutes, they started talking about their experiences using Columinity. 2. At the same time, Denny de Waard, myself, and a few others were listening. Whenever a question came to mind, we threw fish food (representing the question) into the bowl. Christina Mumm had the brilliant idea of using LEGO bricks as “fish food.” 🐠 3. After 10 minutes, we flipped roles. The users became the listeners, and we (the original listeners) positioned ourselves in the middle and shared what we noticed in the first round. What experiences stood out? What did we like, surprise, and maybe even worry about?4. For a final time, the users returned to the center of the fishbowl and continuously shared new thoughts and experiences. 5. After roughly 45 minutes ⏰, we closed the UX Fishbowl.
I considered it a valuable experience. It resulted in lots of feedback we can use to improve the use of our product. It was also an excellent (IMHO) example of how you can use Liberating Structures in a lightweight manner without any preparation.
Now, you probably think:
“Hey, why haven’t you included real-life pictures? Did it actually happen? Or are you just making things up here…”
Fair point. You’ll never know, but it’s a nice story, right? 😃
Additional thoughts by Christina Mumm — Agile Coach Competency Lead at the LEGO Group:
“This is not only modeling the value of Liberating Structures ;) It’s about deliberately creating opportunities for necessary conversations across any divide. In this case, we are choosing to close the gap between internal and external (customer- vendor). Working as one team brings value to everyone much faster. Why would we want to keep a distance? I hope we can inspire others to do the same by walking the talk this way.”
Whether it happened or not, why don’t you try this yourself? If you already have used UX Fishbowl, how did it work for you?

Last week I went to Copenhagen, Denmark. It was my first time traveling outside the country since the trip I took to Italy with my friends Corey and Amanda in 2018, a vacation booked when at least two-thirds of us were in the throes of romantic angst. On that trip we drank a lot of Aperol spritzes, ate arancini from a beachside stand most mornings we were in Sicily, and had the best pasta of our lives in Rome. Due to a language mix-up we also accidentally ordered seven sandwiches instead of a charcuterie board. It was a great vacation and I returned to the United States more tan and improbably more relaxed than I had been before. (I had not been relaxed when we left.)
This trip to Denmark was not a vacation but a trip for work. The startup I work for has an office in Soho, where most of the business functions of the company operate, and another office in Copenhagen, where our design, product and engineering teams are located. In the spirit of the company value of hygge and togetherness, I boarded a plane at Newark headed for Copenhagen last Sunday evening. Though I intended to knock myself out and sleep for the entirety of the 8-hour flight (I had a vision of landing in Copenhagen at 7 am local time, looking and feeling fresh as a daisy and invigorated by a good night’s sleep) Scandinavian Airlines had other plans for me — namely, feeding me two large meals throughout the…

I recently returned from a two-week trip to Europe, and I obviously spent a lot of time observing pedestrian and bicycle culture and infrastructure. Rather than simply envy our neighbors across the pond for their walkable and bike-friendly cities and believe that we Yanks could never match their high active transportation mode shares, I was constantly thinking how I could translate my experiences and observations into on-the-ground change here in the U.S. I also realized that we have some progressive transportation infrastructure on our own soil to be proud of.
We first made the pilgrimage to Copenhagen — the Promised Land for many Americans in the bicycle/pedestrian profession… And it lived up to the hype! The comprehensive network of physically separated cycle tracks was incredible and refreshing, of course, but I was more impressed by how easy it was to walk around the city. Several of the major streets were actually pedestrianized, with motor vehicles prohibited. While some examples of this concept exist in the U.S. — including Santa Monica’s Third Street Promenade — they feel rather manufactured and not organic.
Even with the dreary weather, we were sad to leave the playground of Copenhagen. But Paris was awaiting us! I had a mental image of Paris as the small, charming town along the river that is shown in films and travel magazines. However, I was immediately made aware of the city’s sprawling size and wide, auto-clogged boulevards. In a way, I was reminded of my hometown of Los Angeles, except that Paris’s Metro system blankets the region. In a flip from my experience in Copenhagen, I had gone to Paris expecting a walker’s paradise, but instead saw a budding cycling haven. The city had already squeezed cycle tracks along many of the major boulevards, and the famous Vélib’ public bicycles were as common a sight as sidewalk cafés and baguettes. The bicycle network appears set up to help Parisians close the “first mile/last mile gap” that often exists in a trip using public transit. I would love to see Los Angeles and other U.S. cities with mass transit networks pursue a similar course.
Finally, we ended our vacation by hanging out in the pedestrian paradises that are old Spanish cities. Barcelona, our first stop, was seemingly built to make walking a pleasurable experience, with interesting side streets, promenades, and commercial districts around every corner. Barcelona and other Spanish cities like Granada and Toledo also make good use of shared streets, or woonerfs, to make streets safe in constrained neighborhoods.
Finally, the many plazas and parklets in Spain’s cities were a never-ending source of resting space and excellent people watching.
Although very different in many ways, Los Angeles can and should follow the lead of European cities by creating safe and pleasurable spaces for people to walk or bike and be outside enjoying our near-perfect weather. And I’m proud to say that the LA region is beginning to seriously take on that mission. Both Long Beach and Temple City now have cycle tracks. LA County Metro is planning a regional bike share program. And through the LA Department of Transportation’s People St. program, several plazas and parklets have been created or are planned for previously underused road space. I’m excited that our leaders are beginning to push for progressive changes to restore some balance to how we move around our own cities.

If you are visiting that part of Europe that is carbon neutral and scores high on sustainability, you’ll be rewarded with a perfect, clean, and green getaway like Copenhagen. From the perspective of someone like me who is an advocate for sustainable travel, their endeavors to protect the environment are laudable. I had the privilege of visiting the beautiful, bike-friendly capital of Denmark, endowed with a rich history and culture. It had long been on my bucket list and finally, the dream was fulfilled. Copenhagen was everything that I hoped for and more.
We could manage to set aside only 3 days out of our 20-day Europe itinerary and to make matters worse the weather Gods were not on our side. The day we landed was bright and sunny, but incessant rains dampened our spirits on the main day that we were there and had reserved for sightseeing. However, we refused to let the gloomy weather get us down and made the most out of our time in the city.
Copenhagen has something for everyone. From world-class museums and art galleries, centuries-old castles and palaces, and delicious food, to charming shops, cafes, and entertainment parks.
For history buffs Christianborg Palace and the Rosenberg Castle would be fascinating, giving a walkthrough the lives of Danish royalty. You may feel like skipping them if you’re there for a short time, but these grand places are worth a visit. We too were in a dilemma whether to go inside or miss it, but finally, it was a yes from everyone, and it was a great decision.
The center of the Danish Parliament, the Christianborg Palace may not have attractive exteriors, and you may not be much impressed. But once you step inside you’ll find the opulent interiors awe-inspiring. From the decor and chandeliers to the furniture and artwork, a glimpse into the lives of royalty was fabulous.
The most famous touristy spot in Copenhagen is Nyhaven. Once a 17th-century fishing village, is now a dazzling waterfront entertainment zone, with a string of cafes, restaurants, and brightly painted houses. An amusing anecdote about the reason behind these vibrantly painted houses is so that the owners recognize their homes after returning drunken in the night from the bar.
You’ll also come across centuries-old iconic wooden ships at Nyhaven, taking you back in time. It’s a pleasure to walk beside the canal and enjoy the views. There are coffee shops with fireplaces that provide hot drinks and offer a haven from the chilly winds outside. Must try is the crispy, layered Danish pastry, which is delicious.
The Little Mermaid — based on a fairy tale written by a Danish author, this bronze statue of the little mermaid sitting on a rock is situated by the waterside at the Langelinie promenade. This is a great photo spot full of tourists.
Another Copenhagen highlight is a guided boat tour of the canal. Find significant historical landmarks on this tour as described by the guide, while admiring the beauty and listening to engrossing tales from the past. The witty incidents narrated had the audience enthralled. It was interesting to know that the author of the famous story the `Ugly Duckling was a resident of Copenhagen too.
Something that is unpredictable in Copenhagen, like most of Europe is the weather. Our canal trip was therefore interrupted by showers, but thankfully the boat had a glass roof so we could still take in the scenery. Considering the erratic weather having raincoats and umbrellas with you is a necessity. Even though it may mean hauling heavier bags, it is preferable than getting drenched in the midst of your vacation.
Several modern and historic museums dot the city. We decided on the Design Museum, having a very contemporary vibe and numerous masterpieces on display.
“Sail while the breeze blows, wind and tide wait for no man” — Danish Proverb
Impromptu plans are what make holidays enjoyable. The museum was on the waterfront, and from the terrace, we located a ferry point. Just as the last of the ferries was about to depart in the evening, we hurried and got on to it for what turned out to be an adventurous ride. Though there wasn’t any specific agenda, and the program was made on the spur of the moment, the sunset boat ride was worth it. And doubly so, it was absolutely free.
Getting around is quite easy in the capital of Denmark. Though there are various modes of transport, like, metro, bus, cab, or even ferry, using a bike is common. Specific tracks on the sides of roads, make it so convenient for cycling. It not just saves fuel but keeps the surroundings free of carbon emissions. Walking around on foot appeals to some as well.
Staying at the centrally located Mayfair Hotel was a pleasant experience. Not only were the rooms comfortable, the food and ambiance nice as well. As much as we wanted to, because of a shortage of time, missed going to the famous Tivoli Gardens. Probably, a sign that we ought to come here again.

Working in 3 Labs Over 5 Weeks in Copenhagen— What I Learned,https://moloonaila.medium.com/working-in-3-labs-over-5-weeks-in-copenhagen-what-i-learned-beb76abdf8c5,"Sign up

In the ninth grade I came across bioplastics, plastics derived from renewable biomass, for the first time. Since then I have spent hundreds of hours researching the space and coming up with an idea for a bioplastic made from duckweed. The thought process was that bioplastics today generally come from biomass like corn, potatoes, sugar cane, etc. but these take up acres of land to grow and need to be consumed by humans (especially with the rise in climate change causing a shortage in food supply). Thus, duckweed, although possessing a bit of an odd name, has been a large focus of mine for two years now.
Shortly after I discovered bioplastics, the CEO of Pond Biomaterials became a mentor of mine. Pond is a startup based out of Denmark and I have been working with them (virtually) for these two years. This summer, though, I finally got to come to Denmark in person and Pond set me up to work in three labs across Copenhagen for five weeks, including Novozymes, the Technical University of Denmark, and the University of Copenhagen.
The reason for three labs instead of just one is that to build this project requires work in many different areas of science, including microbiology, biochemistry, and chemistry.
Below, I will go over what I worked on in each lab as well as my biggest learnings / takeaways.
Novozymes was the first lab I worked in. This is a private company, and the world leader in industrial enzyme production. I had never worked on my project in a lab that was not in a university, so this was a very different experience. I worked closely with Ulla Rosenberg and Kim Borch, two individuals I am incredibly lucky to have met. I always had help in the lab and the support was unreal. My days were usually 9–11 hours long but there was always someone by my side sticking it out with me and it was honestly so much fun.
For the first week I worked on an optimized enzymatic procedure for the duckweed. We experimented with different parameters and got the highest glucose concentrations I have seen out of my duckweed. I learned a lot about enzymes themselves, dilution series, and how to run an assay.
The next few days, I worked on fermenting the sugar solutions where I was in the microbiology lab with Robin Dorau trying to produce lactic acid. Some of the things I learned about were buffering capacities, measuring the optical density of bacteria via a spectrophotometer, and how to ensure the bacteria had enough nutrients. We ended up getting very high lactic acid concentrations, although I also learned about some other compounds present in my mixtures that have led to more discoveries about the duckweed and experiments themselves.
We were working large scale, with hundreds of grams of duckweed, so we had to be innovative with our setups. It doesn’t matter what lab you are working in: you always have to do some improvisation. Here are some examples of us simply having to figure it out:
1.) We had to have our samples stirring at a certain temperature for the enzymes to optimally operate, however our system kept dropping in temperature. In order for the setup to be self sufficient, we improvised and used aluminum and towels for insulation, and poured boiling water into the tub our samples were in. It worked like a charm, but definitely looked a little interesting.
2.) Another scenario where we had to just figure it out was when our samples would not filter prior to fermentation. I have been working on a smaller scale in Ottawa so although filtering was an issue I wasn’t on as much of a time crunch and had less material to work with. What we ended up doing was going to the brewery lab and their pressure filters (used for beer) worked perfectly. This taught me another valuable lesson, which was the importance of interconnectedness and asking others — even if in a completely different space of work — for help. Working at Novozymes was so unique because there are so many individuals working on different things and yet everyone can help each other, even a beer brewery lab and a biotech lab.
One more valuable lesson for me was to not always trust the results you get. When we did colorimetric analysis (basically determining the concentration of a chemical compound using a colour reagent) we got very low lactic acid concentrations which was honestly very disappointing because I never would have expected my results to be in this ball park. Later, though, we ran an HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography, a method that is much more precise) and our results were over 20x higher than we had initially thought. This really changed the next steps that had to be taken, so it’s important to ensure that when doing a test like an assay or something generally less precise (usually because they are easier and cheaper) they can have large margins of error in the results they yield.
The second lab I worked in was at the Technical University of Denmark, DTU. Here I was working on something I had never done before: the separation of lactic acid from the fermentation mixture. This process was quite difficult and was certainly not a success, but I learned a lot about purification technologies and namely, their complexity.
My biggest takeaway was to not underestimate how much time something new can take. I would have figured I would have learned this by now but it’s easy to have too high of expectations in science. Since I had never worked on the purification side of things before, I did not fully comprehend the difficulty of it until I tried it out. Researching and ideating is one thing, and actually doing it is something else entirely! For example, we attempted something called an azeotropic distillation on my first day (see the photo below) which theoretically should have worked quite easily but in fact did not at all. Even removing the water without evaporating other compounds was hugely complex and when I researched what to do, I was greeted with hundreds of research papers.
Thus, I learned something else that was very important which was to keep my solutions as clean as possible. What I mean by this is that in prior steps to the purification I am adding enzymes, buffers, extracts, etc. to my mixtures, but I have to in reality remove everything to get pure lactic acid at the end. When working on prior steps it is very important to keep in mind the end goal and future steps that must also be optimized for.
Another takeaway was to utilize online videos for the use of analytical equipment because there is so much online that can help. I had to be much more independent in this lab, and through a video I learned how to do infrared spectroscopy which was very helpful.
I had a hard time coping with failure at this lab overall but it offered many insights into what comes next in this project, as this step will be the key to producing the bioplastic and will be a challenge on its own.
Finally, I worked at the University of Copenhagen with Peter Ulvskov, a professor in plant biology. This tied more into what I had been working on at Novozymes, but instead of optimizing the enzymes being added to the biomass we were working on what could happen even prior to this: cell wall degradation, mechanical methods of breakdown, etc. Honestly, I found this so much fun and full of learning. I truly got to understand the duckweed to a greater extent, like what exists in it that may inhibit bacterial growth, what polysaccharides it contains, and how the starch granules behave. For the first time I got to look at the duckweed under a microscope — microscopy was actually key in my work at KU. For example, before degradation of the cell walls, we could see the starch granules stuck in the duckweed cells (left image, where the granules are dark blue) and then after we could see the granules released from the cells (right image).
Something else we worked on was the removal of pigmentation from the duckweed to explore how this may hinder future steps in my procedures (see the below picture, where the rightmost beaker contains a much lower content of chlorophyll). I found I was looking at duckweed through a different lens because of how much unique experimentation I got to do at the university.
Likely my biggest takeaway was the significance of writing absolutely everything down and taking many pictures. This is of course something I have always had to do in the lab but Peter put a lot of emphasis on organization and I came up with a much better system for taking notes, keeping track of which photos are which, etc. It can be easy to recognize what a microscopy image is showing a few minutes after you’ve taken it, but a month later, the importance of that image to you may be gone.
My second takeaway was to keep in mind everything that is required for each part of my project and look at how this may translate to a real world protocol. For example, when we were grinding the duckweed we made sure to use equipment that could be scaled up easily as opposed to only something that works small scale.
Another one of my learnings was the importance of going back to the very beginning — the foundations of a project — because this is where the most improvement can transpire. Breaking down the cell walls to a greater extent was not helping me in the purification of the lactic acid, but eventually it could help me get more lactic acid to work with by creating improvements in glucose yields. Every step holds weight.
All in all, getting to spend time in Copenhagen was such a neat experience and I am so grateful to everyone who helped me. I also felt that I became a more independent person as I lived alone for around five days which I have never done before! Getting to meet my supervisor Martin from Pond was a huge highlight, as well as exploring the wonderful city (and the crêpe stands👩🏽‍🍳).
Thank you so much for reading this! I’m a 17-year-old learning about where sustainability meets technology, and am the author of the “Chronicles of Illusions” duology. If you want to see more of my work, connect with me on LinkedIn, Twitter, or subscribe to my newsletter!

Name: Malene Sabinsky
What do you do all day? Boss people around and talk very loudly– no really, that’s what project managers do. *laughs*
Hometown: Copenhagen, Denmark
Hunting territory: Copenhagen and beyond
Can you tell us a bit about the difference between the street art in you town compared to the rest of the world? As in, what makes your town really stand out!? I don’t know if there’s a major difference, as a lot of international artists have made pieces in Copenhagen too, but of course the local artist make it completely unique.
Where do most artists get there inspiration from in your town? That would be unfair of me to answer, as I don’t know.
Is there more currated or illegal work? The murals are mostly curated, but there is also a fair bit of illegal activity
What is that one artwork you need to see in your hunting territory? I have to cheat and choose two: DALeast because I cycle past it everyday, and never tire of looking at it. Copenhagen, for me, wouldn’t be the same without it now. And ‘Creativity is Freedom’ by Danish artist Don John. I really love his work, and there are so many great pieces by him around town.
Who introduced you to the street art scene? Nobody did. I am still waiting for my official introduction :-)
When were you infected with the hunter virus? I’m a newbie really *laughs* I’ve had an interest for at long time. I lived in London for many years, and it’s hard not to notice and appreciate street art when living there. But it didn’t actually become a real (active) passion until summer 2015, when i saw the Surface exhibition by Danish photographer Søren Solkær in Copenhagen. And alongside this, I followed the creation of new murals for “Outdoor Surface” (the DalEast piece being one of these).
My hunting kit includes: It’s a very simple kit: bicycle, iphone, headphones and wind in my hair.
When you are out shooting, how much of it is instinctual versus planned? With increased passion comes increased planning! Of course I still stumble upon new pieces when on general eplorations, but mostly I plan to go to a certain place, because there is something specific I want to see.
Do you take photos more for yourself, or for others? Mostly for myself, but I don’t mind sharing :-)
How would you define your style in taking photo’s or writing a (instagram) post? Lacking style in general! I’m not a skilled photographer, so it’s a good thing the art speaks for itself. The same goes for posts. I’m too impatient to write a lot, so an artist credit and an emoji tends to suffice.
Who are some of your favorite classic photographers, and how did they influence you? I like a lot of photographers: Cindy Sherman, Martin Parr, Nan Goldin, William Eggleston, Andreas Gursky etc. And of course I have to mention both Søren Solkær and Martha Cooper, for combining the art of photography and street art. They haven’t influenced me in any particular way, I just admire their skill and art.
What is your biggest challenge of being a hunter? Too much rain, and too little time.
What is the best piece of advice I can give to newbie hunters? Be curious and open-minded. Credit artists where you can , they deserve it. Do it out of passion and interest, not the likes.
Or ignore all that, and just download the app and get yourself a bicycle.
Can you tell us the most exiting hunter story? Any close calls with getting your equipment robbed or caught by the police? Haha, no close calls at all. I’m too well behaved.
I will share a non-exciting, but vivid hunter memory with you though: I was touring California (and beyond) with my two kids a few months back, and when we stopped over in Vegas, we had to go hunting. I had no connection on my phone, so my son got the job of navigating using the Street Art Cities website (see, it’s so easy even a kid can use it!). After some time with no results, I was getting pretty hot and bothered, but suddenly my son stops and points. And I very loadly exclaim: “Woaw, Martin Whatson”. The look of pride in his eyes for having found it, combined with the beauty of the wall, was just priceless.
My most recent discovery in the street art scene is: Not so recent, but during the summer I found some great stencils in Copenhagen, there are four really close to each other. I haven’t found any more across town, and don’t know anything about the artist, apart from the signature ‘Jochum’. I’m dead curious, really like the pieces, and want to see and know more.
Name a few artists you like to follow and why. These artists are all Danish, have their very own style, are super talented, and can be found around the streets of Copenhagen:
Do you collect art books, T-shirts, and other things? What’s the most valuable item for you? No, I’m not much of a collector as such, but I’m dead chuffed with a small piece by Tankpetrol, I bought and just received in the post the other day.
What is your favorite location fellow hunters should definitely visit? Don’t miss a visit to Bolsjefabrikken where local artist make new pieces all the time, cruise down Rentemestervej — possible the one street in Copenhagen with the mist murals. And of course Christiania — for art and the rest — but don’t pull out your camera on pusher street unless you specifically are collecting “exciting hunter stories”.
What are the benefits you find being part of a street art collective? Having found so many people with the same passion and so many of whom are very knowledgeable, and great photographers. I will start inviting myself for coffee and tours when I travel, so be warned.
Last but not least. What is the most valuable thing about Street Art Cities? The app is fantastic. It’s a great resource when travelling.

I remember seeing the term Hygge for the first time while looking for Airbnb experiences in Copenhagen. A quick google search showed that Hygge meant “a cozy quality that makes a person feel content and comfortable”. It gave me the image of resting by the fireplace on a cold winter’s night, which didn’t feel too relevant for my upcoming summer trip, so I kind of forgot about it.
When I was in Copenhagen, I remember feeling occasional waves of inner joy, in a “just glad to be here” kind of way. It was otherwise sublime and hard to describe, and even harder to attribute the cause. I didn’t try to analyze it too much — after all, I was on vacation and taking in the idyllic vibes of a Danish summer.
On the metro to the airport, we zoomed past a father and his child running through some grassy expanses with the backdrop of the sea. I remember feeling a sense of delight and ease, and recalled the term Hygge; that’s when I realized I had profoundly learned what it meant during my trip.
I won’t try to describe what Hygge is; I reckon you have to experience this for yourself to understand. But I’ll tell you some things when I was in Copenhagen that brought me Hygge, and also some that did not.

Can London follow Copenhagen's heat networks example?
All London boroughs are working to reach net zero, and decarbonising how we heat our buildings is a crucial part of that journey. One key solution here is the implementation of heat networks. These currently exist in pockets of London, but we must introduce new networks and connect more households to help us towards net zero.
In May, London Councils and The Danish Embassy in London worked together to take a group of London borough officers to visit the Greater Copenhagen area, a world leader in heat networks. The visit was funded by the State of Green (a not-for-profit, public-private partnership between the Danish government and the country’s three leading business associations) and provided valuable insights into Denmark’s successful adoption of heat networks and offered lessons that could be applied to our decarbonisation efforts in London and across the UK.
Denmark has made significant progress in adopting heat networks, with over 64% of Danish homes currently heated through this system. This figure is expected to rise to approximately 72% in the near future. Denmark’s’ heat network journey began in 1903 with the installation of the first district heating (DH) plant.
However, it was the 1970s oil crisis that triggered a rapid expansion in the use of coal-powered district heating, which was followed by the introduction of natural gas. Over time, Denmark has shifted towards incorporating energy from waste and biomass, and is actively exploring various waste heat sources to further reduce emissions — as we know London boroughs like Islington are also doing.
The Greater Copenhagen Heat Network
The Greater Copenhagen Heat Network stands out as an impressive example of a large-scale district heating system. It supplies heat to approximately 500,000 households — with almost all houses connected in the inner municipalities of the region. It relies on various heat producers, including combined heat and power (CHP) plants, waste-to-energy facilities, and reserve and peak load plants burning fossil fuels. The network also incorporates heat storage systems to ensure efficient and reliable distribution.
What did we visit?
During the visit, we had the opportunity to explore different aspects of Denmark’s heat network infrastructure and solutions. We learnt about the background of heat network development in the Greater Copenhagen region and witnessed initiatives such as the District Cooling system in Copenhagen, a large waste-to-energy facility in Roskilde, and the consumer-owned Greve Municipal District Heating company. We also observed smaller-scale innovative solutions, such as a Danfoss project to capture and recirculate heat from supermarket refrigerators in Energy Lab Nordhavn.
We gained insights into energy-renovated social housing and a low-temperature heat network in the Municipality of Albertslund. We also saw an exciting new heat pump system being installed to that extract energy from drinking water in Frederiksberg, in the heart of the city region of Copenhagen.
We learnt about the vital role of local government and municipal companies in planning, financing, developing, and operating heat networks in Denmark. The experience showcased the importance of effective and resourced local government to drive collaboration among stakeholders, all underpinned by strong regulation which gives price certainty to consumers.
We also learnt how heat networks have been expanding rapidly in response to global energy price increases, and that demand is higher for houses on heat networks.
The visit highlighted both some key differences and similarities between Denmark and the UK in terms of how we heat our buildings. However, both countries share similar climates, building characteristics, and ambitions for achieving net-zero emissions so sharing knowledge will help us both. We were happy to learn that the UK government is actively working with the Danish government to develop UK heat network policy, with a focus on introducing heat zoning which will help increase the uptake of heat networks.
This visit to Copenhagen offered valuable insights for London’s decarbonisation efforts. The Renewable Power for London Programme will be incorporating these as part of its Decentralised Energy workstream to help London Local Government accelerate our transition.

Before you actually begin your dream journey, your Copenhagen Trip Planner is here. Copenhagen is the largest city in the country and also the capital of Denmark. Sitting on the two coastal islands, Zealand and Amager, this beautiful city is full of historic attractions. Consulting your vacation guide can be a good option if you do not want to miss any particular places of interests here. Every year a huge number of tourists visit this city which still possesses a distinct touch of European culture. Copenhagen is packed with various great attractions and tourist spots. Here are some of the best places that you can include in your travel planner if you really want to make most of your time here.
Among the various interesting places in the city, including Christiansborg Palace in your Copenhagen Trip Planner as top priority can be a brilliant idea. Located in central Copenhagen, on a small island, this palace is still used by royal families as the seat of Danish Parliament, Prime Minister’s office, and Supreme Court. Boasting more than 800 years of history, this palace has plenty of attractions to offer you, such as the royal reception hall, the Chapel, the Ruins, and the Royal Stables. The tallest viewing platform of the city is in this palace which offers an excellent panoramic view of this beautiful city.
Tivoli Garden is basically an amusement park in Copenhagen and is a must visit for all tourists. Founded in the year of 1843, it is known as an international attraction and also a national treasure of Denmark. With more than twenty types of different rides, various cafes and restaurants, Tivoli Gardens has become an absolute wonderland for the visitors. It is also the second oldest functioning amusement park in Denmark.
Your trips to this Danish capital may remain incomplete if you do not add a visit to the Little Mermaid in your Copenhagen Trip Planner. Made of bronze and granite, this sculpture was a gift to the city from the Danish brewer C. Jacobsen. Apart from being the city’s most famous tourist attraction, it is also the official emblem of the city.
If the history and culture of a new city are something that truly interests you then your journey guide may suggest you visit the National Museum of Denmark. You can find exhibitions from almost all the different periods and ages here. Exhibitions from the Stone Age, the Middle Ages, the Viking Ages, the renaissance period and modern Danish history are perfectly displayed here.
Nyhavn Harbour can also be there in your travel plan. At the very end of the harbor, you can witness the anchor which is kept there as a memorial of those Danish sailors who lost their lives during World War II. With the brightly painted houses by the harbor and the museum ships, this place happens to be the most featured one in the photographs, describing the city.
If you have not yet included Bakken in your Copenhagen Trip Planner, then it’s high time that you would. Being the oldest amusement park in the world, Bakken is a wonderful green area where you can enjoy various exciting adventure rides. In the entire Scandinavia, it is the only amusement park that has more rides than any other in the country.
By including these most-visited places of Copenhagen in your vacation plan, you can have the most unforgettable experience in your life. Let’s keep your Copenhagen Trip Planner with you as your best guide and start exploring the majestic city Copenhagen.

It only takes me about four days in Copenhagen before I start Googling “Copenhagen apartments for rent” and “Can Americans buy property in Denmark?”. I love how easy it is to walk everywhere, how stylish it is, how friendly the people are, and (of course) how delicious the food is. We planned our trip to Europe around dinner at Noma. While Noma was worth the pilgrimage, it was far from the only good meal of our trip. Here’s my recap of our Copenhagen dining adventures.

There’s a particular kind of focus that lives in voiceover. Not just technical — emotional, too.
As an actor, I’ve found something grounding in the simplicity of sound: a way to stay close to character, even between larger productions. Whether for narration, commercials, or more character-driven work, I approach VO as an extension of acting, just pared down to its essentials.

I’m a New York City girl.
I grew up in the neighborhood of Washington Heights, the area of Manhattan north of Harlem.
On the street I lived, everyone knew everyone. Apartment doors were often left open so kids could run back and forth. If we were out late —which meant once the streetlights were on — we’d be told by an adult, any adult, it was time to go home.
Home for me was on the fifth floor of a tenement building. And our apartment stood out in that drab building because our windows were covered with climbing blue morning glory my father planted every spring.
Those flowers were a bright spot on an otherwise colorless city street.
It’s years since we were back, and this summer it was a trip down memory lane when my husband Billy and I visited “the City”.
Billy grew up in Greenwich Village. Long the home of artists, his father, the abstract expressionist painter Harold Anton, had among his contemporaries, Jackson Pollock, as well as the…

ISRAELS PLADS
Copenhagen, Denmark
Introduction
Israels Plads is an urban plaza situated in Copenhagen, Denmark. It was conceptualised by Sweco Architects and Cobe in 2007 when the Copenhagen municipality invited Danish architects to reconstruct Copenhagen’s largest public square, which had fallen into disrepair as a derelict parking lot. [1] This essay will analyse the aftermath of the project to determine how successful the architects were in terms of heritage integration, user experience, and inclusivity.
Copenhagen is the capital and most populous city of Denmark. It was previously a Viking fishing village, and became the capital in the early 15th century. Since the early 2000’s Copenhagen has seen some strong urban and cultural development, led by the Copenhagen Municipality, through investments in its institutions and infrastructure. Israels Plads is one such urban regeneration project.
According to Cobe, the idea of transforming Israels Plads was to celebrate the significance of the history of the square, and to revitalize it, by turning it into a “vibrant, diverse plaza for leisure and sport, used by all kinds of people.” [7] Right from the get-go, we see that the architects placed a lot of importance on heritage integration, user experience and inclusivity.
The new site consists of an underground car park, with two blocks of buildings (a retail park and a private educational institute) to the North-West and South-East, along with two large market halls (“Torvehallerne”, which opened in 2011 and quickly became very popular, currently housing numerous cafés) to the North-East. The Plads also provides a link to a massive park (“Ørstedsparken”) to the South-West (Fig 1), acting as a transition from the bustling city to the serene park. [7]

Above the underground car park, the plaza acts as a multifunction space, housing a large playground, sports arena, skatepark, and areas for people-watching. At the centre of the square is an “egg-shaped area” (Fig 2), used by nearby schools as an extended recreational zone for all age groups. [2]

History
The space has historical significance dating back to the 13th century when Denmark built their stone wall fortifications and established a central plaza at this spot, where the city ended in a ring of protective ramparts. During the city’s extension in the late 19th century, with the demolition of the old city walls (that were now outdated defence mechanisms), the site became a vibrant market square. Israels Plads is placed on top of these historic ramparts (Fig 3).
Figure 3 Diagram of the city’s old fortifications, and Israels Plads’ location relative to the ramparts (Cobe, 2014)
According to Zerlang (2008), the square served as a starting point and meeting point for the forces of modern life [1], since its inception in the 1870s (Fig 4) and its renaming in 1968 as “Israels Plads”, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the “rescue of the Danish Jews”.[3]
Israels Plads was previously the home of Grønttorvet (1889–1958), a major market for fresh produce known for its special atmosphere (Fig 5). Due to the increase in traffic around the market and growing logistics needs, the market was relocated and the once-bustling square degenerated into an inner-city eyesore and occasional parking lot (Fig 6). [2]

Figure 5: The Food Market, around 1990 (Copenhagen by Design, 2015)
“The plaza used to be empty, especially in the evening, and there were a lot of drug dealers” — Hans Peter Hagens (Architect of the Torvehallerne, adjacent to Israels Plads) [13]
Figure 6: The site’s usage as a parking lot in the 1950’s — 1990's
City Scale
The main reason for the decline of Israels Plads was the city and traffic planners’ inability and unwillingness to put city space and city life high on their agenda. Attempting to ensure the best conditions for car traffic, along with the mismanagement of the city-planning sector has led to multiple public squares such as this one being converted to dingy parking lots, teeming with crime and making the city unsafe, unsustainable and unhealthy. [4]
Jan Gehl, in his book “Cities for People”, criticises the Copenhagen municipality, for putting a low priority on public space, pedestrianism and the role of city space as a meeting place for urban dwellers. However, in recent decades, the government has realised its folly, and started reversing its erroneous moves by restructuring their street network, removing driving lanes and parking places in a deliberate process to create better and safer conditions for bicycle traffic. [4] The city of Copenhagen has a goal for its residents to “spend 20% more time in public spaces by 2025,” [7] and Copenhagen’s bicycles now save 90,000 tons of CO2 every year. Gehl notes that “[Copenhagen] has significantly improved conditions for life in city space in recent decades. Pedestrian traffic has grown, and the number of recreational optional activities has swelled.” [4] It is important to note that Gehl uses the term “optional” to describe activities that can only be done in good conditions, as opposed to “necessary” activities, such as going to school/work and grocery shopping, which have to be done regardless of the weather conditions. One by one the parking places in the city centre have been turned into squares that accommodate public life. [4]
Figure 7: The new and improved Israels Plads (Cobe, 2014)
Recent Developments
A change was triggered in the area of Israels Plads, due to the decision to erect the two market halls (Torvehallerne) on the site, evoking the “aura of the old vegetable market”. [2] The council’s brief for the reconstruction of Israels Plads demanded that the design concept should relate itself to the “history of the square, to the architecture of the surrounding houses, to the Ørstedspark at the southern end of the square and the Botanical Garden and the market halls at the northern end of the square”. [1]
The winning submission by Cobe and Sweco Architects envisaged a “flying carpet” spread across the entire square, where the cars would be “swept under the rug” with underground parking and organically shaped areas that are punched out of the surface to provide a variety of public recreational functions (Fig 7 and 8). [2]
Figure 8: The layers of Israels Plads, as envisioned by Sweco Architects and Cobe (Cobe, 2014)
User Experience
Zerlang (2008) declares that in the modern city, experiences are staged, and architects increasingly treat urban space with the eye of a scenographer. [1] Understanding that the consideration for the individual and their experiences presents a major challenge for modern urban planning, the question of “experiences” had a very high priority in the commission. The Council added a demand that the concept should consider the activities on the square, and also the pre-existing activities of the school children from the Zahles Skole (adjacent to Israels Plads), and the potential activities of the new-arranged square. [1]
The transformation of the public square focuses on its revitalisation as a living urban space [2]. Gehl (2010) urged urban planners and architects to reinforce pedestrianism as an integrated city policy to develop “lively, safe, sustainable and healthy” cities. He also ascertains that it is equally urgent to strengthen the social function of city space as a meeting place. [4]
Israels Plads provides a cohesive structure that offers “short walking distances, attractive public spaces, and a variation of urban functions”. These elements increase activity and the feeling of security in and around the space. [4]
Studies from inner-city shopping streets in Copenhagen show happenings, events and building sites where we can watch people perform, play music, etc. attract far more people to linger and watch than shops along building facades. Studies of benches and chairs in city space show correspondingly that seats with the best view of city life are used far more frequently than those that do not offer a view of other people. [4] The seating areas in Israels Plads are positioned so that people-watching is facilitated. The sloping sides of the sunken playing field can serve both as a barrier and as seating. [2] Wedge-shaped staircases at the western and eastern corners of the square offer a good view from an elevated position (Fig 9). [2]
Figure 9: Users seated on the wedge-shaped stairs, enjoying a sunny day (Cobe, 2014)
“The plaza has opened up to the historical landscape next door. The tree and water elements of the park are echoed on the plaza surface, and circles have been cut out to accentuate the big trees standing on the transition between city and park” (Fig 10) [7]
Figure 10: The cutouts on the plaza used to accentuate the trees. (Copenhagen Design News, 2020)
The cut-outs feature round bench formations underneath the trees, where people can observe the life unfolding on the plaza, a pre-requisite for Gehl’s ideal public space (Fig 11). The localised light zones of areas sheltered by trees also create an intimate setting for groups of people to gather and enjoy the night. The overheads and multiple sources of illumination, according to Schaack (2018), allow for visibility and facial recognition, which is crucial for users to trust their environment and the people using it. [3]
Figure 11: Round bench formations, ideal for people-watching (Copenhagen Design News, 2020)
Cobe’s founder, Dan Stubbergaard appreciates that Israels Plads has become a public meeting place and a playground for three different schools all year round. [7] It also helps that the design incorporates skateable aspects into the architecture of the space. Activities such as skateboarding, basketball and scootering are encouraged, which invites a lot more schoolchildren into the space. [11] Even the lighting is optimised for play. Four different lighting systems illustrate the complexity of the space at night. One of them illuminates the centre of the plaza to answer the need for visibility of sports users, basketball players and skateboarders. [3]
Figure 12: The public uses the Plads even in unfavourable weather conditions (Cobe, 2014)
Heritage Integration
“[The plaza] has a sculptural expression that refers to its historical past as part of the fortifications” [3] “Along the facades, a band of traditional Copenhagen pavement with granite slabs and Nordic cobblestones runs around the square (Fig 13), connecting the granite plate to its surroundings.” [8] These material choices are a throwback to traditional Danish building methods, and also match the colourful historical facades from the 18th century.
Figure 13: Nordic cobblestones and demarcation strips around Israels Plads (Copenhagen Design News, 2020)
The square itself often became the scene of political demonstrations in the 1880s [1] Similar to the 1880s, the square is still used for political demonstrations. In May 2019, the Revolutionary Antifascists group, organised a demonstration at the Israels Plads. [9] More recently, in October 2021, students of the University of Copenhagen assembled at the Plads to protest the University’s investment in Pro-Israeli companies that are involved in the demolition of Palestinian homes and building the Apartheid wall [10]. It is interesting to see how the Israels Plads’ usage has differed only very slightly from its original uses before the 1950s. Copenhagen also hosts WorldPride, the international festival celebrating the LGBTQ+ community, and one of the parades goes through the Israels Plads. [12]
Inclusivity
“This is where children play during recess, where friends meet for a beer after work, and where Copenhageners meet for flea markets (Fig 14) on Saturdays” [7]
Figure 14: The Flea Market that opens up on the Plads on Saturdays (Cobe, 2014)
An issue that I came across quite often when researching the inclusivity of such spaces, is the prevalence of anti-homeless architecture and exclusionary design, whether on purpose or a subconscious choice. A space such as this cannot be celebrated for its inclusivity, if it does not support ALL its citizens, including the homeless, individuals struggling with addiction, and the unemployed. Israels Plads has round benches with metal dividers (Fig 11), making them uncomfortable to sleep on, while the long tiered seating (Fig 9) lacks privacy and is open to the elements, which discourages anyone from taking refuge overnight. [15]
This goes against the policies of Jan Gehl’s “Humanist City” [4], pushing Copenhagen’s most vulnerable citizens out of the public space. Nina Hoegh (Director of Projekt Udenfor (Project Outside)) agrees, stating that catering urban design exclusively to the needs of the middle class in this way sends an implicit message about whom the city values. [15] Public space should be accessible and welcoming for all, without privileging one person or group over another. [16]
“Homelessness must be eradicated, but this process won’t happen overnight. Public places need to design for this reality, not ignore it” [16] Therefore I affirm that the architects of the Israels Plads have not been successful in their efforts to make the space inclusive.
Purpose Fulfilment
The architects have designed a method of directing cloudburst water into an artificial creek, which leads to a large water reserve in the adjacent park. However, their wish that the creek is an aesthetic and pleasant water feature during all other times did not come true, as the “creek” is almost always dry (Fig 15), and may be a hazard for a skateboarding student, or a person with a vision impairment. [7] The Danish Design Review also noted that the fountains and water channel at the park end are rarely running. [14]
Figure 15: The “Artifical Creek”, currently dry (Copenhagen by Design, 2015)
Despite its shortcomings, the plaza does serve as a new public space adding to the social and environment of Copenhagen, while fulfilling the still-existing demand for car parking in the city. The design of the space follows the policy of Copenhagen to be a sustainable and user-friendly city by connecting to the neighbouring park and food market, offering a recreational space with seating areas and sports facilities. [3] Israels Plads has accomplished its goal of being a multi-use space, seeing that it serves as a schoolyard during the daytime, a public basketball court and skate park during the afternoon, a “dining room” in the evening, and a flea market during the weekend. It is quite difficult to design a space where there is minimum clash between these activities, yet Cobe and Sweco Architects have managed to do it.

Some of these new and old car-free squares seem deserted while others teem with life. The difference comes down to the fact that some squares have only been designed to “ferry” pedestrians across, while others seize the opportunity to provide an experience, so that people combine walking and staying in the area. Studies show that the latter type of square registers an activity level of between “10, 20, and sometimes 30 times higher than transit squares” [5] There is no point in having a sheer amount of space if it is not correctly designed, and this is why I believe Israels Plads has been so successful in attracting the populace of Copenhagen as a public space where children can play, adults can people-watch, and almost everyone can enjoy.

Let me start by saying, I'm a huge fan of the S-train network in Copenhagen, Denmark, and especially for the simple and direct communication the transit map of the network provides. The design of the existing map is clean and simple. But it still has in my opinion some flaws and are missing some vital details.
So I have tried to make my own revised S-train map for Copenhagen, based of course on the existing map of the network. With tweaks and improvement to make it easier to navigate as a user.
Just want to see the new map, jump straight to it here.
If you want an in-depth analysis and understanding of the Copenhagen transit map and network and what it looks like today:

Copenhagen surprised me in the best way. It’s not loud or flashy, but quietly brilliant — measured, functional, and full of life in subtle ways. It might not be for everyone, but for me personally, this was the best city I’ve visited so far.
Here’s a breakdown of my impressions, what’s worth seeing, and what (and where) to eat.
Copenhagen feels like it was designed for a self-contained urban human — someone who values clean lines, efficient systems, and doesn’t need the sun to be in their top three happiness factors.
It’s expensive, but everything you get feels fair. There’s no sense of being ripped off — just a steady, Nordic standard of quality. English is almost a second official language, spoken equally well by both the young and the old. That stood out and made everything smoother.
The people are polite, helpful, but emotionally reserved. Not cold, not snobby — just calmly distant. The city itself is beautifully quiet: no diesel engines, no honking, no chaos. Cash is barely accepted, tips are not expected, and digital payments are the norm.
Public transport is flawless — fast, clean, reliable, and not overcrowded. The metro system especially impressed me. The cycling culture is on another level: wide, protected bike lanes on both sides of the street, and visibly fewer cars and parking spots than in Zagreb.
It’s not as immigrant-friendly as, say, London, and that affects the atmosphere slightly. Still, Copenhagen delivers a kind of living standard and order that’s rare anywhere else.
Home of CarlsbergMore than just a brewery tour. This place ties together Danish beer, scientific progress, and art collecting. Jacob and Carl Jacobsen — father and son — are the central figures here. The father was a master brewer, the son added branding finesse and a love of the arts. They even established their own science lab, where in 1883 they solved the problem of “beer sickness” (a sudden souring of beer) by isolating pure yeast. Today, they’ve created a keg that triples shelf life. The visit includes a tour and beer tastings.
GlyptoteketA stunning museum founded by the Jacobsen family, housing collections of Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Danish, and French art. My favorites were the sarcophagi, the mummies, and The Prodigal Son sculpture. The building itself is a piece of art.
Tivoli GardensThe second-oldest amusement park in the world and the inspiration for Disneyland. It’s charming and atmospheric, though pricey. I took my first and probably last rollercoaster ride here. Worth it for the vibe alone.
Danish Design MuseumDesign is taken seriously here — from childhood education to everyday product aesthetics. We saw an exhibition on the development of Irma, a 137-year-old supermarket brand that brought graphic design into daily life. Another focused on natural, innovative materials (chairs from mushrooms, lamps made from cow intestines, dresses from milk-industry waste). Unfortunately, the furniture design exhibit was closed for renovations.
NyhavnA classic Copenhagen postcard: colorful houses along a canal, boats bobbing in the water. It’s a bit of a tourist trap, but still worth seeing — especially if the sun comes out. HC Andersen once lived in one of these houses while writing his first fairy tale.
Freetown ChristianiaA self-declared autonomous neighborhood built on former military land. Around 1,000 people live there — hippies, artists, and others drawn to alternative living. It’s more a sociological curiosity than an actual utopia. Don’t expect magic, but it’s interesting for a short visit.
Rosenborg Castle & KastelletRosenborg is a small Renaissance castle built by Christian IV in the early 1600s. It’s beautifully preserved. Nearby, Kastellet is a pentagon-shaped military fortress, still in use today and perfect for a peaceful stroll.
Food in Copenhagen is pricey. Meals range from 110 to 250 DKK (€15–€34), pastries from 40 DKK (€5.50), and craft beers between 60–80 DKK (€8–€11). But the quality makes it worthwhile.
Here’s what stood out:
Gasoline GrillNamed one of the top 27 burgers in the world by Bloomberg — and the only one from Europe. It’s served from a small former gas station with four cheerful employees. Probably the best burger I’ve ever had.
Juno the BakeryThe cardamom bun here genuinely moved people to tears. The founder is a former Noma chef, and it shows. The almond croissant and pain au chocolat are also top-tier.
Format Café (inside the Design Museum)New Nordic simplicity done right. The carrot soup with tarragon oil, cream, almonds, and sourdough was exceptional. The open sandwich with chicken, beetroot, capers, kale, horseradish, and a mystery cream was surprisingly rich and complex. Easily one of the best meals.
SeksA stylish brunch spot. The chive-and-pepper omelet was solid, the apple pancake with cream excellent, and the Moroccan green tea unforgettable. Small portions, though.
Warpigs BrewpubTexas BBQ in a Danish setting. Three meats (smoked pork, beef, spicy sausage), mac & cheese, beans, slaw, and on-site craft beer. Heavy, indulgent, and very American in vibe — but worth it.
Broens Street Food MarketGreat spot on the docks. We had organic fish & chips with an IPA under the sun. Simple, fresh, satisfying.
Sankt Peders BakeryThe oldest bakery in Copenhagen, open since 1652. Try the Wednesday cinnamon roll — sold only on Wednesdays. They make up to 4,000 in a single day.
Absalon FolkehusetA unique community lunch in a converted Lutheran church. We had rice with spinach, almonds, coriander, and a peppery sauce. At just 60 DKK, it was the cheapest cooked meal we found — and still delicious.
Pølser Hot DogsThe Danish street food staple. Tried two: one at Carlsberg and one at John’s Hotdog Deli at the main station (Bourdain-approved). Both were solid, nothing mind-blowing.
GRØDA porridge-focused mini-chain. The classic version with apples, cinnamon, roasted almonds, and caramel was pure comfort food.
Pico PizzaStandard, good pizza. Clean, consistent, and just what you need after a few fancier meals.
Copenhagen isn’t trying to win you over with flash or charm. It doesn’t need to. It simply works — quietly, confidently, and beautifully. It’s a place that respects both the individual and the collective experience. For someone who appreciates subtle details, structure, and thoughtful living, this city delivers on every level.
Without exaggeration, this is the best city I’ve ever visited — but I’d never move there, unless the sun files for residency too. 😆

Welcome to the United Nations Career Journey podcast where we interview colleagues working for the United Nations all over the world. Our conversations explore their fascinating career paths, what career satisfaction means to them and how they keep learning and developing on the job. My name is Alessia and our conversation today is with Paul Anderton from the United Nations Development Programme in Copenhagen in Denmark.
Welcome to the Career Journey Podcast, Paul, thank you very much for joining us. And it’s a pleasure to have you as our guest speaker today. Would you like to introduce yourself?
Hello there Alessia. Greetings, everyone. Yes, certainly. Thanks so much for having me. My name is Paul Anderton. I’m originally from the United Kingdom, but I’ve lived and worked in 11 different countries in my life now, including the last three years here in Denmark in Copenhagen. I am an international servant, international civil servant with the UNDP. As you just mentioned, I work as an HR manager for the Leadership Development team in the Office of Human Resources, in the UNDP’s Talent Development Unit. That would do is as a starting point. So back to you, Alessia.
Yes, thank you, Paul. That’s really interesting that you lived in 11 different countries. And so how did you become interested in this field?
I think when I go back and look at the course of my life, something fairly major changed for me when I was nine years old, when I moved from a small village where I was living in England, a small village that had more sheep than than people actually, that was very homogeneous. And because of my father’s work, we moved to Brussels in Belgium, one of the most international cities in Europe. I went to an international school, and all of a sudden, I went from going to a small rural primary school to a big international school, where I was sitting next to a boy from Tanzania, and a girl from Venezuela, and a boy from Bangladesh and a girl from Japan. And that really had an impact on me at that young age, and really made me interested both in travelling the world and seeing other places, learning, made me intensely curious about the world. And also made me passionate about the feeling of connectedness, the feeling that all of these different people in all different cultures around the world, we are all interdependent, and that an organisation like the United Nations really has an important role to play. And eventually that will be something that I will be able to, to contribute to. So, I guess that kind of international perspective was something that was influencing me from quite a young age, which I maybe didn’t realize so much at the time. But when I look at the kind of the path that my life took, both in terms of the places I ended up working, which includes Japan, and Zambia, Mexico, Nepal, I feel very lucky, very grateful for the possibilities that opened up for me to, to go to these kinds of places have an international career. And, you know, try to make the most of that, including my time here at UNDP.
Wow, thank you, Paul. That’s a really interesting story. I also went to an international school in my life here in Rome, and I do completely understand you when you say that you were sitting next to someone from Japan, someone from Bangladesh, I also had that experience. And it definitely gave me a bigger perspective of things of my life as well. So what does a typical day or week look like for you in this job?
So yeah, so maybe I should talk a bit more about what my job actually is. So as the manager of the leadership development team at UNDP, we’re overseeing all of the internal learning and development opportunities for UNDP’s leaders at all levels, and people managers, and that covers quite a wide range of of activities and programmes that we’re doing - obviously, a lot of online content, but also organising things like retreats, meetings and get-togethers. I would say that the one thing when we talk about a typical week is there is no such thing. There’s constantly different things that are being worked on, different projects, different initiatives. We have a really substantial work portfolio that we work towards with all the different leadership groups within UNDP. That’s Resident Representatives, whether it’s team leaders in country offices, keeping all those going while at the same time, UNDP is never shy to say okay, here’s a priority that we now need to give to you, whether that might be a Women’s Leadership Programme, or something related, due to inclusion of people with disabilities, so that variety is fascinating. The other thing that I think is absolutely essential for doing the job that I do is the kind of the communication and delegation with my team. So I’d say that the anchors are, in this, pretty variable and changing work schedule, the anchors are the regular team meetings, and one-on-one meetings I have with my team meetings. We have a distributed team, so we have a couple of people working with us here in Copenhagen, others who are located in other time zones and other parts of the world. And so therefore, it’s really important for us to have regular check-ins, to get on the same page in terms of what the work priorities are, who is doing what, who’s accountable for what, and I very much enjoy that part of the role as well, the people management, the getting to know other people. I found that the United Nations and UNDP in particular is a fascinating workplace, the people who work here are really interesting, have all kinds of fascinating stories. And I find that the best way that that we can kind of come and work together is to share those components of ourselves with each other that we’re most passionate about. That really elevates the team as a whole, and gets us motivated, even when we might be overwhelmed with a certain project or feeling tired, because we do we do have a lot of responsibility and a lot to do.
Okay, thank you. Wow, that was very descriptive and very useful for our listeners. And so what specific tools have been useful for you to develop career wise?
So in terms of tools, I was thinking, it’s in my career, it’s probably been less about kind of technical training or specific certification, so to speak, and more about kind of mindset and approach. So I think that some of the things in my career as a whole that have really helped me get to the point I am today includes things like agility, so being able to move from one thing to another, having, I guess, the self confidence that if I’m trying something that’s new to me that I can kind of fall back on the core skill set that I’ve kind of built up over time to get me through that, as well as the network of colleagues and others who can help me either with information or tips, mentor me through certain things to get me somewhere else. And when I was thinking about the idea of a career journey, my career — I don’t usually think of it in those terms, because it hasn’t ever really been kind of mapped out or planned to any great degree. The basic philosophy has been on my approach has been to be open to the opportunities that have come my way trying to follow my passions, which as I mentioned, have been around travel or around being an international civil servant. Also about international development work, that’s what my master’s degree is in, and I spent several years working as a development project manager and humanitarian worker before shifting more to an HQ role at UNDP. And that’s kind of incorporated some of the other skills and I guess, the different job titles that I’ve had over the years, all of those things have contributed different bits of pieces into the professional that I currently am. So I mentioned working in humanitarian worker in Zambia, Uganda in the past, but over time, I’ve also been a teacher, the university lecturer I’ve even though the short term jobs that I’ve had, whether that’s volunteering, I’ve done quite a bit of volunteering my life particularly with with refugees with the Red Cross, an International Rescue Committee, but also part time jobs as you know, things like a driver, a librarian, even a movie projectionist back in the day… All of these things have, you know, added little components into both my kind of my bank of experiences and skills, and also the way that I go about my job. So I mentioned kind of agility and moving from, from one thing to the next thing. Curiosity is also something that has been really important for my career, because that has meant that I have looked to keep growing and taking on different challenges, expanding the repertoire of things that I can do or will go put my hand up to take on. And in our team, the Talent Development Team here at UNDP, we often talk about the growth mindset, the idea that we’re constantly growing, we’re constantly evolving, we’re all on a continuous learning journey, where it’s not the case that — okay, after school in university, that’s it, your learning is done and you put it away. That’s not the way the world works. It’s not the way that work itself works. So, so that curiosity, agility, the growth mindset to keep trying new things. And I think, also important has been a willingness to take a few risks along the way. I kind of mentioned growing up in a small village in England, when I was young, I was pretty shy, I was not that confident. And I wouldn’t have dreamed, actually, that I would have taken on as many different things as I have done over the course of my life, taking chances to go and study for a year in the USA, where I didn’t know anyone, taking a first job after university in in Taiwan, part of the world where I didn’t speak the language, I didn’t know anyone, I have no idea what to expect. But it was a part of this…this kind of growth experience, and, led in all kinds of interesting directions.
Wow, that was really inspiring. I feel very inspired by that. Especially follow your passion. I feel like nowadays, it’s getting very competitive now, when you are in the search for jobs, but I do agree, follow your passion, agility, take risks, everything you mentioned. It’s nice to hear it once in a while. I feel like some people tend to forget, because of a lot of pressure in this in this environment with the job searching and stuff, especially after the pandemic, when you graduate as a student.
And I have to say as well, I can kind… in looking back, you tend to look at the highlights. There were plenty of lowlights along the way and plenty of moments of ‘oh my god, what is my next job gonna be’ or ‘what happens next’. And particularly when I think about my UN career, I’ve had every variety of contract there is, including being a pro bono volunteer, part time consultant, full time consultant, temporary appointment. I eventually got to a fixed term appointment, that was then abolished as opposed to, so went back not to having a post. I’ve gone through a team relocation, so all of these things are also happening, as well as along the way moments of great uncertainty about what what is the right thing to do? And where, where should I be, where should I be moving? And I do kind of see, not not just my career, but for all of us, our lives are a little bit in… in chapters that are being written as we go. And when you kind of look back at some of the completed chapters, it’s only then you can kind of see how everything came together. And I do sense that the moment that kind of the uncertainty and the questions that particularly young people have about, okay, what is our future going to look like? What kind of jobs am I going to have? What do I think about far from my career? It’s getting more and more challenging. And I think about that, in particular for for my daughters who are eleven and nine, so they still have a ways to go in their own education, but say, in 15/20 years from now, what the job market so to speak might look like is really hard to see. The speed at which the types of jobs that people are doing, or the jobs that people have, they’re just changing so rapidly. And that I think takes me back a little bit to what I was saying about being agile, being willing to change, and trying to build up your self-confidence that actually no, I will, be able to ride these waves and get someway good. And of course it helps a great deal ifunderneath that, the work that you’re doing or the place that you’re working connects to what you’re most passionate about.
Yes, yes, exactly. I agree with you. Overall, everything does move pretty fast, especially the market right now. But we’ll see, I guess, c’est la vie.
I think taking time to kind of really analyze and understand that for yourself. One thing I see that sometimes trips people up is that they might have certain expectations about what they think the world of work should be, or they joined a particular organisation and they have a certain idea — this is exactly what is gonna happen when I get there — And then maybe that’s not quite the reality. So I think the more research you can do, or the more analysis or reflection you can do, both in terms of the work and the job that you’re going into but also in terms of yourself and what you need or what you want to have in your career, that’s really going to help so. So take some time for self-reflection for analysis, and it might be that you see certain jobs where you think okay, well the job looks good, but actually, I’m not sure I fit in that organisation or vice versa, that’s an organisation I want to work for. But is that what they want to be doing? It’s not straightforward at all. And yeah, it’s something that yeah, I myself, I’m still in the middle of. You know, I’m mid career, I’ve probably got 15/20 years to go until until I’d be able to retire. So I’m also surfing the wave.
Yeah, you’re right. I think self-reflection comes with any age. But it’s definitely something that one should do once in a while, you know, especially when it comes to work. And just, overall, how you’re feeling with your job and what you want to do next.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, so one more question, which I believe it’s very important. What role does networking play in your career?
This is an interesting one, because I was thinking back to especially when I first joined the UN, I think I had a vision of networking that is quite different from how I see it now. Because back then, I had quite a hard view of of people who I saw as ‘networkers’. I thought that they were being a bit mercenary, maybe in terms of okay, to network, I need to find the people who are going to help me move up in my career, the people who are going to give me backing or information that’s going to get me a promotion, or get me where I want to be. And that all felt a bit inauthentic. And I think, certainly there are some people who take that approach to networking. But the way that I understand networking now, and how I’d recommend other people who maybe think more like me about it, who maybe don’t feel comfortable with that more aggressive approach to networking, is that really, networking is a long term thing. It’s something where you’re looking to make connections with people. And for me, I feel most comfortable when it’s authentic human connections in the workplace. And I mentioned before being curious, I am constantly curious about my colleagues, in terms of how did they come to UNDP or whichever partner we might be working with, what drives them? What are they passionate about? What do we have in common? And that I think helps the the immediate working relationship. But it also gives you this network of people who, in the future, they might come to you with a question you might go to them with something you want to ask about, there might be just kind of shared information, or just an awareness of, oh, okay, I know that person who’s really good at X, Y, and Z. I’ve got this one thing where I need some help with X, Y, and Z, I’ll just check in with them. And it kind of goes in both directions. So I guess my second recommendation would be not to see networking as something that you have to do to progress in your career, so much as something that can actually be an enjoyable human part of the work experience. We spend so much of our daily life at work, and one of the things I most appreciate about working in the UN is the incredibly diverse and interesting workforce that we have. That’s something that’s both meaningful to me and I think that’s been important in the work that I do and what whatever comes next. And one last thing, because it’s kind of, slightly off to the side, in terms of, of networking. I’ve been quite an active user of LinkedIn. And that’s something where you’ve got some virtual networking at play, which obviously, is not the same thing as what I’ve just been talking about. So on LinkedIn, you’ll have connections to some of your teammates, or people that you work with, or people that you know pretty well, then there’ll be looser connections to maybe people who are in your organisation, but you don’t know, or people who are outside your organisation in other places. And then there’s also connections to sometimes really random group of people who you have no idea who they are. But in that virtual space, there’s a different type of networking going on. And for me, the way that I use LinkedIn is pretty much in three ways. So one is to, to kind of help show the work that I do and the work that my team does to give to kind of highlight what it is that we’ve actually been working on, which can also help me as well in terms of remembering what we’ve what we’ve done over the years. Also, I think LinkedIn is very good in terms of being a good advocate for UNDP itself and for the UN itself, because there’s plenty of posts from different parts of UNDP or the UN system, in terms of the the good work that we’re doing, and I think anyone who works in the UN system, it is part of what we should be doing — helping to support and promote the UN values, you know, the amazing work that we are doing. And then the last thing is also in terms of some of the people who are looking for work themselves. So I regularly reshare links to job vacancy announcements or interesting career opportunities within UNDP or elsewhere that I think that people will find value in. So those are kind of two different strands of networking. I hope that makes sense.
Yes Paul, it completely does. I believe that when I started this internship, I think that the networking has given me a bigger perspective in the way that I network with my colleagues to enjoy the relationship and to get to know them and to understand where they’re coming from, what their values and missions are. This has been really nice, and I don’t know Paul, if you have anything else to say?
So thank you so much Alessia for having invited me to take part and thank you to anyone who’s made it to the end of this this interview. I appreciate you listening!
Thank you so much for coming and thank you all for listening. We hope our conversations will inspire you to keep learning and advancing in your careers. And make sure to share this episode with any social platform you all have. We will see you all for the next time!

What a weekend. I just had the pleasure to explore Copenhagen in Denmark for a bit. I took lots of photos with my beloved Fujifilm X100V and the conversion lenses. In this little article, I will share some of my favorite shots & spots from this trip.
All the photos you’ll see, have been edited with my presets. If you’re interested, you can get them here: www.chrisperkles.at
We arrived at a Wednesday night in the capital of Denmark, and we stayed in the Huxley Hotel in the center of the city. The location of the hotel made it easy to get everywhere by foot.
We started the first beautiful sunny fresh march day at Nyhavn, since it was next to our Hotel. The good thing was that on a Thursday morning, it was not too busy, and we could find a good spot for breakfast close to the water and in the sun.
After having some good brunch, we walked towards Kastellet along the water shore. Spotting some nice architecture and beautiful views.
Kastellet is something special. For me, as an old Stronghold gamer, this was very pleasant to see, how the castle was shaped and still used today.
After the castle, we walked back towards the center and checked out the Frederiks Kirke and Schloss Amalienborg. There we enjoyed a parade from the oldschool military.
Next on our list was Schloss Rosenborg and the attached garden. Since it was March, the garden was not that pretty because nothing was blooming. But the small palace was impressive.
Feeling: Hungry. So let’s get some food. In the area of Schloss Rosenborg, we found a place called Brdr. Price. Food was delicious, service was great and the location very pretty. 10/10 recommend.
Back on energy, we headed towards the Botanical Garden, but we’ve been too late, it was already closed. So the replacement program was the Rundetarn, an observatory with a beautiful view over Copenhagen.
That was the closing of our first day here. We spent a nice evening having some dinner and relaxing.
New day, new luck. We started the day with a quick breakfast and then heading towards the botanical garden again. This time we were on time.
In the evening we walked through the city, checked out some stores and just had a good time.
After all, this was a very beautiful trip, with some great food and beautiful weather. I can recommend copenhagen to everyone, but consider, that town is expensive as hell. The food compared to Austria is at least 50% — 100% more expensive. If you have any questions, send me a message on Instagram or leave a comment here.

Welcome, wanderlust-driven adventurers, to the enchanting city of Copenhagen! Nestled on the scenic shores of Denmark, this vibrant metropolis boasts a mesmerizing blend of rich history, modern design, and irresistible charm. I would always stop by Copenhagen if I needed to fly from the Kastrup Airport. It is the coolest capital in the Nordic country in my opinion. In this article, five must-do experiences will be unveiled. So, grab your sense of adventure and let’s dive into the heart of this magical Danish capital!
Escape the hustle and bustle of the city and find tranquility amidst the lush greenery of the Rosenborg Garden. Located in the heart of Copenhagen, this expansive park is the perfect spot to enjoy a leisurely picnic surrounded by natural beauty in the typical Nodic summer afternoon. Spread out your blanket on the soft grass, bask in the warm Danish sunshine, and savor a delicious spread of local treats, a nice Danish sandwich will be a great choice.
The garden’s meticulously embedded flowers, tranquil ponds, and majestic trees provide a picturesque backdrop for your picnic. As you indulge in your culinary delights, take a moment to admire the stunning Renaissance-style Rosenborg Castle, which stands as a guardian over the garden. Whether you’re seeking a romantic escape or a peaceful retreat with friends and family, picnicking in the Rosenborg Garden is an absolute must-do in Copenhagen.
Step into a world straight out of a Hans Christian Andersen story at the iconic Tivoli Gardens. This whimsical amusement park, dating back to 1843, exudes an atmosphere of wonder and nostalgia. Stroll through enchanting gardens, take a thrilling ride on the roller coasters, and enjoy live performances by talented musicians and actors. As dusk descends, Tivoli transforms into a mesmerizing wonderland of twinkling lights, with charming food stalls offering delicious treats. Tivoli Gardens truly encapsulates the essence of Copenhagen’s charm and should not be missed.
For those seeking retail therapy, Strøget is an absolute must. This bustling pedestrian street stretches across the heart of Copenhagen and is one of Europe’s longest shopping streets. Lose yourself in a retail wonderland as you walk by the high-end boutiques, trendy international brands, and Danish design stores one after another. But Strøget is not just about shopping — it’s a vibrant hub of entertainment, with street performers, charming cafés, and historical landmarks along the way, like Round Tower, City Hall and the Parliament building. Take your time to explore the side streets and hidden courtyards, where you’ll stumble upon unique treasures and delightful surprises.
At the end of the pedestrian street, you can see the most colorful corner of Copenhagen, Nyhavn. It gives you a chance to embrace the picturesque waterfront district that perfectly captures the city’s allure. Its vibrant row of colorful 17th-century townhouses will transport you to a time when sailors, artists, and dreamers roamed these very streets. Stroll along the canal, admiring the quaint boats floating on the water, and indulge in the delectable Danish pastries at the local cafés. Nyhavn is a haven for photographers, and you’ll find endless photo opportunities at every corner. Soak up the lively atmosphere, raise a glass of Carlsberg, and toast to the beauty of Copenhagen.
Prepare to enter a world within a world at Christiania, an autonomous neighborhood that defies convention and embraces its own unique spirit. Founded in the early 1970s, this self-proclaimed “freetown” is a haven for artists, musicians, activists, and free thinkers. Meander through the colorful streets, adorned with vibrant murals, and immerse yourself in the eclectic atmosphere. Discover artisanal shops, organic cafés, and offbeat music venues. While Christiania’s unconventional nature may not be for everyone, it offers a fascinating glimpse into a subculture that celebrates creativity and alternative lifestyles, concurring with a typical hedonist Danish image.
While you’re around the neighborhood, why not visit the top of the Vor Frelsers Kirke? From there, you can look over the whole city, with everything under your eyes. The church also preserves the oldest pipe organs in Copenhagen.
In Copenhagen, where fairy tales blend with regal history, a visit to both Amalienborg and the Little Mermaid promises a captivating journey through time and folklore. Begin your royal escapade at Amalienborg, the present royal castle and residence of the Danish royal family. Marvel at the elegant architecture as you explore the majestic palace complex, composed of four identical rococo-style palaces surrounding an enchanting courtyard. Witness the Changing of the Guard ceremony, where soldiers in their distinctive bearskin hats create a scene straight out of a storybook.
From the regal splendor of Amalienborg, venture to the tranquil shores of Langelinie to meet the iconic Little Mermaid. A short stroll along the promenade leads you to the petite bronze statue perched on a rock, gazing longingly into the sea. This beloved symbol of Copenhagen, inspired by Hans Christian Andersen’s enchanting tale, captures the imagination of visitors from around the world. If you are lucky, you may see swans along side with the mermaid, making this walk even more fairytale-like.
Copenhagen, with its blend of history and creativity, is a destination that promises to captivate every traveler. It is a perfect choice for those who come to visit Scandinavia for the first time. Whether you find yourself lost in the whimsical world of Tivoli Gardens, savoring the colorful sights of Nyhavn, or immersing yourself in the bohemian allure of Christiania, this enchanting city will leave an unforgettable mark on your soul.

My perfect day in CPH starts in Vesterbro, my favorite neighborhood in the city. Formerly a blue-collar neighborhood, it’s known for its hipsters, dive bars, and murals, so I feel right at home, thinking of the Mission District in San Francisco, my second home I left behind.
The main drag, Istegade is grungy and chic in turns: Central Station where Istegade begins crawls with junkies and hookers. Early in the morning, that area is fogged with old cigarette smoke and the clouded eyes of unseeing street-walkers. The Danes are modestly boastful about this last bastion of filth in their practical little city, and the fact that they invented the concept of modern porn as we know it.
My morning begins with pastries. I lived in Paris for years, but I might go out on a limb and say that the Danes’ pastry and bread-making skills are on par if not slightly above the French in general. Near the end of Istegade is BRØD, where a sandy-haired young Viking stands behind the counter and gruffly hands over fresh-baked bread, steaming heft and wholesomeness in his likeness.
One of the things you must do to fully enjoy CPH is rent a bike. The bike roads are so well-paved, the city so level, and the air so crisp, it’ll make you wonder what you did to deserve this bliss. Ride down the suspended bike-only bridge by Fisketorvet mall, and head to the docks for a canal tour, preferably one where they give you warm wine, or gløgg. (I swear I’m not choosing all of these words based on the funky-looking Danish “ø,” which is called a Faroese, you nerds.)
During the tour of the Copenhagen canals, you will learn many things about this watery city, like how it was founded in 1167, about the illustrious reign of King Christian IV, and their near-constant naval humiliations. But the most impressive of all is the newly built power plant, Amager Bakke, which imports waste from neighboring countries to generate energy. The smoke produced from the plant is 95 percent water, with which they aim to recreate the freshness of a mountaintop near the plant’s chimneys where the world’s largest man-made ski slope starts. If that is not doing the MOST good, I don’t know what is.
Back on land, it’ll be time for lunch. Torvehallerne is a fresh food market that delights the senses of food-obsessed world travelers and Copenhageners. Definitely have the smørrebrød, which is dark rye bread covered in all good things like smoked salmon, roast beef, or shrimp, smothered in aioli, nuts, and dill. After that you could check out the Design Museum, one of the best of its kind. But the mother of Danish design and supreme engenderer of material covetousness is Illums Bolighus downtown, the most spectacular design and living store I’ve been inside.
By the time I’ve had my fill of looking at pretty things I can’t afford it’ll be around 3 or 4pm, when people get off work. Yes, you heard me right. It’s time for a drink. A Danish friend told me Denmark has the highest per-capita consumption of coffee, ice cream, and beer. I didn’t check these facts, but I believe him because he’s a doctor.
Whatever you choose to drink, make sure to have a good view of the street to watch the commuting Danes. Other than the fact that they are ridiculously good-looking, one thing struck me as particularly notable: the amount of blond-haired children in the street accompanied not only by their beautiful mothers, but invariably by their fathers as well. Truly, I had never seen a city where so many men were catering to their children. This is the first place I’ve ever been where having kids and taking care of them isn’t emasculating for men or akin to career suicide for women. It was almost as though toxic masculinity had been wiped out. Maternity and paternity leave is mandated by law, and not a miserly few weeks for the mother only, but a whole year, that’s fifty-two weeks of paid leave to be shared between the parents. The government takes good care of its citizens.
Coming from San Francisco and Seoul, where none of my career-driven girlfriends dare having children until they are settled and secure well into their mid-thirties, I suddenly had the creeping suspicion that the rest of the world had got it all wrong. The Danes had figured life out. Everyone was well-fed, a feeling of wholesome well-being permeated the city with the brisk salty air coming off the Baltic Sea.
This was the ideal socialist Utopia, or the closest thing I’d ever seen. The possible future of feminism and mankind invigorated me. But looking around, my heart sank. No one here looked like me. People of color were rare and far in between: I would never belong here. I would always be considered a tourist, or worse, a Thai masseuse.
The Danes are kind but insular people who are sometimes described as cold by expats. Their days and weekends are filled with family picnics and parties that outsiders aren’t invited to. What they have, their culture, their practical sensibilities and husbandry of their surroundings, their dedication to the good life represented by hygge are treasures that should be protected.
But CPH is where one of the worst housing crisis in Europe is taking place for students, newcomers, and immigrants. Denmark receives less refugees per capita than any other Western European country excepting the UK. It is a far cry from what Denmark’s neighbor, Sweden is doing. The future and health of a city can be judged based on their treatment of outsiders, people who aren’t from there who want to move there. And it struck me as sad that some nationalists might cite Denmark as a good example to close their borders to people in need.
When I am about to be depressed by my own thoughts, it’s time to head to Christiania. Christiania Freetown is the jewel of Copenhagen, a radical morsel of prime real estate that hippies took over in the 70s smack-dab in the middle of the city. Until quite recently they didn’t pay for electricity or taxes, operating under their own laws. Before sunset is the ideal time to go there to check out the architecture, which is a euphemism for the only place that sells weed in the open in Denmark. Sit on the outdoor benches or by the water with a beer in hand and feel that brotherly love seep back into you.
When it becomes too cold to sit outside, I would head back towards Vesterbro to Kødbyens, the meat-packing district filled with restaurants and nightclubs to continue the night until the sun comes up. As I creep back home in the morning, the streets are quiet and subdued, foggy and windy like no one lives in this sleepy town. There is none of that anxious energy that makes a big city spin, spin, spin. Bukowski’s saying, “Find what you love and let it kill you,” is not a phrase that goes down well with the practical Danes nor with the soporific comforts offered by hygge.
And I love CPH because it helps me imagine a different life where I don’t have to kill myself for my career, or tamp down every instinct until I make something out of myself. If only one could belong here.

Have you ever arrived in a city so tired from traveling, but somehow the energy of the place wakes you up? That’s exactly what happened when I landed in Copenhagen…
We got to Copenhagen on Friday morning after a ridiculously early 6 AM flight, and we were dead tired. We didn’t have any time to lose so we set out for the hostel. We took the train to Steel House, which was hands down the best hostel we’ve been to yet. It had everything — pool, gym, cinema, you name it. We dropped our bags and headed to the city. Upon arrival we stopped and listened to a singer on the streets, it was super cool to see him perform.
Locating the Streets and Gasoline Grill
Copenhagen has an atmosphere that makes you just want to walk around. We walked around the streets, dropped by Rosenborg Castle, and let the city reveal itself. Somewhere along the way, hunger caught up with us, and we went to Gasoline Grill, which serves famous burgers. The burger was just what we needed and it set the tone for the day.
The Old Irish Pub and Barkowski’s
We continued walking and ended up at this place called “The Old Irish Pub,” where they had a live band playing. The atmosphere was just right with a good energy. We sat back, listened to the music, and just absorbed the atmosphere. It was a mix of locals and tourists, and it felt like one of those pubs you find on a college campus.
We finally checked into the hostel at 3pm and freshened up to then head back out into town. This time we headed to Barkowski’s, a restaurant/bar that was full of people. We had heard that they heard pull tables but didn’t see them at first sight. After an urgent search we headed downstairs to the basement and found the pool tables and asked some locals if we could play them. They were excited to play “The Americans” and spoke great english. We ended up beating them in a best-of-5 series and it felt very good to win. We hung out for a little while longer and listened to the jazz/rock that was playing, then called it a night.
CopenHot and relaxing, and partying at Rumors
The next morning, we were ready for something entirely new. We went to CopenHot, where they have hot tubs right on the water. It was busy, but in the best way possible — people were just hangin’ out, relaxing. We even did the ice plunge for a bit. The cold was terrible but the instant jump back into the hot tub made up for it. The soft music in the background made all this feel ultra peaceful. It was just the reset we needed.
Then we were hungry and went to War Pigs to get BBQ. As someone who is from Texas, I can vouch that it was some of the best BBQ I had had. The mac and cheese was phenomenal and it paired just right with the pulled pork sandwich. It was the ideal way to finish off a relaxing morning, and I would eat in again in an instant if I could.
We napped briefly, then prepared for the evening. We headed to The Jane, a former library turned bar. The music was just what you’d expect if you were in a library listening to music. It was definitely a first for me and it almost makes you feel like you are in a library. It had books on the walls and the lighting was very dim. It was a very mellow vibe.
Though that changed pretty quickly… We then headed to a club called Rumors. It was all EDM and sing-along tracks here, and the atmosphere was on a whole different level. People were dancing in what looked like a pit.. The music was blasting, and we got to feel what its like to almost be at a concert in Denmark. We met some locals, danced and then called it a night to end our trip.
The Copenhagen Vibe
By the time we got back to the hostel, I had concluded that Copenhagen somehow felt like Amsterdam — the buildings, the bars, the surprises around every corner. There’s a sense of never having any idea what’s gonna happen next and what place you will end up in. Everywhere we went was somewhere completely different and somehow we had a great time everywhere we went. And honestly, the music in this city ended up shaping the whole experience. It was the soundtrack to it all, establishing mood and rendering each moment a little more memorable.
Thanks for reading! If you enjoyed this post, make sure to follow my account for more travel stories and insights. Stay tuned for next week’s adventure .

After a long, dark, freezing, and often soul-crushing winter, Copenhagen slowly begins to come alive in April. It’s green and beautiful with colorful flowers all over the city.
And right in the middle of so many colors, when the cherry trees blossom, their delicate white and pink petals create a stunning contrast against the lush green grass and the clear blue sky.
Copenhagen is full of cherry blossom trees. You see them everywhere. They are in the gardens of tall buildings and standalone houses, in playgrounds, near water bodies, and even lining the roads.
This was quite surprising for me during my first year here. I always pictured Denmark as people biking through the streets, taking icy dips in the sea, and sipping coffee with Danish pastries in cozy cafés.
But cherry blossoms?
That was something I never expected.
This was one of the sweetest surprises that Copenhagen, the world’s happiest city, has given me.
I’ve travelled to over 20 countries, some just once, others many times, but Japan has always remained a dream. Though I have planned many times, a trip to…

Overview
Schrödinger’s cat was a thought experiment proposed by Erwin Schrödinger in a discussion with Albert Einstein in an attempt to illustrate the insufficiencies of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. The experiment questioned the validity of superposition and posed the largely unsolved question of at which point a superposition collapses into one of its possible states.
Superposition — Young’s Double Split Experiment
Superposition plays an essential role in the Copenhagen interpretation and thus Schrödinger’s thought experiment. It is the ability of a quantum system to simultaneously exist in multiple states until observed. The idea is demonstrated by Thomas Young’s double-slit experiment, where a beam of light is aimed at a barrier with two small vertical slits. The light that has passed through the slits is measured on a photographic plate. When one of the vertical slits is covered, a single line of light is observed on the photographic plate on the side of the uncovered slit. If both are left uncovered, however, rather than two lines of light, there are many more on the photographic plate. In route to the photographic plate, each photon exists in a state of each of its possible trajectories, demonstrating a concept called interference, which is essentially the superposition of waves.
In an attempt to further analyze the trajectories of the photons, experiments have been conducted to track their paths. Doing this, however, seems to disrupt the superposition of the photons, creating what would be expected by classical physics on the photographic plate, two lines of light mirroring the slits in the preceding barrier. It appears that the superposition of a particle can not be directly measured; its effects (interference) can only be observed.
Schrödinger’s Cat
Schrödinger’s Cat is a thought experiment that was proposed by Erwin Schrödinger in a discussion with Albert Einstein to highlight the seemingly ridiculous nature of the concepts of superposition used in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. The Copenhagen interpretation briefly states that a quantum system remains in a state of superposition until directly observed by the outside world. When observed, the superposition collapses into one of its possible states. For example, when the photons in Young’s double-slit experiment were measured, they collapsed into one of their possible trajectories, creating two lines of light.
Schrödinger, attempting to disprove the practicality of superposition, proposed a hypothetical in which a larger system was dependent on the superposition of a quantum particle. Schrödinger suggested that if a cat were placed inside a sealed box with a radioactive particle and a flask of poison and the poison was only released if the particle decayed and released radiation, the mortality of the cat would be subject to the state of the radioactive particle. Because the Copenhagen interpretation states that the radioactive particle is in a position of both decayed and not decayed, the cat, by extension, will be in a position of both alive and dead until observed by the outside world. The goal was not to propose the practicality of simultaneously dead and alive cats, instead the thought experiment emphasized the unrealistic implications the Copenhagen interpretation had at a larger scale.
The thought experiment had brought to light a question that is still largely unsolved today: “At what point does a particle stop existing as a superposition and collapse into one of its possible states?” The Copenhagen interpretation had assumed this would happen when an observation of the superposition takes place.
Von Neumann Interpretation
In response to the flaws of the Copenhagen interpretation, John von Neumann proposed the idea that the radioactive particle is observed by the device that detects radiation which is subsequently observed by the controlled flask holding the poison. The point at which the superposition of the particle collapses is not significant. The only point at which the superposition must collapse is when there is a conscious observer. Even this interpretation, however, has been rejected by a thought experiment proposed by Eugene Wigner called Wigner’s friend. Other interpretations include the ensemble interpretation, relational interpretation, and transactional interpretation all with the common goal of identifying at which point a superposition collapses, a question posed by Erwin Schrödinger’s famous thought experiment: Schrödinger’s cat.

“Jonathan just tested positive for Covid here this morning.” My son Dan called me from Copenhagen with the bad news. And he called just minutes before I was to fly there for a long-anticipated visit to Copenhagen, to visit Dan and his family. I was devastated. I knew it would be crazy at age 87 to head off to Copenhagen when someone in the household there had Covid. I canceled.
I had been reading and talking about Denmark for weeks and I found myself continuing to do research and hold forth on Denmark. And now, dear readers, I want to share some of the amazing information that I have learned and to tell you why what is going on in Denmark matters to each of us. Even if we never go there.
Denmark has been ranked as the best place on earth to live and also the best of all countries in terms of quality of life. It has been named as the least corrupt country in the world and number one in terms of protecting the environment and gender equality. It has been ranked the 2nd happiest country on earth, (after Finland) for…

Alright. I have completely fallen in love with Copenhagen. If I were to do college again, I would study abroad here… in the summer ; ). It’s seriously such a magical place — the parks, the bike lanes, the zero noise pollution, the food, the “hygge”… I could go on. Copenhagen is considered one of the happiest cities in the world, + I can totally see why.
Pro Tip — Bike… everywhere. Literally, everywhere.
1] Mad + Kaffe: MUST. HAVE. BRUNCH. HERE. They serve brunch until 12:30 every day. Wow. I can’t believe a spot like this is not in Chicago yet. This has been voted “best brunch in Copenhagen.”
2] Wulff + Konstali: Another — MUST. HAVE. BRUNCH. HERE. They serve brunch until 3 PM [even better!]. Go to the one on Ameagerbro, so that you can go to the beach after!
3] Grod: We went here for takeaway dinner, but I wish I could have come for breakfast! Everything is porridge based… sounds weird but it’s SO GOOD.
For Next Time (Brunch) — Baryl, Social, Bowl Market, Cafe Det Vide Has, Moeller Kaffe + Kokken
Coffee — Coffee Collective, Original Coffee, Statement Coffee, Prolog Coffee Bar
Bakeries — Sankt Peders Bageri [cinnamon rolls on Wednesdays! ++ Copenhagen’s oldest bakery!], Leckerbaer, Isoteket, , Juno The Bakery, Lilli Bakery, Hart Bageri, Meyers Bageri, Bageriet Brod
Sweets — Nicecream, ISTID, Social Foods, Granny’s House [in Torvehallerne]
1] La Banchina: Hands down favorite spot in Copenhagen for a few reasons: the food is incredible [apps = bread + olive oil, olives, + almonds… + then the starter, fish, vegetable, + dessert change every day!], THEN after dinner: jump in the water… + then warm up by the fire + SAUNA. They are also open for breakfast, which is probably so dreamy too.
2] Organic Boho: We stumbled upon this place on our way to Christiana [the hippy town] + WOW, obsessed. Get the burger with tempeh, + THE LOVE PLATE [my fav]. They have tons of beautiful drinks too — juices, smoothies, + rainbow lattes ; ).
3] 42Raw: I love that so many spots in Copenhagen have easy “takeaway” options. We ordered takeaway to bring on the Go Boat: acai bowl, green bowl [“this almost tastes too healthy” — Isaac], salad of the day, + chocolate PB cup. The sweet potato fries looked bomb, too.
4] Neighbourhood: Organic pizza + cocktails… what more do you need? Oh, + TRUFFLE POPCORN. Make sure to get the burrata love pizza.
5] Sprod: You know a place is good when they don’t have an English menu. We ordered the chicken sandwich to split as a snack… + then instantly ordered another one. SO YUM.
6] District Tonkin: This place has the “best banh mi in Copenhagen” + it lived up to the hype . Chicken lemongrass banh mi + pho = winning combo.
7] Souls: This won the most sustainable restaurant in Copenhagen, AND best vegan restaurant — so definitely go. The warm potato salad was liiiiiife. ++ the summer lemonade.
8] Aamanns Deli: A trip to Copenhagen is not complete without trying a smorresbrod. There’s a few Aamanns, depending on the experience you want — I liked the deli because you can eat it in the restaurant, or easily choose takeaway + bring it to a park!
9] Kodbyens Fiskebar: MUSSELS : ) This was the fanciest restaurant that we went to [on our last night]. It’s in the Meat Packing District… we hopped around to a few places — staying at each place for an hour while ordering: drink + one item from the menu to share, what we call #AppyHour.
10] Smag: The BEST salads + sandwiches, oh my gosh. Go before a picnic!
For Next Time — Morganstedt, SimpleRaw, dop, Bollyfood, WEDOFOOD, Gro Spiseri, Ma Poule [duck sandwich is apparently amazing], Kaf, California Kitchen, Mahalle CPH, Plantepolsen, Barabba, Amass [$$$$], Kadea [$$$$], Noma ; ) [$$$$ — named the best restaurant in the WORLD]
Markets — Copenhagen out did themselves with all the markets here. Like, WOW. Trovehallerne is obviously a must… make sure to get Smag, GROD, a chocolate peanut butter brownie from Granny’s House. Other fabulous markets are The Bridge Street Kitchen, Reffen, Rebel Food, + Tivoli Food Hall.
1] Mikkeller + Friends: Apparently the best spot for beer in Copenhagen.
2] WarPigs: Go for the beer, stay for the MEAT. Omg, literally — the brisket was to diiiiie for. *Make a stop here during #AppyHour.
3] Noho: Funky cocktails + hip vibe. *Make a stop here during #AppyHour.
4] Grab Wine… Literally Anywhere: Drink in a park, on the streets, by the lake, etc. It’s open container law!
For Next Time — Sidecar, BRUS, Baghaven, Himmeriget, Lidoeb, Malbeck Vinbar
1] ALL. THE. PARKS: Faelledparken, Svanemoelle Beach, The Citadel, Frederiksberg Gardens (*probably my fav because you get a shot of the zoo in the park + can see the elephants!), Superkilen, King’s Garden, Botanical Gardens… + more. If I lived here, I would spend every day in a park. They are all so gorgeous + unique. You must visit them all!
2] Walk Down These Streets:
3] Go Boat: We chose this over the Canal Tour [if I had time, I’d do both!] — you rent a boat to drive… yourself… with no experience required! Aha. It’s right next to the Islands Brygge Harbour Bath, which you should definitely go to on a sunny day. *Book ahead of time!
4] Tivoli: Copenhagen’s second oldest amusement park, + right in the center of town. It’s definitely worth a stop.
5] Visit The Cemeteries: Sounds creepy, but this is also a must. Vestre Cemetery + Assistens Cemetery are incredibly beautiful.
6] Christiania: The hippie commune — the only place hash/weed is legal in Copenhagen. Super funky to walk through... most people built their homes themselves! Couple things to note: I wouldn’t go there at night, no photos are allowed, + no running.
7] Shop Vintage: Check out this guide for the flea markets!
8] Wellness: I wasn’t able to test any of these out, but I heard great things about: YO Studios, NOR Nordic Health House, CopenHot, Hot Yoga CPH.
We stayed at Hotel SP34— incredible free breakfast every day, in a great spot in town [a bike store is like two seconds away… or you can rent bikes at the hotel], + WINE HOUR EVERY DAY! Also, there are a few other hotels close by in the same collective, so you can go there for wine hour, too ; ). Check out Brochner Hotels. / *One thing I will say is the room we booked was TINY.
There are so many components within Copenhagen that I want to bring back to Chicago — particularly BIKE LANES. ++ how they do brunch… + all the parks. I’m in loooooove. Please visit!
What did I miss? Let me know!
++ Elisabeth

Copenhagen, Denmark, has a unique and interesting transit system. When looking at it at first, most will just see the S-train network, that by any means is not the largest one in the world. But it’s a quite effective network. And when combined with the metro that got added to the Copenhagen transit network back in 2002 when the first 2 lines opened.
The S-train network has been running since 1934. It was the vision for the network, even before it was born that it should be 100% electrified. And it has been, from its start until today, it has only been running on electricity. This vision was part of some earlier work done by The Electrification Commission of 1926, that wanted to electrify many of the commuter rails in and around the suburbs of Copenhagen.
The first line opened the 3rd of April 1934, and ran from Klampenborg via Hellerup and Vanløse and terminated at Frederiksberg. This exact line is now defunct and does not exist in today's network. Along with a timetable…

My interest to explore Copenhagen stemmed from the immaculate design culture that I had heard of . In the quest to explore the origin of hygge life we left for about week’s adventure to Copenhagen.
Fun Fact: The Danish Royal Family holds the title of the oldest monarchy. If Queen Elizabeth visits she will need to bow down to the Queen and King of Denmark.
2. Food & Drink: During my visit, the surprising find for me has been the refined food scene here. Unlike other cities, I did not go here with a focus on devouring food all day but I was pleasantly surprised by the offerings. It could be the influence of René Redzepi’s Noma, which is seen as one of the best restaurants in the world potentially attracting a lot of culinary talent here. Although, I could not get reservation at Noma these are some restaurants that left me wanting more:
Similarly for drinks some spots to check out are:
3. Fashion & Art: When I travel, I love to check out local stores that depict the local style. For sartorial trends street style was definitely trending in the city. Most of the stores I went to showcased unisex easy to wear style. Some stores that were interesting to check out are:
You cannot leave Copenhagen without checking out the best in class design stores. Some to check out are:
4. Must see: As mentioned, Copenhagen is a beautiful city. To understand its past and present I would recommend you to check out these spots, which span all over the city and gives you a good idea on what Copenhagen is all about.
Nyhavn: Street with beautiful colorful building. Great for an evening stroll.
Garden Royal: Close to Aamann’s great to catch a break here and check the rose garden.
Supekilen: For all the reasons listed above highly recommend to check this out. Although a bit away from city center.
Freetown Christiania: This is a free commune which operates as a local body without any governance from local government. It is an interesting oasis in the middle of the city , which is worth checking out.
Nyboder houses: Built in 1757, these houses have lasted several city fires and provides a little flavor of the past.
Church of Savior: This church gives a great aerial view of the city. Worth climbing up the 700 stairs to check out the cityscapes.
Design Museum of Denmark: This museum provides Danish sensibility and evolution from everywhere across fashion, architecture, furniture.
5. Tips & Tricks: These are some quick tips that I wanted to leave you with while planning your trip.

I just got back from my two-week trip across most of Northern Europe. This is my third trip back to Europe. (My first was a summer abroad in Italy nearly 8 years ago and my second was another two-week trip in 2014 where we explored Dublin, London, Amsterdam, and Paris.) I daresay this was the best so far! Thom and I visited Stockholm, Copenhagen, Berlin, and again, Amsterdam this time around. In order to share our experience and to create a living record of its details, I’ve decided to write across a few posts on each city and its adventures. This first post serves to detail our overall travel plans, information on flights/places to stay, tips on light packing, and general advice for good travel. I should mention that I’m not an expert on any other these things but it’s worth sharing the little knowledge that I gained before, during, and after this trip.
To begin with, here are a few starting facts about our trip:
Let’s begin by discussing budget flights. Nine months before this vacation even happened I found some non-stop flights from Oakland to Stockholm for $600 a person. These flights kicked off the entire trip and made everything possible. I recall the very first time I ever flew to Europe. (Which was 8 years this summer!) It was to Genoa, Italy from Buffalo, NY. That flight had three stops (Buffalo to NYC, NYC to Frankfurt, and Frankfurt to Milan) and one train (Milan to Genoa) in order to get to my destination with a total of over 20+ hours at a hefty price of $1500. (Thanks Aer Lingus! 🖕) So to come across a flight that was only 10 hours and non-stop to my choice destination, it felt like fate...
Doesn’t that last sentence feel so inspiring? Statements and facts like those are the gold and shiny wrapper on the cheap bar of travel chocolate. Here’s the nitty-gritty of budget flying:
With some of the add-ons and extra taxes, our $600 tickets actually came to $711.30 a person. Our in-between flights from city to city were around $50 a person. (As compared to a train from Berlin to Amsterdam which was $120 a ticket.) In the end, you have to deal with the minor annoyances for that 💰deal.
Let’s move on to transportation.
Thom and I took public transit for the most part. (I’ll discuss the bicycling and Uber rides a bit later in some of my city posts.) For us, it’s a fun challenge learning a new city’s public transit. And unlike American public transportation, European public transportation is fast, convenient, and very, VERY reliable. Upon arriving at the Arlanda Airport, which is located just outside of Stockholm, we took the Arlanda Express Train that runs directly to the city center in just 20 minutes. (As compared to my 1.5 hour MUNI and BART trip to Oakland International Airport. 😑) Out of the four cities we visited, Berlin boasted the fastest and most reliable transportation (dat German innovation) with Amsterdam coming in at a close second. (Trams, trams everywhere!) All the trams, trains, and buses that we took were clean and clearly marked. My only complaint was the summer heat which was especially felt in the enclosed and non-air conditioned trains.
I plan to discuss each Airbnb in detail for each city post but in general our decision to use this service came from a few points:
Finally, let’s talk about packing. Much like my last Europe trip, I took a single backpack and personal bag with me. That was it! Now that this trip is over, I can say, quite proudly, that it was the best decision that I made for packing. After each city we visited, Thom and I both got a little better at packing our bags. It was a very efficient way to travel, IMO.
Here are some pros:
I admit that there are some cons involved with this kind of packing. While I can pack a mean bag, it doesn’t exclude the fact that the weight gets to you…no matter how light. If you’ve ever landed at an airport and took public transit into a city, the transfers mean a lot of walking between terminals and stations. The weight of the bag can cause a lot of stress on your neck and shoulders. Even this year, I packed a bag that weighed about 8 lbs total and after a while, say 20 minutes of walking, it can really push down on you. I should mention that my bag isn’t meant for hiking or true backpacking and therefore isn’t super ergonomic. I’m sure if I had chosen a small hiking backpack, my experience would be different. The bag that I took is just an everyday backpack for commuting which is why long walks with a lot of weight can easily become a small burden.
Backpacking can also force you to make some crucial decisions as to what you pack. One small error (should I bring a bathing suit?) and you’ll be forced to carry that item throughout the entire trip with much resentment. The last time we were in Europe, it rained for most of the trip. Thom brought an umbrella this year. He never needed it! 😂 🙃 Lessons learned.
A few surprising things that we did bring this year are:
I’ve only really traveled internationally in the summer months so packing has always been dictated by the warmer weather. I took mainly dresses with a single pair of jeans and shorts. A few shirts to mix it up and a hoodie with a jean jacket for cooler evenings/days. I took a pair of black flats since they’re so versatile and my Keds for comfort as I walked/biked everywhere. I kept toiletries to small sizes and bought anything else that might have run out.
Thom and I failed to exchange any currency prior to the trip. But I would recommend making that order with your bank if possible since ATMs abroad will charge you a fee for any withdrawals. Also, make the obligatory call to your bank letting them know that you are traveling abroad so that they don’t lock your card and account.
A kind co-worker provided us an extra SIM card and we had another already from past trips, so this year we both had data/service for our phones. Thankfully our SIM cards were both purchased in the Netherlands with Vodaphone. These cards worked in all the other countries we visited and we didn’t need to purchase new cards along the way.
Finally, I’ll add that we obtained Global Entry prior to the trip. It made entering the US very easy and fast when going through customs. If you are a frequent international flyer, consider getting Global Entry. Global Entry includes TSA PreCheck. So if you fly around the country frequently (which I do), it’s very convenient and handy for jumping those long security lines.
This post is a part of a series based on my recent two-week trip to Europe.

The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics — and even quantum mechanics generally — has been both loosely and strongly associated with the philosophical position of idealism (see here).
Of course, there are almost as many varieties of idealism (from subjective idealism to absolute idealism to pluralist idealism) as there are idealists. So this isn’t the place to run through all of them. In any case, the kind of idealism I have in mind will become clear in this essay itself.
So take as an example the following passage (written in 2005) from Harry Nielsen:
“ Almost unbelievably perhaps, [the academics who developed quantum mechanics] chose to interpret the strangeness of quantum behaviour by denying the existence of physical reality. And as a standard textbook interpretation of quantum mechanics, physicists have been taught for the last 80 years that physical reality therefore only exists as a result of the act of observation. This is the ‘Copenhagen interpretation’ of quantum mechanics, developed in the late 1920’s by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. To quote Heisenberg: ‘I believe that the existence of the classical ‘path’ can be pregnantly formulated as follows: The ‘path’ comes into existence only when we observe it’.”
The passage above doesn’t actually mention “idealism” — yet the general gist seems to be that the Copenhagen interpretation is idealist (or at least subjectivist). And it isn’t at all odd that this writer thought this way about this interpretation of quantum mechanics.
So it’s important to stress that the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics is not idealist. Or at least the Copenhagen interpretation itself can be interpreted as not being idealist. That said, it is difficult to explain why that’s so. Indeed not many physicists — or even philosophers — have fully clarified why that is so.
Finally, there are stronger arguments which assert that quantum mechanics — if not the Copenhagen interpretation itself — is entirely subjectivist in nature. Yet there are clear differences between subjectivism and idealism. Indeed, Harry Nielsen’s words above can be interpreted as only claiming that the Copenhagen interpretation is subjectivist, not idealist.
Various philosophers (such as Karl Popper) have also argued against those who claim that quantum mechanics is subjectivist , let alone idealist (see Popper here).
It is therefore convenient that there’s a short and simple passage (as quoted in Karl Popper’s The Logic of Scientific Discovery) from the Austrian physicist Arthur March (1891–1957) which perfectly clarifies this issue.
Firstly, Arthur March makes an explicit anti-idealist statement. (It’s not clear if that was his main intention — indeed, it probably wasn’t.) He wrote:
“Naturally nobody is so mad as to assert that a body ceases to exist the moment we turn our backs to it [].”
[March was referring to quantum bodies such as particles; not cups, trees or human beings.]
An idealist, on the other hand, would argue that
a body ceases to exist the moment we turn our backs to it.
And that’s because, to an idealist, “a body” — and everything else — only exists in the individual mind or in some kind of collective mind. Thus, it does indeed cease to exist when “we turn our backs to it”. (Unless, that is, it still exists in the mind of God — as with Bishop Berkeley immaterialism, in some other being’s mind or in a collective mind.)
Arthur March, on the other had, stated that it is “mad [] to assert” that idealist position. Yet March did preface that phrase with the following words:
“One may say perhaps without fear of being misunderstood [] that for the physicist a body has reality only in the instant in which he observes it.”
It’s worth noting the phrase “for the physicist”.
This isn’t an expression of a philosophical view or even of a layperson’s position. As a physicist, March was speaking entirely as a physicist.
So even though it may be problematic to stress observation alone, this is still the stress of a physicist qua physicist. And, almost by definition, a physicist is only concerned with the observations of — and experiments on — a (in March’s word) body.
Thus March, qua physicist, stated that the
“[body] does cease, in the moment, to be an object of inquiry for the physicist”.
Why is that?
It’s
“because there exists no possibility of saying anything about it which is based on experiment”.
March’s statement above is true by definition. That is, what comes before the experiment can’t actually be part of the experiment. Or if someone does “say[] anything about it”, then what he says can’t be based on the experiment, and is therefore not itself physics. Indeed, even the mathematical formalism and/or the wave function required for the experiment has nothing to “say” about any bodies before the experiment.
The wave function has just been mentioned.
Thus, the standard interpretation of the wave function is that — in itself — it has no physical interpretation. It is purely a mathematical function. A tool. Something physicists use to do things with. Of course, it can then be given a physical interpretation.
Take the Schrödinger equation.
This doesn’t tell us what the wave function is — other than in purely mathematical terms. The physical meaning of the equation — i.e., what entities, etc. are posited — is a product of the interpretation of quantum mechanics the physicist adopts.
And even when physicists do “guess” at the (as it were) before-observation, that too is only a use of the wave function; which, again, is a large abstract mathematical object made of smaller mathematical objects.
So, basically, Arthur March, qua physicist, wasn’t interested in what might have been the case before the experiment. And, presumably, he wasn’t that interested in what was the case — i.e., in the experimental area — after he took off his white coat and packed up his bags to go home. Alternatively, if he was interested in both the before and after of the experiment, then it was as a philosopher or a layperson, not as a physicist.
As hinted at in the introduction, it’s at least partly understandable that some people see the Copenhagen interpretation as being philosophically idealist in nature. In the passage in the introduction, for example, Harry Nielsen quoted Werner Heisenberg.
So I’ll help Nielson’s cause along by also quoting Heisenberg stating the following:
“[A]n ‘objective’ physics in this sense, i.e. a sharp division of the world into object and subject has indeed ceased to be possible.”
Such passages from Heisenberg and others have provided grist to the mill for various idealists, mystics, New Agers and whatnot. Yet even here (on my reading of idealism at least) an idealist simply can’t make any distinction at all between “object and subject”. (Of course, it’s possible that the word “object” can be defined in such as way that it squares with idealism.) That’s because (to an idealist) literally everything is in the individual’s (or experimenter’s) mind. (Either that, or everything is in a collective mind or in the mind of God.) In other words, there is simply no object in idealism — we only have a subject or subjects.

Here is my usual guide to Copenhagen for tourists who enjoy the culinary side of life and want to visit Copenhagen for the first time.
In general I tell Taxi to use taxa.dk +45 35353535 or use Donkey bikes with app or use the electric scooters.
Packing: Copenhagen is rainy and windy and chilly. Check weather forecast. Plenty swimming opportunities, so bring a towel and swimwear if you want to swim.
Inner city: This is the old town of Copenhagen. Think small streets, alleyways, and historic squares. The main (shopping) streets are Strøget and Købmagergade. Sights to see: Parliament (Christiansborg) and the Round Tower (Rundetårn). You will find two good wine bards here: Ved Stranden 10 and Den Vandrette as well as restaurant Musling.
Christianshavn: An old residential neighborhood full of canals and colorful houses. Sights to see: Cathedral of Copenhagen (Von Frue Kirke) and the Freetown Christiania. Try Rufino’s delicious pasta if you’re in the area or grab a beer at Barr in the evening sun. Restaurant 108 is also located here.
Vesterbro: The area is full of hip cafés, bars, galleries, music venues, and restaurants. The main streets are Istedgade and Sønder Boulevard. Sights to see: the meatpacking district (Kødbyen), where you can pick up Rosio Sanchez’s delicious food (ex-Noma) at Hija de Sanchez, enjoy coffee at Prolog or dine at Fiskebaren. Also, check out Rosio’s new opened place Sanchez on Istedgade.
Nørrebro: This area is often described as the most diverse part of Copenhagen. You’ll find vintage clothing stores, antique shops, café’s, and authentic Danish bodegas (bars). The most interesting streets are Jægersborggade, Stefansgade, Griffenfeldsgade, Guldbergsgade, Nørrebrogade, Ravnsborggade, and Blågårdsgade. Swing by Bæst for pizza if you’re near Guldbergsgade.
Østerbro: in an old bourgeois, residential neighborhood. Among other things, you’ll find Copenhagen’s largest park, Fælledparken, here; interesting streets: Østerbrogade, the stretch closest to The Lakes (Søerne) and Nordre Frihavnsgade. Sights to see: Kastellet (an old family fortress), Svanmøllen beach, and Juno Bakery.
Amager: Copenhagen airport is situated here. You can reach the inner city by metro in 17 minutes. Islands Brygge is worth a visit — and a swim! Sights to see: The wild landscape of Amager Fælled, Amager Strandpark (the beach), and Helgoland (a traditional sea bathhouse from 1913, that is open for everyone during the summer months).
Refshaleøen: This is the area of Copenhagen where a lot of top restaurants are based. Recently, the peninsula has been in constant development. Check out restaurant Amass, LA Banchina, and Lille bakery.

When people hear ‘Danish,’ they typically think of Danish pastry, a multilayered sweet pastry with various fillings like cheese or a berry sauce. Or they think of Danish cheese.
From the moment I landed in Copenhagen, locals and people from my program told me to try the numerous famous bakeries in the city. Of course, as a foodie, I couldn’t say no.
But what I didn’t realize was how central of a gathering place bakeries are for Copenhageners (is that what they call them?). Their fast-paced life accompanies grabbing a pastry and cappuccino on their way to the office, or as a casual meet-up spot for friends as they get off work around 3 or 4 pm.
When I look back via camera roll at the delicious, warm, and fluffy pastries I tried, it evokes more than longing to have the level of freshness and quality these pastries have at an affordable price. It sucks me right back into highs and lows during my study abroad, new friendships blossoming, and lessons learned.
Here are five moments (and pastries) I am happy to share from my study abroad experience in Copenhagen:
A week into my stay, I found myself wandering through the streets near Kongens Nytorv, the city center filled with people, shops, and the famous Nyhavn canal. I was walking home after a class excursion feeling hungry and exhausted.
I was still figuring out public transportation (bus or train?) and I had unsuccessfully made any plans with new friends.
The homesickness and loneliness were starting to sink in.
I stumbled upon the nearest coffee shop, Farumhus, which translates to “farmhouse.” I walked in and ordered the Kanelstang, a cinnamon Danish pastry but elegantly twisted in various ways, depending on the bakery.
The place was about to close, so the lady ringing me up offered me an extra pastry for free. her kindness was a small act but stirred a few tears for me, sprouting a tiny sense of belonging in this new country.
Biting into the Kanelstang felt like a warm hug as well, with the generous layers of cinnamon and the intricate swirls, perfect for ripping pieces as I sat on a bench and people-watched for the evening.
I’ve been to this bakery twice during my stay and both times were with new friends I had made. My Food and Identity professor recommended this bakery, located in the Meatpacking District, to our class after a field study in the area.
My friends and I sat outside the bakery in Enghave Plads: this utopian park area where families, friends, and children gathered to chat, play, and spend time together. How I long for areas like these in the US. It was a great area to break the ice over delicious treats and get to know each other more.
As an Indian, trying a cardamom bun was absolutely out of my comfort zone. But strangely it’s a popular pastry option in Copenhagen. But the lemon tart was gorgeous. A light and fluffy meringue, with the tart lemon flavor, dare I say — it’s almost better than a key lime pie (shocker! as a Floridian.)
I was well into my study abroad and just completed my second session. Life was good, I was finally getting used to navigating the area, and made some good friends and memories. But I was longing for one of my favorite moments of my stay: my partner visiting me.
I purposely avoided a few attractions and restaurants to try when he got here, which included Skt. Peders Bageri, which translates to St. Peter’s bakery. A cozy bakery that hails as one of the oldest in Copenhagen, they’re known for their Wednesday snails (cinnamon rolls) that I regretfully did not try. I know nothing about authentic Danish food, but this certainly felt what ‘authentic’ would be.
I tried their plain croissant which was indubitably the BEST croissant I’ve had in my life (I think about it often..) and had to snag a blueberry pastry (pictured) as I saw a worker carry it out fresh from the oven.
Even trying my partner’s picks of pastries, every single item here was divine, fresh, heartwarming, perfectly sweet, with golden flaky crusts. This certainly ranks as the best bakery I tried on this list.
When I was down to a week left in Copenhagen, my friend and I scrambled to try the missing bakeries like Juno (pictured left), famous for its cardamom bun. This was the only bakery I waited an hour in line for. Would I say it was worth it? Maybe, if they had more options available.
But Juno sticks to what they do best and people line up for it, fostering this humming excitement waiting in line as people socialize — standing, sitting at tables, across the street if there’s no room — it feels like a hidden pocket of hygge [hue-gah], the epitome of Danish comfort and coziness.
I really was on my croissant high, trying one in both places, searching for a crust so flaky a knife would scrap across beautifully, a hint of sweetness and saltiness, and the soft multitude of layers inside.
After a long day of souvenir shopping my friend and I sat at Original Coffee, located in the heart of the Strøget shopping district. It’s located on the top floor of Illum, a department store, and serves as an excellent place to look at the city and reflect on the city.
We thought back on everything we got to experience and do, what we learned, whether would we even come back to Copenhagen, and when? What about a different place to study abroad? It certainly was a wistful atmosphere as we enjoyed our last few days being abroad.
My last ‘Danish’ meal before I headed to the airport to fly home, Joe and the Juice is the only place on this list that has a location back in the US. Their pricey smoothies and juices, along with the default Danish pastries, are available on every other corner of Copenhagen. They’re delicious and healthy. It’s no surprise that they’re one of the top food chains in Denmark.
Yet, it had me feeling nostalgic. Before coming to Copenhagen, I had heard and seen this chain but passed it off as a pricey, overly healthy spot that wasn’t worth going to.
However, coming to Copenhagen shook up my perspective on things, and now I was willing to try the very same spot in its original country. Studying abroad pushed me to try foods, and seek out places I would never go to back home. In Orlando, I’m so used to going to the same few spots, complaining about nothing new to do, and sending myself in the loop of my weekly routines.
But when I was in this brand new city, I was wide-eyed, ready to explore, and curious about each corner, hidden gem shawarma spot, an interesting castle, or nature an hour’s ride away.
I just hope to carry this newfound excitement in exploration as I explore my city and reminisce about my summer studying abroad in Copenhagen.

The unique mix of one-man play and opera was in town. The always charismatic John Malkovich came with disturbing confessions, the sopranos Chen Reiss and Susanne Langbein sang beautiful opera arias, and the Vienna Philharmonic played Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Vivaldi to make sure to deliver an unforgettable experience.
The Story
The story is about Jack Unterweger, the serial killer, the writer; the unloved child.
He murdered prostitutes and was sentenced to life in prison. In prison, he started to write poems, plays, and short stories and eventually earned literary respect. Two Nobel laureates in literature (Günter Grass and Elfriede Jelinek) were campaigning for Unterweger’s release because they believed that he was the proof that even the most repulsive people can be converted through art. His biography called Purgatory became a bestseller. Convinced that he was a changed man, he got released on parole. While he was invited to talk shows and other events, he still strangled and murdered prostitutes in Vienna, Graz, Prague, and Los Angeles. The FBI caught him after two years, and after being sentenced again he killed himself in his cell.
This play is meant to be his second biography.

(a to-do list at the bottom)
A city that mostly moves to the rhythm of cycles. With 350km of bicycle tracks, it’s a city where legs and bicycles are synonymous. Silences and blank expressions can be easily mistaken for snobbery, while in fact being softness, simplicity, and kindness of the locals. The cinnamon swirls are sweet and the coffee is strong, old guys play chess in Wednesday evening clubs and old ladies bike by faster than both of us.
I was educated on what makes a city truly ‘emotionally intelligent’ by the architects of a smart city, and something they said that has become my rule to observe was that — a city is not defined by the buildings it has or makes, its energy is defined by the spaces “between” those buildings. Copenhagen is a city where urban development has been based on and around its nature and green cover- that’s really the true beauty of this place. They make it easy to carry luggage without using cars, to walk, bike to work or run back home through lakes and gardens without worrying about traffic or breaking rules. It is truly a sustainably intelligent city.
Areas in Copenhagen are spread out wide, and very self-sustained in terms of food, coffee, parks and culture. Someone living in Frederiksberg doesn’t need to come into Indre-by and someone in Christiania has no actual need to go into Vesterbro. While I loved the neighborhood local vibe of Norrebero and Frederiksberg, I did feel like my eventual place of stay around HC Andersons Boulevard. From airbnbs to eco-hotels, the average rate in Copenhagen doesn’t vary too much if you’re a last-minute nomad like me but I highly recommend at least 2 days in the hotel I stayed in (details at the bottom)
Eat & Drink- only my 2023 favorites, in no way exhaustive :)
Stay- my personal favorite is the Manon Les Suites Hotel — an eco hotel with the best of comfort meets conscious in a central location. If you prefer an Airbnb, check the ones around Norrebro and make sure you check step free access.
Getting Around- Rent an e-bike but not from a hotel.
Yoga - I’ll always check out yoga studios in every city as a personal rule and my favorite one here was ‘Rive Gauche’. The weekly pass makes it easier on the pocket than a one time pay.
Places to Run/Walk- The Lakes, Rosenborg Gardens, Frederiksberg Garden

Grundtvigs Church was erected in commemoration of the great Danish priest, poet, and reformer N.F.S. Grundtvig (1783–1882). This monumental church is referred to in modern terms as a gothic cathedral. Master builder and architect Peder Vilhelm Jensen Klint (1853–1930) died before the church was finished. The task was entrusted to his son architect and designer Kaare Klint (1888–1954), who completed the building of the church in 1940. Kaare Klint has also designed the chairs for the Grundtvigs Church — a chair made of beech wood with wickerwork seat — a Danish furniture design classic. Despite its massive size, the church seems to exude an atmosphere of calm contentment. Perhaps it is the appeal of the regular yellow brickwork forming the sole decoration of the church.

Conceived as an iconic building, which create awareness of cancer without stigmatizing the patients. Designed as a number of small houses combined into one, the center provides the space needed for a modern health facility, without losing the comforting scale of the individual. The houses are connected by raised roof shaped like a Japanese paper art origami, which gives the building a characteristic signature.

The close coexistence between private and communal spaces, often separated only by a thin door, makes this hall of residence quite unique. In fact, the dialogue between individuality and communality forms the very basis for the architecture and layout of Tietgenkollegiet.
Tietgenkollegiet was the result of an architecture competition organised by the Nordea Denmark Foundation with the intention of building a visionary version of the hall of residence of tomorrow. Lundgaard and Tranberg’s round building won the competition. On both the architectural and metaphorical fronts, it is all about inclusion, community and equality.
Rued Langgaards Vej 10–18, Ørestad North
Built for The Medical Association housing scheme and initially were known as Lægeforeningens Boliger. These well-built but relatively inexpensive houses for poor families were some of the first social housing in Copenhagen and were built on the initiative of doctor Emil Hornemann as an immediate and practical response to a cholera epidemic in Copenhagen in 1853.

Cirkelbroen
Cirkelbroen celebrates pedestrians. It reflects the daily life and intimacy that you find around the canal in the Christianshavn neighbourhood, its houseboats and sailing boats, the unique life on the ramparts. Copenhagen’s harbour was once a centre of maritime activity, and Cirkelbroen is a testimony to that history. While working on the bridge, I remembered the fishing boats I saw as a child in Iceland. In the harbour, the boats were often moored right next to each other, and it sometimes seemed that you could even cross the harbour just by walking from boat to boat.
Christianshavns Kanal, København K
The Kalvebod Waves
When addressing this infamously gloomy and desolated side of the harbor, the architects put their focus on two major design aspects: to create urban continuity and to locate the new structure on the sunny spots in the water.
Facing Southeast, the quay has fantastic sun conditions until the early afternoon, but to attract the public after working hours the architects needed to study the course of the shadows casted by the huge buildings along the promenade. The two new main piers are located in the shadow-free zones and programmed as active islands on the water. The project then re-connects those islands to the urban network and to makes them blend naturally into the city’s infrastructure. Two bridges link the tip of the main piers back to the old quay, creating two inner water-basins for watersport activities.
Superkilen
Superkilen is a park that supports diversity. It is a world exhibition of furniture and everyday objects from all over the world, including benches, lampposts, trash cans and plants — requisites that every contemporary park should include and that the future visitors of the park have helped to select. Superkilen reattributes motifs from garden history. In the garden, the translocation of an ideal, the reproduction of another place, such as a far off landscape, is a common theme through time. As the Chinese reference the mountain ranges with the miniature rocks, the Japanese the ocean with their rippled gravel, or how the Greek ruins are showcased as replicas in the English gardens. Superkilen is a contemporary, urban version of a universal garden.
Radio House
Politikens Boghal
With two floors filled with books written in Danish and English, Politikens Boghal is fairly-often considered one of the top choices for book lovers in Copenhagen. The warm bookstore associated with Politiken, one of the largest newspapers in the country, has been welcoming locals and foreigners since 1915. On its selves, visitors can find old and new releases of everything from fiction and poetry to nature and hobby books. Moreover, special events such as concerts, speeches, and presentations take place regularly throughout the year attracting the city’s intellectual crowd.

Cinnober Bookstore
Cinnober has been standing in the heart of the city center for approximately 10 years. Its founders, Ulla Welinder and Morten Voigt, have a great passion for graphic design and illustration. Therefore, a big part of their book selection consists of magazines and books that showcase the best of design, architecture, and art. Make sure to stop by while exploring the area around the Round Tower and rummage through the bookstore’s collection of local artists’ prints and paper products. Visitors might even find a special souvenir to take back home.

My brother, who’s a volunteer, greeted me in pink sunglasses, with a big smile, and an “I haven’t slept yet”. It’s Saturday, 9.30 at Ungdomsøen. In the short distance, I heard an intense bass blasting into the greyscale sky.
We dropped my bag at the camping area. Spending time at major festivals throughout the summer made me notice how clean it was. Despite me arriving four days into the festival, no trash was lingering around, no broken pavilions, no lonely crying.
As I got a tour around the island, I started to understand why there seemed to be an invisible cloud of respect and love. No brands were screaming their logos into my face, no careless investors were occupied with my amount of money. When you build with a pure heart, you attract pure hearts and pure behaviour.
It’s 11 in the morning. At Astral we sat down for a moment. Platforms vibrating with the music were occupied by sleeping cuddles, stretching bodies and tired dancers. The ambience sound playing was in my head the sound of the universe. The projections on the walls allowed my imagination to be imagination, as I closed my eyes and landed on planet Kune.
Close to noon, I understood that time is irrelevant. 15 people were dancing to an after-hour groove at Space. The atmosphere was uplifted, yet exhausted. A magical mix. At Vessel, the sound was fast, edged and deep. Several people came to say hi, saying that they haven’t seen me all week. As I explained that I just arrived, I was greeted with hugs, smiles and “please enjoy”.
I sent my brother to sleep, agreeing to meet again at night. At the harbour, I asked about the food, as I started to feel hungry for lunch. There’s no third-party involved, all food was thought and created at and by the festival.
People arrived at the same destination for a bite. Some before finally going to bed, some for a wake-up meal. They all smiled at me.
I spent the daytime napping, walking around, talking to people. In Copenhagen, I am so used to introducing myself with my job, my place of living. My commercialised existence. Here, no one cared about my fancy title, yearly income or place of birth. I met Daniel from Romania, Ash from Australia, Olivia and Lukas from Denmark, Toni from Hungary, Anne from France. English was default, as the world united on a small island in the middle of Øresund.
As the night sat, a few hours of sleep had done wonders to the face of my dear brother. He and his girlfriend gave me a tour around the many tunnels before we grabbed dinner in the kitchen. Tomato soup and a Moroccan stew warmed me up as my body was thankful for a fresh and homemade meal made with love and appreciation for its ingredients.
A beer and a drink later, I found myself in front of the speakers at Space. The darker it got, the more magical it all seemed. The stage was sculptured in wood as visuals reflected, played and enhanced the artwork. I couldn’t stop looking, moving, smiling.
I have spent many years feeling awkward, feeling wrong, feeling like the one on the outside. As if I was born on the wrong side of the glass, peeking in on the many people moving their hips, choking alcohol and aggressive consumption culture. I spent the summer missing Copenhagen 10 years ago. Back when Saxons, KB18, Christiania, Ungdomshuset and pirate parties were dominating the underground with heavy drum N bass, dubstep, techno, jungle and everything between and outside. But there, in front of the Space speakers, I finally felt like I did 10 years ago, I felt like I was on the right side of the glass.
At Vessel, I arrived at a deep and evil sound. The screens reflected my inner stage, as I let go. Of whatever was on the mainland, whatever was in the world, whatever was on my worried mind. I no longer cared for time, schedules, work or hate. All I cared about was dancing with people who like me, gave up modern slavery for a moment, only to be slaves of the bass. And damn, that bass deserved my soul.
The night was a pendulum between Space, Vessel, Amphi, Astral and water views. I got lost several times, but it didn’t feel like getting lost. I noticed how the clean behaviour continued into the dark. Trash was being sorted, pocket ashtrays used, water drank. Once in a while, someone in a red Kune-shirt asked me if I was feeling all right, they were the safer space guards. The funny thing is, that a small island with young people and 24 hours music sounds like a recipe for chaos and uncontrolled madness — but never have I visited a festival where I felt safer. People knew what they were doing, and did it with respect. For each other, for Kune and for themselves.
As the sun peaked above the horizon, I started to feel my sore feet at Vessel. We sat down, a random group of people. We shared a moment. Thoughts and ideas were aired, and I understood, that this is the place where the ‘angry young people’ smile. Not because they party, but because they feel free to let dreams touch reality. I came down, feeling like I landed on a soft pillow of utopian hope.
Thank you, Kune. Your revolution is heartfelt, honest and kind. I’ll carry it with me until I’ll see you again next year.

By Kai Chen
I studied abroad in Copenhagen last semester through DIS Copenhagen. Copenhagen is gorgeous! The colorful buildings, the cozy cafes, and the endless green spaces all make for the perfect European vibe. As soon as I got off the plane, I knew I was in for an incredible adventure.
As someone who is passionate about foreign languages, I was stoked to dive headfirst into Danish culture and start learning the language. The Danes are all about hygge (coziness), and the language has fun words and phrases you won’t find anywhere else. Plus, the locals were super patient with my attempts to speak Danish and were always down to teach me new words, as is the case with pretty much everywhere else I’ve been to in Europe.
Taking economics classes in Copenhagen has been a unique and enriching experience. One key difference between these courses and those at Duke University is the practical approach to learning in Danish economics classes. Through field trips to France and Belgium, I saw firsthand how economic principles are applied in real-world contexts. Traveling to those countries as part of one of my economics classes gave me invaluable insights into different economic systems and policies and how they impact societies. This hands-on approach to learning economics allowed me to directly apply the knowledge I gained in class and see its real-world implications, a departure from my classes at Duke that did not typically involve field trips. Another notable distinction was the informal relationship with professors in Denmark, as I could address them by their first names, creating a more relaxed and approachable learning environment. This unique blend of practicality and informality in my economics class in Copenhagen has broadened my perspective on the subject and enriched my overall learning experience.
But the best part? Getting to travel all over Europe! Copenhagen is such a perfect home base for exploring other countries. I hopped on trains and planes to visit cities like Hamburg, Amsterdam, and Paris. It was amazing to see each culture’s differences through their architectures, and I love to explore those cultures through their nature, and oftentimes, museums as well.
Back in Denmark, I loved exploring all the cool neighborhoods of Copenhagen. From the hipster vibes of Nørrebro to the quaint streets of Christianshavn, there was always something new to see. And the food? Don’t even get me started. Danish pastries, smørrebrød, and hot dogs (yes, hot dogs) were some of my favorites.
And let’s not forget about the people! I made some of the coolest friends during my study abroad program from all over the world. We bonded over our love of travel, languages, and hygge, and we still keep in touch today.
Overall, my study abroad experience in Copenhagen was one for the books. I got to immerse myself in a new language and culture, travel Europe, and make lifelong friends. If you’re into languages and travel like me, I can’t recommend studying abroad enough!

In the beginning of March 2023 we met in Copenhagen for a 3-day WP4 workshop focused on the ongoing development of our PwY decision support tool (DST) that is a deliverable of the Working Package 4. During these days, members of the Swedish team from Södertörn University met with colleagues from Copenhagen University for hands-on activities meant to advance our project on selected aspects of the decision support tool.
Image: collective activity for identifying relevant stakeholder and methods.
During these three days, we revised findings from WP2 and WP3. Work package 2 focuses on the study of current challenges and opportunities planners and other professional face in Sweden, Netherlands and Denmark in relation to the involvement of youth in spatial planning. Work package 3 focuses on testing, exploring and piloting with different participatory methods and it seeks to understand if and how these allow youth to participate in meaningful ways. In this sense, WP4 and its deliverable, the decision support tool, brings all that research insight together in an integrated way.
Image: Sofia Lundmark facilitating an activity for the workshop.
The workshop was facilitated by our team collaborator Sofia Lundmark, Senior Lecturer at Media Technology Department at Södertörn University. Sofia use methods from design studies to facilitate the sessions and led us over key questions.
Our project team is a combination of collaborators with different scientific backgrounds and experiences who are connected by an interest in interdisciplinary approaches to sustainability and urban planning. This diversity allows us to borrow tools and perspectives from each other’s discipline, stay fresh and be creative. This is particularly important when developing and designing a tool meant for use in different national contexts and by different stakeholders.
But what is the Planning with Youth decision support tool and whom is it meant to support?
Decision support tools are a compilation of information and data organized in a systemic way meant to assist professionals with their day-to-day work. A DST does not give a final answer as such but gives access to needed information and data for the professional to consider and use in decision-making processes on a given matter.
Planning and urban governance is a field with many decisions support tools and systems. But very few are developed in the context of youth and children participatory processes. Our objective is to contribute with a new tool for planners and practitioners to use when needing to prepare and delivery participatory processes that are meaningful for children and young people.
The DST will provide planners and practitioners with key information about methods for involving children and young people in participatory planning. We envision for the PwY tool to become a useful instrument. For the Swedish context, this is particularly relevant considering that from 2021 and following the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child, planners are obliged by law to include children and youth in participatory spatial planning processes. You can read more about the Swedish context and its challenges in this article produced by members of our team.
Furthermore, even in countries that have not enforced the inclusion of youth in urban planning, this remains an ongoing and necessary challenge that aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Ultimately, we hope that by using the DST urban planners will get the support they need to create (with youth) cities that are more democratic, sustainable and accessible and reflect the needs and uses of the entire population.

Stay tuned for more on our upcoming decision support tool!

Copenhagen inspiration from one friend of a friend to another
I recently booked a weekend in Stockholm to visit some friends who’d moved there. To make the most of being in the area, I added a few days somewhere I heard people consistently rave about: Copenhagen.
▶️ Instagram Highlights️️▶ Copenhagen Google Map▶ Visit Copenhagen Official Website
I put up a call for tips on my Instagram right before going and received so many wonderful tips that I felt I should make a guide linking it all together. The result is a combination of the top things recommended, with a bit of Stubborn Travel curation and personal favourites. I hope it can help as a quick planning aid to this delightful city, home to the happiest people on Earth.
A huge thank you to the awesome travellers and locals who contributed, especially Amalie, Courtenay, James, Nina and Caitlin.

Welcome to the United Nations Career Journey Podcast, where we interview colleagues working for the United Nations all around the world. Our conversations explore their fascinating career paths, what career satisfaction means to them, and how they keep learning and developing on the job. My name is Petra, and today, our conversation is with Iina Paarma who works as a Chief of the Talent Development Unit at the UNDP’s Office of Human Resources based in Copenhagen, Denmark. Welcome to the Career Journey Podcast Iina, it’s good to see you. And thank you very much for joining us. It’s a pleasure to have you as our guest speaker on the podcast.
Hi, Petra. Thank you. It’s my pleasure to be here with you today.
Thank you again. And could you introduce yourself to our listeners?
Absolutely. So, my name is Iina Paarma. And as Petra said, I’m the Chief of the Talent Development Unit at UNDP. I’m also a proud mother of two children. And I grew up in Finland and sometime in my early teenage years, I started dreaming of an international career in international development.
Lovely, thank you very much. My first question that I want to ask about your career is how did you begin your career? It can be internships, or maybe first job, so what was the start of your career?
Well, during my studies, I did have a chance to do an internship in my home country’s representation office in Vienna, in Austria. And I also studied one term in Geneva, as an exchange student during my master’s studies. And another one actually in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. But after completing my master’s degrees, I actually landed a job in the private sector, and then actually another job in the private sector. But somewhere during those years, I did realize that the sort of the dream to be part of the UN, or the international community, had actually never really disappeared. And so, I started applying for jobs in different international organizations. This was already around the time when I was approaching 30. It took it took almost three years, but then late 2012, I got my first assignment with UNOPS, actually here in Copenhagen, and I spent a number of years in that agency. And then, in 2017, I joined UNDP, in New York City after having applied for a position that I found on UNDP Jobs site.
Thank you for this introduction, Iina. And how was the transition into getting into UNDP, after spending time in the private sector and also in another UN organization? And also, which specific tools have been useful for you for this transition, and during this transition?
Yeah, I mean, when I joined the UN, then in 2012, early 2013, that’s when I was coming from the private sector, and I joined UNOPS in Copenhagen. So that transition wasn’t actually that, you know, that big one. It was really a dream to come true. But in terms of specific tools that have been useful, I think, first of all, I’ve tried to do my job as well as I only can. And secondly, you know, I have hopped on every opportunity that was given to me. And early on in the UN, in UNOPS, I also had fantastic bosses who believed in me and took me to meetings, and, you know, let me job shadow them. And that has been incredibly powerful, and I am really, forever grateful for this. And it was a pivotal steppingstone for me to be able to be sort of, on-the-job mentored by my people manager early on in my UN days. Then in terms of tools in general, I mean, I learned incredibly much from interactions with others. So, in that sense, the transition to the UN wasn’t a difficult one, it was a fascinating one.
That’s very good to hear. And I think these points are can be very useful for someone who is trying to look for maybe inspiration or ways to do that step to get into the UN system, but also just career tips in general. So, thank you so much for, for sharing those. So, your role as the Chief of the Talent Development Unit, could you explain a little bit to our listeners what is it about, what are some of the tasks that are a part of your daily job?
Yeah. So, you know, UNDP, we’re a big organization, we are close to 20,000 people in 170 countries. So, this role is really to lead the Talent Development Unit that focuses on leadership development, people manager development, career experiences, capability development. So, we have the three sort of main components in the unit. And overall, we are catering for the talent needs of the whole organization. We are really looking at talent development and learning as something that happens in the flow of work. It’s, it’s not a one-off sort of exercise, it’s sort of part of our DNA as an organization. We believe that creating a learning organization is something that is embedded in every aspect of the organization. And UNDP puts a lot of effort in talent development, we see that as a catalyst for organizational performance, for sure. But also, people’s careers, their career development, and their professional development.
This is great, and working with learning and talents, that must be something very rewarding for you as well, to help the people to develop themselves. But I would like to ask you my next question, and that is, what do you like the most about your role? What aspects of your job of your current job bring you career satisfaction?
I think for me, I am a people person. So definitely teamwork and learning from others. And the fact that I do feel very privileged to have the opportunity to work with people from all over the world, it is extremely rewarding to constantly, you know, develop oneself as one hears about other people’s perspectives based on their backgrounds, you know, be it educational, or cultural, or other backgrounds. The UN is also a big part of my identity. So, so serving this greater purpose of the UN is something that brings me enormous satisfaction. So then when I think about the current role, our team is not in the frontlines of international development. But what brings us satisfaction is the fact that we can develop the ones who are closer to our beneficiaries. And we can see that directly translated into better results on the ground.
That sounds great. And I think this is something that is a big motivating factor for many people working at the UN. And you also mentioned that it was your dream, when you were younger, that, you know, you really wanted to work for the UN. So, it’s actually great that it’s now a part of your daily motivation and career satisfaction. On the other hand, what are some of the more challenging, perhaps, aspects of your job? Or something that you need to continuously work with? Could you just share some of those with our listeners?
Yeah, you know, I think in terms of challenges, this is a global organization that’s present in 170 countries like I mentioned, and this means that someone is always awake, and the work never stops. So, I would say, you know, UN colleagues in general are very committed, you know, hardworking people. So, it’s very easy to sort of get into that sort of ‘someone is always awake’ mode. So, I would say that what I’m trying to learn is to manage myself in such a way that I allow enough time to rest and recharge, so as to be the best version of myself in the workplace.
That’s very good to highlight because I think this topic is very important. And to highlight the need for, you know, strengthening your resilience and well-being is something very important. So, thank you for bringing that to the discussion. And that actually kind of leads to my next question. Sometimes our mental health can be challenged by big changes, challenging moments, and it can take a toll on how we feel about our careers. So my next question is, could you share a time in your career where you had some big changes in responsibilities of your role, and how did you approach it and what did you learn from it?
Yeah, I think, I think maybe the sort of critical juncture for me was when I joined UNDP, in 2017, and moved to New York, the new role was quite different from my previous role and UNDP, as an organization also worked in a very different way than my previous organization. So I think I learned to appreciate that it takes some time to grasp the new context and asking the right questions and understanding that, you know, one should not assume that what worked well in your previous role and organization is, is sort of directly applicable in the in the new content, or in the new context. I think the learnings maybe happened, sort of, in some kind of internal after-action review and reflection, also now in hindsight, realizing that UN, especially when it comes to relocations, those are not only your decisions, if you have family members who are joining you, and so, so certainly reflecting afterwards, the appreciation of the willingness of my family to join me and also looking back at not only those years, but also throughout my career in the UN, as someone who was raising children as well, I am having such gratitude and sort of humility. And understanding that those people around me, you know, grandparents and relatives and their immediate family members have certainly been enablers for me, and for that I am, I am very grateful.
That’s lovely, thank you so much for sharing that. And, yeah, I can totally imagine that these changes of relocating to a different country, different continent, changing your are a big milestone in everyone’s lifetime. And so sharing those learning outcomes might be very useful and good to hear, and I’m sure a lot of our listeners can relate to it as well. Talking about living abroad and having different international experiences, experiences from different career paths and career experiences, what are some of the best tips you have gathered throughout your career so far, when it comes to either creating a career that you like, creating a satisfying career, or just navigating a career in general?
Well, I think it’s important to follow your heart and your passion, when you enjoy what you do, it makes, it makes it all so much easier. And it shows also in the results you deliver, you know, when I grew up, the mentality was a little bit like, you know, job is a job, and then life happens outside of the job, and you should sort of play the same card, you know, study hard and get a job that you can have until you retire. And, you know, we all know, especially the young generations, that those days are over. So, I think maybe, you know, understanding that these type of career moves and career aspirations, they always come with a certain risk. You can’t have it all, you know, you should always in mind, you follow your passion, and understand that that’s not necessarily always the most sort of stable path. But if that’s what you truly want, you should go for it. And then I think in general, I mean, when it comes to sort of career tips, I’m not sure if I’m the best one to share any of those. Once someone much wiser than me told me that, you know, essentially, there are two ways to plan your career, either you go with the flow, or you have clear goals of the type of roles and profiles you’re aspiring for, and then, you know, you make a roadmap and follow that path. Honestly, I have personally been one of the sorts of go with the flow type of profiles. And, you know, that has worked for me. I have jumped on the opportunities that had been in front of me, and sometimes it’s been daunting, but I would say, you know, go for it. All jobs are extremely valuable. You learn things in whatever role you have, for however short time you would have that, you know, it teaches you about the role itself, but it also allows you to meet different people who might have different tips.
These are really great tips and advice and I’m sure the listeners will find it very helpful because I think it’s always good to be reminded of, you know, following the passion and having that as the guiding… guiding light of when you’re trying to navigate through the career so, so thank you very much for that. I’d like to ask you, where would you like to be career-wise in the next coming years? Or do you have any maybe aspirations as well? I know you just shared with us that you prefer to, you know, maybe go with the flow. But is there anything you’d like to achieve in the next coming years in terms of your career?
Oh, thanks for the question. You know, I love my current role. I‘ve been in this role for some 18 months. And I feel that I still have quite a lot to give in this current position. And then future will show what’s the what’s next in in store for me.
Well thank you very much, and I wish you all the best! I really enjoyed our conversation. And I found it very interesting and insightful. And yeah, I hope you had a good time as well.
Absolutely. My pleasure Petra, and keep up with the great job, great work that you’re doing here with the podcast.
Thank you very much! And thank you to all our listeners. We hope you enjoyed this episode and that our conversations will inspire you to keep learning and advancing in your careers. If you liked the episode, please share it with your friends and colleagues, and make sure to tune in for the next one.

Just about a year ago I moved into this incredibly small and beautiful country called Denmark all the way from India to pursue my PhD. I had dreamt about it for a long time and it was so surreal when I actually landed in Copenhagen. Noone back home understood why I chose this strange far away cold land when I could have been applying to top universities in the US; hustling away in pursuit of an empire I had no desire to build in the first place. To me, a safe, happy and a peaceful place would make moving my entire life to another country absolutely worth it. Copenhagen consistently ranked among the top three livable cities in the world while Denmark is popularly known for being one of the happiest countries across the entire world. I knew that as an expat the rules would be different; I wouldn’t share the same benefits that the Danes enjoy and perhaps, my opinions about the happiness index would be different from how the Danes perceive it. That is not say that the index is wrong because it is indeed the opinions of the Danish citizens that actually matter.
My priorities in life were always different. I didn’t care about owning a car and a house to display how successful I was in my social circle. To me, peace of mind, having just enough of what you need and want, and respect were above materialistic desires. That is not to say that money didn’t matter to me. I want to be wealthy in terms of experiences, good health, healthy relationships and money is just a part of wealth. As an overly anxious, introverted and sensitive person, I learnt from a very young age what my triggers were and how to cope with them and so I knew that working in an annoyingly bureaucratic corporate structure and culture was not for me. While I have financially successful friends I really respect and admire, I have no desire to talk the same language as them. I started working young and ensured that I would never have to borrow money from my parents anymore whether it was for my education or materialistic pursuits. If I couldn’t afford it, I wouldn’t buy it. I chose academia simply because at the time it gave me the freedom to think, read, and write the way I wanted and I was given due credit for it. I wanted to move away right after my Masters but my father was clear that unless I had a scholarship, it wouldn’t be worth it. And, that’s when it all began! A six year long journey post my Masters making peanuts but doing what I loved, saving just enough to finally take the leap. I had my eyes on Denmark for many reasons, the most important being safety and gender equality.
One year down and I wouldn’t call it perfect but I know it in my gut that I made the right choice. They ask, what was the biggest culture shock for you when you moved here? I laugh! Because India has given me far more cultural shocks than I expect to experience anywhere else. I have lived in different parts of India and navigated life across language and cultural barriers. We were united by the delicious food and our diversity itself! I am grateful for my journey from a tiny Indian town noone knows of to this beautiful city where I am living the life I always dreamt of. Life in India prepared me for life in a strange country I had absolutely no connection to. The struggles are not unfamiliar— a different language, the lack of a social circle, having to find an affordable living arrangement, getting familiar with the rules and regulations. Things that took me a while getting adjusted to was the right-hand traffic and the fact that there was barely any traffic :D Sure, the weather is rough and the winters are dark and the Danes are reserved (you know the stereotype), but every single day I am in awe of how this tiny little dot on the world map evolved into an architectural beauty, home to some of the largest MNCs and holding an impressive reputation of being politically progressive.
Danmark er virkelig et dejligt land! There was not a single day when a Dane refused to help a “confused” me trying to get used to the city. Often they would greet with a pleasant smile and would appreciate you trying to speak a little bit of broken Danish while making small talk. I deliberately chose to work with a Danish supervisor for two reasons — first I wanted to push myself to work with unfamiliar people (since Indians tend to flock to each other everywhere in the world; I am guilty of this too) and second, I had some serious toxic boss baggage from India that I knew would ease off in the flat heirarchical structure Scandanivian countries are famous for. Wait, I could call my seniors by their first names and they wouldn’t mind? And did you say they don’t call you after work hours (they never call you at all if you are lucky)? Also, you are not obligated to respond to their emails after 5 pm? Wait, did they ask for my opinion? Oh wait, the professors consider their PhD students “colleagues” and not slaves? And…whaaattt!! I am paid a living wage as a PhD student? To me, this was a dream! This is where I felt I could become a well-rounded person whose opinions were equally important and my gender didn’t decide how much I was paid.
I won’t lie I did have my own insecurities (thanks to our colonial past and the ensuing inferiority complex). I was in this land full of white people with beautiful blue/green eyes and blond hair, ones I had only seen on Television up until I moved to Denmark. Soon enough I realised we are bonded by similar desires and experiences that is only natural to the humankind and it is not the color of our skin but our openness to embracing the unknown that really mattered. Sure, I felt unseen many times in a conversation across a table that only white people could connect to (endless discussions over the origins of wine and cheese like we talk about chai and samosas) but this would be followed by a few empathetic people (or those afraid to be perceived as politically incorrect…kidding!) displaying a little bit of curiosity into my culture. I was suddenly representing India in these conversations; not my tiny hometown, not the cities that I lived in but the rich and diverse country that India is. I was educating people who had these preconceived biases against the Indians, some of which were quite ridiculous and rude to be frank (if you don’t eat red meat, you are religious; most of India is polluted, poor and filthy). Some of them had ill-informed opinions about Hinduism and the political situation in the country! On the other hand I was surprised by how India was perceived by Europeans in general. Many considered it to be the land of CEOs, shooting for the galaxies, full of lucrative investment opportunities, ofcourse Bollywood and interestingly home to the good “green stuff” (if you know what I mean ;)). Some applauded me for the bold choice to move to a cold country all the way from India while some struggled to grasp why any South Asian would want to move to this part of the world. I just enjoyed the ride! I am not one to get offended easily. It is only natural to have your prejudices but come to me with an open mind and I will answer all your questions. How you frame your words and the way you speak them tells me a bit about your upbringing and the conscious efforts you put into educating yourself to get rid of your biases often shaped by problematic western constructs. So hey! It has nothing to do with the color of your skin. You can be brown, white, black, straight, gay, queer and whatever you identify as and still be a vile person. In Denmark though, I have mostly met the nicest and most open minded people. They are not intrusive (which unfortunately we Indians could be most of the time), they are polite and respectful of other’s time and space, they call a spade a spade and they really do have a wonderful life outside of work (hygge anyone???). This is the place where I feel my own person, where nobody cares about my age, gender, marital status and whether or not I have kids. I am a far more evolved person than I was when I first moved here and I am doing things I never believed I would be able to do.
So that’s my first Medium post here, a short story of an Indian smalltowner in Denmark. Not sure if I would still call this the happiest place in the world but this sure is the happiest I have ever been :)

I remember well the last days before I left my Vilnius. Days, where I have been walking in the city, going to the places that I have always wanted to, but did not have time for it, spending time with my family and meeting with good old friends. Those days were great. However, the time flies fast. And even though I was quite excited to start a new life in a foreign country, I was also a bit worried. Who will be my new friends? When will Ifind a job? Will I like the studies? How will Copenhagen greet me? After a year of living here, I have found some answers.
Copenhagen greeted me with big white clouds and the hustle in the airport. The hustle of the people greeting their fellow travelers and the hustle of the people running for their planes. An airport is a place where people come and go. And I was one of the many arrived to Copenhagen. I remember that I was not at all impressed by Copenhagen in the first days. So many buildings so similar to each other, so few green spaces compressed between them and cyclists with their angry faces.
It is now, a year after living in Copenhagen, I understand that Copenhagen has so much to offer. Small details matter in this city and it feels like the community is trying to make it with a personal touch. Buildings in different neighborhoods do not look alike and there are very nice green spaces within the city. Only my perception of cyclists did not change.
Nevertheless, I came here to study Organizational Innovations and Entrepreneurship (OIE) — a masters program organized by Copenhagen Business School (CBS). The program offered quite an interesting path of studying, combining theoretical knowledge and practical classes with the most diverse class that I’ve been a part of in my life.
The beginning of the studies was quite interesting. We’ve had an introduction week, organized by previous OIE students, where we had a chance to visit some of the most prominent startup hubs and companies in Copenhagen, mingle together and get to know what awaits us in the future.
And the future was…
Studies at OIE program comprise of two different sets of subjects divided into 4 quarters throughout the first year. One subject will be practical (lectures which are happening in Studio) and the other one — theoretical. On the second year of education students are allowed to choose between exchange, electives, summer university or internship. Or it can be a mix of everything (up to 30 ECTS credits). After that — only master thesis and graduation, where everybody is happy :)
But let’s get back to the first year with compulsory subjects. As it was mentioned before there were 4 quarters with different focuses:
Furthermore, we have also had an elective course — study trip to Silicon Valley, where we have met 28 different companies throughout 2 weeks. You can read more about it in my previous stories on Medium (beginning, part 1, part 2).
As the courses implied, we have been working hard on different business ideas every quarter. I remember it like yesterday:
Q1. Developing an app for finding people/friends with similar interests
Q2. Developing a lip balm for winter sports enthuziasts
Q3. Developing a YouTube channel about local undiscovered places
Q4. Researching the “precariat” & changing spaces (in our case — CPH Village and containers made livable).
Plus we’ve had some of the theoretical classes related to the classical understanding of entrepreneurship, strategic management of innovations, the art of innovation (like design-driven innovation) and some other interesting activities combined together.
Last, but not least, CBS really tries hard to develop in us the entrepreneurial spirit, creating opportunities for the students to go further and make the ideas real. As part of our program, we have been also introduced to Copenhagen School of Entrepreneurship, whereas we, if there is any business idea, could try to get in and use the co-working spaces, advisors and other useful programs for free throughout the different stages of development.
Overall, the OIE program allows to develop the skills and abilities, necessary for becoming an entrepreneur or working with innovations within different fields. Plus, if you have a business idea — you can go for it. Nevertheless, the living costs in Copenhagen are not cheap and a big part of a Danish student life will be described in the next chapter.
Most of the students in Denmark are combining studies with student jobs. That’s a fact. Even though they are generously paid by the government scheme called SU, they are still working as part-time employees in different companies, starting from cafes and bars and ending with study-related jobs.
As my finances did not allow me to live here for two years without having an actual job, I started to look for the new opportunities in Copenhagen. Even though it took me some time (including exams and other activities) to find an actual first job (to be precise — 4 months), I had a great experience learning how the Danish job market operates.
Throughout the 4-month period I had 6 job interviews with different companies, where I had a chance to present myself and also get to know the other side of the table. In the end, I have landed a job at a local food chain, where I have been working as Operations Assistant, learning to deal with numbers, revenues, Excel and developing programs. Nevertheless, during the summer situation has changed and I have to find a new job, which I would like to learn from most, combining my previous experience with my skills and knowledge.
One lesson that I have learned throughout the year — try to be more unique in every aspect that goes throughout the job search adventure. And, the most important, show the companies what you can bring to the advertised position and show that you are a valuable person worth the salary that you will get while working there.
Pro tip: students from EU — if you have a part-time job, working min. 10–12 hours/week — apply for a student scholarship (SU) to be equal with Danish students. More info: www.su.dk
What is a student life without fun? The answer is easy — it is not a student life. People, with whom you are studying, can bring a lot of joy, happiness and adventures throughout the years that you will be studying together and, most probably, they will become the friends for life.
I had the honor to meet with people from different countries and cultures, with whom I had a lot of fun and great things done together. Copenhagen is a great city, where if you want to do something — you will find it. It offers a wide variety of events, places, bars, cafes, parks where you can hang out with your friends, meet even more people and learn about Danish traditions. And, the most important thing, not to be lonely, because sometimes that feeling of being such can come.
Last year I have visited many different places and hometowns of my friends — Bornholm, Aalborg, San Francisco, Asturias. I have also participated in many local traditional events and learned more about Danish culture and who are Danes. Funny enough, but while being in Denmark, I have learned a lot about Mexican culture :) I had a lovely Christmas-New Year’s Eve period, seeing the local traditions and participating in them, seeing how Danes can be welcoming and how cozy are their homes.
Pro tip: check out the Survival Guide in Denmark, it is a great guide to find almost everything you need before your arrival or during your stay.
The first year in Denmark was an amazing experience. The weather was great (4 months of sun in a row), the people are awesome, the studies and the job gave me lots of new skills and knowledge.
I believe that the next year will be even better, with more interesting discoveries, experiences and amazing people. Especially now, when everybody will be back in Copenhagen and will be ready to rock’n’roll.

Copenhagen, Denmark (population of 799,033 as of 2020)
Copenhagen aims to be the world’s first carbon-neutral capital city by 2025 (The CPH 2025 Climate Plan, Copenhagen — Urban Development). Politically, the city also intends to demonstrate how it is possible for big cities to combine growth, development, and an enhanced quality of life while reducing carbon emissions at the same time. This goal sets Copenhagen as a frontrunner in the international arena.
Copenhagen designed its Climate Plan Roadmap in three phases and set on the first phase of the net-zero journey in 2013 with the ultimate goal to become carbon neutral by 2025. The plan was developed in line with the emergence of new knowledge and technology, as continued innovation allowed to make carbon reduction strategies possible and at scale. At the same time, the CPH 2025 Climate Plan seeks to enhance the quality of life for Copenhageners using carbon neutrality goals to change behavior and stimulate innovation, job creation and investments.
By 2018, Copenhagen has successfully achieved a reduction of carbon emissions per capita by 57% while the city’s population grew by 22%. This reduction was mostly due to the green conversion of power-generation and district heating systems from coal to biomass and the erection of wind turbines.
Figures 5, 6: Copenhagen carbon emissions actual and projected, 2005–2025
According to Figure 6, while the 2018 progress has been remarkable, it will require significant additional efforts to reach the 2025 targets. This aggressive goal is based on the city’s climate plan’s four pillars: (1) Energy consumption, (2) Energy production, (3) Mobility with reduced emissions, and (4) City Administration initiatives.
Energy consumption. This pillar primarily focuses on achieving energy efficiency for district heating and transitioning from oil to renewable energy systems. City of Copenhagen collaborates with large building owners on efficient management of their properties by monitoring their energy consumption and optimizing building operations.
Energy production. Copenhagen is powered mostly by renewable energy with more than 50% of electricity supplied by wind and solar, and approximately 80% of all electricity coming from renewable energy sources including bioenergy and geothermal energy (“A record year: Wind and solar supplied more than half of Denmark’s electricity in 2020.” State of Green). The city has ambitious efforts to add at least 460MW from wind turbines by 2025.
Mobility covers two groups of transportation: road and maritime. The city plans to convert all its public busses, road and harbor busses, to renewable energy sources and run on electricity, biodiesel, bioethanol, biogas, natural gas-electric hybrids or hydrogen fuel cell busses. The city is looking to expand public transportation and promote the use of bicycles to travel around the city. In addition to achieving a reduction of CO2 emissions, this initiative will have the benefit of significantly less street noise and reduced local air pollution (“Copenhagen aims to become a carbon neutral capital/Sustainable Transit.” Green City Times).
City Administration. This category sets an example for the Administration to lead the way to reduce the city’s energy consumption, green procurement and transition of the city’s vehicles and infrastructure to operate on alternative fuels. This is important in stimulating public-private partnerships, cooperation with other municipalities and other organizations, and engaging the citizens in the green transformation.
Copenhagen is showing an impressive reduction in carbon emissions. Two specific projects the city is proud of are EnergyLab Nordhavn and seawater use for cooling (“This is how Copenhagen plans to go carbon neutral by 2025.” World Economic Forum). EnergyLab Nordhavn is located in Copenhagen’s waterfront city district North Harbor. The EnergyLab was launched in 2015 in close partnership between academia, industry, utilities, and local government to design a full-scale smart city energy lab with innovative solutions in the areas such as intelligent waste handling, low-temperature district heating, clean public transportation, and super cycle highways. This project is looking at the whole energy system as one, integrating heat, electricity, and transport and testing new solutions such as large batteries and EVs to reduce peak load on the grid, intelligent heating of buildings, and a heat pump and storage system to improve flexibility and optimize local district heating network (“Cities 100: Copenhagen’s new Nordhavn neighborhood is a center of innovation for small energy systems.” C40 Knowledge).
Copenhagen also uses seawater from the harbor for its cooling system with the potential to cut emissions by 70% and keep about 80,000 tons of carbon out of the city’s direct atmosphere. In addition to the climate and environmental benefits, it costs less, takes up less space and it makes no noise. It works by pumping seawater of about 6C, using this water for the district water supply and returning water at about 16C back to the harbor (“Seawater keeps Copenhagen buildings cool.” Climate Change Adaptation).
This is a case study for the main article, Urban Path to Net-Zero: Leading Strategies of the Most Energy-Efficient Cities.

This is a short summary of what I saw in the conference, what I liked and didn't like and what I think was most interesting or worth notice considering my personal preferences and needs.
It was my first international conference and also the biggest conference I've attended so far, so please take that into account when reading this.
The conference had a good amount of different topics, I was satisfied with the balance between topics related with soft and hard skills, although, some of the mandatory talks could be frustrating to some people due to the lack of technical points or a practical guides.
Talks presented by partners (sponsors) weren’t simply trying to sell their solution, but were tackling problems or showing general solutions that can benefit you or your company even if you don’t use the partner specific solution. It was great to see the power of Kafka, GraphQL and Erlang/Elixir.
I was happy to be able to catch up on some topics like AI and quantum computing, the talks in general were well presented, not too long or too short and relevant. I felt that some topics should have had less talks considering that talks on similar subject were already present as part of the mandatory talks (AI and machine learning for example). I believed that the topics could had been better distributed (maximum number of talks per topic). On another side I understand that some redundancy is built-in for the different days and for people that might not be able to attend certain talks due do conflicts with parallel sessions. I understand that it’s not an easy to solve problem, and even with these remarks the overall experience was incredibly positive.
On a personal note I really liked the talk from Saša Jurić about Erlang and Elixir, seeing what Erlang and Elixir can do really gave me the extra push needed to dive into it. The talk from Adam Tornhill ""Prioritizing Technical Debt as if Time and Money Matters"" gave me a new perspective and even actionable points (although not easy) to deal with the trade-off between improving existing code and adding new features. Finally I was surprised with the extreme digitization in China presented by Christina Boutrup, it gave great insights which I believe are not on the radar of standard western people.
I currently live in Switzerland and I have to say that the Danes seemed to me to be even more punctual and organized! No real issues with talks being late or running over time, the duration and number of breaks helping to keep your attention on each talk you attend. Registration and overall logistical organization was very good ( quality of the food and amount of options was great).
The area for partners was cool and well structured, good amount of swag and most partners were easy to interact and have a good conversation during the quick breaks between talks.
One point that I really didn’t like was the amount of talks that were not being recorded, I don’t have enough conference experience to know how much this is common practice but feeling forced to attend to certain talks that might, or not, be of interest just for fear of missing out isn’t a great feeling in my opinion.
I didn't know most of the speakers, but was satisfied with the quality of the talks. As celebrities go, it was cool to see Steve Wozniak in person!
Most of the talks contributed more or less in the same way and a lot of them helped me into catching up with the current state of the industry (at least in a high-level view).
I'm less scared about AI and I think the field still has to evolve a lot before an AI tries to destroy humanity, still I would bet that many people will have their jobs taken by AI based solutions, but it's difficult to say how fast this will happen even for specialists in the field.
China is really a place to pay attention to, we can learn from them, as they seem to be able to foster innovation despite being very restrictive on their market and ideas.
Machine learning is finding more efficient and precise methods to do things in ways that humans can't understand, so it’s something I think everyone should pay more attention to as the results so far are already impressive (and seem to be less dangerous than what we normally associate with AI apocalypse, although strongly related).
Elixir is really awesome and I need to start experimenting and learning asap.
There are different ways to handle the trade-off between adding new functionality and improving existing code, I have much to learn!
The new perspective from Adam Tornhill is something that I believe will have an immediate positive impact on my daily work as in any fast paced and competitive business it’s part of the day to day job to weight the benefits of improving existing code versus the many new features that business requires in the short and long term. This talk gave me a different perspective on how to look at the problem and directions on what needs to be considered on a more technical and practical stand for me to be able to keep the best balance between business value added and the long term evolution of our platforms, while also keeping our 24/5 high frequency trading system competitive.
As a possible mid/long term contribution I think I would like to partner with our big data and BI teams and see what I can do using machine learning to improve the overall business. I now, more than before, believe that machine learning can really help businesses to take big leaps forward in ways that we humans simply can’t predict.
I wish I have the time and opportunity to put some Elixir in action at Swissquote as I believe that the very nature of the business can benefit immensely from the platform features (Erlang/Elixir) that support high availability, fast recovery and the benefits of the actor based model (processes in Elixir). Perfect for my needs in the Forex business line!
Thank you for you attention.

Hi! My name is Jeppe Rindom and I am CEO and co-founder of Pleo, a fintech startup that automates expense reporting.
In 2015, my former colleague from Tradeshift, Niccolo, and I founded Pleo in Copenhagen. We had and still have big and global ambitions but with the limited access to digital talent in Denmark, we wondered, right from the beginning, if we would ever be able to scale a global company without moving our base.
It is evident that digital graduates are produced at a much slower pace than what our fellow startups (and desperate ‘we-fear-disruption’ corporates) are screaming for. But hey, our country has pretty architecture, bikes, great food, and the happiest people in the world. So, as bold entrepreneurs we figured; ‘let’s not bring Pleo to the talent — Let’s bring the talent to Pleo!’
Fast forward 30 months, our organisation now counts +40 employees and more than half are non-Danes. What a great success one might conclude, but actually I would argue the opposite, because only in one single case did we, as a company, succeed in convincing an international candidate to relocate to Denmark. And in this specific case, the relocation was caused by a strong friendship to an existing employee.
We consider Pleo a fairly attractive workplace. We’ve been recognized with international prizes and have attracted substantial investments from venture capital firms. I believed so much in our ability to attract international talent that I naively wrote a blog post with the title ‘Let’s conquer the World, not each other!’, which was a shout to the Danish digital ecosystem to hire internationally instead of stealing talent locally. Yet, we’ve never been able do so. But Why?
The Danish ‘package’ is not competitive
As much as I am proud of the Danish welfare system as well as the Capital of Copenhagen, I have come to the conclusion that the Danish ‘package’ sounds much more compelling than it is.
A classic Danish startup package looks somewhat like this:
1) a non-competitive salary, which is really no news if you want to work in startups.
2) high taxation due to our welfare system. Here you might say ‘you get what you pay for’, but that’s actually not true. Most candidates we’ve tried to relocate have a 3 to 7 year perspective for staying in Denmark. They are at a stage in their lives, where access to free education, free healthcare etc. is of very little value.
3) a high cost of living. Being a foreigner without a place to stay in Copenhagen is really tough. Even if you’re willing to settle for just a room in a shared apartment, you will likely end up paying +€1K a month.
On point 1 and 3, Copenhagen is not much different from cities like London, Paris and Stockholm but on taxation, our offering is much worse. And that’s not only a shame, it’s a deal breaker.
So, how have we made it to first base?
I’ve always had mixed feelings when it comes to our ‘open’ (read: free for EU citizens) education system. Today, I praise myself lucky. It saved my a.. Big Time. When we were 1.5 year into the journey, we, as everybody else, couldn’t recruit Danish digital talent, and when our team turned 15 employees, I was still the only Dane. Looking around me, I realised that everyone else were here because of our good and open education system. Luckily for us, many had decided to stay after graduation and in hindsight, I should have done more to build relationships to schools and universities and would encourage any startup to do so.
Second, we right from the beginning had an international company culture. My co-founder is Italian so the Danish way was really never an option. It was of course an obvious thing for us, as our ambitions goes far beyond Danish borders, but our strong international company culture has also become a strong selling point when we hire. Today, Pleo has 14 different nationalities and we still have strong focus on maintaining a welcoming, family-like company culture.
Third, we have had a lot of media attention both inside and outside of Denmark. Today, it mostly relates to our business traction, but in the beginning we did serious efforts to create some buzz, both in terms of being present at conferences, startup events and constantly trying to get media coverage. That helped us tremendously — also in our recruiting.
Fourth, our foreign employees have been great at enabling their networks. Because of that, we today have a handful of engineers working remotely. And it has worked surprisingly well, not something I expected initially and that I believe is strong correlated to the fact that all remote workers were familiar with other Pleo folks (and vice versa) right from the beginning. So get your employees to enable their networks! Chances are that they already know a handful of relevant candidates.
We praise ourselves lucky to have made it to first base. But I fear that more challenges will come when targeting second base and growing our product organisation from 15 to 50 in the foreseeable future.
The bigger picture
We have to join forces on promoting Copenhagen as a European techhub. Organisations like CPHFTW and Copenhagen Capacity are doing a great job building, empowering, and promoting our tech community. But there’s a need for more ambassadors spreading great stories of the Danish tech ecosystem. We just hired a candidate who chose to move to Denmark before having a job. She decided to seek opportunities in Copenhagen (and relocate from Madrid) due to her positive perception of the Copenhagen startup scene. What a win!
We also need shared living at a reasonable price for foreign workers, who relocate to Denmark. Shared living initiatives such as LifeX have also proved to be social catalysts in the tech community. A place to meet like minded people outside of work. Being a foreigner and having social success in Denmark can be hard. Let’s admit it, Danes are pretty reserved when it comes to being inclusive of foreigners. Foreigners with a social headstart are more likely to stick around.
Lastly, I want to come back to our taxation. Our tax society has previously been creative, when facing the lack of talent. In the 90’s, we invented ‘expert taxation’ (in Danish: Forskerordningen), a favourable tax system for researchers and well paid employees recruited abroad. At that point in time, most of the Danish growth arrived from research-heavy organisations.
Today, our world is upside down. Big corporates face challenges maintaining growth and leadership positions and younger growth companies are contributing increasingly to the economic growth.
I strongly encourage Denmark to expand the ‘expert taxation’ agreement, so that tax incentives are created for medium-income but much-needed digital talent moving to Denmark.
Because there is no way we can scale our businesses without help from abroad. So let’s spread those great stories, let’s do our utmost to welcome foreign talent and let’s continue to push our politicians for more attractive framework conditions.
Jeppe

""Why Copenhagen?"" has been the common question when we told people we got married there. I am a Cambodian; my husband is English; and we live in Berlin. Wouldn't it make more sense to get married in Berlin, England, or Cambodia?
Yes, we did have a big fat wedding celebration in Cambodia. But more to that later. What I'm talking about is the legal/civil wedding where you sign a paper that legally binds you as husband and wife.
So… Yes, we live in Berlin. No, we don't speak very good German. This makes it hard because (1) we will then need an official translator at the wedding, (2) it would be tough throughout the whole application because of the limited German, (3) the paperwork is just too much. This article here could tell you more about everything you need to do to get married in Germany. One of the most ridiculous document you need to provide — in my opinion — is the Ehefähigkeitszeugnis aka Certificate of no impediment to marriage from your country of origin (and if I'm not mistaken, from all the countries you have lived at prior to Germany). Did I also mention certified copy of birth certificate? It's not easy business to get that for some countries.
And ""why not the UK then""? Which is actually a good question. UK is a bit simpler (probably because it's all in English so we could understand stuffs), but then we found out there is this requirement that ""In order to actually start the marriage process, you and your partner have to have been living in the UK for at least 7 days prior to notifying a designated registrar office of your plans to marry"". Read more from this article.
So yeah. Getting married in Germany seems hard. Getting married in the UK was also tricky. Thanks to the sponsored Google ads, we found out that a lot of expats in Europe goes to Denmark to get married. It looked like Copenhagen was the Vegas of Europe! No joke! Looking deeper, it was not like Vegas. There's no drive-through or laundry weddings. I know, disappointing right? But still, everyone claimed it was the best decision one could do if one of us are not German and not willing to go through the bureaucracy. So yeah, we decided to do Copenhagen.
There is literally this website that we found: https://gettingmarriedindenmark.com/ that provided a very clear step by step explanation of what to do. (FYI this is not a sponsored post or anything, I'm simply sharing information) They also provide the consultation service that helps you through with a fee. Honestly, the process is simple enough that you probably would not need the service, but we got it just for the peace of mind (and admit it — less stress for the bride).
So here is what we did.
Voila! Now you just need to turn up for the wedding!
We got married at Copenhagen city hall. Everything was straightforward and relaxing, and the whole ceremony was done in less than 10 minutes. We did not even have to bring any witnesses — they have those if we need. The people who performed the ceremony was nice and friendly, and we felt really comfortable. You can do vows too if you like. We didn't though. None of us really like to say emotional stuffs, so we skipped it. We simply said ""I do""and exchanged rings, and kissed. And oh, we signed the papers too.
It was just the two of us. So simple. So easy. Not a care in the world about guests, how we looked, or anything going wrong. We focused on getting married and did exactly JUST that.
As you could see, we dressed up a little though and had a photographer to capture the moment. You can skip all these and just rock up. I told the consultant agency what I was looking for, and they gave me some recommendations. However, there's plenty of photography, makeup, and flower services at different price points that you could go for if you google or check on instagram. They are pretty nice and friendly too, so just send them a text with your needs. Some people also opted for the fancier packages where you get married it at your own venue or a little off the bustling city center area.
None at all. We spent a bit of money but it was smooth and I recommend any expats living in Germany or Europe that struggles with the bureaucracy where they live to consider Copenhagen as their wedding destination. You can make it a little holiday and even invite people you care about to attend the ceremony.
Lots of love, from the newly Mrs ❤ Let me know if you have any questions or would like to know which photography and makeup service we used.

Alex Martin shares his love of history with people in Copenhagen, Denmark, through his job as a tour guide. This last Tuesday, April 5th, Martin led a food focused tour with a group of students from Semester at Sea.
Semester at Sea is a floating university where students from all over the world spend the semester taking classes on a ship, the MV World Odyssey. During the semester students get to travel to 10–13 different countries. While in country, they can travel independently or with field programs organized by Semester at Sea and tour companies from each country. Martin’s tour was with a group of journalism students.
Martin has been living in Copenhagen for 20 years. He started working as a tour guide because of his love for the city and his love for history. Because of his wide range of knowledge, he is able to lead tours related to a variety of topics. This tour focused on the food scene in Copenhagen, but just the day before Martin led another tour with Semester at Sea that focused on social movements with a group of political science students. Martin introduced the group of journalism students to the rich history of food in Denmark by telling them the story of rye bread, and its importance in the country. According to him, rye bread is a staple in most Nordic cultures because of its rich nutrients. The bread uses flour made from rye grain instead of wheat grain and includes a variety of seeds. Historically, people used to even put wood shavings in it to bulk up its nutritious value. Danish farmers used to use this bread as an edible plate and bring their leftovers to the fields for lunch, creating an open-faced sandwich called the smorgasbord. This practical and inexpensive dish was later adopted by bars who would serve it to clients in effort to get them to buy more drinks. The public really enjoyed these sandwiches and began to request specific flavors. The bars responded to this interest by making the smorgasbord a permanent item on the menu, and restaurants soon followed. Smorgasbord is now considered the national dish of Denmark and, although it has practical roots, it is presented as a delicate, elegant dish at many dining establishments.
After teaching the students about the history of rye bread and smorgasbord, Martin brought them to CPH Cooking Class to try and make the dish themselves. The group prepared three different variations of the dish. The first variation was vegetarian and consisted of buttered rye, boiled potatoes, mustard mayo, fried onions, and dill. The second was rye topped with chicken salad made of shredded chicken, mayo, green apple, green onion, and herbs. The last variation was fried fish and vegetables served on top of rye with lemon. Martin said the fish was a red spotted fish popular in Denmark because of its supply in the North Atlantic. The group was able to eat their creations with popular fruit juices while having time to ask Martin and the CPH Cooking Class staff questions before heading off to their next activity.
A short bus ride took Martin and his students to Reffen, a famous Copenhagen food market where the stands are made of recycled shipping containers. Martin explained that Denmark is one of the most sustainability focused countries in the world with a huge emphasis on recycling. Making food stands out of old shipping containers near the capitol’s shipping port is just one of the innovative Danish techniques that Martin taught about. He also pointed out a complex of student housing made from the recycled containers, a garbage incinerator that creates power for the city and has an artificial ski hill on top of it, a group of windmills near the coast, the importance of bikes in the city, and the use of recycled materials in Copenhagen’s hippie commune, Christiania. He gave the students free time to explore the food market, interview business owners, and taste more unique dishes. According to Martin, Reffen is a great place for aspiring chefs and business owners to enter Copenhagen’s already dense food industry.
For their last stop, Martin took the students to one of his personal favorite spots, Halls on the Plaza in the city center. This food market offers many take home options and is conveniently located downtown, making it a popular spot for Copenhagen residents on their way home from work. The plaza consists of two buildings constructed on top of an underground recycling complex. While it is expensive to rent a space at, the heavily trafficked area generates steady business making it another great place for people trying to enter the city’s food industry. Martin’s personal favorite things to buy at the plaza are fish cakes and chocolates.
Bellies full of Danish food and heads full of information, Martin took the group of students back to their ship. When asked if he likes his job he replied, “I get to learn new things every day, what’s not to like?”
Thank you to Kris Kodrich and Semester at Sea for facilitating this field class.

I would like to share my overall impressions about the flight to the Faroe Islands and why I chose this airline.
The company made its first flight on March 1988. Since then, much has changed, and the company has become larger. Now Atlantic Airways has 184 employees. The fleet consists of 3 planes and 2 helicopters, the aircrafts are relatively new, including the brand new Airbus A320NEO and Leonardo AW139 helicopters. The airplanes and helicopters are named after the outstanding artists of the Faroe Islands.
The decision to fly to the Faroe Islands came very spontaneously, and there was little to no time for deliberation and plans. However, at the same time, I was pleasantly surprised by the cost of tickets, even when buying a mere 10 days before the departure.
As an experienced tourist, I decided to register on the site and get a frequent flyer card, but something went wrong, and I was confronted with an error on the website. Looking ahead, I would say that this is the only minus that I can note. In any case, I was not upset, as the primary goal was to buy flight tickets, and this can be done without any registration.
Go to the airline’s website, and right on the main page, you can immediately see all direct destinations:
North
South
There is also an option — to see the calendar of low prices.
The process of buying tickets is quite simple, all prices on the website are in Danish kroner. Choosing a date, you can see prices for a few days back and forth, which will allow you to find the best option.
You can also buy tickets using mobile apps on iOS and Android devices.
You can use the app or web to Check-in online, and you don’t need to print out boarding passes, you can use them directly from the mobile app.
Before buying tickets, I recommend checking the information if you need a visa since the Faroe Islands have their own permission.
Information on countries whose residents need a visa can be found here.
If you still need a visa, the list of embassies can be found here.
The Faroe Islands are not part of the Schengen Area, and therefore you can’t get here using a Danish visa. You must apply directly for an Island visa.
After all the preparations had been completed, finally the long-awaited day of the departure had arrived. The route consisted of a stop off in Copenhagen then onto Vagar.
Check-in and baggage drop-off at the airport closes half an hour before a flight. If you have luggage, you can choose 2 options:
In the first case, the airport staff will help you arrange everything. Although if you decide to use the second option, you need to scan the boarding pass and select passengers with luggage, after which the machine prints a sticker that must be attached to the suitcase. After that, just a few meters away is the baggage drop-off point. If your baggage weighs more than 20 kg, it’s classified as heavy so you will need to attach a special tag to it, which you will find right next to the scanner.
Wave goodbye to your luggage and head to the gate for boarding. If you are departing from Copenhagen Airport, I would highly recommend you to arrive early, as there are a lot of shops and various cafes inside.
The gate was in a small remote wing of the terminal. Most of all, I was worried about company loyalty to hand luggage. The hand luggage restrictions are 55x40x25 cm and 8kg weight plus a laptop bag.
As I noticed, there were no questions from the airport staff regarding the size and quantity of hand luggage and boarding was speedy.
I flew on the brand new AIRBUS A320NEO, and my impressions were only the most positive, not only from the plane but also from what was happening inside.
I was almost the last person to board the plane, and this did not hinder me from putting my suitcase on the luggage rack. The shelves were not full, even despite the fact I was flying to a cold country, and people would need a lot of outerwear.
I think it’s not worth saying however that the seats were in excellent condition as the plane is still new. You are able to change the position of the chair and headrest.
I was surprised by the mobile device holder, as well as USB charging for each seat.
Atlantic Airways provides an app for passengers. The main functionality is
How to get the app? Connect to WIFI AtlanticAirFi and open airfi.aero in a browser.
Atlantic Review Magazine is published 4 times a year and has been available to airline users since 1990. On the airline’s website, you can find all the old publications since 2010. The journal tells about the sights, entertainment, and events on the islands, as well as historical information.
Oh, what a delicious sandwich, you can create songs about it ;)
A selection of free drinks provided on board: sweet soda, juices, and coffee or tea.
I especially recommend you to try tomato juice. I would even say that it is not juice, but a ready-made cocktail with spices, incredibly tasty for spicy lovers.
Food can be ordered in several ways:
You can order sandwiches or rolls as well as desserts and drinks, but if you travel in the morning, breakfast may be your choice too.
A feature of the menu was the opportunity to try craft beer, specially brewed in collaboration with the brewery and the airline.
Föroya Bjór fly WIT me
Atlantic Airways asked Föroya Bjór to brew beer specifically for passengers, and as a result, we got a fly WIT me. This is Belgian Witbier (Bière Blanche), and experts say that the best place to drink beer you can have at an altitude of 10,000 meters. Föroya Bjór is the oldest brewery in the Faroe Islands and was founded in 1888.
Okkara Hop in the Air
Another beer is Indian Pale Ale brewed together with Okkara, which has been brewing beer since 2010 and is very famous for its collaborations with other breweries.
If you are planning a trip to the Faroe Islands, this airline may surprise you.
Read my blog, and you will find a lot of useful information for traveling around Europe.

Healthy. Organic. Paleo restaurant
Inspired by our latest trip to Berlin and how much wifey and I enjoyed the #SexyGood healthy delicious Simply Keto restaurant/cafe in Berlin, Germany, I realised how much I had enjoyed a similar experience last August when we had gone to Copenhagen Denmark.
The entire #SexyGood + links to the 3 visits to Simply Keto can be captured here https://medium.com/@abhijitpradhan/the-launch-of-the-true-life-metric-95a305856195
We had done a short 5 day trip to this amazing city for the following reasons
After paying homage to the Coffee Collective at their roastery outlet in Godthabsvej/Freidricksburg, we came to the famed Torvehallerne, the hip and happening food hall ( there are 2 big halls ).
And while hunting for lunch options, my eyes settled on Palæo which I had read about earlier. Luckily, as one could pick up food from any kiosk and sit together in one place, I didn’t have to worry about wifey, who was frankly not too interested in the place ! ( It took her a trip to Berlin last month to finally nudge her !). She looked at the different food options, but her attention quickly wandered off and she came back with a multi cheese platter as her lunch !
I went to the counter and the person taking orders was friendly and helpful. The place was more a snack/fast food/smoothie kind of place. Apparently there was a “restauranty” style Paleo outlet somewhere else in the city, but she told me the food was essentially the same.
I ordered a salad which was heavy on keto bread, avocado, nuts, berries, etc.
She suggested I go for the Sweet Potato chips. I did. And my main course was a “grass fed” Hot dog with the sausage wrapped in an egg omelette.
I was in seventh heaven as one did not get such treats back home-especially the grass fed hot dog !
The other thing that struck me after reaching Copenhagen was the sheer quality of their produce. Especially the vegetables. I told wifey that I could happily give up meat for ever, if I get a constant supply of such awesome vegetables. This theme continued throughout the trip and even in the Michelin starred restaurants that we ate in and loved, the vegetables were like from another planet !! #Swoon
Torvehallerne became a very convenient lunch spot for us. It was next to the hub station, Norreport, so it was connected to all places in the city ( Metro, train, bus) and dinners were strategically chosen and booked by wifey to feed her chef soul, so basically I got a license to have most of my lunches at Palæo ! Yay ! Think I did at least 3 :)
My favourite dish was discovered when I ordered their burger. The same friendly order taker told me the bread used for the burger was not as heavy as their regular bread as it used more seeds than nuts. Cool !
I loved it. The meat was obviously grass fed beef and from the first bite I was transported to my school days where my dream meal was in one of the fast food burger joints ( Hardees, Dairy Queen etc.) and my favourite dish used to the burger ( specifically the Mushroom & Swiss burger in Hardees).
I ensured that I had the burger again in my next and last visit here !
This experience gave me hope that Sexy and Good can co-exist and my recent trip to Berlin and Simply Keto has only reinforced that hope !! Also, it was heartening to know that Michelin star chef Thomas Rode Andersen was behind the design of the menu ! #SexyGood in action !https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/mar/02/fast-food-restaurant-caveman-diet-copenhagen
I had turned “Paleo” way back in 2012 and in fact tried to use that approach while running marathons but it didn’t work as after 30 k of running, the system would just revolt and scream for quick carbs. Energy gels, potatoes. I was eating more and more unhealthy stuff just to fuel my runs !
It was only in 2016 where I discovered “Keto” which actually gives me hope of plugging that energy crash issue that I always faced on the longer runs.
Paleo can be seen as High Protein ( which I realised was not actually good for me) + Low Carb + Low Fat whereas Keto is High Fat + Moderate Protein ( a crucial tweak) and Low Carb
When ( and if ) your body adapts to the High fat and low carb component of Keto, it slowly starts prefering to burn fat as a fuel ( which is far cleaner) rather than the extremely dirty and volatile carbs as source of fuel. I know now that if I had managed this during my marathoning days, it would have made a world of difference ! I don’t do long runs anymore as it took me a very long time to get over a knee injury and I realised that my body thrives on high intense short bursts of activity rather than the prolonged abuse that I was subjecting it to + after the recent Paris + Berlin trip, I re-connected with “walking” as it probably activates health in my system better than any other activity ! Wow.
The above is a short recap of how I arrived at #SexyGood in terms of diet, nutrition and exercise.

When this Airbnb host in London decided to be an Airbnb guest in design-conscious Copenhagen, he found much to be inspired by in the galleries and museums. If you’re also looking for design/art inspiration, here are three spots you should include when visiting Copenhagen. (Although just being in the city itself seems to activate latent design genes…)
The SMK houses 700 years’ worth of Danish and Nordic art and sculpture with a clear demarcation between the original architecture built in 1896 and the stunning, light-filled modernist section built 100 years later. If you like a chronological context, you can work your way from the front and understand the big themes through the centuries with clever diversions into more obscure and ‘problematic’ branches every so often.
A short train trip north of Copenhagen takes you to another repository of modern art in a stunning waterside setting, housed in an architectural marvel.
Louisiana (named after the original owners three wives, all named Louise) is a day trip in itself. The permanent collection boasts works by Picasso, Klein, Arp, Moore, Warhol, Hockney, Giacometti and oodles more. The current exhibitions included a immersive retrospective of Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama, Lucien Freud and ‘Africa’, a hugely thoughtful and surprising treatise on architecture, art and culture from the continent today.
If Copenhagen can’t have a stunning museum of design, what hope is there for anywhere else? The museum has the lofty twin ambitions to both serve ‘as a source of inspiration for people active in industry’ while making ‘contemporary consumers both critically aware and discerning’.
This translates of course into a whole lot of #chairporn…
So, despite ostensibly taking a break from London, Airbnb and design, I find myself filled with a better understanding of how Danish design works. Now to bring some of that all important hygge to Kith & Kine.
Kith & Kine is a stylish two-bed property close to all the hip/tech action in Shoreditch, London. Come and stay and see how far we’ve got recreating some Danish hygge…

“Travel has been the fire that has shaped my current self, accumulating layers of complexity in my thinking, thoughts, and actions as a result of my journey’s successes and failures.” Gabriela Trofin-Tatár
My Erasmus University exchange in Odense, Denmark, during the spring semester of 2006 was an unforgettable chapter in my life. Immersed in the vibrant atmosphere of Tehnisk Kollegium, I discovered the power of collaborative learning through teamwork, an experience that would profoundly shape my educational journey.
Moreover, during the semester, I traveled both in Denmark and abroad, expanding my horizons and becoming more curious about my studies.
In the following sections, I invite you to read about events and places that had a positive impact on my love for Denmark and my cultural awareness during that time.

I am not often in Copenhagen. It is a one-hour drive from where I live. And I can get my shopping and entertainment needs covered closer to home. But I do go there occasionally. And when I do, I see reminders of our racist past everywhere.
I will start with a disclaimer. I am a white dude, who is soon approaching 40. I am a history buff. And I have always tried to fight racism where I can. But I am aware I can not fully escape my racist history.
Many Europeans acknowledge the blatant racism in the U.S. But they falsely believe that it is a uniquely American problem. It is not. The slave ships that brought these slaves to the U.S. sailed from our harbors.
Racism is a European invention. We had to invent it in order to justify our atrocities against people of color. And guess what. We think our invention was so smart, that we Europeans call the historic period where we shipped slaves and exploited our colonies “The Age of Enlightenment”.
Yes, racism is systemic. And trying to censor this truth in our classrooms will not make it untrue.

Based on a meeting in Copenhagen, one call to Australia, a number of tweets, Linkedin and Yammer posts, the word was spread and the first #ResponsiveOrg meetup in Copenhagen became reality Thursday 27. November 2014 — read about the preparation here ,
Eager to meet the people who signed up for #ResponsiveCoffee in Copenhagen on Meetup.com I got to the cafe about 30 minutes early…
tables where placed in a corner, and the coffee was just about to brew — we where ready to meet.
All interested and curious we gathered and the talking started by one to one introductions as people showed up, then the non existing agenda developed in this way:
6 men joined — Kenneth has listed ResponsiveOrg Copenhagen relevant tweets here — and here are the names of the 6 men at the first meetup
admitted - it looks a bit as a bunch of..
“..handsome, thoroughly clever, perfectly plump men in our prime” as Karlsson on the roof says
The conversation touched diversity and all agreed it is needed for future meetups. Also discussing the need for a meetup in english, which is obviously is an option if non Danish-speaking wants to join — please let us know at meetup.com or as a comment here.
I am not really sure, but I know that I have found likeminded people whom I want to share my experiences with, and I am sure they will share interesting angles on topics that relates to #futureofwork, #ResponsiveOrg, #worklikeanetwork — add the # you like, or tell the story as Matt Partovi
http://player.vimeo.com/103393370
One thing it instantly brougth was Kenneths scoop.it on Leadership a ressource of inspiration for future topics, and so much more.
And the all participants was featured in this tweet
Wanting to get into a series of meetups, the next meetup is planned as #ResponsiveMorning for the 14. January at 9:30 - you can signup via meetup.com
Do you want to give a 10 minute speak about a topic you care about? If so suggest a topic for the meetup, and suggest a topic anyway.
A big thanks to all of you showing up, and for those of you who showed interested but couldn’t find the time, come by in the future.
To all of you who liked, retweetet and shared the posts to make the noise — most appreciated!

August 4, Sabbatical Day 23
Sunday did not go at all like I had planned. I walk out of my apartment at 10:40am, planning to bike to church (that starts at 11am), only for rain drops to start falling. So I pivot to taking the train … only that adds to my travel time and makes me 10 minutes late to church. And I’m sleepy in my movie-theater seat in the back of the auditorium, fighting heavy eyelids. And if we’re being honest, I don’t get much out of the guest pastor speaking.
But I’ve still got the entire day, right? Only it’s pouring when I walk out of church, so I linger a little longer in the lobby, game-planning my day on my phone.
Church attendees are slowly making their way out (this church takes place in a hotel conference center). And one makes it’s way over to me. Glasses, ash-blonde air a little ruffled, lanky and crooked smile. No rain jacket.
“Were you at Hillsong?” He asks in heavily accented English.
“Yes, I’m visiting Copenhagen and every time I’ve come to the city before, I have come to church here.”
He proceeds to tell me that he just moved to Copenhagen last week from Bratislava, Slovakia. He’s staying in a hostel now, but wants to live by the beach. He tells me about the bike he bought from a guy a month ago (the guy just left it on the street for him to buy!), and how it was locked up on the street for the last month waiting for his return. I tell him about my journey to Copenhagen, my sabbatical.
Eventually I see the rain lightening up, and say my goodbyes. I walk off to the metro, planning on taking it to Norrebro to get this focaccia sandwich I dreamed about getting last visit. And just as I make it down the escalator, I hear an alarm going off.
“Evacuate immediately,” it says.
So everyone makes there way back up the elevator, crowing under the metro awning outside, because — mind you — it’s still raining. Sirens start in the distance, and a fire truck rounds the corner.
I make the call to try for the bus instead, since clearly this train station won’t be opening back up anytime soon. I walk back past the church, past the Slovak, and to a bus station a block away. The bus is 10 minutes late, but finally arrives. By this point, it’s nearing 2pm, and the sun has broken through — you’d hardly know it was so nasty 30 minutes ago.
I get my focaccia sandwich from Rondo, inhale it, and start walking back to my apartment to pick up my bike. I think I take a wrong turn somewhere along the way, because it’s taking longer than I anticipated. I’m cutting through Fælledparken, and start realizing — if I want to go visit Grundtvigs church, I need to do it now, since they close at 4 and are closed Monday. So once again, I backtrack to the bus station. And what do you know, the heavens open up midway. I wait under a tree for a couple minutes, waiting for it to lighten up, then make my way to the bus stop. The bus is late, which I’m starting to realize is a Copenhagen trend. I start seeing a bunch of people walking in the same direction with jerseys, and realize there’s a match on today. Do I want to go? I calculate the time it takes to get to the church, take a quick spin, then go back to my apartment to change, then go to the game. It’s a lot, so I decide against. This is all being thought through while I’m on the bus.
Eventually I get to the church … only to walk up and find that it’s closed due to water damage. And honestly, I’m more bummed about the hour of travel time round trip than the actual church being closed.
So I make my way back to my apartment, changing out of my church clothes and swapping my bag for coffee shop books and journals. There’s one right around the corner from my apartment that a guy from Hagen Espresso in London recommended. It’s pretty full for 4pm when I get there, so I snag a seat inside since there’s not a seat open outside to enjoy this gorgeous weather.
But right after my drink is delivered, one does open up, so I gather up my bag and cortado and relocate. I’m sitting outside for around 20 minutes before I see a young guy — who I think is not Danish — walk into the shop. He’s by himself, wearing a Cyprus cap, along with a green market tote bag.
He sits at the table to left of me, back to the street, while I’m facing the street, Mere Christianity in hand. I keep eying him — do I make conversation with this fellow traveler? After all, sometimes I’ve found some of my best travel moments behind starting a conversation. But how to start — do I ask him about Cyprus?
At this point, I pull out my phone that’s plugged into my power bank. And that’s my opening (or rather, his).
“Do you have a USB-C cable?” He asks, once again in accented English. “I have a power bank, I just need the cord.”
And this, reader, is where I thank God once again that I bought a power bank with several types of cords.
“No, but this has one in it. Here, you take it,” I insist. “Are you visiting Copenhagen?”
“Yes, I just arrived today.”
“Oh, and where are you from?”
“I’m from Ukraine, but I’m living in Italy now.”
“Oh, where in Italy?” I ask, thinking about my January trip there.
Outside of Florence, he tells me. “I’ve hitch-hiked here from Florence.”
Cue my jaw dropping.
“I first went to Berlin, where I stayed with some friends. Then hitchhiked here. I wanted an adventure, and I had things that I wanted to figure out for life. But now I think I know what I need to do next, so I’m going to just fly home. Plus hitchhiking is exhausting.”
The conversation that follows is not one that I could have predicted.
I find out more about his life — He lived in Italy from 2019 to February 2022, making money so he could come back to Ukraine flush with cash — rich in their eyes. This is when he says he thought his dream, ideal life would start. But he didn’t have to explain it too much — Russia invaded a month later. Eventually he got out of Ukraine (which he didn’t explain, but I know means avoided being conscripted). Back to Italy, working in services industry — a textile manufacturer, I think.
He said his life was comfortable, but he didn’t want to blink and life fly by. I asked him what his realization was, and he answered, “I need to leave Italy.” He has various gripes with Italy and Italians — lack of openness and diversity, lack of parks, lack of opportunities to connect with others. He also doesn’t know what to do work wise — he’s tried a lot of different things.
I couldn’t help but think at this point — “Oh buddy. You’re searching for a happy life, but that’s never going to satisfy.”
I ask him what brings him joy, and he says talking with people — at some points he struggles to find the words in English. He likes providing advice, or crisis management, as he says.
He asks about me, too. I tell him about my sabbatical, about processing life, what I want to do next.
“How satisfied are you with your life? Put a number on it.”
I tell him that while I love my life, of course there are things I’d love to be different. I’d love to be married, I’d love for experience physical healing. 75%, I say.
“That’s pretty high.”
We talk some about singleness — I say there are things I could not do if I was married. Like working with the youth kids that bring me so much joy. I probably could not do a trip like this if I was married. That’s when I’m surprised to find out he’s married (no ring). Just left his wife back in Italy to hitchhike for a bit.
I explain that in the south in the U.S., people get married younger. My sisters both married young.
“Do you feel pressure to? From your family?” He asks.
“Not really.” It’s more the pressure of my own timeline. But my parents don’t quite understand the different world I am dating in, and find themselves befuddled that being asked out is so non-existent for so many of my friends.
We shut the coffee shop down, and move to a bench next door. At some point, he has me follow him on Instagram so we can keep up with one another. How much, we’ll see. Near the end of our conversation, he asks me, “So what’s your plan from here?”
I clarify — “Do you mean for today, this trip, or my life?”
“For your life.”
Oof. How to answer this?
“Here’s the thing, I can make plans for my life, but ultimately, I could die tomorrow –“ He recoils a bit at this — “I mean, I hope not, but I know where I would be if I did. And here’s the thing, as great as all this is,” I wave my hand at the street in front of me, “Heaven is better. So I can make plans, my life is not my own. My life belongs to God. He has plans for me. One of the things I love about God is I can do x or y, but he’s going to use it regardless for my good and his glory.”
He’s watching me as I talk and I don’t know if I’ve entirely lost him. I feel the need for honesty not pontifications.
“Listen, is it easy to say that? Absolutely not. I want to be tight fisted with my life. I have to remind myself regular to let go, because I know his plan for me is so much better.”
He doesn’t respond to any of this, and that’s okay. I don’t need him to. The conversation peters out some from there — but before we part, I ask to take his picture and he acquiesces.
We stand — he’s VERY TALL — and bends at both the knees and the waist to give me a very awkward hug. “Don’t die tomorrow,” he tells me.
I smile at that, and tell him I’ll try not to.
I walk off in the direction of the grocery, reeling a bit. Did the last hour and a half just happen? I’ve never had a conversation with a stranger like that before.
I rewind through my day — the delays and redirects and ending up at Prolog Coffee outside at 4pm. It would be easy to look at my encounter with Bogdan (that’s his name) in a silo. But I can see the fingerprints streaking across the window of my day, and I can see how the fact that I ended up there was not happenstance. Who knows if any of that will stick with him, but it was as much for me as it was for him.
There’s this rewiring starting to happen inside of me on this trip.
Life with God is an adventure. I’ve said that before, but I’ve thought about it more in the large-scale sense. Adventure of career, dating, etc.
But now, now I’m starting to realize that every day is an adventure. To look at the margins — or lack of — and invite him in. Surprise me, God.

When I arrived in Copenhagen six years ago, after a particularly hard year in New York, I needed to regroup, re-think and reinvent myself. I was stressed out, exhausted and confused — everything you’d expect a New Yorker to be. My salvation came from the most unexpected source — a bicycle.
If in New York cycling was saved for hipsters, exercise fanatics and tourists at that time, in Copenhagen, it was (and is) the main mode of transportation. Bike roads run alongside car roads there, with dedicated traffic lights, and bicyclists are respected and given priority. In return, they obey strict rules and laws. The whole thing is very civilized. No yelling, no honking, no confusion.
After two weeks of taking overpriced buses like a tourist and gawking at masses of bicycles at intersections, I gave in and bought a used bike. Little did I know, my rusty two-wheeled companion was to become my best friend in Denmark’s cold capital and my best chance at finding happiness.

My old friend Kathrine invited us to stay with her a while at her new tiny house in Copenhagen. For our first night out, she looked at a number of options: There was a weird performance art piece by The Center for Militant Futurologi, drummers were needed for a climate change demonstration on two tallships sailing down whatever the big river in the middle of the city is called (I swear I can’t find this information anywhere), and a jam session was brewing in Freetown Christiania. Kathrine said her best bet was a metal show at a small bar called Lygtens Kro, with a headliner from Sweden (Gothenburg, naturally) who played in the style of the 1980s. “Power metal?” I asked, and her boyfriend said that sounded right to him. I became partly acquainted with the numerous highly-specific metal subgenres back in my nightclub days, and I do my best to keep up as the lexicon matures; but I’m never sure what names to use.
So we met at the Metro station, hit the bar, and got a round of Golden Ladies (a slightly-higher-priced form of Tuborg lager, analogous to ordering a Miller Genuine Draft instead of a Miller High Life). The opening band, I thought, was good but not great. They could use a new guitarist. Still, it was enjoyable enough, stoner rock with a vein of grunge in there that might have resulted more from a lack of rehearsal than an aesthetic choice. I figured this was what would be on the menu tonight. I couldn’t have been more wrong. After a short set break, during which I smoked a comically tiny joint outside, the headliners took the stage sans announcement and began to play. I happened to be near the door that was nearest the stage, headed straight in, and got myself an enviable position in the very front of the room to see and hear a band called Hypnos.
Holy shit, these boys could play. There was an Iron Maiden thing happening, sometimes escalating into Queensryche territory or putting its root down into Soundgarden. If you know those bands, then a certain kind of metal vocals are playing in your head now that speaks to a certain era of rock — “No one sings like you anymore,” as the late great Chris Cornell lamented — and you’re right on the money. This singer Linus Johansson was extra fun — a sensuous and playful front man with frizzy blond hair and a porno mustache, with a voice like Geoff Tate and moves like Robert Plant, graceful arms and serpentine torso, with penetrating eye contact at such close quarters. This bar didn’t even have a stage, so I was just standing right in front of these guys, able to really get into what the players were doing, and they were doing plenty. The lead guitarist, Pontus Isebring, was positively fucking rad, an inspired shredder in a paroxysm behind his veil of dark brown hair yet locked in tight with the rhythm section. To call them a rhythm section is to undersell them a bit, in fact: The younger-looking second guitarist Oskar Wersall often harmonized with solos and melodies note for note, leaving the chugging rhythmic floor to dead-serious bassist Anton Kallmin; and even that mustachioed and muttonchopped warrior was doing some pretty fancy shit when space opened up on the bottom end. Drummer Oskar Brindmark was a beast and a scientist, not a drop of sweat on his brow as he assembled and deconstructed patterns with breakneck speed. They were one sick five-piece metal outfit, my friends. This isn’t even my kind of music, particularly, but I know greatness when it’s blasting me in the face.
It wasn’t all about technical chops, either. Part of what made Hypnos so much fun to watch was that they were all having so much fun, enjoying one another’s company on stage in a way that lots of bands fail to do even in their honeymoon years. Anton and Oskar W. stepped in to share backup vocals on a single mic, eyes flashing and heads bobbing at one another. Linus couldn’t get enough of Pontus’ solos — every time the latter cut loose, the former sidled up real close and let his own fingers wiggle up and down his mic stand in a celebratory air guitar dance that brought to mind Bowie/Ronson in the Spiders From Mars years. I guess this singer isn’t even the original guy — he joined the band in 2017 — but having watched them play I can hardly imagine Hypnos without him. That this band remains so infatuated with the stage and with each other on their fifteenth year of performing says much about their special chemistry, and for an audience member it makes all the difference.
At the end of the set, Linus asked us to make sure and buy something at the merch table. “We don’t have any money!” he cheerfully informed us. Sadly, I hadn’t a dime to spare at that very broke point in my own independently-booked tour of Europe; so the best I could offer was my congratulations and this article. Hypnos seems to be on tour at all times, releasing music on The Sign Records that you can buy right now and generally doing the work of a rock and roll band in the prime of life. You should find an opportunity to see them play live, ideally in a small venue, and bring enough cash for the CD or the t-shirt or whatever. Folks like us are out here scraping by in 21st-century showbiz, even living metal gods from Sweden, and time shovels dirt over all of us soon enough. It’s up to the fans to keep the scene alive. As long as there are heads in the club, Hypnos is sure to keep them banging.

[Note from Massimo: This article by my friend Jim Baggott is a bit on the technical side. But if you care about our deep understanding of the world, or about the nature of science, or about the relationship between science and philosophy, enjoy.]
I read Massimo’s essay “Physicists don’t know what the world is like, at bottom” (29 May 2020, also here) with considerable interest. And no little frustration. In the epilogue of my new book Quantum Reality (published in the US in September) I close with a brief analysis of a survey of attitudes on the interpretation of quantum mechanics that was conducted among physicists in 2011. Massimo’s essay concerned a more recent (and more extensive) survey published in 2016, which I’d overlooked. Thankfully, in most respects both surveys produced similar results.
Massimo observed that, despite all the popular media attention given to fantastical interpretations which invoke the existence of multiple, parallel universes, the Copenhagen interpretation remains the most favored. (And I heaved a sigh of relief, as this was true also in 2011.)
But what I found even more fascinating is that the 2016 survey, conducted by Sujeevan Sivasundaram and Kristian Hvidtfelt Nielsen at Aarhus University in Denmark, included questions which allowed them to go beyond this simple statement of…

I took fairly easy train ride from Stockholm, through Malmo, and then over a gigantic bridge that spans the sea between Malmo and Copenhagen. I had no idea what to expect from Copenhagen, but somehow I knew I was going to enjoy my week in the home of Carlsberg. It turned out to be one of my favourite cities in Europe and the first time I stayed in a hostel with triple bunk beds.
Copenhagen was a fascinating city with an interesting mix of old and modern architecture in addition to many parks areas and canals. The bike lanes were also the best i’d used in Europe. I was able to skateboard on them anywhere I wanted in the city without having to go on the actual roads at all.
Apparently there was a study done about the Copenhagen bike lanes and the conclusion was that it was actually faster to use the bike lanes to bike to your destination than to drive within the city.
Copenhagen also had what I consider one of the best modern art museum that I visited in Europe, the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art.
Set a bit outside of the city on the coast, the building is at first unassuming by appearing to be a diminutive house, but when you enter it opens into a vast underground exhibit area.
In the surrounding grounds there was a pond with a small forest and various sculptures perched around some walking trails.
There were also some large open lawn areas with more sculptures and installations overlooking the sea. It was a beautiful place.
After being in the Copenhagen for a few days I could notice some contrasts between there and the Stockholm, most notably the liquor laws. Stockholm’s laws were more conservative than the redundant Canadian laws, forcing you to buy alcohol from specific government run liquor stores that close around 7 pm on weekdays, 3 pm on Saturdays and are completely closed on Sundays. Furthermore it was illegal to drink outside of establishments, and the latest almost all bars and clubs stay open till was 3 am. In contrast, in Copenhagen you can drink on the streets, buy alcohol from the corner store and party all night if you want to.
An interesting thing to note is the bottle deposit is so high on beers cans and bottles in Copenhagen that anytime I was sitting in a park enjoying a beer with some friends there would be at least five people coming up to you to ask for your empties, which was great because you never had to concern yourself with finding a garbage can to dispose of them. Win for the Danish.
During my week in Copenhagen I went to three music festivals. The best one was a free festival the city put on in the middle of a park called the King’s Garden that had a castle on a hill. Everybody was chilling on the grass drinking beers and enjoying one of the nicest days of the summer while music blared from a stage set up underneath the castle. I met some friendly people and ended up being invited over to somebody’s house for some after party drinks.
One of the most compelling aspects about Copenhagen was the existence of Freetown Christiania. Christiania is a place that exists in the city center of a Copenhagen, which is a self-proclaimed republic that stemmed from squatters living there since the 1970s. Christiania is it’s own world.
There were only about 800 official residents living there that have built themselves all kinds of strange houses and have even built their own schools to teach their children their own curriculum.
Street art was splashed everywhere all over the buildings and there were numerous small cafes and restaurants around that only accept cash.
The part about Christiania that most people come for though was the open selling and consumption of marijuana. There was a street called ‘pusher street’ that was lined with at least 20 stalls selling all kinds of hash, marijuana and edibles.
Here you can buy a joint, light it up, smoke it and nobody will bother you. It is fascinating that such a place existed right in the middle of one of the most modern cities in Europe. Still what happens in Christiania was technically illegal so the residents had established two rules for visitors. The first rule was no running, because if people are running the residents assume it’s a police raid and they will start to run away as well. I later met some Danish dude that told me if you are caught running in Christiania you will receive quite the beating. The second rule was no photos, which was unfortunate because there are some many cool art installations and works of street are littered around the self-proclaimed republic.
Still I was able to sneak a photo or two, but there was one instance where I took a photo of the entrance sign with a resident in the photo and he came up to me and made me delete the photo from my phone.
In the end for me Copenhagen was an ideal blend of south Europe and Scandinavia. It was a clean, organized, well thought out city that has a little bit of everything for everybody where you didn’t have to look over your shoulder to go drink a beer. I actually looked into immigrating there, but unfortunately I would have had to learn the Danish language, which, according to one of my Swedish friends, takes the Danish more time than any other group of children in the world to learn their native language.

It’s Monday, the start of a new week. Nat and I are both working at our desks, which at this moment is a small wooden kitchen table in our Airbnb in Vesterbro. The sun is shining into the living room after a split second downpour — after less than two days here we’ve already come to understand this is totally normal. Not your typical tropical rainstorm, but a charismatic part of the city I’ve embraced rather quickly. Ask me again in a couple of weeks…
We arrived on Saturday evening. After meeting our Airbnb host, who was very friendly and helpful, we unpacked quickly into our home for the next 3 weeks and took advantage of the late-setting sun to wander around our neighborhood. Copenhagen hasn’t been short of hubbub since we landed: Saturday was the Pride Parade; Rapha Nocturne, a nighttime cycling race ironically hosted in London for the past 10 years, was set up a few blocks away; and IRONMAN had its triathlon all throughout the city yesterday. We made our way through the liveliness to explore what Vesterbro had to offer, with the not-too-distant goal of finding a place for dinner, too.
The main street was decorated with rainbow leaflets and cutouts from the Parade, but ultimately, pretty desert when compared with the West Village in New York in June. To be fair, Pride in Copenhagen is a full 5-day event including open-air concerts, Drag Night and After-Pride Chill Out… no need for post-Parade rowdiness, even if it is a Saturday night. We walked by a few cool-looking bars and restaurants... lots of starring on our Google Maps for future ventures… and got drawn to a place called Madklubben for dinner.
There was a huge line outside — a large group of ladies waiting to get seated — which, as my Dad always says, is always a good sign a place is worth trying (not the ladies, but the line…). We waited at the bar for a table and got served by two very suave, attractive Danish men, shaking their shakers in unison and making stoic yet flirtatious conversation with the single New Yorker sitting next to us. Nat got a beer.
Dinner was delicious, though the stools not too comfortable. Guess that’s what you get when you go to a “minimal spot for unfussy dining” (quote from Google).
Next stop: a drink! It was Saturday night after all. We tried a speakeasy called Duck & Cover but they had no space — not packed, just full. Another night, perhaps. Instead, we headed to CURFEW, which had the coolest signpost at the entrance. A horizontal cutout with a light shining through, projecting the bar’s name on the wall. And a spider, fairly large, dangled comfortably. We almost believed it was fake.
Is this day zero? I asked Nat, not wanting to give up our first day so soon.
Nat ordered one of CURFEW’s award-winning drinks — key ingredients: Tanqueray gin, tarragon and mango — and I went for a refreshing alcohol-free fizz. Big mistake. Nat likes to say I’m a cheap date because I don’t like to drink, but considering how delicious this Little Dragon was, my new theory is I take only the best.
The vibe was perfect. 1920s Prohibition style, matching music, bartenders in suspenders… Nat and I didn’t even talk, we just enjoyed the moment.
The next day, it’s really day one. Or day two… I haven’t decided yet. We rented bikes — the only way to travel in Copenhagen — and Nat mapped out a whole itinerary for us. Christiansborg Palace, Rundetaarn, Botanic Gardens… today, we’re tourists, not just digital nomads. We ate lunch at Torvehallerne and biked to Kastellet, a 17th-century fortress on a star-shaped island. It seemed like anywhere we biked, another beautiful palace, church or building was there, waiting for us. This city is just stunning.

The surprising thing is we’ve adjusted so quickly. 48 hours in, we feel like we know our neighborhood decently well; we’ve gone to and made friends at our first CrossFit class at Butcher’s Lab; we’ve cooked our first meal and slept the best couple of nights we’ve had in weeks. As this first work day comes to a close, I’ve finally settled on a name for my poetry project, Midnight Plume (you’ll notice the first sneak peek in this post). I’ll properly launch it this week. I hope you’ll follow along… it’s quite personal and something I’ve thought of doing for quite some time. I’m so excited to finally share it.
And while I’m not yet sure how this travel blog will take shape, this hereby concludes my first post. I’m sure I’ll include more places and spaces we’ve seen and loved, and I hope to dive more into the feelings and questions intrinsic to this adventure. Thanks for reading, and see you soon! ***

In the last two years running has occupied a great place in his life. All this time, I slowly, slowly walked the small steps to the next goal — to run a marathon.
Preparation began in the farthest February: I trained and participated in competitions that interested me. But he tried to plan his running calendar for 2019 so that the peak of training and running occurred in April and early May. And so it turned out: at this time I ran three half marathons (Poznan, Slavutych and Białystok), one run in Brovary 11 km and 30 km. in Kharkov. The latter was important before the marathon, as he had to show how my body would respond to heavy loads.
Although at first I wanted to stop at the Prague Marathon, but its start coincided with the Bialystok Half Marathon. The problem was that this year he decided to run the “Crowns of Polish Half Marathons” and the “Bialystok Half Marathon” was on the list of this series. After thinking about the month, he preferred the Bialystok Half Marathon over the Prague Marathon.
Two Scandinavian marathons in Stockholm and Copenhagen caught my attention. Having long wanted to visit Denmark, I stopped at the Copenhagen Marathon. He also started 40 times and had an interesting route.
You can register for the marathon on the marathon page: http://cphmarathon.com. There you had to fill in your details (name and name; country; contact details; if there was experience in marathons, approximate time for which you were going to run 42 km). You could also choose the size of a T-shirt. After paying the starting fee, the system automatically assigns a starting number. The marathon route was held in one circle by the central and surrounding streets of Copenhagen, passing by the main architectural monuments of the Danish capital.
Ancient packages can be banned on Friday, Saturday and Sunday before the marathon starts.
After paying for the starting number, getting acquainted with the route of the marathon, it is time to plan the trip itself, that is, buy airline tickets and book accommodation. I decided to fly to Copenhagen on Friday night to have a free Saturday and get to know the city a bit, visit the Sport Expo and pick up the starter pack in advance.
Arriving in Copenhagen on Friday evening, my route ran from the airport to my place of residence, and at the same time enjoyed a stroll in Copenhagen in the evening.
The main task of Saturday was to find the starting number, so I followed him in the morning. The extradition took place at the Sparta Hallen Sports Complex, which also hosted the Sport Expo, Kids Running. To get the desired starter pack, you need to have a passport and a certificate from the participant who came to the mail after registering for the marathon.
The first half of Saturday came with the launch pack and the Sport Expo. The latter is well organized: in addition to the usual sports goods and equipment, there was a lot of interesting information about various marathons in the world.
After the preparation for the marathon was over, it was time for a walk in the city, a little evening jog and rest before the marathon.
I decided to run the marathon only with water and isotonics without gels, so in the evening I bought them at a local supermarket.
Sunday morning was good weather. Especially in the morning when the sky above the city was overcast and everything was indicating possible rain. This could not but rejoice, because in the heat did not really want to run.
The starting town is spread out on the waterfront on the island of Bruges. Immediately it was possible to use the cameras, get the start numbers, change clothes. In the morning, the runners began to gather here, the closer they got to the start, the more and more they became. Someone dressed up, someone kneaded before the marathon, and someone admired the views of Copenhagen, which opened from the waterfront.
All marathon participants were divided into sectors according to their time of running the marathon. The marathon runner could choose his own time before the start, unlike the Polish races, where the participant must start in the group that he chose at registration. The starting numbers were all the same and not divided into sectors by color. And the runner himself before the start chose in which sector and for what time he wants to run.
The marathon started at 9:30. The participants gradually started to run one solid mass, which again was not very convenient at the beginning of the marathon. For myself, I chose place-holders for 4 hours 10 minutes and tried to hold on to them.
The first half of the marathon was easy enough, it ran comfortably. First, the route is almost flat, with only a few climbs. Secondly, it was overcast, starting to get clear by 12 noon.
He used the hydration points constantly as soon as he met them on his way. The first part of the marathon I tried to hold on to the placemakers. In 2 hours 2 minutes I overcame the first half of the track. The movement to the finish went well. The second part of the marathon started under a very beautiful arch, informing the runners that half the distance had been passed.
The next psychological boundary after the 21 km mark was 19 miles for me. Why this mark? Mainly due to the fact that I had already overcome the 30 km distance during the Easter run in Kharkiv and knew the approximate time of its passage and that I would not encounter any problems in overcoming this distance.
One of the main tests besides the 42 km mark itself, the physical and psychological strain was a 15-mile climb to the trestle. Psychology has played even more here. The experience gained during the same “Kharkiv Half Marathon” became relevant when you just ran down one hill and you were already waiting for a descent and a new one. Another such rise was not very much wanted to overcome on its way.
I overcame the second psychological mark of 19 miles in 3 hours and 10 minutes, which again is good — in Copenhagen I spent 1 minute longer than in Kharkiv. Running towards the finish line was in the planned rhythm. The distance was 4:10–4:20 because one hour would be enough to cover 7 miles of the route. Although these are all theoretical calculations that do not always coincide with what is happening in practice. The closer I was to the finish line, the more I met on the sidelines of the runners, whose parameters were brought back to normal, and the slower I started to run.
The last 7 miles could already be described as running from one hydration station to another, where you could drink a little water, isotonics, and some to eat a banana or orange. It was a little distracting from fatigue. For those 7 miles, I stuffed everything I had just encountered along the way: from the Danes’ pizza to redbull. At about 39–40 km I began to save power, although it was difficult to find them here, which would make the last dash that would have taken me over the finish line.
A preliminary detail about the runners was in store for a surprise: a minor row on the bridge. When he appeared on the horizon, in the main sense the thought was: “it does not fit, although it is small, but I do not want to draw”. the last test, after using the descent and the finish line.
There were fans on the side of the road, adding strength to the run. From this atmosphere and the thought that even a little more and you will see the cherished word “Finish”, the forces do not understand where they came from.
After 4 hours 48 minutes of running and overcoming 42 km of my feet, I was still brought to the coveted arch with the inscription “Finish”. There I was waiting for the restoration of strength with delicious fruits, hot chocolate, cola, pastries. And most importantly — it was possible to take a breath and already nowhere to escape.
My first marathon fully met all expectations. He presented wonderful emotions, both from the run itself and from the atmosphere that dominated it. It was extremely nice to run near the Embassy of Ukraine in Denmark, where there were Ukrainians. The hometown flag is especially inspiring in the second round, when you are already exhausted and looking for some positive things to move on. A very well thought out route along the main architectural monuments of Copenhagen, the whole route is accompanied by fierce support of residents and visitors of the city. After the finish, there are a lot of different flavors for everyone to recover, as well as massages and showers. The task for this marathon was first and foremost to run it without injury so that it would not be the last.
In the beginning, I wanted to run better and finish in the range of 4:10–4:20, but in the process it goes to the background and the bar is already reduced to 5 hours — the main thing that would be no injury.
The Copenhagen Marathon has taken management to a new level of development as a runner, so in the last northern year marathons will take their place in my two main calendars.

an artist, a brewery, a restaurant
I’ve spared you the gory details on most of my other museum visits, but I have to write a little about Olafur Eliasson’s installation Riverbed at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art (located about 30 minutes outside of Copenhagen by train) because Eliasson is one of my favorite artists. Earlier on my trip I saw his Turner color studies at the Tate Britain — painted perfect gradients of colors sourced from famous J.M.W Turner paintings onto donut-shaped canvasses. But before Riverbed, I’d never seen an installation by Eliasson. He makes a lot of different types of art, but his installations are what he’s best known for.
Riverbed is, on its face, very simple. You walk down a hallway with boardwalk flooring into a typical museum art gallery. White walls, well lit, etc. The floor in the gallery, however, has been transformed into a virtual riverbed, covered with smooth stones of various size. An actual trickle of water running through the whole thing, cascading down the steeper bits of rocks where there are stairs. And it’s not just a layer of gravel that’s been thrown down; the floor has significant topography, and seems to ignore the walls and doorways of the gallery space.
There’s no designated path through the landscape, you just kind of wander until reaching a reading room at the end, at which point you must turn around and exit the way you came in. It’s natural but very sparse, much like the photographs of Iceland Eliasson published in a new book also debuted at the exhibit. Perhaps more than anything, this exhibit made me really want to go to Iceland sometime.
It’s art that’s participatory and immersive; as a visitor you are part of it, and it’s all around you. It’s not confined behind proximity sensors or crowds of people; you literally get to walk all over it.
I also think the practice of creating simulated nature inside an art museum space is interesting. You can look at it as a sly middle finger to stuffy gallery spaces, or a statement that natural beauty deserves to be examined with the scrutiny that manmade art is. Or maybe it’s just meant to be a meditative spot. In an interview about the piece, Eliasson said “It’s about exposing yourself to time, to things taking time. The walking is time unfolded.”
Personally, I did find it to be meditative. It’s funny how just putting something inside a museum makes you pay more attention to it than you might otherwise. Writing about it now, after my trip is over, I still remember the feeling and sound of walking over the layer of rocks, and watching others do the same. Eliasson’s first exhibition at MoMA was titled Take Your Time, and you get the feeling that’s what he wants you to do here too.
Still, I get that it’s not for everybody. I heard somebody upon reaching the end say “That’s it?” Some of his installations deal more with doing impressive things with light, mirrors, color, and haze. I would love to see some of those too, but I thought Riverbed was pretty cool.
Also in the museum was a theater showing some of Eliasson’s films and, and one of my favorite parts, a “model room”. The model room is essentially a table covered with hacked-together bits of wire, 3D-printed plastic, foam core, and other materials. It’s rare to see an exhibit focus so much on process and intermediate products, and I love seeing that stuff. It reminds you that works don’t just get conjured out of nothing, and gives you a peek into what the tables at Eliasson’s large Berlin studio must look like.
I highly recommend exploring some of the stuff he’s done using “Your uncertain archive” on his website. Even if you’re not interested in Eliasson, it’s a really cool piece of web design.
OK. So I’m done gushing about an artist. Time to gush about something else. I have also spared you the gory details of food and beer I’ve had on my trip thus far, but this place also requires an exception to be made.
The first time I ever heard about Mikkeller, I was with friends at the excellent Northdown Tavern in Chicago. After a couple drinks, our probably drunk bartender leaned in and started speaking in a hushed tone. “Listen. You guys wanna try some really good shit?”
Of course we did. He brought out a fantastic beer by Evil Twin Brewing (Imperial Biscotti Break Natale — Pretty Please With A Cherry On Top, for all the beer nerds out there) and mentioned that the brewery was called Evil Twin because the guy was the twin brother of the guy who started Mikkeller. “Between the two of them,” he said, “they’re making some of the best beer in the world.” In my experience thus far, he’s right.
A couple days into my Copenhagen visit I remembered that Mikkeller was based in Copenhagen. While I couldn’t find any sort of brewery tour type of thing, they do have a few bars sprinkled around the city, and a new restaurant that specializes in smørrebrød– Danish open-faced sandwiches. I was sold.
The place is called Øl & Brød (pronounced oel og broed… yeah, good luck with that), aka “beer & bread”. The interior is very hip– extremely well decorated, with an almost comically meticulous table setting and Scandinavian rock played over the speaker at the host’s podium. In addition to having several taps of delicious beer from Mikkeller and others, they also have the most extensive Akvavit (a spiced Scandinavian liquor) list of any bar in Northern Europe. Didn’t get around to sampling any of that though.
I wanted to get a real Danish delicacy, so I went for the pickled herring sandwich which was topped with fennel, cabbage, apples, and onions in various states (pickled, grilled, raw) and aioli, piled on top of a slice of very dense, dark rye bread. I took the menu’s recommendation (it has beer pairings for everything they sell) and got a glass of Boon unblended lambic beer to go with it. You’ll hear more about lambics when I write about Belgium, but the way they’re brewed makes them tart or even sour, which was perfect for complimenting the pickled bits of the sandwich and cutting through the creamy/oily bits.
After the meal I walked next door to the Mikkeller bar, tried a few tasters of beer, and talked with a pilot from Phoenix, AZ who was stopping by on his day off. Beer nerddom, like any nerddom, is great for making quick connections while abroad.
Needless to say, if you’re ever in Copenhagen you need to give this place a look for lunch. It’s a little pricier than just going to a kebab place or something, but it’s still reasonable (for Denmark) and entirely worth it. One of the best meals of my trip. And if you’re not going to Copenhagen any time soon, keep an eye out for Evil Twin or Mikkeller beer at your local bar or liquor store. Be sure to read the labels; both breweries have excellent senses of humor.
Just as a reminder, I’m choosing to write about favorite spots and stories in each city I visited as opposed to major attractions which you can read about in any guidebook. Yes, I visited Christiania and the Nationalmuseet and the Little Mermaid statue and all that. If you want to hear more detail about my trip, just talk to me ☺

Two cities I have not visited--Copenhagen and Tokyo--and you've given me a beautiful glimpse of both. And, you've made me hungry. That onigiri looks and sounds wonderful. I think that fusion with smoked salmon would be delicious. Thank you for a wonderful article.

In November 1981, having lived in West Berlin for four months, I was given the unexpected privilege of having four days off from my job at the Hotel Schweizerhof. I was ready for an adventure and gave careful consideration regarding where I should spend the days.
Paris was too far away, a fourteen-hour train trip. It took very long to get anywhere in Western Europe from the walled-in city that was closer in distance to Poland than it was to West Germany. A co-worker told me it was possible to go to Copenhagen directly from East Berlin. Not only was it a much shorter trip than going through West Germany, but it was also significantly cheaper.
I didn’t need much time to think it over. I was going to spend my little vacation in Copenhagen.
I went through the always intimidating checkpoint at the Friedrichstrasse station in East Berlin and procured a transit visa. This was a rather routine affair and didn’t require the complicated application process for obtaining a tourist visa. I had not even considered spending my holiday in East Germany, the nearest country. Ironically, that’s what I would end up doing.
I was excited as the train pulled out of the East Berlin station and headed north toward the Baltic Sea. By the time we reached Warnemuende, the seaside town from where the ferry would cross to Denmark, darkness had already descended.
There were not many passengers heading for the ferry terminal, perhaps fifty or sixty, and all appeared to be Westerners. Of course, that is not surprising considering the fact that East Germans were generally prohibited from traveling to Western countries.
The train soon pulled out of the station and headed back to East Berlin. Meanwhile, I gathered with my fellow ferry passengers in the terminal. I immediately had the sense that something wasn’t quite right. I looked out on the dock and didn’t see a ferry.
My ears picked up someone speaking English and I gravitated to that voice. It belonged to a young South African, who I later learned was heading to Copenhagen to spend a semester at the university there. He was speaking with a Danish couple.
They told me the ferry was delayed because it couldn’t make the crossing safely in the stormy sea. I never even thought about weather conditions. In my mind, I pictured a serene sea and a calm, relaxing three-hour crossing. The news that the sea was not at all as I imagined made me worried. I am not a sea-faring person. I always prefer to have my traveling feet on solid ground, or at least on reliable tracks. I have given in to air travel as an unavoidable necessity.
The Danish couple made inquiries and then informed us that it was unlikely the ferry would be arriving that night.
My initial reaction was relief. I wouldn’t have to face a multi-hour ferry crossing on a stormy sea. Always the optimist, I assumed the storm would subside during the night and the next day the sea would be calm, and we would be able to make the crossing under a blue sky, basking in the autumn sunlight. Okay, I was waxing poetic in my mind and not being particularly realistic. I was shaping the adventure I wanted to have.
There wasn’t much we could do. I was realistic enough not to expect the East German terminal police to provide us with mattresses and blankets. People grabbed the few chairs that were around, but most of us had to make do with the hard floor.
Needless to say, it was not a restful sleep. In fact, I doubt that I dozed off for more than a few minutes.
We were stirred awake by a not very cheerful “Guten Morgen” (Good Morning) and informed that we had the opportunity of purchasing East German marks (currency) so that we could have breakfast if we wished. Of course that would be at the one-to-one ratio that East Germany maintained was the true value of their money, when in reality it was about six East marks for one West mark. But who would be foolish enough to argue with them? I was hungry and didn’t really mind.
I stayed close to Dennis the South African, and the Danish couple in order to get the latest information about when the ferry would be arriving. I looked outside and was disappointed that my fantasy image didn’t appear to be manifesting. The sea was gray and stormy.
The couple was not about to spend the whole day waiting for a ferry that may or may not come. They had an alternative plan. They informed Dennis and me that there was another ferry, a very reliable one, that sailed from Sassnitz, a town in the far eastern part of East Germany. This ferry, however, didn’t go to Denmark but rather to Sweden. It would then be fairly easy to cross over to Denmark.
The couple walked up to the terminal police and indicated their plan to travel to Sassnitz. Watching from a distance, I could see that the police did not like the idea, probably because we didn’t have tourist visas for traveling around East Germany. We all just had transit visas for the route we were on.
But the couple was not going to be dissuaded and somehow got permission to leave for Sassnitz. Dennis decided to join them. I elected to as well. I didn’t want to spend most of my four-day trip in a ferry terminal. I thought it would be an unexpected adventure to travel across the northern region of East Germany and end up a stone’s throw from Poland.
A few hours later, the four of us boarded a train for the journey east. I soon realized that train travel in East Germany is laboriously slow. The tracks were obviously not in great shape. But I really wasn’t in a hurry. I had nearly forgotten about my original destination and now embraced the unexpected change my journey had taken.
We were on a local train route and made innumerable stops at small, dilapidated stations. In between the stations was a very pleasant countryside, fields and farms with an occasional small lake.
I was aware that we were attracting attention from the other passengers. Many of them, living so far from the capital city, East Berlin, probably never heard English spoken and it was unlikely that they ever encountered Westerners.
I wondered if the East German passengers were looking at us with envy that we had so much more material wealth than they did. Or perhaps they were expressing disapproval of us as decadent capitalists. German facial expressions are difficult to interpret.
It was already late afternoon when we saw in the distance a beautiful old town with a soaring steeple. The November light cast a soft golden haze over it. For some reason, the train was not stopping there. My companions told me it was Stralsund, one of the historic Hanseatic towns on the Baltic Sea. They heard that it had a well-preserved medieval center. I made a mental note of it for a future journey.
At last, we arrived at our destination. Although we were close to Poland there was no border crossing nearby. Sassnitz was more like a village than a town. But it was from this out-of-the-way location, at the eastern extremity of East Germany that the reported reliable ferry would be departing for Sweden. We easily found the tiny terminal and there was in fact a ferry there.
My fellow travelers were excited and walked immediately to the ticket booth to purchase a ticket. I stood back and gave some thought to whether I would join them. I looked at the sea. While it was not as stormy as it had been at the other location, it nevertheless did not match my ideal of calmness. It would also be a much longer crossing than with the other ferry. For Sweden was quite far from East Germany. I only had two days left of my allotted time off. I would arrive in Denmark just in time to depart.
That might not have dissuaded me from continuing on with the others, however; what really convinced me not to go was the sea crossing. The prospect of a long, rough crossing on an unpredictable sea was not inviting. I thus bid farewell to my companions as they prepared to board the ship.
I walked to the little train station and purchased a ticket to East Berlin.
I seemed to be the only one boarding the night train to Berlin. I had the compartment all to myself. It was going to be a six-hour journey. I stretched out and rested but didn’t fall asleep. I was waiting for the conductor to come in and check my ticket. But no one came. I wondered if it was just me and the train engineer on the train. I heard no footsteps and no one boarded or disembarked from the train at each stop.
We arrived in East Berlin at half past four in the morning. I walked up to the entrance to the intimidating maze of mirrors and glass partitions that constituted the Kafkaesque passport control office that one needed to navigate in order to enter West Berlin. But it was closed.
It would open in one hour. I didn’t know where to wait. Not a single person was around. I didn’t want to simply stand there for an hour. So, I walked outside into the deathly still nighttime city center.
As I walked up dark, deserted Friedrichstrasse, I didn’t feel so much afraid, as I would have been on the streets of any American city at that hour. But I felt rather nervous because I was there illegally. I had no tourist visa and thus shouldn’t be strolling around the city. Fortunately, I encountered no uniformed agent. It was eerily silent. After walking back and forth along the street, I returned to the border crossing office.
At exactly half past five, the gate opened, the lights came on. I was the first and only customer. I promptly walked up to the glass partition and handed the agent my passport. He saw the transit visa issued three days earlier. He clearly was not pleased.
Still holding on to my passport, he walked away and spoke with other agents who were standing around with nothing to do. He returned and gestured me into an open area where I was soon surrounded by seven or eight border police agents. I was told to sit down on a chair that was in the middle of the area. The police gathered around me.
In normal circumstances, I would have been nervous finding myself in this situation. But I was exhausted, having hardly slept the last two nights, and so I was rather calm. I felt very American at that moment, thinking what are they going to do to an American citizen? Thank you red, white, and blue.
Then the questioning began. Fortunately, they spoke slowly and clearly so I could understand most but not all of what they were saying. I was having some difficulty responding in German and generously sprinkled my sentences with English words. I understood what the problem was. It was now my third day in the German Democratic Republic but I didn’t have a tourist visa. All I had was a transit visa issued three days before. They wanted to know exactly where I had been during all that time.
I managed to give them an account using increasingly more English words. They seemed to understand, or at least some of them did. While they noted that I spent the previous night on the train, they were perplexed about where I had been the night before. I proudly informed them that I spent it on the floor of the ferry terminal in Warnemuende.
This was apparently shocking for them to hear. I then added a bit cheekily that it wasn’t very comfortable accommodations.
That seemed to do the trick. They were not about to prompt another flare-up in the Cold War. I was allowed to re-enter West Berlin without any further delay.
I soon breathed the not particularly fresh air of freedom in West Berlin and headed back to my furnished room. I actually wasn’t disappointed that I never made it to Copenhagen. My unexpected adventure behind the Iron Curtain proved to be highly memorable.
My heartfelt thanks to Darren Weir for his editing suggestions and assistance with the photos.

Jebiga…
This is a pretty often word used by myself: Filip Malek, a 22 year old Software Development student, part time full stack web developer and a part homeless student from Croatia.
Let me give you a little back story and the reason of writing this article. It all started many, many, many years ago when I was a little angry, 6th grade rebellious kid who preferred running through forests playing airsoft, spending every single dime on surplus military equipment rather then spending time with his peers and doing all the usual shit that kids do at that age.
Why?
Its simple — I just couldn’t do what all the others did… It just didn’t make sense. I hated the idea of following trends and being just another fish in the sea following the usual everyday routines.
Why am I telling you all this?
Well, because going to the country you have never been to, with very limited financial resources, to a accommodation you have no clue is any good, without knowing anybody there that could help you out and if that isn’t good enough — flying for the first time in your life (if we ignore flying when I was 5 years old) — requires some serious guts, or craziness, or both…
The reason I opted for ‘Living in Copenhagen’ as the name of this article is because its just that — living, not studying.
There’s so much more to just studying in Copenhagen.
You don’t come here to study, you come here for a whole package. All the good things,bad things, headaches, relationships (both love and friendships)...
Studying in Denmark is very much different from, for example, studying in England or at the campus in the ‘states’. There you have a dorm room that you can live in as long as you study which is not really the case in Denmark. Of course there are dorms here but nobody is gonna find them for you and waiting lists for the bad ones are up to 12 months… It is completely up to you to find accommodation and even though you might get tips from school or others, it is still very, very hard.
You might be getting a hint on what I’m aiming with this article. No, it’s not the fact that finding a room/apartment in Copenhagen area is a living hell or that the weather is pretty sh**** or, in fact, that jobs you will do when you start off are pretty sh**** as well.
It’s just one man’s observation on the fact that life is HARD! And trying to start off in a country such as Denmark isn’t the easiest thing in the world and you won’t be padded on your back nor congratulated on every step of the way.
It is just a wake up call and a slap in the face from the life itself. You see, life is a tragedy, we can’t argue that. Ancient Greeks knew it way back when life was much simpler. Jordan Peterson wrote about it in his book “12 rules for life” — which I definitely recommend by the way! We just have to make sense of it all if we were to survive and live a meaningful life. To set of in a world at the age of 19 with circumstances that I had was a bold move and still, 3 years later, I am not comfortable enough to look at myself and say that there is no work left and let alone sit back and relax.
But I did actually kinda relax. I was living the life. Living super close to city center in my own place (I sublet a room with its own kitchen, toilet and separate entrance in a much bigger apartment), working was just 5 mins away and school barely 7, hitting the gym often and just being happy. I was super lucky to get that place. After being kicked out and having to crash at a friends sofa for a few days I got contacted by a lovely woman who offered me the room. That just doesn’t happen in Copenhagen. Usual practice is to send 10 messages a day to landlords looking for tenants and hope that after a few weeks you get invited for an open house. I knew that this doesn’t just happen and I treated it as such.I respected the rules and I decorated the place to my own taste. Bought a black board to note shit down (always wanted one), put Star Wars posters all around, old Copenhagen Tuborg commercial posters, Copenhagen Street Food memorabilia (used to work there for 2 years). Made a hygge corner (google it) with candles and stuff… It was a really nice place and I felt at home there.
Then life decided to happen…
On 1st of May there was a some plumbing work being done in my building so they cut off the water from 0700 to 1700. My upstairs neighbors did a small mistake that led me to being kicked out again… Don’t get me wrong, they are generally nice people. I don’t know them that much though. Small talk is considered awkward and you can really see a Dane not enjoying it if you don’t know him well, that is. So I didn’t talk to them. Except saying “Hello” when I saw them in the stairwell or “Tak” (danish for thank you) when they held the door for me or vice versa. All I knew is that they were a couple with two small kids. On 1st of May — when plumbers were plumbing away — their kid left the faucet open and around 1500 — when they connected the water back on — it started to flood everything… At least that’s what they told me. I am not blaming the kid (even though, technically it is his fault). He is just a kid after all. Maybe plumbers messed up when they turned the water on too early… I came home from work only to see my room being completely wet and water dripping form the ceiling. To be honest I wasn’t angry or anything. I just wanted to go to the gym. I even bough a Ultra White Monster and a Reese's bar. I waited until they shut down the water but didn’t want to wait for repair man to come so I told my landlord that I will be going to the gym. She was okay with that as there was little to nothing that I could do. Few days after insurance company came and said that I will have to move out along with all of my stuff until latest August. I was speechless, to way the least… By then, the damage should have been fixed.
This was 5th time that I was moving in almost 3 years of being in Denmark and I definitely wasn’t happy about it.
Then life showed its beautiful side and I stumbled upon a room 25 km from Copenhagen until my place gets fixed. My cousin met a Danish girl in Bulgaria on some kind of student event. Her parents have a house in Kokkedal (district somewhat close to Copenhagen) that they rent out to students and turns out that they had one room free just for me (rhyme is on purpose here :) ). I took it without too much thought. I am still extremely grateful to these wonderful people because without them, I am not sure what would have happened.
In the time of writing this article I am still living there. Three months have passed and repairs are only 50% done and I don’t know how long will it take them to finish but I at least hope to move back in once it is done.
I guess that at the end of the day this is life. Sometimes good things happen and sometimes bad things happen. You might get 10 bad things happen and then only one good thing or vice versa. Only logical thing to do is — and I quote great Jordan Peterson — to “Stand up straight with your shoulders back” and take it like a man.
Wining and complaining never helped anybody anyway…

Facing Copenhagen City Hall across the street, Tivoli is the second-oldest amusement park in the world. I hold a special affection for it, because two same-sex partners in one of my favorite pioneering Chinese LGBTQ novels, Beijing Story (later adapted into the well-known film Lan Yu), bought a house in the suburbs of Beijing and named it Tivoli, hoping it could be as dreamy as the amusement park since they couldn’t be openly together in the city.
Tivoli became not only a shelter for them but also a haven where they could express and nurture their love. Many years have passed, yet we still need and yearn for such a place in reality.
I couldn’t hold back my excitement and took a quick look at Tivoli in the cold wind before running to catch up with my friend into Copenhagen City Hall.
My friend, K, walked ahead, glancing back repeatedly to check the wedding veil pinned to her shoulder, fearing it might fall. Her wedding with another girl, J, was to be held at City Hall in just half an hour. Two Chinese girls, getting married in a foreign country far from home.
The quiet and solemn City Hall was carefully decorated, with rainbow flags hanging in mid-air, rainbow stickers on the…

By the time we got to Femøren metro stop the wind had picked up and the rain was lashing down. More inappropriate weather for a sea swim you couldn’t imagine. But it would take a bold — and rash — person to stand between me and a swimming adventure and so we pressed on, holding umbrellas horizontal, like shields in battle against the driving rain.
Half an hour previously, scurrying from the warmth of our cosy hotel to the metro station, we had had a tiff about umbrellas. Between us, you thought that one small black collapsible umbrella was not enough: it was raining, windy and miserable. You wanted me to shelter under the brolly beside you and and I didn’t want to pin myself to you to keep dry. I don’t care for umbrellas. I prefer getting wet and bedraggled to the fuss and bother of an umbrella. My protestations of “Look, I’m waterproof!” and “I’m not cold! I don’t mind getting a little wet!” didn’t convince you. It made you feel ungallant, you said.
“What if it’s really rainy when we get to the other end and there is a long walk?!” you wailed, persuading me to let you go and buy a second umbrella.
Thank goodness for the second umbrella, I had to concede. It was much worse by the time we got off the metro. A less determined expedition would have turned back. Instead, we pressed on. I was going to have my swim. We skirted through an industrial estate, crossed 4 lanes of traffic, and squelched our way across the sodden and marshy grass of a park because it seemed marginally quicker than the pathway. Anything to get out of the driving rain.
I’d seen pictures of Kastrup Sea Bath in glossy design and architecture magazines. It looked beautiful: an elegant curved wooden construction, warmed and weathered, at the end of a long jetty, where locals can swim, sunbathe and dive, sheltered from the elements.
On a day like today there were no swimmers, sunbathers, no hanger-outers. Not a soul. It looked beautifully desolate, forlorn, slightly spooky. The usually silvered wooden timbers were black and sodden with rain. The planks looked more like the snaggle-toothed weathered boards of a wrecked ship than a haven. There was nobody around. Had they all abandoned ship?
We walked out along the jetty to investigate more closely, I had a sense of foreboding. I hoped it might appear more inviting close up, but it felt just as bleak. Doors to changing rooms were locked, it felt like the world had left for the summer and well and truly locked up on the way out.
We decided, I decided, that a swim from the shore, from the beach, might be more prudent. We walked back along the jetty to the beach and found a large spartan changing room nearby and stripped off.
As we stood in our swimming gear on a cold autumn day, in the rain, in the middle of nowhere, slightly hysterical, miles from civilisation, a middle aged woman rode up noncholantly on a bike. Seemingly unphased by the vile weather, she leaned her bike against a wall, and walked along the jetty to the sea baths. The lifeguard had arrived! As we watched from the beach she wandered around the sea baths unlocking doors and settling in for a quiet day at the office. I felt more reassured by her arrival.
Back to the reason we’d come. We tiptoed into the water. Sand underfoot. Wincing. Cold. My feet hurt. Undeterred I waded in deeper, reasoning that being under the water would somehow would be warmer, because I’d be out of the wretched wind. You let the water dance across your thighs, and then turned back, not as convinced by the beauty of the cold as I was.
Emboldened by the presence of another human being who might be able to help if something went wrong (what would go wrong?!) I headed out from the shore. Breastsroke at first — to take in the view — and then front crawl. Out past the edge of the sand into an area of tall seaweed beds. I tasted the water — it was suprisingly unsalty. Is it the sea? Or a river to the sea?
Becoming bolder, I headed further out — swimming alongside the jetty, with little choppy waves to slap me as I went. Arriving soon at the haven of the wooden platform I was greeted by the lifeguard, a middle aged Danish woman, smoking a cigarette, wrapped up against the weather. As I treaded water, we smiled and said hello. “14.5C” she offered, unprompted, with a friendly smile. The international language of swimmers. Would she swim, I asked? Perhaps. How many people would swim today? About five to six.
Then I saw you wandering back along the jetty, in only your trunks, to join us.
And there we were, the three of us, chatting away: one fully clothed and bundled against the cold, one standing half naked in the wind, and one bobbing about in the water. On a swimming platform, out to sea, in the wind and rain. Oh Copenhagen. What better way to experience a place than to be right there, surrounded by it. Inside it.

The whole idea of moving from Brno to Copenhagen came to my mind sometime around November 2015. The main reason for me was that I had already completed the majority of design classes at my university in Brno and I was struggling with math and algorithm classes. I didn’t want to spend 2 more years studying calculus day and night and shifting my focus away from design. So I started researching schools around Europe. I looked for the ones focused mainly on design and suitable for me to continue my studies. From all the schools I looked at, I found the best fit in the Copenhagen School of Design and Technology, where I eventually applied. I had to wait until the 1st of July to see whether I am accepted or not. Luckily I passed the admission process and I could continue my studies in Denmark. It sounds quite effortless now but I was terrified at the time. I had just landed a great job heading the Edookit design team and I was also involved in a number of my own freelance projects. Yet I took advantage of the opportunity and with all the projects in mind I moved to the capital of Denmark.
After a few months of living here, I have to say it was a good decision. I managed to keep my work at Edookit as well as my work on private projects (such as this blog). Living in a completely different country and working for a company based in Brno taught me how to manage my time well. I have already detailed my time management routines in a previous article.
The city itself is undisputably stunning. Colourful buildings, huge parks and bikes everywhere. The history of Copenhagen is rich, yet the city maintains a modern feel. I am a big fan of the bike culture, I still cannot imagine a single day here without my double-wheeled friend. The year of 2016 was the first year in history when there were more bikes in this city than cars. Coming from Brno, where you can easily be killed when riding a bike, Copenhagen feels like heaven. Overall the bike infrastructure is very developed with futuristic bike bridges over canals and self-driven metro. All of this is supported by city train lines called S-trains which go up to 40 km/h from the city centre in each direction. I was using the B-line of the S-train often because I lived in a nearby suburb town of Taastrup.
I fell in love with this town and the house I have lived in and as I said to my landlord, it will always remain a great part of my life. Taastrup is a quite small town inhabited mostly by families and made beautiful by the pristine nature surrounding it. A lot of different opportunities for running, huge shopping centre called City 2 and a lot of Danish architecture. The main squares are full of traditional shops, which are maintained by people who spent their entire lives developing their skills. Quiet, inspirational and friendly — the best place for a creative person to live in.
Studying at KEA (Copenhagen School of Design and Technology) taught me a lot that I could immediately utilize in my actual work. The school puts emphasis on research as well as on pitching ideas. I also wrote an article about one of the projects we did as an assignment for a new museum in Copenhagen.
I knew that research is a crucial part of UX design and design in general but until I became involved in research at KEA, I think I hadn’t thought about it quite as deeply as I perhaps should have. Leaving my comfort zone, talking to users and consumers and creating new design processes are only a fraction of what I have learned here. I have had the opportunity to work on our school projects with many talented designers, who were already able to achieve so much in their lives and some of them are already members of teams working on projects with worldwide impact. I am thankful for getting to know them and being inspired by them to learn even more about design and continue working towards my goals.
I was lucky enough to get a place in a minor, semester-long program, which is focused in particular on digital product design. I wanted to get a place there badly, as this program could really help me understand the work I do even more and teach me a lot about designing experiences. After spending a semester focusing on research and theory of design, I am looking forward to coding and high fidelity design. And so I have to move again and leave Copenhagen. After Christmas spent in Slovakia with my family and friends, I will spend most of January in Brno at Edookit headquarters preparing my work for the next couple of months and then move to Amsterdam, starting the next chapter of my life.

Copenhagen Food: A Tasty Tour of the Danish Capital’s Culinary Delights,https://denmarkinnewyork.medium.com/copenhagen-food-a-tasty-tour-of-the-danish-capitals-culinary-delights-473a0eb80461,"Sign up

A new cookbook revealing the hidden gems of Copenhagen cuisine is set to take American readers by storm later this month as Trine Hahnemann’s Copenhagen Food arrives in bookstores across the country.
The Danish chef and food entrepreneur’s latest work is a sprawling exploration of her hometown and the hyggelig cafés and restaurants that make it a unique standout in the global gastronomic map. Chapters covering eight boroughs, including Nyhavn & Gammelholm, Frederiksstaden, Christianshavn, Central Copenhagen, Vesterbro & Frederiksberg, Nørrebro, and Østerbro, and also Outside Copenhagen, are paired with over 70 local and traditional recipes and Trine’s own personal stories of living in and rediscovering each neighbourhood.
#DenmarkInNY met up with Trine Hahnemann to discuss her view on how Copenhagen food culture stands out from the rest of New Nordic cuisine and what the sophisticated New York palate can learn from Copenhagen’s food culture.
DKNY: Can you tell me a little bit about yourself and how you became inspired to produce a cookbook about Copenhagen food culture?
TH: I am native to Copenhagen and I have lived here all my life (a part from a few years in New York and London). I have worked in food for more than 25 years and I thought that now that Copenhagen has become a recognized gastronomic destination I would really like to write about the everyday food culture and how Copenhagen forms part of my history. I also wanted to go back to the roots and tell about where we are coming from.
DKNY: Is there something special that characterises Copenhagen food culture and distinguishes it from the rest of New Nordic cuisine?
TH: Yes, the ‘smørrebrød’ (open sandwiches). The bread culture — especially rye bread. And, of course, all the soft sweet buns we eat where the most iconic Danish is “kanelkringle.” Then the most diffuse traditional fast food is the hotdog, which comes in traditional, modern and organic versions.
DKNY: New Nordic cuisine has built a broad fan base over the past few years but it is now a known entity. Can Copenhagen food culture help maintain New Nordic’s popularity?
TH: Copenhagen is at the epicentre [of New Nordic cuisine] and at the same time finding its own identity away from New Nordic. Restaurants with food from around the world are opening here and I think seasonal, terroir and traditional and cutting-edge sustainable solutions are the future of Copenhagen restaurants.
DKNY: New York is a very diverse city when it comes to food. Is there something that New Yorkers learn from Copenhagen’s food culture?
TH: I would say the culture around eating out is relaxed. Hygge is important in sharing a meal. The other unique aspect is the local produce and the diversity of the seasons. We have more like 12 seasons instead of four, in part because many things only grow here for a very short time. Moreover, restaurants work directly with producers. We are close to the country and distances are short therefore local collaborations are easier.
DKNY: What is a staple of Copenhagen food culture that New Yorkers absolutely need to discover?
TH: The smørrebrød and trying out the lunch culture of having smørrebrød, beer and snaps at some of the classic lunch restaurants thereby trying the whole flow of a Danish lunch. The other thing is bicycling around and trying the different street food markets.

I originally wrote this article in Danish for Politiken Byrum. Here’s the English translation.
Copenhagen is about to get a unique opportunity to learn from other global cities when it hosts the C40 Cities Conference. The question is whether a city as smug as Copenhagen is willing to exploit the opportunity. I doubt it.
The C40 network is bolstered by strong city brands with renowned mayors and is trying to act as a counterweight to national governments and their molasses-like politics, with an agenda strong on action. Cities are an absolute key in the fight against climate change but we’re not exploiting their potential near enough. Copenhagen is in the C40 club, since the city’s status quo is on a high level. Perhaps Lord Mayor Frank Jensen might even drag his bike out of the garage for the event. THAT would be epic.
It is clearly an advantage to work internationally in urban planning and design and say that I come from Copenhagen. It gives street cred. In 2007, I coined the word copenhagenize as a way of describing how other cities could be inspired by all the — back then — exciting things the city was doing. The word hit a nerve around the world.
It is quite telling that I came upon copenhagenize rather than something like denmarkification. Regardless of which political block is at the nation’s helm, the state still focuses on motorways and car sales, as though it’s still 1955. They haven’t understood the concept of induced demand — if you make more space for cars, you get more cars. It is hard to see the difference between the different transport ministers. The latest incarnation has recently been in Oslo to “look at electric cars”. We don’t need fewer cars in Denmark. No no no. Just different cars.
For years I have put Copenhagen on a pedestal regarding sustainable development and I have been an eager exporter of inspiration and transferable solutions with Copenhagen as a role model. I’ve worked in over 100 cities and, with my tv-series about urbanism The Life-Sized City — I curate so many amazing things that are happening in cities around the world. For 12 years I have taken hundreds of politicians, policymakers and professionals around my city on bicycle urbanism tours and I have given countless keynotes and interviews about the city. The pedestal, however, is getting wobbly.
Where arriving home in Copenhagen from my travels used to be pure pleasure, it is now often a bit of a bummer. There are simply so many amazing things happening out there in the world that Copenhagen is looking more and more old school. The brand is dusty and tired. Lately I have to answer puzzled questions from colleagues like, “why the hell did you build a Metro instead of reestablishing the tram network you removed in 1972?!” As on urban planning colleague from France put it, “car-centric cities build metros and people-friendly cities build tramlines”.
I live in Frederiksberg, a city in its own right in the heart of Copenhagen. It’s too small to be in the fancy C40 club but brags ad nauseum about being “The Green Heart of the Capital”. Here on the corner of Godthåbsvej and Nordre Fasanvej, where I’m writing these words, more than 30,000 cars groan past my windows. Windows that are consistently dirtier than any other apartment I’ve lived in in the capital. Frederiksberg is building underground parking garages but without removing the same number of street parking spots. Induced demand is a foreign concept to them, too. It’s wild to think that with the current parking licence fees for residents (only about €100 per year) it takes 900 years to pay off one underground car parking spot. Rumour has it the parking prices will increase, but let’s see if they actually rise to a price that makes sense. It costs 50,000 Danish kroner (€6700) just to paint and maintain an on-street parking spot. So the fee should be at least that.
The city is throwing around taxpayer money like it’s going out of style in the form — among other things — of expensive noise reducing asphalt. If you lower the speed limit from 50 km/h to 30 km/h it will give you the same noise reduction in our densely-populated neighbourhoods as the new asphalt — for a lot less money. The Black Heart of the Capital.
I’m an optimist but I’m also an impatient idealist. I simply have to be inspired in my daily work in order to bother continuing. Luckily there is inspiration to be had around the world. If Copenhagen dares to stand up and kick their laurels aside, here’s a quick and dirty list of modern ideas they can learn from.
Former Mayor of Paris from 2001–2014, Bertrand Delanoë spelled it out perfectly: “The fact is that cars no longer have a place in the big cities of our time”. He is far from alone on this. The woman who took over from him, Anne Hidalgo, is trying to continue where Delanoë left off. Mayors around the world have been quoted for similar, modern statements. It is simply the new normal to work towards fewer cars in a city. Okay, maybe not THAT new. Since the 1990s, French cities with over 100,000 inhabitants have been obliged by national law to develop mobility plans that would reduce car traffic and strengthen public transport, walking and cycling. Maybe when the current transport minister is done with looking at those Norwegian cars he could get started on intelligent legislation.
What else do we have? Hmm.
Over the past four years Oslo of all places has removed over 5000 car parking spots and made it impossible to drive into the city center unless you live there. Amsterdam plans to remove 10,000 parking spots for cars between now and 2025 in favour of making the city safer and adding public space. Helsinki is almost proud when they say it won’t be necessary to own a car in the city in the near future. They’re putting their money on MaaS (mobility as a service) instead. Vancouver is trying to turn the transport budget paradigm on its head — money goes to public transport, walking and cycling first and whatever is left goes to cars.
Now it’s getting awkward. Congestion charges. The national government promised us on around Copenhagen a few years and then failed to deliver. They’re a success in Stockholm, Oslo, Milan, London and Singapore and there is now serious talk of implementing them in many cities, including New York and Belgian cities. Are you as tired as me that your tax money goes to benefiting motorists who don’t even live in — or pay taxes in — your city? Shouldn’t we try to get some of that money back? Other cities have done the math.
Soon 85% of all the streets in Paris will be 30 km/h zones and the “30 Zone” movement that started in Germany in 1986 continues to roll. Soon Central London will slow down to 30 km/h like over 150 cities around Europe. Outside my windows it’s 50 km/h — in Denmark’s most densely-populated city.
I can go on. Ljubljana is in the midst of a massive green paradigm shift. Mexico has an official “laboratory for the city” created to think out of the box. Barcelona is developing people-friendly “superblocks” to reestablish life in the streets after the destructive reign of the automobile. Dublin has banned large trucks from the city center. Several cities are rebuilding or expanding their tram networks. Large logistics companies like DHL and UPS have been using — for a few years — cargo bikes for their last-mile logistics in over 75 EU cities.
Just look at Malmö, Sweden. You can literally see it from Copenhagen. They have a policy to strengthen density, they’re working on being the world’s most skateboard friendly city and they’ve built a bike-friendly apartment building without car parking.
Back to Copenhagen. Things are going well. So well that we don’t need to think about doing it better and maintaining our leadership position. World’s best and safest bicycle city — sure, until further notice. Massive investments in climate change adaptation. Super. But think about it. We have so much money that we have lost touch with reality.
The City just completed a bombastic new waste incinerator called Amager Bakke right near the city centre. One of the greatest singular vanity projects in recent memory. Oooh, there’s a ski hill on top! Nevermind that we don’t generate enough garbage to fill it and we have to import garbage from abroad to make it break even.
Is there really talk of a harbour tunnel that will pump more cars into the city when other cities are removing their last-century, fossil fuel infrastructure motorways? No serious action on affordable housing? More car parking spots that will just give us more cars? The same mistakes in the Nordhavn development that we didn’t learn from after the Ørestad and Carlsberg City disasters?
Imagine if Nordhavn was designed to be the world’s most sustainable development — like a huge version of Vauban in Germany — by using the whole arsenal of modern solutions. THAT is leadership. But no, all we have at the moment is a pile of marketing hype about being C02 neutral in 2015. A plan that activates my bullshit detector like never before.
Copenhagen thinks it’s in the boxing ring with the great fighters but in reality the city is merely the hot bikini-clad woman holding up the sign in between rounds. It is time to send copenhagenize into retirement. Personally, I’m more excited to see what vancouverism, barcelonification or osloism — or whatever the next one will be — has to offer up as inspiration.
When the cities of the world come to C40 in Copenhagen, we need to shut up and sit up straight. We need to listen. We need to learn.

Previous: San Francisco — Copenhagen Scandinavian Airlines SK936 Flight Report
However short time I have in a city, I still enjoy taking public transportation not to save money, but to experience subways and buses in different countries as much as possible. So I took M2 metro line from airport to downtown Copenhagen. It was a 20 min short ride, but cost as many as 30 DKK ($4.5). Scandinavian price is no joke even to a Bay Area resident like me.
Copenhagen metro: not the best I’ve taken, but pretty comfortable and clean, definitely a far cry from the US ones.
I planned to start from the City Hall at the western end of downtown area, and made my way to the famous Little Mermaid statue in the east, which would cover most of Copenhagen’s central area. That is from the statue of Anderson to the statue to one of the most famous characters he created. As I walked out the metro station, to my surprise, I saw a sea of flags of not Denmark, but Palestine. It was in the midst of the Hamas-Israeli war, shortly after the Israeli army entered the Gaza Strip.
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has always been one that’s close to my heart. Personally having been to both Israel and Palestine, I’ve heard stories from both sides, and attended events of various sorts from both sides as well. So I stayed here to observe for a while, seeing the impassioned crowds waving the flags and chanting the political slogan “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.”
In the middle of chaos, I took some time to walk toward the other end of the plaza to see Mr Hans Christian Anderson, arguably the most famous person every tourist to Copenhagen would come to visit. Anderson sit on his chair with a top hat, looking at the other side, seemingly not paying attention to the ongoing protests on the plaza at all. He seemed to see these quite often and just wanted to chill.
As I decided to leave the plaza and began my walking tour, the rally also ended. So I followed the crowds to the Strøget, the famous pedestrian, car-free street in Copenhagen. The street seemed to be a touristy area with many souvenir stores, many of which were named “Viking” conveniently, and “exotic” restaurants. In retrospect, I really should have had dinner here.
Flyers on the wall were about the Palestine rally I saw earlier.
With crowds still chanting Palestinian slogans, I continued walking down the Strøget, while occastionally left the crowds to explore some stores briefly. A huge pulpit was seen placed next to this fountain, where Quran was played loudly admist the Scandinavian night. Seeing a group of mid-age Danish people sitting on the other side of the plaza hanging out and drinking, I wondered how they thought about the scene. Did they embrace such diversity or else?
Continuing walking eastward, architectures looked more and more modern. Fountains and statues could be seen once in a while. Then a market full of crowds came to my sight. Even thought it was still early November, the Christmas market had already taken place.
I personally can’t stand sitting outside in such a cold weather, but it seemed fitting to the Danish. People dressing in heavy jackets came together to chill, drink beers ,and share sausages and desserts on this Saturday night. The price for everything looked insanely high though. As a sausage cost nearly $20, I just observed the crowds.
I also visited a department store that fortunately was still open. Such stores are good places to observe local lives, so I always make them top on my list when I travel. Everything in the supermarket, from vegetables to seafood, seemed very pricey. Even though I later found my conversion rate was a little bit off, these prices were still way higher than in the Bay Area, which was already one of the most expensive places in the world.
As I walked pass the seafood counter and saw a lady sorting out seafood, a surreal feeling occurred to me. Travel brought me to this random place to encounter this random person, which wouldn’t have had anything to do with my life otherwise.
This is exactly what I travel for.
I planned to have dinner in the department store, but it didn’t really have a food court (only one serving desserts and wine). So I continued walking. Finally seeing Danish flags outside souvenir stores after a while.
This iconic building with all the dazzling lights was also a department store (for some reason I forgot to take any photo inside). I have arrived at the Kongens Nytorv (lit king’s new market) and Nyhavn (lit New harbor) area. This is also where the postcard-worthy photos of the colorful facades and old ships were taken (something along these lines). There was a McDonald right outside the department store, but I didn’t feel like having it as my only meal in Denmark. Big mistake, but we’ll come back to this.
To my disappointment, the facades were not very well-lit, which made them not very colorful. Both sides of Nyhavn were full of fancy restaurants that would probably cost me an arm to eat and a leg to dine inside (seriously $60 for a simple meal?) I was unsure whether these were tourist traps, or just typical Scandinavian prices.
Walking to the end of the harbor, I took a photo of the iconic new opera building across the harbor, under chilling winds. I thought the Little Mermaid, as popular as it is, has to be located in somewhere full of crowds. However the lively vibe I had experienced so far suddenly faded away. I realized it was really just the walkable Strøget area that was lively, and now I had encountered another side of Copenhagen.
Amalienborg was the official residence of the Danish royal family, where the Queen of Denmark resides today! However, it was only serenity that I could experience at night. A few royal guards wearing huge bearskin hats were patrolling the plaza. They would walk from one end of the building to a specific corner, stand still, turn around, and walk back to the original spot, so disciplined and well trained as if they were programmed robots. But as the palace where the head of state resides, I felt the security level was way lower than expected.
So on the plaza in this tranquil night, there were really only the royal guards wearing bearskin hats, King Frederick V on the horseback (he was actually king of both Denmark and Norway, when these two countries used to be one), and myself. I was observing both of them, while both the king and the guards were just going about their day (or night), ignoring my presence.
I was desperate to have dinner at any time, but few restaurants could be found. I made a small detour to a nearby street, where there were Khmer, Thai, and Vietnamese restaurants, presumably opened by immigrants. My experience told me that these places would offer foods at reasonable price. However, they all turned out to be high-end restaurants that cost $40 a meal.
Other restaurants I went to either was closed, or cost even more. I really wondered how an average person got to survive here.
At least I was glad to see the Danish road signs! Whoever plays Geoguessr would recognize this typical Danish signs, screaming Denmark, at first glance.
So I was approaching my destination, the Little Mermaid, walking in hunger and increasingly brutal winds. I realized the statue was located in a coastal park, with no stores or restaurants around as I imagined before. My final shot to not starve would be this seafood restaurant on the way there.
I almost thought the place was closed too, because I couldn’t even open the door as fierce winds blew onto it. It turned out to be a food court with many restaurants to choose from, ranging from seafood, authentic Mexican food, Argentinian grills……. and even Japanese sushi.
I ended up having this poke bowl as my only meal in Copenhagen. The famous Hawaiian and Californian-inspired dish that came with fish, avocado and random vegetables. Seriously it could not be less Danish than this. After I came out from the much needed restroom, I wondered how funny it would be to write about this journey, sharing about the authentic Danish food that Danish people get to eat in their everyday lives. I really should have eaten McDonalds or Burger King, or even the Chinese restaurant I first saw.
But hey, at least I had walked across nearly all of Copenhagen!
After such an authentic Danish dining experience, I went on to see something truly Danish: the Little Mermaid. The coastal park seemed to be a fun place to visit during the day, with good trails to bike if I hadn’t been carrying a 10kg backpack. Few tourists would visit the Little Mermaid in such a chilly night. In fact, only two local Danish dudes were there chatting. They came to me asking for cigarettes, which was indeed very fitting for this setting. Too bad I didn’t have one.
On my way walking to the metro station, I realized I had drunk too much water when I had the Danish delights, and my bladder couldn’t stand anymore. Unlike my dinner, I had no luck this time — absolutely nowhere was open in 10pm; the public restroom at train station was hopelessly occupied forever; however neat and clean Copenhagen’s metro was, it didn’t have any restroom in the station.
I tried to focus on my brain instead of my bladder. At one point I almost had no options but to take metro all the way to the airport, just for its guaranteed public restrooms. The department store and McDonalds in downtown, only 2 stations away from here, finally occurred to me. As I ran out the metro, the former seemed to be closed, but the latter, fortunately, was open.
I ran all the way to the basement, rushing into the restroom, only to see some ladies waiting in line. As I quickly turned back and about to ran out, a lady said “it’s fine! it’s both genders!”
“I promise I’ll eat McDonald next time Im in this city.” I pondered, As I used the gender-neutral restroom.
Walking out of McDonalds, I took metro to Ørestad. This is where I would stay tonight, somewhere with reasonable price and only two stations from the airport. Since my flight would depart 8am the next day, proximity was the top priority.
I walked through the already closed shopping mall and exited via the confusing parking lot stairs to avoid the ruthless freezing winds.
The hotel was a good deal for what I paid in such an expensive city. But my room turned out to be the final room down the hallway. This is very scary and something I would like to avoid at all cost. Legend has it that, the final room down the hallway always……
had the worst wi-fi signals…….took me forever to upload my Strava activity.
And was I only 5 hours into the trip? Why did I feel it’s already been 5 full days…….

Part two: Getting an apartment
So you’ve moved to Copenhagen (or you’re about to!) and you read my last post, so you know that you need an apartment before you can get set up for absolutely anything else (health care, bank account, nemID, etc.). Here’s what I learned…
First, Set your expectations.It took us over 3 weeks to get an apartment in Copenhagen, and I was working on it every single day. We had to move between two different Airbnb’s because it kept taking longer than we thought. We have both a dog and a cat, and it was the middle of winter so it wasn’t much fun to trek around the city. Hopefully for you it will be faster!
In terms of what’s available here… Many Danish bathrooms are very small, to the point where you have to shower over your toilet (ew). And most do not have bathtubs. Pets make it extra-difficult to find a place. Many buildings are walk-ups (we are on the 4th floor with no elevator). However, there is plenty of hardwood and natural light and Danish modern design sensibility YAY!
Invest in the apps.Almost every apartment rental site costs money. Try a few (Boligsurf and Boligportal are decent) and pay for trial subscriptions, but put a note in your calendar to cancel the subscriptions when they are about to auto renew because they are not cheap. DBA is the equivalent of Craigslist and can have some good options, especially if you are willing to do a short term rental and then find a full-time spot later. However, it’s important to have a permanent address in order to get your CPR number, which is your key to everything else (see my last post).
Prepare for the competition.Competition can be fierce in Copenhagen. Come ready to see apartments with your proof of residency/income/employment, passports, and willingness to pay, just like you would in NYC, SF, or DC. Some places require you to fill out an application, others don’t. Bottom line, if you love it, don’t hesitate. On the flip side, the Danes have a more… relaxed pace, especially now during the summer months, so getting a showing can take time. Keep pushing if you have a good feeling about a place!
A note on agents.If you see an apartment that you kind of like, but it’s already gone, or not quite right, ask the person showing it what else they have on the market. Use them as a filter for similar quality apartments. But, keep in mind that buildings rented out by agents are also more expensive because they get a cut.
Be ready to shell out.In Copenhagen it is standard to pay an extra 3 months of rent on top of your 1st month’s rent as a damage deposit. Some places also charge 2–3 months on top of that as a deposit for the last few months rent. So, you are likely to pay between 4–7 months rent on day one. For a 1 bedroom 15.000dk apartment, that could add up to as much as 105.000dk, or $16,500 USD. As I mentioned in the last post, paying your first payment can be tricky without a local bank account, which first requires you to have a local address (so bizzare). I found Transferwise to be pretty useful for those first few overseas payments.
New vs. old?In Copenhagen, deciding between new vs. old is not the difference between modern luxuries and convenience, or personality and affordability. Some of the new construction buildings we saw had few luxuries, were located on the fringes of town (pretty inconvenient), but were more affordable, while some of the older buildings we saw had no character, or a few modern luxuries and conveniences, but at a much higher price. In other words, don’t be fooled by the age of the building!
In Copenhagen, a 15min bike ride is considered far. The city is really not that big, but I’d recommend choosing just a few neighborhoods that are close to where you want to spend your time, especially for when the weather gets uglier. You can find both expensive and affordable apartments in each neighborhood, though as a general rule it’s more expensive the closer to the center you are. When you start searching, you will see Københaven S, V, SV, N, O, K, etc. These refer to the areas of the town, but not the neighborhoods…
I have not even included Vanløsem Brønshøj-Husum, or Bispebjerg, because I’m assuming that if you’re moving to Copenhagen for a short time, you’d rather be in the middle of things.
K CENTER/CENTRUM
Centrum AKA Indre By: Can be a bit more expensive, not good for dogs, full of tourists, but super convenient to get anywhere. Good shopping, restaurants, scenic canals, museums…
VWEST/VEST
Valby: Families and more affordable housing over one big hill from the center. You can even get a whole house out there, I hear! The neighborhood of Carlsberg Byen, right on the edge of Frederiksberg is in heavy construction, and may be a cool area to check out in the next year or two.
Vesterbro and Kødbyen (meat packing): Can be loud, but also super hip and fun. Home to many cafes and bars and boutique shops. I found it hard to find apartments here.
N NORTH/NORD
Nørrebro: One of the most-multicultural neighborhoods in Copenhagen. A bit more crime, but also a lot of amazing culture — food, art, shops, etc. We spend a lot of time here.
Ø EAST/ØST
Østerbro: Quiet and family-friendly with lots of beautiful old character buildings. Close to “the lakes” (not what I think of as lakes, but beautiful for jogging and strolling) and the best bakery in town. All my friends live here.
Nordhavn: lots of newer construction buildings, right on the ocean! I hear the swimming is great.
SSOUTH/SYD
Islands Brygge: Copenhagen charm, if you want to live right on the water. But keep in mind that everyone else also wants to be right on the water all summer.
Amagerbro: A bit more crime here, but affordable and interesting. A short train or bikeride to the center.
Amager: Further out from the center, but closer to the beach, and the airport. Some areas feel pretty soul-less to me with back-to-back office buildings. But, I’m sure there are some awesome affordable apartment gems out here, and a whole lot of nature.
Christianshavn: Home to many houseboats, and also the famous Freetown Christiania. The neighborhood is just across from the center, and close to NOMA, you know, just in case. For cheaper eats, there’s also the new food hall at Reffen nearby.
Sydhavnen: Here there are A LOT of newer buildings that you can get into quickly, which are not too expensive. But, it feels a bit separated from the city by the railroad tracks, and much of this area is still being developed. Pro: it’s also right on the water.
And finally,
FREDERIKSBERGFrederiksberg is an island (figuratively, not literally) in the middle of Copenhagen. Even though it’s quite central, it’s a completely different byen, or city, which means different regulations, street signs, taxes, etc. It’s quiet and convenient, with lots of old character buildings, boutique shops and a gorgeous park. We love it.
My 5 step process to find the best apartments in any city
Start with what you need (and what you want).Whenever my husband and I move to a new place, we spend an hour or so writing up post-its with everything we’d like to have in our new apartment. Usually it’s based on learnings of what we liked or didn’t like in the last place. Once we’ve written everything that we can imagine (it’s light and bright, there’s outdoor space, a bathtub!), we’ll rank them by importance to our quality of life, debating back and forth until we both feel satisfied that this vision of an apartment is representative of our needs, and then our wants. This way, if only one of us is available during househunting, then we also have a good guide to make decisions with.
Know your budget.Choosing an apartment can be a very emotional process, so having an anchor to return to helps when it’s time for serious decision-making. I like to start with a “spending plan” for how much I think I’ll make and spend in my new city/neighborhood, then determine the high and low end of our rental budget, and clarifying what we would be giving up if you went with the high end. Don’t forget to factor in all the moving costs before, during, and after the move, like movers, new furniture, and damage deposits.
Visualize your ideal.Since I’m a visual person and a designer, I also often make a moodboard of what I want the space to look and feel like. It helps me check whether I’ve found the right place, or just a “good enough” place. My husband and I have been building this Moodboard for our House for the last 5 or 6 years, and I think it’s helped us understand each other’s sense of style.
Start early.Before I arrive in a new place, I get on all the local apps and start evaluating the market to find out what’s available, what would be a realistic price range, and how the neighborhoods compare — Airbnb neighborhoods and people who have recently moved to the city can be a good gut check. Many people told us to start trying to rent an apartment before we arrived in Copenhagen, but I think that’s bad advice, because it doesn’t allow you to…
…trust your gut.Now that I know what I can afford, where I’d like to be, and what’s most important to me, it’s time to let my intuition do the work. If it feels too good to be true, or I have a sneaking suspicion that there’s something off, I try to listen to that warning. After all, this is the place we’ll call home.

If you visit Copenhagen during the colder months, eating your way through their amazing bakeries is one of the best ways to spend your time (and to gain a few pounds of padding to protect you from the cold). We visited 9 bakeries in 5 days. Copenhagen’s bakeries rivaled the ones I tried in Stockholm (reviewed here). While I loved them all, we agreed there was one clear favorite. The list below is loosely in reverse rank order and rated as good, great, or amazing.

📆 Flight Date: 20/11/2022📌 Nyhavn, Copenhagen — Denmark
During our stay in Gothenburg, we planned a 2-day weekend trip to Copenhagen. We hopped on a fast train that took us to Copenhagen in just 3 hours, arriving early in the morning. It was a delightful city to explore and wander around. We wished it were a bit warmer, but unfortunately, the weather was so cold that evening, it had snowed for the first time that year.
Nyhavn is a historic harbour area and one of the symbols of Copenhagen. Built-in the early 17th century, this region was originally used as a trading port. It is renowned for its colourful and distinctive buildings, its atmosphere steeped in history, and its maritime heritage. In the past, Nyhavn was a popular stop for sailors, hosting various cultures over time. Today, it has become a vibrant meeting point for tourists and locals alike, with lively cafes, restaurants, and charming colourful houses.
It was a day when we set out early in the morning to explore the city. While wandering around, I kept an eye out for a suitable place to fly the drone. When we arrived at the famous Nyhavn area, I found an open and quiet space near the river and decided to take off from there. It was an extremely cold day, and the wind was blowing very strongly, making it challenging to control the drone at times.
After taking off, the city looked stunning from above, and I captured a few photographs. Then, I spotted a tourist boat moving along the river towards Nyhavn, and I immediately started recording a video. Slowly progressing alongside the boat, I maneuvered through the streets.
And I took one more photograph of the city.
In my second video, I reversed the process, moving backward away from the river.
In my third video, I kept the drone stationary and, while facing the river, slowly elevated the camera towards the sky.
And finally, my one of my personal favourites is below. In this video, I captured the famous colorful houses and boats by moving the drone parallel to them. Due to the wind, I had to make 2–3 attempts while filming, but in the end, I believe it was worth it.
You can find detailed information about drone flying permissions in Denmark here. Although I have a drone license from the Turkish Directorate General of Civil Aviation, I didn’t possess the required license to fly in urban areas in Denmark. Unfortunately, I flew for a very brief period without obtaining permission. I made sure to stay away from people and buildings during the flight.
The indispensable element of my Northern European shots, the wind, challenged me once again. In fact, I couldn’t feel my fingertips due to the cold for a while after the shoot. Copenhagen was a beautiful city, and the buildings provided delightful scenery.
My point: 9/10
I’m considering adding my past flights here as a memento, so the dates mentioned in the writings I’ve added may belong to the last two years.
If you liked the content, I’d appreciate a thumbs up and a subscription. If you have any questions, feel free to leave a comment or reach out to me through my social media accounts listed here.

It was the day before Onam. I was sitting in the beautiful Frederiksberg Gardens in Copenhagen. It was a beautiful sunny day and all around us families were picnicking, children running around, and dogs dozing. This is what I would consider a perfect afternoon and I was soaking in every second of it. But, in the back of my mind I was also thinking about what I would be doing if I was home. (Currently, we do not have a permanent address). I would be cooking dal for Sambhar and chopping vegetables for Avial; defrosting packets of grated coconut to go into each of the five or six dishes I usually make. As an immigrant (now going on 12 years), cooking is how I feel at home. Cooking is, as some might say, my love language. Vishu and Onam are when that instinct comes out in full force. As much as I am enjoying this Europe sojourn, being in a different place every week and even cooking in new kitchens, not having Sadhya on Onam is a recipe for homesickness.
Home is a complicated concept; but one way I think of it is that home is the place where most of my food memories and cravings are anchored. That day in Copenhagen, we had bought a couple of things from a bakery (or bageri) to eat at the park. One of them was a cardamom bun or kardemommabolle which every Copenhagen food blog I consulted had recommended. As I bit into the beautifully glazed and twisted cardamom bun, nostalgia flooded my senses. Although, I had never eaten a kardemommabolle before, it felt so intensely familiar. That mix of sugar and cardamom and the soft melt-in-your-mouth bread, transported me home to Kerala. For a moment, I was a little girl eating one of those buns stuffed with sweetened coconut, flavored with cardamom. It reminded me of other confections that used this formula, now replaced by cakes and cookies in most Kerala bakeries, whose names I have long forgotten.
Food nostalgia can often hit you in unexpected places and ways. The smell of a particular mix of ingredients hitting hot oil, the texture of a dessert, and even the flavor of something you have never eaten before can bring back memories of familiar foods, places, and people. So why had this kardemommabolle transported me from Copenhagen to Kerala?
Cardamom—elam, elakka, elakaya in Malayalam—is the quintessential dessert flavoring in Kerala cuisine. This is not surprising given that some of the world’s best cardamom is grown in Kerala. Cardamom goes into our payasams (delicately flavored milk-based dessert), ela-ada (rice flour pie stuffed with jaggery-sweetened and cardamom spiced coconut filling that is steamed in banana leaves), and unnakaya (steamed and pounded plantain shaped into beautiful oval shapes, stuffed with sweetened and cardamom spiced coconut, then fried). It is used to flavor spiced black tea or Sulaimani of the Malabar region (which in my humble opinion is superior to the milky cardamom tea of the North). It is also used to flavor breads and cakes that became a part of Kerala cuisine, as a legacy of British colonial presence. When I first moved to the US, before Cinnabon kiosks opened up in Indian malls, I was slightly puzzled by the prolific use of cinnamon in American desserts. In Kerala, cinnamon is very much a savory spice. It is cardamom, and occasionally cloves, that are used to flavor sweet treats, although they are also key in savory dishes such as stew and biriyani.
We also revere cardamom for its supposed medicinal properties. You can pop a few pods into your pocket or handbag and chew on the seeds as a mouth freshener or to suppress nausea or motion sickness. Eladi Lehyam, an Ayurvedic paste with cardamom as its main ingredient is used to treat sore throat and cough, and an ubiquitous item in the medicine cabinets of Malayalis. (As I write this, I can almost recall the metallic methol taste of the Lehyam at the back of my throat). Eladi Thailam, or cardamom oil is used for head and body massages. Thus, cardamom is familiar not just to our taste buds, but all our senses. So how did this “queen of spices” make its way to Scandinavia and into the delectable kardemommabolle?
The Danish had some trading posts in India, including the southern port of Tranquebar, which it held as a colony for more than a two-hundred years. (Danish discourse seem to avoid the term colony and refer to Tranquebar as a trading post, but they did build a fort there). In the heyday of Danish East India Trade Company it had factories along the southern coast including—Edava—a town near Varkala, not far from a part of the Western Ghats known as the Cardamom Hills. So does the origin of the delectable Cardamon bun that transported me to Kerala on that Onam-eve lie in Denmark’s trade with South India?
Online sleuthing tells me that the creation of cardamom bun predates Scandinavian presence in Asia. Although I happened to have my first cardamom bun in Denmark, everyone (on the internet) seems to agree that it is a Swedish invention, where it is known as Kardemummabullar. Before the Portuguese explorer, Vasco Da Gama, landed in Calicut on the Malabar coast—my hometown and the heart of the spice trade at the time—spices were coming to Europe via the Middle East. The spice trade is believed to have started as early as 2000 BCE along the silk route, and was over the centuries controlled by Arabs, Venetians, and Genoans. The demand for spices played a key role in creating the first international trade routes and the European quest to cut out middle men and get to the source of the spices was a driving force of the “age of exploration” or as the colonized like us call it — the colonial era. Spices were making their way to Europe and shaping its cuisines well before Europeans themselves arrived at South and Southeast Asian shores in its pursuit.
One theory dates the arrival of cardamom in Sweden all the way back to the time of the Vikings. Supposedly, cardamom was brought back to the region by Viking explorers who made their way to Istanbul (then Constantinople) sometime in the 11th century. Another theory suggests that cardamom was introduced to Scandinavia by the Moors. This theory cites the appearance of cardamom in Scandinavian recipes in the mid-1400s and the “Moorish” influence of those recipes. This of course does not indicate a specific time or place, and might refer to the Maghreb or Al-Andalus. Irrespective of how cardamom first arrived in Scandinavia, Tranquebar and the East India Companies of other European nations (including Sweden) played a part in it becoming an essential part of the cuisine. This “opening up” of the spice trade in the 15th century made cardamom and other spices, which were previously luxury goods meant for the kitchens of the elite, more accessible to working class Europeans, even as it paved the way for the colonization of South and Southeast Asia.
As I was connecting the historical dots of how cardamom made its way from Kerala to Scandinavia, I realized that I had brought my own cache of cardamom there in the form of my homemade garam masala. One of its key ingredients is green cardamom that my aunt gave me on my last trip to Kerala. I made some lovely (even if I say so myself) Malabari biriyani for dinner on one of my nights in Copenhagen.
Copenhagen’s beauty is in both the grandiose and the mundane. Spectacular palaces sit unpretentiously besides old housing blocks with stunning but understated brickwork; Museums housed in old impressive buildings are surrounded by shops selling Danish-designed furniture and home ware that could give any museums a run for their money; verdant home and apartment gardens that look unplanned and wild are no less aesthetic than the many perfectly manicured royal gardens of the city. As much as I loved everything about Copenhagen, it is not the place where I expected to become nostalgic about Kerala (although, we do consider ourselves more understated and subtle in our aesthetics compared to the rest of India).
Food is an archive of history, cultures, and exchange. Food can bring back memories, and reveal connections in the most unexpected ways. This is probably why Food Studies has emerged as a serious field of research to understand culture, migration, history, and politics. As a seafood lover, I enjoyed the many Smørrebrød (open-faced sandwich, usually topped with seafood) that we had in Denmark. But it did not remind me of the fish curries, fish fries, or other seafood dishes that form an essential part of Kerala cuisine. On the other hand, a humble cardamom bun made me nostalgic and sent me down a research rabbit-hole. I am looking forward to having many more of them when I get to Stockholm next week.

We sent podcast host and self-proclaimed “expert on everything” Markus Herrmann on a road trip across Europe to find out how cities embrace the future of urban space. In this episode, we’re in Copenhagen, a city that is known for its incredible bicycle infrastructure. But the Danish capital has more to offer, eg. an artificial ski slope.
When it comes to urban mobility, Copenhagen is immediately mentioned as a prime example. After all, the Danish capital is considered the European capital of cycling. But apart from two-meter-wide cycle paths, what makes the development of the cityscape, and the mobility associated with it, so special?
If you take a look at the figures on bicycles, Copenhagen’s special position quickly becomes clear. An impressive 45 percent of the inhabitants commute to work, school or university by bike, covering around 1.4 million kilometres every day. According to a study, even more people in the Greater Copenhagen area bike to work every day than in the entire USA. There are five times more bicycles than cars in the city center, and only 14 percent of inhabitants drive a car every day.
It’s clear that with so much cycling traffic, new records are being set. The cycle path at Nørrebrogade, for example, is the world’s busiest cycle path, with up to 40,000 cyclists a day. Not only there, but in the entire city area, about 1,000 kilometers of cycle paths provide the right connection. Of these, 200 kilometers alone are high-speed cycle paths — so-called Cykelsuperstier — which are particularly well-developed and designed to prioritize bike traffic. These cycle paths are three meters wide, and the traffic lights along them are synchronized to create a “green wave” so cyclists don’t have to stop at intersections.
But it’s also the small things that show further thought is being given to cyclists here. For example, rubbish bins are oriented diagonally towards the cyclists, and there are footrests at the traffic lights so that cyclists don’t have to get out of their saddles while waiting.
Those who would like to take advantage of the cyclists’ paradise themselves are best served by the city bikes from the Bycyklen public bike hire system. After a short registration, you can rent one of the e-bikes and start cycling right away.
Bycycklen city bikes already have a long tradition in Copenhagen. In May 1995, the first 1000 city bikes rolled through Copenhagen’s streets. And when Bill Clinton came to Denmark for a state visit in 1997, he received the “City Bike One” as an official guest gift.
As progressive as the rental bike system might be, there have still been some unexpected setbacks. Until recently, e-bikes were equipped with tablets, which not only allowed you to rent the bike but also to view a map and information about the surrounding area. Unfortunately, due to heavy vandalism last year, all tablets were removed from the bikes.
Even though Copenhagen is completely flat and it hardly ever snows, there is one rather unexpected way of getting around: downhill skiing! Since the beginning of 2019, Copenhagen has a new landmark, the “CopenHill”. A ski slope was built on the roof of a waste incineration plant, on whose dry ski slope you can ski almost 100 meters down into the valley.
It is hard to believe it, but the waste incineration plant Amager Bakke inside the urban ski slope is one of many building blocks for Copenhagen’s next big goal: the city wants to become climate neutral by 2025. If it succeeds, Copenhagen would be the world’s first CO2-neutral capital. Since 2009, a multi-faceted plan has been underway to achieve this goal. What starts with rather obvious measures such as solar panels on public buildings extends to the optimization of menus in canteens and kindergartens. Copenhagen is on its way to become a sustainable model for the whole world — not only on the cycle path.
Markus Herrmann is a blogger, author, and member of the successful podcast “Gästeliste Geisterbahn”. For Porsche, he is testing the mobility level of the Back 2 Tape metropolises in Europe.
The project “Back 2 Tape” is a cooperation between the Porsche Newsroom and music journalist Niko Backspin. It follows the tracks of hip hop in Europe. All further information on this project can be found in the Porsche Newsroom.
An important note: Markus’ trip through Europe as well as “Back 2 Tape” were produced before the outbreak of COVID-19. Porsche, Backspin and the involved agencies and artists are aware of their social responsibility and advise against such a trip at this time out of consideration for the health and well-being of all people.

Part One: Onboarding
Moving to Copenhagen can be pretty overwhelming, and I found all the sequenced steps to be frustratingly unclear. To help you avoid running around in circles, I’ve put together a step-by-step guide to beginning your awesome new life in Copenhagen.
Each step must be done in order, or you risk wasting a lot of time.
Once you have your proof of residency and an address, you’ve unlocked the next set of tasks.
With your NemID and CPR number set up, you are finally eligible to get your yellow card, and set up your online life.
The following steps can be done with a bit more leisure, but most within 90 days of arrival.
Leaving — If you were to ever leave Copenhagen (and really, who would?) you have to go in reverse order and remove yourself from all these systems. Read more here.

I’m from Brazil and I’ve been living in Copenhagen for 2 years. In Brazil we have more than 2000 freshwater fish species, but Pike isn’t one of them and I’ve always wanted to catch big Pike, after watching on TV how violent this fish is.
Looking for Pike in a lake in the middle of the city (Valby, Copenhagen)
I live 3 km away from an urban lake, so it was the first lake I wanted to try fishing in Denmark. Last year, in 2019, I went there 2 times in the summer and didn’t catch anything, and I considered the lake just dead water.
I wanted to give the lake another try in the summer this year, one year after my last trip to it. It was a Saturday in August and I was immediately greeted by a small pike, caught in a small weightless spinner (known in Brazil as “varejeira”) rigged with a bombarda (a kind of float with weight). My first pike ever! I finally crossed this specie off of my list. But still, far away from the big pikes that I saw on TV. Anyway, on this same day, I ended up catching more than 50 small pikes. It was basically one pike per cast!
The next day, Sunday, I got there after lunch and ended up catching dozens of small pikes and even small perches. I decided to move around the lake, until at 18:00, my friend Ricardo cast a small spinner and hooked a big one, which immediately got off the hook, due to how small the lure was. He agreed on me throwing my big wobbler right where he lost the pike and finally, I hooked the big one!
In my mind, it was huge, because I was used to hooking only tiny pikes! Five minutes afterwards, I cast close to where I caught the big one and I hooked one which appeared to be twice bigger than the previous one! Spot on! I finally found the one I was looking for! Even the previous pike could now be considered “small” compared to this one!
Going Bigger
Afterwards, I went there almost on a daily basis after work and hooked medium to big pikes constantly. I even got a reasonably sized one in an ultralight set with 0.08mm braided line (thin as a hair).
One day I decided to try a “pen toy rod” that I bought from China for only US$ 3 and I hooked a lot of small pikes.
Suddenly, I saw a wave nearby, and it was the biggest pike I’ve ever seem. It was just taking a look at the small pikes that I was releasing, in a place where it’s probably 15 to 20cm deep. I switched to my bait casting set and a bigger lure. Unfortunately it ignored all my casts. I switched more than 10 different lures, until I got it… but my fluorocarbon leader was only 0.35mm and it cut the line. I was hectic. I quickly tied another leader (still 0.35mm) and put a 16cm lure, and then I cast in parallel to the shallow area where the pike was. Unfortunately it was gone, it was a sad 5 minutes for me. Anyway, I decided to keep casting the 16cm lure parallel to the shallow surface, until suddenly, I hooked it! After fighting it, I managed to bring it out of the water!
A very long but thin pike. The head itself was bigger than 25cm. My record pike so far! And to think that it all started with the toy rod that day.
Halloween Night Pike Fishing (Going even Bigger)
As a Halloween challenge, I made my own Halloween pike lure and I went night pike fishing at the same lake! The night delivered 3 big pikes, all above 100 cm, where one of them was a BIG FAT MAMA (big curved belly when you hold it), my biggest and heaviest pike, and I wonder if this one is the biggest in that lake? I ended up getting one with my custom lure and 2 with a Danish lure made especially for pikes.
I can now identify the pikes from my local lake from their patterns and from their scars, and I even started calling them by name, because I caught some of the pikes more than once the past 3 months, that’s also the magic and emotion of catch and release! For me, it’s a very happy moment to release the fish and see it swimming back!
Never underestimate your backyard lake!

The story sounds familiar: A utopian city where the streets are clean, traffic is orderly, and the people are tall, beautiful, and calm. It’s the stuff science fiction novels are made of…
I didn’t have many expectations for each city that we visited during this trip but I had some thoughts going to Copenhagen.
Some quick backstory:
I’ve grown up to with the American work ethic of the “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” kind. So to come to a country where socialism plays an important part of the governing system, it immediately brought thoughts of lazy dependence on an overtaxed government from beatnik no-doers. I should say that most of my understanding of socialism spews from good ‘ole propaganda-filled American public education. It has led me to believe that socialism is THE anti-American way of living and is often told much like a scary bedtime story to caution wayward capitalist children about the tyranny of the Soviet Union. 👻
In reality, Denmark is not a socialist state but rather it upholds a socialist democratic practice. The objective is not for the state to own the means of production but rather it refers to a political philosophy that supports economic and social policies that promote social justice in a capitalist economy in a democratic way. Most people see this through the way they govern a tax-financed health care service. (Universal healthcare 🚑) Others might refer to it as a social welfare country due to its extensive services for children, the elderly and the poor. Denmark also provides special provisions for universal education, support for unions or collective bargaining, and sensible (ostensibly) government regulation of industry to preserve the environment and health and welfare of people within the jurisdiction of the country. Either way you spin it, the country operates with private and publicly run businesses and Copenhagen is considered to be one of the top ranked best city in the world for standard of living. So with that in mind, I came to Copenhagen with a lot of curiosity for the way everything worked and operated.
Here’s a breakdown of our trip to Copenhagen:
We arrived in the late afternoon of our first day. CPH was quite nice and fairly large. Having flown a lot domestically within the US, it was a night/day comparison to see a privately-owned airport. (As compared to the airports owned by the government much like the Port Authority NY/NJ) Even the bus lines are privately owned in Copenhagen and I was mostly impressed by the clear signage, cleanliness, and on-time reliability.
We decided to purchase the 72-hour CityPass ticket to get around on public transit since it encompassed the entirety of our stay in Copenhagen. (We got in late our first day and left at noon on our last for a total of three days.) Public transit is a bit pricey here. A one-way ticket throughout the 3-zones that the city encompasses is $36 DK or $5.39 USD. So to purchase their $200 DK 72-hour card, it only cost about $30 USD for three days. We didn’t rent bikes this time around but rather walked. If I return again, I would rent a bike for the entirety of our stay since the city was very bike friendly and central to most points of interest.
Our Airbnb was conveniently located just a few blocks from the Nørrebro Station. Thom and I really enjoyed our stay there. Our guests were very welcoming and the apartment was very comfortable. If you follow me on any other social media, then you’d know that I’ve already posted a short video of our stay.
A lot of the time making this video was spent find creative ways to shoot still video without a tripod though. 😝
The location of our Airbnb was absolutely great! Again, we were very close to public transit but also a short walk away from The Lakes, Copenhagen’s Botanical Gardens and parks, grocery stores, and the famous Torvehallerne.
On our first evening, we walked over the Lakes and ate at Thai Pan. I’ll admit that food is a bit pricey in Copenhagen in general, but this restaurant had a great three-course menu that provided us with a lot of leftovers for the next day. They make a super tasty coconut soup with chicken and mushrooms. That alone was well-worth the price and trip!
Also that first night, I received the best email that I could ever imagine:
Noma has an open spot for you and one other to dine on the following day. Would we care to join?
WOULD WE CARE TO JOIN??!! WOULD WE EVER!
I think that I’ll save that experience for it’s own special post since the meal was over 3.5 hours long and consisted of 14 courses and a tour of the kitchen and grounds. Long story short:
It. was. amazing. 😍
The other two days we spent walking around site-seeing. We visited:
One place that we did not have time to see was Tivoli Gardens. I still don’t know if I regret this or if this was something to easy miss. I haven’t been to a theme park since my short visit to Disney World over three years ago. The idea of long lines, large crowds, and rollercoasters just doesn’t appeal like it used to when I was 14. But Tivoli is one of the world’s oldest theme parks and has some beautiful gardens. If I had the chance again, I think that I would go to see and visit the grounds alone.
Here are some shots from our stay in Copenhagen:
Some shots around Christiania. You aren’t allowed to photograph some parts within the free state:
Out and about Copenhagen, including: The Lakes, Botanical Gardens, and Nyhavn:
And that was it! An overall great impression of the city. What really stuck out to me was the overall infrastructure of the city and how well maintained it is. I enjoyed the serenity found in the heart of the city and loved the fact that people were out and about strolling in the parks or by the Lakes late into the evenings. My only criticism is the near-perfect state of everything. There weren’t any brash forms of expression of any kind whether through the city itself or it’s people. It’s of no surprise that a place like Christiania had established it self so long ago. It acts as the only visual protest of all the conformity found throughout the rest of Copenhagen. Even staying in the multicultural Nørrebro neighborhood, I felt that there was a tragic loss of diversity, especially compared to places like Berlin and Amsterdam. (SO many blonde-haired, blue-eyed people everywhere in Copenhagen!)
It’s truly a give and take with this city with this ultimately in mind: High prices for a better standard of living.
My last take: Not to live in, but I would visit again.
This post is a part of a series based on my recent two-week trip to Europe.

In June, the Civic Commons Learning Network in partnership with the Better Block Foundation hosted Civic Commons Learning Journey: Copenhagen, a four-day study trip that immersed learning network members in the public life, policy and culture of the city. Through explorations of the city by bike and frank conversations with local leaders on the work they are pursuing, we considered how the city is building and sustaining public assets that deliver more public value. On our final day in Copenhagen, we hosted a workshop session to distill learning from the two dozen participants representing Akron, Detroit and Philadelphia.
Here are 10 key lessons from the trip:
Copenhagen is known as being one of the most liveable cities in the world. But it wasn’t always this way. In the early ’90s, the city faced bankruptcy. Seeing a bleak future, the leaders of the city came together to create several strategies for change. One of these was to focus on pilot projects. The city began to expand and scale pedestrian street conversions originally built in the 1960s and parking lots that, in the 1980s, had been transformed into public squares. The goal was to create visible changes quickly that would encourage the citizens to come together. Just as important as the pilot projects was following up with permanent investments when the pilots proved successful.
In the ’60s, many cities around the world expanded their freeway infrastructure by building elevated highways. But when this idea was proposed in Copenhagen people protested. In the ’90s, when the city was nearing bankruptcy and had little money to invest, it put the money where it could be stretched — toward bicycling infrastructure.
Copenhagenize, which highlights cycling life in Copenhagen, said that because infrastructure investments of the ’60s and ’90s made it easier to bike, more people started biking. In fact, now 56 percent of Copenhageners use a bike every day. By making bicycling the most convenient option, and by keeping the cycling infrastructure simple and legible, Copenhagen has made biking the easiest, fastest and cheapest mode of transportation. “Copenhageners are just as lazy as you are,” said Morten Kabell, COO of Copenhagenize. “Fifty percent of us only ride a bicycle because the city of Copenhagen has made it fast and easy.”
In Denmark, design is everything. Every single element of every single space has been designed with the user in mind. One small example: trash cans. Each trash can has a lip on the outside for cans and glass. This way, it’s easier for people who need those items to grab them for recycling.
The city has also found ways to maximize its spaces by taking down the fences and designing areas to support a wide variety of activities. An example: a large courtyard next to a marketplace that serves as both a schoolyard playground and common space with a basketball court. During lunch, multiple worlds collide in one cohesive space. And in terms of policy, the city is redesigning all of its schoolyards to be fenceless so they are open and welcoming to the community.
We ended our trip at Gehl Architects, where Mayra Madriz talked through the firm’s approach to building cities, highlighting the importance of design. “Consider urban life before urban space and urban space before buildings,” Mayra said.
Copenhagen’s architecture policy promotes a people-first approach. Chief City Architect Tina Saaby holds position of influence, advising politicians and city administrators alike. When a development proposal crosses her desk, her first question is, “Who is the landscape architect?” She recognizes that the space between buildings is where public life either thrives or fails to thrive.
When a crisis faces Copenhagen, the city’s response often comes in the form of investments in public life. While bankruptcy spurred some of the best bike infrastructure in the world, climate change catalyzed the concept of cloud burst parks. This network of green public spaces mitigates flooding by holding and filtering excess water. They also serve as a natural playscape.
For significant neighborhood-wide investments, the project managers from the city’s urban planning department don’t do their jobs from city hall or in an administrative building downtown. Instead, they work in the neighborhood’s culture house. For example, Eva Christensen and Sia Boensen, project managers in the neighborhood of Nørrebro, lead a diverse team of architects, planners and social scientists who will be based in the community for six years. Their mission involves co-creating a set of projects. Together with neighbors, they’ll reimagine Hans Tavsens Park as a cloud burst park that combines stormwater management with recreation, complete neighborhood-wide transportation planning and develop safe streets. But the city and the planning team see their work as much more than capital projects. The team is also interested in understanding existing social networks and the exploring the connecting between infrastructure investments and building social capital.
Whimsy. That was the one word that kept coming to mind when visiting the various parks and public spaces throughout Copenhagen. Trampolines embedded in sidewalks are just the start. Each park was unique, playful and a reflection of the neighborhood that surrounded it. For example, Monstrum, a playground design company, created the Crooked Houses in the Brumbley neighborhood. The houses can be climbed in and on, slid down and crawled between. They are a near-identical reflection of the neighborhood homes, yet slightly topsy-turvy.
But the parks in Copenhagen aren’t just about kids. They allow for unexpected moments of joy, relaxation and, in some cases, the thrill of fear for all ages. At Folkets Park, for example, a bridge was designed that wasn’t reflective of the community’s needs, so a new designer transformed the bridge into a parkour course. The bridge has self-moderating aspects (such as a second step that is too high for most children to make) to keep it safe while still allowing for a thrill. And many parks offer cafe kiosks for adults to buy a coffee and chat with a friend or a stranger.
From Torvehallerne to Reffen by Copenhagen Street Food, there is no shortage of great food markets in Copenhagen. These sites are serving as on-ramps for entrepreneurs to test their products. They make it easier for vendors to focus on their products, while providing shared services like bathrooms, seating, trash, permitting and marketing. They also happen to be public spaces capable of attracting people from every background, if they keep an eye on price points to ensure they remain welcoming to all. Reffen’s founder, Dan Husted, has proven his concept once before with a temporary food court that gained acclaim. He hopes to do the same with this new concept in a forgotten area. “We decide the primary colors, then we invite the public to paint the canvas,” he says.
Jacob Hartmann is an instigator turned city bureaucrat, and his Sharing Copenhagen mini-grants capture a spirit of “yes” in a way not often seen in municipal government. The grants are tied to the vision for the city and allow everyday citizens to test new ideas for change, from a floating sauna to a pop-up farm to a program that encourages hitchhiking. And when the easy answer is “no,” we can’t allow for that, he works with urban innovators to get to “maybe” — and sometimes asks for permission later. From inside city government, he has developed a program that fosters active citizen engagement in making the city more sustainable, and more fun.
Nearly every city has them: natural features that were once polluted and still carry the stigma of being dirty and unsafe. Just 15 years ago, the water in Copenhagen’s harbour was so polluted that it posed a health risk. Alongside unsexy municipal efforts to make the waters clean, like wastewater treatment plants and a modernized sewage system, the city also made public space investments like the harbour baths, parks and pathways along the water that have drastically changed the use and narrative of this waterfront. Now harbour baths are packed on warm summer days, a bicycle chef uses a harbourside spot as his homebase and a maritime education center cultivates oysters and mussels in the urban waterways.
There are many reasons Copenhagen is studied, imitated and beloved. The bicycling infrastructure alone makes it something to strive for. However, the city is not perfect. No city is. While we experienced many beautiful examples of infrastructure, public space and collaboration in Copenhagen, we were jarred by the discussion of race, immigration and who truly belonged. Or, perhaps, by the lack of discussion. In some of our conversations and experiences in the city, multiculturalism was characterized as a burden, rather than a value. This article offers context for what we witnessed.
It was a stark reminder of why Reimagining the Civic Commons holds socioeconomic mixing as a goal for public space investments. Bringing people of all backgrounds to share in public life and build trust will not happen without intention.
We realized that, while we went to Copenhagen to study and be inspired, our demonstrations cities are inspirational, too. Through their approach to revitalizing and connecting public assets, they are setting a new standard for advancing civic engagement and “creating the welcome.” This realization reflects the value of learning journeys: they create moments for team members to experience, to learn, and to reflect on our shared work with a fresh perspective.

Back in 2014, the news in Copenhagen was that the modal share bikes exploded between 2012 and 2013, from 36% to 45%. A whopping 9% increase in people arriving at a destination in the City of Copenhagen for work or education. That had never happened anywhere before. At the same time, the modal share for motorists fell from 27% to 23%.
We were in the midst of one of the greatest urban transport experiments in the world, and didn’t really realise it.
For years I’ve espoused the benefits of following the simple traffic planning guide at the top of this article. Prioritise the three, inherently inter-modal transport forms on the left — bikes, pedestrians and public transport — and make driving a car a pain the ass. Make it the slower option, make it more expensive and difficult, and you’re on your way to a bright transport future. I call it A2Bism. It’s what every human who has ever lived wants the most: to go quick from A to B. Humans are like rivers — we’ll always seek out the quickest route.
So what happened between 2012 and 2013 in Copenhagen? The City made it a pain in the ass to drive a car. Not on purpose, mind you. The construction of a new Metro line, with 17 stations, was underway and, in a glorious coincidence of bad municipal communication, the city also dug up streets to upgrade the pipes for our district heating. The city was one big squiggly line — primarily for cars. In biannual surveys since the 1990s, a continuous majority of Copenhageners have declared that their primary reason for riding a bike is the fact that it’s the quickest way from A2B. The City inadvertently enabled them to go to the next level, at the expense of car traffic.
Fast-forward to late 2019. The new Metro ring line has just opened. The contstruction hoarding has been removed and roads are returning to how they were before the work began. This great urban experiment is going to go one of two ways. Either the City learns from it and keeps that squiggly line or we just return to the car-centric status quo we started with.
I’ve never been a fan of the Metro expansion. A city this size doesn’t need a metro — it needs tramways like so many other cities in Europe. I don’t advocate shoving citizens underground. They should be on street level on foot, on bicycle and in trams. My colleagues around Europe basically point and laugh when I tell them that we have bus routes with 50,000 passengers a day and the City ISN’T building tramways. The main problem in Copenhagen is that we have so much money and we have delusions of grandeur.
But hey. I guess I didn’t succeed in talking the city out of building the metro expansion. The new M3 line doesn’t go anywhere new. It just spins around in a circle and goes to places that have been easily accessible by bike for over a century. The Metro has been falsely advertising travel times for years. Advertising station to station, but not the first and last mile to and from the station. I sent out a team a few years ago to map travel times using real world scenarios and — no surprise — the bike usually beats the Metro in Copenhagen.
There are more great statistics from the glorious period of 2012–2013. The average bike trip length in Copenhagen rose 35% from 3.2 km to 4.2 km between 2012 and 2013. That means that the oft-quoted statistic about how Copenhageners cycle 1.2 million km a day needed to be upgraded to 2,006,313 km per day.
When the results of the travel survey came out back in 2014, journalists were scrambling for answers. Two researchers at DTU were “surprised”. They were quoted in the Danish press as saying things like, “uh… the City’s new bridges and traffic calming on certain streets seem to have worked. Giving cyclists carrots encourage cycling.”
The detail they forgot was that the new cycling bridges weren’t finished yet, nor was the traffic calming on Amagerbrogade. The Nørrebrogade stretch is from 2008. Cycling rose on that street by 15% but that was BEFORE 2012. Duh. Basically, there hadn’t been much carrot dangling in this city for a few years. So forget about THAT hastily thunk up theory.
It was simply a combination of construction sites and district heating pipes being upgraded. It was a fantastic urban experiment.
In the original feasibility study for the new M3 line, I found an alarming statistic buried in the document. It was estimated that cycling levels in the city would drop by 2.8% after the completion of the new line. Then we saw that fantastic, unexpected rise of 9% between 2012 and 2013.
Can we now expect a drop in the modal share for bikes of 12% in Copenhagen? Perhaps. You read it here first.
Unless, of course, the City of Copenhagen has the cajones to embrace this experiment and use it to finally make The Leap — as described by author Chris Turner — into the future of our city. Expanding and widening the cycle tracks. Reallocating space from falling car traffic to bicycles and public transport. The new BRT route in Copenhagen is a good step. Let’s see how much farther we can go. Designing cities instead of engineering them.
They can listen to me or they can just listen to the simple logic of children.
The citizens have shown us that they will be on our side if we do the right thing.
Otherwise, this rich petri dish experiment will just rot and be forgotten.

Copenhagen is the best of Europe distilled into one city, the continent at its most perfect.
From the airport, we take the metro, a clean, modern train, glass-walled to let in the pale sunlight. The airport was like this too, not the gray, military aesthetic of Reykjavik where we had a layover, but a space with curves and glass and white paint.
The ride reminds me that I’m back in Europe. Well-dressed people in coats and scarves and shoes that click against the ground step on and off. The train moves with an almost silent whir down tracks that look new but must be at least a century old. Outside, red-brick houses flash by that make me think of England: the same gabled, tiled roofs, the same compactness.
Our hostel is in the Nørrebro district, at the end of a long, connected row of 19th century red-brick buildings. On the way, we pass falafel and shawarma places, cool, dark bars in tiny storefronts, and well-lit cafes where people work on laptops. There’s at least one bike shop on every street so far, and special bike lanes separated from the road where the cyclists breeze by with enviable nonchalance.
The hostel is simultaneously hip and cozy: long wooden tables, old, circular metal lamps shining dark yellow light, and a bar that sells both coffee and beer. Large windows look out onto the quiet street, where a row of parked bikes points down to a 19th century building, mostly brick but renovated to include a glass elevator, and a church on the adjacent block looming against the gray sky.
We check in with the receptionist, who like everyone here looks at once elegant and casual, with blonde hair in a ponytail and the sleeves of her gray sweater rolled up to reveal forearm tattoos. Our room is in a separate building, and we get there by following a trail of sheep painted onto the sidewalk.
Out primal need is sleep, but after washing up, we head out to find food. Yelp suggests a “toast bar” which proves to be excellent, with dark, rich coffee and sandwiches smothered in various melted cheeses. The barista is a guy with a beanie, a beard, and tattoos who talks in a loud, echoing voice and looks like he runs a bike shop part-time. There are a few others in the cafe, but two are on laptops and the other two are a couple who aren’t talking, which gives the room a strange silence. We sit at the window, where a candle drips white wax onto the counter. Outside, bundled up pedestrians walk small dogs. In the building facing us, a guy stands at the window, having an intense cell-phone conversation. Across the street is another cafe, with a black exterior, a dark interior, and a small chalkboard sign advertising pricey lunch specials. To the left is a park with a modernist sculpture of twisted metal bars and a brick apartment building with the words “FREE GAZA” written in large, white block letters.
At one point, the two women working on their laptops go outside to smoke. They leave their jackets inside and stand huddled in their sweaters, breathing out a mix of smoke and cold breath.
From there, we walk down to what I at first think is a river or a canal but later learn is an artificial lake, created back in the Middle Ages. Across the water, the houses have that grand, 19th century look: mansard roofs, symmetrical windows, brick and stucco painted various shades of red and white. They go on endlessly down the bank and remind me of Budapest, but with warmer colors. People walk dogs and linger along the grass and feed the swans. A couple sits on a bench, talking about sex in Danish-accented and perfectly articulate English. I notice that everyone in Copenhagen is as young as we are, as if the city exists only for millennials. Los Angeles by contrast always feels slightly older, a city for tired people in their late thirties and early forties.
We cross the lake at a large embankment, along a pedestrian path separated from the busy street by trees and manicured shrubbery and past a large white pavilion, late 19th or early 20th century, situated along the water. On the other side of the lake, the street becomes H.C. Andersens Boulevard, and the buildings are bigger are more varied. Across the street is a brick building that’s an unfortunate mix of architectural styles — a neo-Gothic crenelated tower centered between two large, gabled roofs, like an orphanage from a Dickens’ novel, 19th century kitsch — and beyond it rise the flat roofs of the 20th century and the shining glass walls of the 21st. We walk leisurely down the sidewalk in these buildings’ shadows while everything breezes by us, the bikes and the cars and the pedestrians walking briskly in coats and scarves, all moving with a comforting urban indifference.
Traffic here is the densest we’ve seen in Denmark, as busy as Wilshire or Santa Monica Boulevard. Somehow, though, it all seems more orderly, less chaotic, as if like everything else here, it too is better regulated.
#
In the center of the city and across from the train station sits Tivoli Gardens, an 1840s-era amusement park supposedly built to distract the country’s population from protesting the absolute monarchy, now bedecked with Christmas lights and related items: trees, gnomes, snowmen, a building lined with several austere Nutcrackers, a wooden reindeer that looks like a Trojan Horse, a strange mirrored wall mounted with polar bear heads wearing Santa hats. There are lots of children about, and the adults are mostly mothers in groups pushing strollers, or young couples enjoying the kitsch. The park is like Disneyland, and was in fact one of the inspirations, though it’s smaller and quainter and less corporate. There are different sections corresponding to regions of the world — some pagodas representing either China or Japan, domed mosques for the Middle East or India, a lighthouse and a pirate ship possibly signifying Europe. It’s only vaguely and benignly racist, and nothing out of the ordinary for the 19th century. Bronze statues from that era are sprinkled throughout the park, including one of the founder, Georg Carstensen, looking proud and dapper with his mustache and top hat.
We stroll leisurely through the crowds, past food stands and stores selling magnets and memorabilia. I buy a glogg, which tastes pleasantly warm on a day this cold, though the best part is getting to recycle the plastic cup in one of the futuristic red kiosks, which lowers my cup down into the void with a mechanical whir and then gives me back 5 kroner. It’s an extremely practical and efficient solution to incentivize recycling, which is probably why the United States would never use it.
In the middle of the park we find an octagonal glass theater, a replica of one built in the late 1800s, which Nazi sympathizers burned down in the 1940s. Out beyond the walls of Tivoli, meanwhile, rises city hall, red brick towers capped with green spires, built in the early 20th century but speaking much more of the 1600s.
In this moment, I feel very close to the past. Like the crenelations on city hall, it feels like a ring surrounding us. Take away the phones and the electric lights and make the coats longer and give everyone top hats and we might as well be in the 1800s when the park first opened. Take away the park and give everyone ruffled collars and we’d be in the 1600s. Only 600 years before that, and we’d all be Vikings in huts.
#
The National Gallery, or the Statens Museum for Kunst, is across the city, though still within walking distance. It’s colder now, so we pull our scarves tighter as we walk down the empty streets. Soon we reach the white stone of Christiansborg Palace, and across the canal from it, along Nybrogade, a row of picturesque 17th and 18th century houses, narrow and built against each other, painted red and white and dark-brown. The sunset above streaks the sky with wisps of purple and brings out the color of each building. Even the yellow construction crane is more vivid and seems a remnant of past centuries.
We reach a small bridge and cross it into a Christmas market selling gnome statues and wooden souvenirs, and food of course. I smell sausages and see mushrooms simmering in a vat of butter. Behind me, the sun dips behind two rows of houses on opposite sides of a canal, and paints the whole scene, including a distant bronze statue, in a cold, yellow light — a sunset-hued cityscape, postcard-perfect, on all sides colors like an artist’s palette.
The city darkens as we move across it, past contemporary shops and dark streets and cyclists. It’s only 4:00, but it feels much later. A languor settles over us, and I remember our lack of sleep.
We reach Rosenborg Slot, Christian IV’s 17th century palace, and we walk across the park behind it, down a path lined with trees whose bare branches meet overhead. The castle looks romantically sinister silhouetted through the trees, but also small, “like a toy castle” K______ says, especially next to the block-long 19th century houses stretching down the parallel street. The park and the castle remind me of Oxford — a small patch of the past preserved despite the various encroaching presents pushing in from all around.
Just past the park is the museum, a grand, 19th century building reminiscent of museums from Britain, built to reflect the glory of the nation, or whatever. We’re both tired and cold, but on the walk up the large steps I feel exhilaration.
Inside, we find familiar European art. There’s a Titian portrait of a gentleman staring thoughtfully off to the left, a painting by a follower of Bosch of tiny figures against a bleak brown landscape, and quite a few Lucas Cranachs — various women with big heads and weird chins, and one work titled Melancholy depicting three oddly shaped infants trying to push a stone ball through a hoop with sticks while a winged woman watches them wistfully and several witches ride goats in a distant corner. But the highlights of the museum are the Danish pieces, a tour through one of the lesser known traditions of European art. In the first room are portraits of Danish royals from the 17th century and 18th century, all painted by the same Swedish-born court painter, C.G. Pilo, and opposite them, portraits of the bourgeoisie by Jens Juel, the most prominent one of an odd-looking middle-class family standing before a plantation. The room’s juxtaposition is perfect, ingeniously displaying the fundamental change of the 18th century, the rise and triumph of the bourgeoisie in all their awkward glory.
The next room has allegorical and historical paintings, and the following room works from the Romantic Era inspired by Caspar David Friedrich. A late-19th century room has some vaguely orientalist paintings of reclining women by Elisabeth Baumann and a wonderful work by Carl Bloch, of a man and two women eating dinner at a table and staring in surprise back at the viewer, their wine carafes tellingly half-empty, a guilty look on the man’s face. I assume his wife must be the viewer, having just caught him in the early stages of what might have become a threesome.
There’s also a beautiful late-19th century piece by J.F. Willumsen, titled En bjergbestigerske (A Mountain Climber), of a woman in a white sweater standing in front of a mountain, her walking stick leaning casually behind her, her cloak hanging lightly off her shoulders, and her hip thrust to the side as she looks boldly into the distance. According to the plaque, Willumsen’s artistic movement was called vitalism, and vitality is exactly what the woman gives off. She is more alive than the inert, distant mountains, a triumph of humanity over nature, her fierce stare made bolder by the vaguely impressionistic style of the piece, the soft colors and the murky brush strokes.
Finally, there’s a room of paintings by Vilhelm Hammershøi: cold, melancholy portraits of empty artist’s studios and solitary women, like sad Vermeers. Everything is cast over in a gray-blue pallor, all bleak, forlorn — how appropriate for the dawn of the 20th century.
We leave around 6:00 PM, very tired now, and buy falafel and shawarma from near our apartment. We eat in the hostel common room, quickly, not talking, plastic bags and foil strewn everywhere. Back in our rooms, we shower and are asleep by 8:00.

Biking in Copenhagen is exhilarating. We sail without much effort along cold winds, over bridges, down through old buildings, along wall-paved, separated bike lanes. Cold air whips at my face and nose and my poorly wrapped scarf comes untangled in the wind, but it all feels glorious moving among the herd of cyclists, not worrying about passing cars, feeling safety in numbers. We stop at an intersection behind a cluster of ten bikes, mostly young people like ourselves, some mothers with babies strapped into tiny seats, a few older men who look fitter than me, everyone leaning gracefully to one side as they wait for the light to change.
#
Christiansborg Palace, the old seat of the monarchy and the current seat of Parliament, is largely a lesser-Versailles, a 20th-century reconstruction of the site’s various older palaces which all burned down. But amidst the standard set of stately and filigreed reception rooms we find the Great Hall, a room whose expensive chandeliers and 18th century allegorical ceiling are belied by the floor tiles’ 20th-century black and white pattern and, the room’s highlight, the 17 ultra-modern tapestries. They chronicle Denmark’s history, from the Viking era to the 21st century, and are done in a self-consciously non-Western style, reminiscent of Diego Rivera’s murals in Mexico City, with vivid, wild colors, bright reds and dark greens and deep purples. We take our time before several of them, using the laminated guides to identify the various figures. Some names I know — the Viking Kings Ragnar Lothbrok and Harald Bluetooth, the Arab traveler Ibn Fadlan, Margaret “the Lady King” of the medieval Kalmar Union — but most are unrecognizable, a rush of history that swirls together in all the bright color.
There’s one tapestry titled “The Future” depicting two men in suits hovering in a nebula of blue and purple, surrounded by floating microbes and crystals and drawings of atoms and solar systems, “the bionic men” as K______ calls them. The irony of course is that Denmark already is the future: a country with safe bike lanes and universal healthcare and free higher education and a minimum wage twice as high as the United States and 5 weeks paid vacation and 32 weeks paid family leave and 85% voter turnout and overall some of the happiest people in the world.
#
The National Museum has an impressive collection of historical artifacts. We spend most of our time on the bottom floor, amidst the pre-Viking stuff, prehistoric arrowheads and cerated harpoons and burnt animals bones offered as ritual sacrifices. There are large skeletons of an aurochs and an elk, and a grave from 5000 BC with the bones of a 40-year-old woman and her 3-year-old child. The description tell us she survived several blows to the head.
Farther down we reach the Bronze Age, where we find more bodies and objects preserved in bogs or unearthed from barrows: swords, helmets, shields, jewelry, a wooden folding chair from 1400 BC, a tree-trunk coffin from 1370 with the remains of the Egtved Girl, her ragged clothing, bits of her skin and teeth, and a large bronze belt. Later, in the Iron Age we find a metal carriage pulled up from a bog, with large wheels and small decorative details, and following that the Gundestrup cauldron, a large silver bowl decorated with strange non-Viking figures and animal imagery, evidence of Denmark’s early connections with the wider world. Beyond them, finally, is the Viking era, where we find shining swords and shields, drinking horns of various sizes, large rune stones etched with unfamiliar letters, and the remnants of a wooden longboat.
The museum’s most interesting item, though, is the Trundholm sun chariot, from 1800 BC: a bronze statue of the sun pulled along in a chariot by a small horse. The sun is still gilded on one side and shines brightly in the dark museum gallery
I find this evidence of Bronze Age spirituality particularly fascinating. In our modern world the word “religion” has developed such negative connotations, dogmatism, stupidity, intolerance. But everything in this museum, from this chariot to the Early Modern allegorical ceilings on the floor above us to the animal bones in the Paleolithic room, show the need for some kind of religion — perhaps not the ones we have today, that speak of abstract principles of righteousness and morality, but ones like these, of people who viewed the afterlife and the supernatural in the literal terms of their own small worlds, who buried themselves with the physical objects they imagined they might need in whatever awaited them hereafter.
What would we be buried with, I wonder? Our phones perhaps?
#
Later, at the Christiansborg Palace stables, I notice how similar the royal carriages look to the iron age wagon pulled up from the bog.
#
We walk back along Rantzausgade, looking for a place to eat. Signs of Danish coziness are everyone, people visible in windows seated around a table, not bundled up like we are, candles before them, all eating and drinking slowly while relaxing and talking, signs of community, of warmth, inviting from the cold. We see one such group in a well-lit interior, drinking wine around half-empty plates, and I can’t tell if it’s a restaurant or just young people having dinner at home. Because of all the glass walls and big windows, at night every interior becomes so well lit, so easy to see from the street. The lack of privacy feels deliberate, as if as if projecting this image of coziness is part of the charm of the city.
We find a small place, run by a woman who both cooks and takes orders. We sit at the well-lit window, next to the dark street and split a hummus sandwich, vegan chili, and a nice, fruity Danish IPA. Afterwards, K______ goes to sleep, but I stay up in hostel with a pilsner and write. Around me is the same atmosphere I saw in all the windows. A group of Spanish tourists are chatting at my long table, everyone in sweaters rolled up at the sleeves, their scarves and jackets piled on a chair in the corner. A candle flickers in a holder amidst their beers, and mellow music plays from overhead. I feel a pleasant warmth from the outside cold.
#
The buildings on the canal-side streets of Christianshavn are nicer, richer — some are older, painted red and ochre, and some are made of brick, and along the waterfront are a few modern apartments, red stone reinforced with black metal.
Nearby is an 18th century warehouse, a long, beige, brick building, bland, unassuming, rectangular. Now it houses an art gallery and the Michelin-starred restaurant Noma, supposedly the best in the world. Dinner there would have been 2000 KR (roughly 250 dollars) each, for 6 courses. Another tourist couple are taking pictures under the sign. It’s not yet open, and the inside is mostly dark, save for the candles flickering in the window. A white shape, probably a waiter, moves in the shadows beyond the yellow flames.
Beside the warehouse is an old wooden, ship, tied to the dock and resting silently in the water. A man sits on it, eyes closed, so still he’s almost part of the boat. Against the contemporary black steel of the apartment behind it, the ship looks particularly ancient.
The warehouse’s art gallery features an Icelandic artist, whose work deals with water and climate change and methods of measurement. One of the sculptures on the second floor is a ticking clock, which echoes through the bright and empty room.
Because of the new light wood flooring and the white, newly painted walls, it’s hard to imagine this gallery as a warehouse. I try to see the sacks of grain and barrels of herring that would have lined the walls, ready to load onto merchant ships like the one outside — but I can’t. The space seems like it was built not in 1767 but in 2015, as an artistic aperitif for the haute-bourgeois diners of Noma.
#
We have lunch at Copenhagen Street Food — a hipster food market located in a former paper factory — and then bike farther north towards Refshaleøen, an old industrial area that our guidebook recommended, now mostly used for warehouse parties. The ride up takes us off the main road and along a smaller bike path that winds between broad, grassy plains, and past varied and interesting buildings, some contemporary glass and steel, some pre-industrial brick and stone. We cross a small bridge, and a large fluttering Danish flag comes into view, and below it a statue of what looks like a merman holding aloft a smaller Danish flag, angled forward, like he’s carrying it into battle. In the distance is a strange-shaped factory, a square metal hulk with a rounded top, sending darkish-white smoke up into the grey sky. The sun is still hidden, as it has been all day, and the air is bitterly cold, but the sense of adventure is enough to keep us going. Wind whips at my face, my nose is numb, my cheeks stinging, and I can feel the cold through my gloves as they’re stretched across the handlebars — but we’re moving so quickly, flying around concrete roads, bouncing across gravel, following the memory of a Google Map through an unfamiliar landscape, past signs we can’t read, the grey warehouses growing larger ahead of us. Only a few cars pass us, one or two vans, one bus, a handful of cyclists, and so it feels to us as though the landscape is all ours, Denmark a private playground.
We reach the end of a gravel road, where it meets the water. Behind us is the Mikkeler warehouse. Cinder blocks lie stacked outside the sheds and a few old cars sit empty and rusting. Everything is quiet now, and the warehouse windows dark, and no one is about expect the solitary biker who’d pulled up to a building somewhere behind us. We walk our bikes across old metal tracks which run along the gravel next to the concrete barrier separating us from the water. It’s quiet, peaceful, and majestic, to look out across the water at the row of brick buildings, now the familiar skyline of Copenhagen, the grey sky bringing out their pre-modern red. Behind us, the word “Refshaleøen” looms, written in big black letters across a gray factory building.
We take in the landscape for several long moments, our hearts still beating from our bike ride. Evidence of history stands all around us, the 18th and 19th centuries in brick out across the water, the 20th in metal stretching out behind us — but right now, it feels emphatically like the present, nothing else but 21st century, and I don’t wish we were anytime else.
After a moment, a white car turns a corner to our right and approaches us with bright headlights. The spell broken, we mount our bikes and ride back into the city.
#
From there we bike to Nyhavn then up to Amalienborg Palace, where the queen lives. We watch the guards in blue and black doing a march, which makes me think of England and Buckingham Palace. The idea of monarchy seems even more absurd up here.
From there we go inside the large church we’d seen from across the canal. It’s big and grand, but I don’t feel impressed, perhaps because Christianity hasn’t figured so prominently here. It may be the country’s Protestantism, but also probably that the religion in general only reached Scandinavia in the late 900s. It’s been Protestant almost as long as it’s been Catholic, and it was pagan up until almost the Crusades. A thousand years of Church history and tradition don’t even exist here. Warehouses seem better symbols of Copenhagen than churches.
From there, we go to the Danish Design Museum, where we find among other things an exhibit on chairs. “The chair is one of the most culture-bearing objects we ever invented,” the description says. “It reveals everything about the age and society in which it was created.” A folding chair from the 20th century makes me think of the folding chair from the bog we saw yesterday at the history museum — as with the carriages, a consistency from past to present.
From there, we bike up to the Little Mermaid Statue. The sun has almost set now, and to our right over green hills rises a stone church, beautifully backlit against the fading day. We pass though the Kastellet, a star fortress from the 1600s, the walls now mostly crumbling stone. We walk our bikes between quaint red buildings and watch three soldiers conduct a flag ceremony. They look like Boy Scouts rather than grown men.
The Mermaid is naked, like a Greek statue, and very sad, sitting atop a pile of rocks and looking longingly out across the water. It’s 4:30 now, and practically dark. Across the canal, we can see Refshaleøen, where we just were, the black letters written on the gray building. It seems so far to have come in just half a day.
#
Rosenborg Palace is dark and poorly lit, as expected in a 17th century building, and outside the latticed windows rain falls from a gray sky. But inside, the various royal treasures sparkle: gilded chests, fine wooden cabinets, small objects of ivory and amber, paintings ranging from humble landscapes to wild allegories to austere portraits of men, women, and horses, all in all an impressive collection that takes us from the castle’s construction in 1606 under Christian IV to the end of Denmark’s absolute monarchy in 1848. On the top floor is the throne room with antechambers holding the King’s collections of glass and porcelain, and in the basement is the royal treasury, with crowns and scepters and gold rings. The palace’s most interesting object, though, is tucked away in a small glass case against a wall of one of the 19th century rooms: the pen King Frederick VII used to sign the 1849 constitution.
Afterwards, we go to the Worker’s Museum where instead of rooms glorifying individual Kings we find a space honoring the nameless millions of the 20th century. In the central hall where union leaders once met hang the flags of various labor organizations, most of them a vivid, socialist red against the beige walls. In one of the exhibits in the basement, several old union flags have been stitched together into a single red banner, now reading “HOPE NOT FEAR”.
One of the rooms has a small exhibit on Thorvald Stauning, Denmark’s first social democratic prime minister, elected in 1924, and the country’s longest serving PM of the 20th century. He came from a working class background and trained as a cigar sorter before getting involved in politics. We stare at his big, bearded face in some surprise. As we’d just learned, Denmark had still been an absolute monarchy only 74 years before. And now, 90 years after, it’s one of the world’s preeminent social democracies.
If Denmark can change that much so quickly, then why can’t we, the United States, already born as a republic?
#
The only thing that frustrates us here in Denmark is the small window for lunch. It’s 3:00 and we’re wandering Kødbyen, the former meatpacking district in Vesterbro, going warehouse to warehouse only to find that most of the bourgeois restaurants are closed until dinner at 6:00. The fish place our guidebook recommended is open till 3:30, but it looks too expensive. The Indian restaurant does take-out only. A pub serving beer and burgers is open all day, but it looks like something we could find in Los Angeles. Eventually, at 3:30, we sit down in a packed Italian place. Neither of us particularly wants Italian food, but we’re both hungry. After ten minutes, though, the waiters still haven’t brought us menus, so we get up and leave. The waitress gives us an irritated look as we button up our coats.
We eat ultimately at Øl & Brød, a slightly upscale lunch place attached to the Mikkeller bar we were at earlier, open till 4:00. The tables have white tablecloths and the clientele is mostly older, except for a group of six posh guys in their early 20s, all wearing sweaters over button-downs and with the same expensive haircut, like some Danish version of the Bullingdon Club. We’re too hungry to bother converting the prices on the menu until after we order. The food is delicious: 3 open faced sandwiches (smørrebrød) and a savory chicken tartelet filled with gravy.
When the bill comes, we have just enough cash to cover it.
#
One our final day, we wait on the empty platform for our mid-morning train to Stockholm. It was warmer earlier, and even a little sunny — but now the sky is gray again and the temperature dropping.
Now and then a train passes with the smooth sound of sliding metal, and the occasional bundled up pedestrian or cyclist moves by on the street above. But for the most part everything is quiet and almost desolate. The tracks would be abandoned-looking if they weren’t so pristine and well-maintained. But this ghost-town quality is an appropriate way to bid farewell to Copenhagen, as we felt it several times over the last few days, from Nørrebro to Refshaleøen to Kødbyen. As always, everyone must be inside now, staying warm behind the yellow lights.
In looking at all the buildings, I can’t help, of course, but note the mix of centuries: the brick train station of the early 20th century in the foreground, the elegant mansard roofs of the 19th century repeating down along the street, the distant concrete of the late 20th century, and out beyond the floating glass and steel of today.
Dominating the horizon is the ugly SAS hotel, a Le-Corbusier-inspired tower of misguided modernity. There was a brief section on it in the Design Museum, about how when it was constructed in the 1950s, the architect Arne Jacobsen sincerely believed it would be the pinnacle of architectural form, functionalism perfected. It looks even worse here than similar buildings do in the United States, too clumsy next to the elegant brick or the floating glass. But considering everything else we saw, its imperfection is forgivable.

Shortly after joining Tymit, I started hearing whispers about KotlinConf’25 in Copenhagen. I’d never been to an international conference before — let alone one dedicated to a language I use every day as a Junior Android Developer. The excitement was real! I couldn’t wait to see what the global Kotlin community looked like up close.
When I finally arrived, I was blown away by the energy. The event was so well organized — registration was fast, the talks started on time, and everything felt super professional. I had been worried that most of the sessions would be too advanced for me, but there was something for everyone, no matter your experience level.
What really struck me was seeing Kotlin’s potential in action. I already knew Kotlin was powerful, but it’s something else to be in a room full of developers from all over the world, sharing their passion for the language. The enthusiasm was contagious — even developers who don’t use Kotlin every day were getting inspired! I was especially surprised to see backend and even iOS developers interested in Kotlin Multiplatform. It made me realize that Kotlin is much bigger than just Android development; it’s a growing ecosystem with a place for everyone.
Attending KotlinConf with my Tymit team made the experience even better. We picked out talks together, grabbed lunch between sessions, and just enjoyed being part of the event as a team. It helped us bond and made the whole trip unforgettable.
The conference started with an inspiring keynote by Roman Elizarov, who walked us through how Kotlin has evolved and teased some amazing features coming soon. The talk that stood out most for our team was “Rich Errors in Kotlin” by Sébastien Deleuze, which introduced a new way to handle errors in Kotlin.
Day 1 Highlights:
Day 2 Highlights:
A lot of talks focused on AI and Kotlin Multiplatform, both of which I’m really excited about. I left the conference full of ideas for side projects and new tools to try at work.
We also got to see Junie, JetBrains’ new AI assistant for their IDEs like Android Studio. We’re planning to try it out on our team, hoping it’ll help us automate tasks and boost productivity.
The Rich Errors proposal especially caught our eye — we think it could make our app even more robust.
Overall, KotlinConf’25 was an amazing experience. I’m so grateful to Tymit for making it possible. If you ever get a chance to attend, don’t hesitate — you’ll come back inspired, connected, and ready to level up!

Copenhagen is my city. I still feel like that, even after having moved (far) away and not lived here for years. It still feels like home.
I’ve walked through its parks with my boys when they were little chubby babies sleeping in warm blankets in their prams.
I’ve cycled along its lakes for a decade on my way to work.
I’ve discussed world peace and literature and art with my friends at its cafes and bars for countless hours.
I know its streets and parks, and museums and galleries like the back of my hand.
And furthermore, it is home to my closest friends.
In other words, this place has a special place in my heart, which is also why this guide and description might be a tad bias. I hope you can bear with me.
I just spent ten days in Copenhagen. And from the moment I arrived, the special Copenhagen feeling seeped through my bones and made me feel at home and eager to get out walk and cycle and sit at the harbor area with a glass of white wine and wind in my hair.

The Danish National Opera House — opened in 2005—is located on a small island in Copenhagen’s inner harbor. It is one of the most technically advanced in the world. It is also one of the most expensive, costing a cool half a billion dollars.
Situated very strategically, the opera house is sited at the end of what is called the Amalienborg Axis in the very heart of Copenhagen, Denmark’s capital city. The Axis is equivalent to the National Mall in Washington D.C. It is a stone plaza that bisects the Queen’s residential compound, terminating at the Marble Church, the largest in Denmark, and a holy shrine. Directly opposite, and clearly visible across the harbor, sits the Opera House.
The bulk of the money to build it came from the A. P. Møller Foundation, who controls the enormous fortune of the founder of the gigantic Danish shipping company, Maersk. Møller himself has a reputation for being imperious and heavy-handed.
The imposing facade of the very Danish Modern glass and concrete Opera House looms over the harbor. It was designed by the prominent Danish architecture firm, Henning Larsen. Like most established architectural design firms, Henning Larsen is big and conservative, but not that conservative. As the story goes, A.P. Møller arbitrarily overrode some of Henning Larsen’s design decisions, and this did not please the architects. Møller’s ham-fisted meddling with the architect’s design is at the heart of this story of Danish rebellion.
Less than a mile from the Opera House is the autonomous neighborhood of Christiania, encompassed entirely within the city limits of Copenhagen. Formerly an Army barracks, Christiania was abandoned in the late 1960s only to be occupied by hippie squatters in the early 1970s. The authorities never bothered to kick them out and left them to their own devices, so they established their own informal government and rules. It’s home to several successful businesses like the eponymous cargo bicycles that are ubiquitous in bike-loving Copenhagen. Today, the community is home to about 850 people, most of whom are artists, craftsmen, performers, and other creative people who, like their hippie forbears, lean to the left politically.
Christiania, though, is famous for marijuana. For more than 40 years the Copenhagen authorities have turned a blind eye to widespread pot selling and smoking as long as it stayed within the boundaries of the former army base. Christiania residents confine pot sales to one short avenue, often called “Green Street.” Photography on Green Street is strictly forbidden, and brandishing a camera might get you summarily escorted out of town by a dozen offended citizens. Even though Christiania now has its own government, commerce, mayor, and many respectable full time residents, it remains a bold counter-culture statement right in the heart of conservative, Christian, Copenhagen, a living symbol of tolerance and independence. Christiania also proudly flies its own flag, which is orange with three yellow circles in a horizontal line. More than anything else, this iconic flag represents the anti-establishment spirit of Christiania.
The imposing Opera House, on the other hand, is an important civic building representing traditional values and the triumph of global trade and capitalism. But even vastly wealthy, self-important capitalists need to hire creative people, and it is unwise to abuse them, as A.P. Møller learned.
Long after the industrialist Møller forced the unwanted changes on Henning-Larsen’s design, and long after he innocently approved the lighting plan, which included the installation of three gigantic round chandeliers in the auditorium foyer, it gradually dawned on the good citizens of Copenhagen that the Henning-Larsen architectural firm had got the last laugh. At night, after it gets very dark, the entire Opera House glows a certain shade of orange, and the three giant round chandeliers shine a certain shade of yellow, all in a horizontal line with a characteristic spacing, all clearly visible from the Marble Church, the Amalienborg Axis, and the Queen’s Palace. It’s a gentle, subtle, anti-establishment gesture of defiance to those with more dollars than sense.
Heartwarming, isn’t it?

Last week I went to Copenhagen, Denmark. It was my first time traveling outside the country since the trip I took to Italy with my friends Corey and Amanda in 2018, a vacation booked when at least two-thirds of us were in the throes of romantic angst. On that trip we drank a lot of Aperol spritzes, ate arancini from a beachside stand most mornings we were in Sicily, and had the best pasta of our lives in Rome. Due to a language mix-up we also accidentally ordered seven sandwiches instead of a charcuterie board. It was a great vacation and I returned to the United States more tan and improbably more relaxed than I had been before. (I had not been relaxed when we left.)
This trip to Denmark was not a vacation but a trip for work. The startup I work for has an office in Soho, where most of the business functions of the company operate, and another office in Copenhagen, where our design, product and engineering teams are located. In the spirit of the company value of hygge and togetherness, I boarded a plane at Newark headed for Copenhagen last Sunday evening. Though I intended to knock myself out and sleep for the entirety of the 8-hour flight (I had a vision of landing in Copenhagen at 7 am local time, looking and feeling fresh as a daisy and invigorated by a good night’s sleep) Scandinavian Airlines had other plans for me — namely, feeding me two large meals throughout the…

The Liberators: Unleashing Organizational Superpowers

Last week, we visited the LEGO Group’s office in Copenhagen. Where the office in Billund is hard to miss, the one in Copenhagen is nicely hidden in the city center. It reminded me of Harry Potter searching for platform nine-and-three-quarters. 😄
One reason for our visit was to gather feedback from real users of our product, Columinity. We can look long and hard into our crystal ball to search for clues about customers’ experiences or ask them instead. With 150 active teams, it shouldn’t be too difficult to find someone using it. 🔎
During our session, we focused on talking with various Agile Coaches using it to support their teams in continuously improving based on scientific insights and evidence-based feedback.
We *almost* started a classic open discussion (the horror 😱)…
Luckily, the idea of running a lightweight version of the Liberating Structure “User Experience Fishbowl” came to mind. This seemed to make sense, given our goal of collecting real users’ experiences. 🤔
The flow was simple:1. A small group of Agile Coaches positioned themselves in a circle in the center. For about 10 minutes, they started talking about their experiences using Columinity. 2. At the same time, Denny de Waard, myself, and a few others were listening. Whenever a question came to mind, we threw fish food (representing the question) into the bowl. Christina Mumm had the brilliant idea of using LEGO bricks as “fish food.” 🐠 3. After 10 minutes, we flipped roles. The users became the listeners, and we (the original listeners) positioned ourselves in the middle and shared what we noticed in the first round. What experiences stood out? What did we like, surprise, and maybe even worry about?4. For a final time, the users returned to the center of the fishbowl and continuously shared new thoughts and experiences. 5. After roughly 45 minutes ⏰, we closed the UX Fishbowl.
I considered it a valuable experience. It resulted in lots of feedback we can use to improve the use of our product. It was also an excellent (IMHO) example of how you can use Liberating Structures in a lightweight manner without any preparation.
Now, you probably think:
“Hey, why haven’t you included real-life pictures? Did it actually happen? Or are you just making things up here…”
Fair point. You’ll never know, but it’s a nice story, right? 😃
Additional thoughts by Christina Mumm — Agile Coach Competency Lead at the LEGO Group:
“This is not only modeling the value of Liberating Structures ;) It’s about deliberately creating opportunities for necessary conversations across any divide. In this case, we are choosing to close the gap between internal and external (customer- vendor). Working as one team brings value to everyone much faster. Why would we want to keep a distance? I hope we can inspire others to do the same by walking the talk this way.”
Whether it happened or not, why don’t you try this yourself? If you already have used UX Fishbowl, how did it work for you?

If you are visiting that part of Europe that is carbon neutral and scores high on sustainability, you’ll be rewarded with a perfect, clean, and green getaway like Copenhagen. From the perspective of someone like me who is an advocate for sustainable travel, their endeavors to protect the environment are laudable. I had the privilege of visiting the beautiful, bike-friendly capital of Denmark, endowed with a rich history and culture. It had long been on my bucket list and finally, the dream was fulfilled. Copenhagen was everything that I hoped for and more.
We could manage to set aside only 3 days out of our 20-day Europe itinerary and to make matters worse the weather Gods were not on our side. The day we landed was bright and sunny, but incessant rains dampened our spirits on the main day that we were there and had reserved for sightseeing. However, we refused to let the gloomy weather get us down and made the most out of our time in the city.
Copenhagen has something for everyone. From world-class museums and art galleries, centuries-old castles and palaces, and delicious food, to charming shops, cafes, and entertainment parks.
For history buffs Christianborg Palace and the Rosenberg Castle would be fascinating, giving a walkthrough the lives of Danish royalty. You may feel like skipping them if you’re there for a short time, but these grand places are worth a visit. We too were in a dilemma whether to go inside or miss it, but finally, it was a yes from everyone, and it was a great decision.
The center of the Danish Parliament, the Christianborg Palace may not have attractive exteriors, and you may not be much impressed. But once you step inside you’ll find the opulent interiors awe-inspiring. From the decor and chandeliers to the furniture and artwork, a glimpse into the lives of royalty was fabulous.
The most famous touristy spot in Copenhagen is Nyhaven. Once a 17th-century fishing village, is now a dazzling waterfront entertainment zone, with a string of cafes, restaurants, and brightly painted houses. An amusing anecdote about the reason behind these vibrantly painted houses is so that the owners recognize their homes after returning drunken in the night from the bar.
You’ll also come across centuries-old iconic wooden ships at Nyhaven, taking you back in time. It’s a pleasure to walk beside the canal and enjoy the views. There are coffee shops with fireplaces that provide hot drinks and offer a haven from the chilly winds outside. Must try is the crispy, layered Danish pastry, which is delicious.
The Little Mermaid — based on a fairy tale written by a Danish author, this bronze statue of the little mermaid sitting on a rock is situated by the waterside at the Langelinie promenade. This is a great photo spot full of tourists.
Another Copenhagen highlight is a guided boat tour of the canal. Find significant historical landmarks on this tour as described by the guide, while admiring the beauty and listening to engrossing tales from the past. The witty incidents narrated had the audience enthralled. It was interesting to know that the author of the famous story the `Ugly Duckling was a resident of Copenhagen too.
Something that is unpredictable in Copenhagen, like most of Europe is the weather. Our canal trip was therefore interrupted by showers, but thankfully the boat had a glass roof so we could still take in the scenery. Considering the erratic weather having raincoats and umbrellas with you is a necessity. Even though it may mean hauling heavier bags, it is preferable than getting drenched in the midst of your vacation.
Several modern and historic museums dot the city. We decided on the Design Museum, having a very contemporary vibe and numerous masterpieces on display.
“Sail while the breeze blows, wind and tide wait for no man” — Danish Proverb
Impromptu plans are what make holidays enjoyable. The museum was on the waterfront, and from the terrace, we located a ferry point. Just as the last of the ferries was about to depart in the evening, we hurried and got on to it for what turned out to be an adventurous ride. Though there wasn’t any specific agenda, and the program was made on the spur of the moment, the sunset boat ride was worth it. And doubly so, it was absolutely free.
Getting around is quite easy in the capital of Denmark. Though there are various modes of transport, like, metro, bus, cab, or even ferry, using a bike is common. Specific tracks on the sides of roads, make it so convenient for cycling. It not just saves fuel but keeps the surroundings free of carbon emissions. Walking around on foot appeals to some as well.
Staying at the centrally located Mayfair Hotel was a pleasant experience. Not only were the rooms comfortable, the food and ambiance nice as well. As much as we wanted to, because of a shortage of time, missed going to the famous Tivoli Gardens. Probably, a sign that we ought to come here again.

Before you actually begin your dream journey, your Copenhagen Trip Planner is here. Copenhagen is the largest city in the country and also the capital of Denmark. Sitting on the two coastal islands, Zealand and Amager, this beautiful city is full of historic attractions. Consulting your vacation guide can be a good option if you do not want to miss any particular places of interests here. Every year a huge number of tourists visit this city which still possesses a distinct touch of European culture. Copenhagen is packed with various great attractions and tourist spots. Here are some of the best places that you can include in your travel planner if you really want to make most of your time here.
Among the various interesting places in the city, including Christiansborg Palace in your Copenhagen Trip Planner as top priority can be a brilliant idea. Located in central Copenhagen, on a small island, this palace is still used by royal families as the seat of Danish Parliament, Prime Minister’s office, and Supreme Court. Boasting more than 800 years of history, this palace has plenty of attractions to offer you, such as the royal reception hall, the Chapel, the Ruins, and the Royal Stables. The tallest viewing platform of the city is in this palace which offers an excellent panoramic view of this beautiful city.
Tivoli Garden is basically an amusement park in Copenhagen and is a must visit for all tourists. Founded in the year of 1843, it is known as an international attraction and also a national treasure of Denmark. With more than twenty types of different rides, various cafes and restaurants, Tivoli Gardens has become an absolute wonderland for the visitors. It is also the second oldest functioning amusement park in Denmark.
Your trips to this Danish capital may remain incomplete if you do not add a visit to the Little Mermaid in your Copenhagen Trip Planner. Made of bronze and granite, this sculpture was a gift to the city from the Danish brewer C. Jacobsen. Apart from being the city’s most famous tourist attraction, it is also the official emblem of the city.
If the history and culture of a new city are something that truly interests you then your journey guide may suggest you visit the National Museum of Denmark. You can find exhibitions from almost all the different periods and ages here. Exhibitions from the Stone Age, the Middle Ages, the Viking Ages, the renaissance period and modern Danish history are perfectly displayed here.
Nyhavn Harbour can also be there in your travel plan. At the very end of the harbor, you can witness the anchor which is kept there as a memorial of those Danish sailors who lost their lives during World War II. With the brightly painted houses by the harbor and the museum ships, this place happens to be the most featured one in the photographs, describing the city.
If you have not yet included Bakken in your Copenhagen Trip Planner, then it’s high time that you would. Being the oldest amusement park in the world, Bakken is a wonderful green area where you can enjoy various exciting adventure rides. In the entire Scandinavia, it is the only amusement park that has more rides than any other in the country.
By including these most-visited places of Copenhagen in your vacation plan, you can have the most unforgettable experience in your life. Let’s keep your Copenhagen Trip Planner with you as your best guide and start exploring the majestic city Copenhagen.

I recently returned from a two-week trip to Europe, and I obviously spent a lot of time observing pedestrian and bicycle culture and infrastructure. Rather than simply envy our neighbors across the pond for their walkable and bike-friendly cities and believe that we Yanks could never match their high active transportation mode shares, I was constantly thinking how I could translate my experiences and observations into on-the-ground change here in the U.S. I also realized that we have some progressive transportation infrastructure on our own soil to be proud of.
We first made the pilgrimage to Copenhagen — the Promised Land for many Americans in the bicycle/pedestrian profession… And it lived up to the hype! The comprehensive network of physically separated cycle tracks was incredible and refreshing, of course, but I was more impressed by how easy it was to walk around the city. Several of the major streets were actually pedestrianized, with motor vehicles prohibited. While some examples of this concept exist in the U.S. — including Santa Monica’s Third Street Promenade — they feel rather manufactured and not organic.
Even with the dreary weather, we were sad to leave the playground of Copenhagen. But Paris was awaiting us! I had a mental image of Paris as the small, charming town along the river that is shown in films and travel magazines. However, I was immediately made aware of the city’s sprawling size and wide, auto-clogged boulevards. In a way, I was reminded of my hometown of Los Angeles, except that Paris’s Metro system blankets the region. In a flip from my experience in Copenhagen, I had gone to Paris expecting a walker’s paradise, but instead saw a budding cycling haven. The city had already squeezed cycle tracks along many of the major boulevards, and the famous Vélib’ public bicycles were as common a sight as sidewalk cafés and baguettes. The bicycle network appears set up to help Parisians close the “first mile/last mile gap” that often exists in a trip using public transit. I would love to see Los Angeles and other U.S. cities with mass transit networks pursue a similar course.
Finally, we ended our vacation by hanging out in the pedestrian paradises that are old Spanish cities. Barcelona, our first stop, was seemingly built to make walking a pleasurable experience, with interesting side streets, promenades, and commercial districts around every corner. Barcelona and other Spanish cities like Granada and Toledo also make good use of shared streets, or woonerfs, to make streets safe in constrained neighborhoods.
Finally, the many plazas and parklets in Spain’s cities were a never-ending source of resting space and excellent people watching.
Although very different in many ways, Los Angeles can and should follow the lead of European cities by creating safe and pleasurable spaces for people to walk or bike and be outside enjoying our near-perfect weather. And I’m proud to say that the LA region is beginning to seriously take on that mission. Both Long Beach and Temple City now have cycle tracks. LA County Metro is planning a regional bike share program. And through the LA Department of Transportation’s People St. program, several plazas and parklets have been created or are planned for previously underused road space. I’m excited that our leaders are beginning to push for progressive changes to restore some balance to how we move around our own cities.

Working in 3 Labs Over 5 Weeks in Copenhagen— What I Learned,https://moloonaila.medium.com/working-in-3-labs-over-5-weeks-in-copenhagen-what-i-learned-beb76abdf8c5,"Sign up

In the ninth grade I came across bioplastics, plastics derived from renewable biomass, for the first time. Since then I have spent hundreds of hours researching the space and coming up with an idea for a bioplastic made from duckweed. The thought process was that bioplastics today generally come from biomass like corn, potatoes, sugar cane, etc. but these take up acres of land to grow and need to be consumed by humans (especially with the rise in climate change causing a shortage in food supply). Thus, duckweed, although possessing a bit of an odd name, has been a large focus of mine for two years now.
Shortly after I discovered bioplastics, the CEO of Pond Biomaterials became a mentor of mine. Pond is a startup based out of Denmark and I have been working with them (virtually) for these two years. This summer, though, I finally got to come to Denmark in person and Pond set me up to work in three labs across Copenhagen for five weeks, including Novozymes, the Technical University of Denmark, and the University of Copenhagen.
The reason for three labs instead of just one is that to build this project requires work in many different areas of science, including microbiology, biochemistry, and chemistry.
Below, I will go over what I worked on in each lab as well as my biggest learnings / takeaways.
Novozymes was the first lab I worked in. This is a private company, and the world leader in industrial enzyme production. I had never worked on my project in a lab that was not in a university, so this was a very different experience. I worked closely with Ulla Rosenberg and Kim Borch, two individuals I am incredibly lucky to have met. I always had help in the lab and the support was unreal. My days were usually 9–11 hours long but there was always someone by my side sticking it out with me and it was honestly so much fun.
For the first week I worked on an optimized enzymatic procedure for the duckweed. We experimented with different parameters and got the highest glucose concentrations I have seen out of my duckweed. I learned a lot about enzymes themselves, dilution series, and how to run an assay.
The next few days, I worked on fermenting the sugar solutions where I was in the microbiology lab with Robin Dorau trying to produce lactic acid. Some of the things I learned about were buffering capacities, measuring the optical density of bacteria via a spectrophotometer, and how to ensure the bacteria had enough nutrients. We ended up getting very high lactic acid concentrations, although I also learned about some other compounds present in my mixtures that have led to more discoveries about the duckweed and experiments themselves.
We were working large scale, with hundreds of grams of duckweed, so we had to be innovative with our setups. It doesn’t matter what lab you are working in: you always have to do some improvisation. Here are some examples of us simply having to figure it out:
1.) We had to have our samples stirring at a certain temperature for the enzymes to optimally operate, however our system kept dropping in temperature. In order for the setup to be self sufficient, we improvised and used aluminum and towels for insulation, and poured boiling water into the tub our samples were in. It worked like a charm, but definitely looked a little interesting.
2.) Another scenario where we had to just figure it out was when our samples would not filter prior to fermentation. I have been working on a smaller scale in Ottawa so although filtering was an issue I wasn’t on as much of a time crunch and had less material to work with. What we ended up doing was going to the brewery lab and their pressure filters (used for beer) worked perfectly. This taught me another valuable lesson, which was the importance of interconnectedness and asking others — even if in a completely different space of work — for help. Working at Novozymes was so unique because there are so many individuals working on different things and yet everyone can help each other, even a beer brewery lab and a biotech lab.
One more valuable lesson for me was to not always trust the results you get. When we did colorimetric analysis (basically determining the concentration of a chemical compound using a colour reagent) we got very low lactic acid concentrations which was honestly very disappointing because I never would have expected my results to be in this ball park. Later, though, we ran an HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography, a method that is much more precise) and our results were over 20x higher than we had initially thought. This really changed the next steps that had to be taken, so it’s important to ensure that when doing a test like an assay or something generally less precise (usually because they are easier and cheaper) they can have large margins of error in the results they yield.
The second lab I worked in was at the Technical University of Denmark, DTU. Here I was working on something I had never done before: the separation of lactic acid from the fermentation mixture. This process was quite difficult and was certainly not a success, but I learned a lot about purification technologies and namely, their complexity.
My biggest takeaway was to not underestimate how much time something new can take. I would have figured I would have learned this by now but it’s easy to have too high of expectations in science. Since I had never worked on the purification side of things before, I did not fully comprehend the difficulty of it until I tried it out. Researching and ideating is one thing, and actually doing it is something else entirely! For example, we attempted something called an azeotropic distillation on my first day (see the photo below) which theoretically should have worked quite easily but in fact did not at all. Even removing the water without evaporating other compounds was hugely complex and when I researched what to do, I was greeted with hundreds of research papers.
Thus, I learned something else that was very important which was to keep my solutions as clean as possible. What I mean by this is that in prior steps to the purification I am adding enzymes, buffers, extracts, etc. to my mixtures, but I have to in reality remove everything to get pure lactic acid at the end. When working on prior steps it is very important to keep in mind the end goal and future steps that must also be optimized for.
Another takeaway was to utilize online videos for the use of analytical equipment because there is so much online that can help. I had to be much more independent in this lab, and through a video I learned how to do infrared spectroscopy which was very helpful.
I had a hard time coping with failure at this lab overall but it offered many insights into what comes next in this project, as this step will be the key to producing the bioplastic and will be a challenge on its own.
Finally, I worked at the University of Copenhagen with Peter Ulvskov, a professor in plant biology. This tied more into what I had been working on at Novozymes, but instead of optimizing the enzymes being added to the biomass we were working on what could happen even prior to this: cell wall degradation, mechanical methods of breakdown, etc. Honestly, I found this so much fun and full of learning. I truly got to understand the duckweed to a greater extent, like what exists in it that may inhibit bacterial growth, what polysaccharides it contains, and how the starch granules behave. For the first time I got to look at the duckweed under a microscope — microscopy was actually key in my work at KU. For example, before degradation of the cell walls, we could see the starch granules stuck in the duckweed cells (left image, where the granules are dark blue) and then after we could see the granules released from the cells (right image).
Something else we worked on was the removal of pigmentation from the duckweed to explore how this may hinder future steps in my procedures (see the below picture, where the rightmost beaker contains a much lower content of chlorophyll). I found I was looking at duckweed through a different lens because of how much unique experimentation I got to do at the university.
Likely my biggest takeaway was the significance of writing absolutely everything down and taking many pictures. This is of course something I have always had to do in the lab but Peter put a lot of emphasis on organization and I came up with a much better system for taking notes, keeping track of which photos are which, etc. It can be easy to recognize what a microscopy image is showing a few minutes after you’ve taken it, but a month later, the importance of that image to you may be gone.
My second takeaway was to keep in mind everything that is required for each part of my project and look at how this may translate to a real world protocol. For example, when we were grinding the duckweed we made sure to use equipment that could be scaled up easily as opposed to only something that works small scale.
Another one of my learnings was the importance of going back to the very beginning — the foundations of a project — because this is where the most improvement can transpire. Breaking down the cell walls to a greater extent was not helping me in the purification of the lactic acid, but eventually it could help me get more lactic acid to work with by creating improvements in glucose yields. Every step holds weight.
All in all, getting to spend time in Copenhagen was such a neat experience and I am so grateful to everyone who helped me. I also felt that I became a more independent person as I lived alone for around five days which I have never done before! Getting to meet my supervisor Martin from Pond was a huge highlight, as well as exploring the wonderful city (and the crêpe stands👩🏽‍🍳).
Thank you so much for reading this! I’m a 17-year-old learning about where sustainability meets technology, and am the author of the “Chronicles of Illusions” duology. If you want to see more of my work, connect with me on LinkedIn, Twitter, or subscribe to my newsletter!

I remember seeing the term Hygge for the first time while looking for Airbnb experiences in Copenhagen. A quick google search showed that Hygge meant “a cozy quality that makes a person feel content and comfortable”. It gave me the image of resting by the fireplace on a cold winter’s night, which didn’t feel too relevant for my upcoming summer trip, so I kind of forgot about it.
When I was in Copenhagen, I remember feeling occasional waves of inner joy, in a “just glad to be here” kind of way. It was otherwise sublime and hard to describe, and even harder to attribute the cause. I didn’t try to analyze it too much — after all, I was on vacation and taking in the idyllic vibes of a Danish summer.
On the metro to the airport, we zoomed past a father and his child running through some grassy expanses with the backdrop of the sea. I remember feeling a sense of delight and ease, and recalled the term Hygge; that’s when I realized I had profoundly learned what it meant during my trip.
I won’t try to describe what Hygge is; I reckon you have to experience this for yourself to understand. But I’ll tell you some things when I was in Copenhagen that brought me Hygge, and also some that did not.

It only takes me about four days in Copenhagen before I start Googling “Copenhagen apartments for rent” and “Can Americans buy property in Denmark?”. I love how easy it is to walk everywhere, how stylish it is, how friendly the people are, and (of course) how delicious the food is. We planned our trip to Europe around dinner at Noma. While Noma was worth the pilgrimage, it was far from the only good meal of our trip. Here’s my recap of our Copenhagen dining adventures.

Name: Malene Sabinsky
What do you do all day? Boss people around and talk very loudly– no really, that’s what project managers do. *laughs*
Hometown: Copenhagen, Denmark
Hunting territory: Copenhagen and beyond
Can you tell us a bit about the difference between the street art in you town compared to the rest of the world? As in, what makes your town really stand out!? I don’t know if there’s a major difference, as a lot of international artists have made pieces in Copenhagen too, but of course the local artist make it completely unique.
Where do most artists get there inspiration from in your town? That would be unfair of me to answer, as I don’t know.
Is there more currated or illegal work? The murals are mostly curated, but there is also a fair bit of illegal activity
What is that one artwork you need to see in your hunting territory? I have to cheat and choose two: DALeast because I cycle past it everyday, and never tire of looking at it. Copenhagen, for me, wouldn’t be the same without it now. And ‘Creativity is Freedom’ by Danish artist Don John. I really love his work, and there are so many great pieces by him around town.
Who introduced you to the street art scene? Nobody did. I am still waiting for my official introduction :-)
When were you infected with the hunter virus? I’m a newbie really *laughs* I’ve had an interest for at long time. I lived in London for many years, and it’s hard not to notice and appreciate street art when living there. But it didn’t actually become a real (active) passion until summer 2015, when i saw the Surface exhibition by Danish photographer Søren Solkær in Copenhagen. And alongside this, I followed the creation of new murals for “Outdoor Surface” (the DalEast piece being one of these).
My hunting kit includes: It’s a very simple kit: bicycle, iphone, headphones and wind in my hair.
When you are out shooting, how much of it is instinctual versus planned? With increased passion comes increased planning! Of course I still stumble upon new pieces when on general eplorations, but mostly I plan to go to a certain place, because there is something specific I want to see.
Do you take photos more for yourself, or for others? Mostly for myself, but I don’t mind sharing :-)
How would you define your style in taking photo’s or writing a (instagram) post? Lacking style in general! I’m not a skilled photographer, so it’s a good thing the art speaks for itself. The same goes for posts. I’m too impatient to write a lot, so an artist credit and an emoji tends to suffice.
Who are some of your favorite classic photographers, and how did they influence you? I like a lot of photographers: Cindy Sherman, Martin Parr, Nan Goldin, William Eggleston, Andreas Gursky etc. And of course I have to mention both Søren Solkær and Martha Cooper, for combining the art of photography and street art. They haven’t influenced me in any particular way, I just admire their skill and art.
What is your biggest challenge of being a hunter? Too much rain, and too little time.
What is the best piece of advice I can give to newbie hunters? Be curious and open-minded. Credit artists where you can , they deserve it. Do it out of passion and interest, not the likes.
Or ignore all that, and just download the app and get yourself a bicycle.
Can you tell us the most exiting hunter story? Any close calls with getting your equipment robbed or caught by the police? Haha, no close calls at all. I’m too well behaved.
I will share a non-exciting, but vivid hunter memory with you though: I was touring California (and beyond) with my two kids a few months back, and when we stopped over in Vegas, we had to go hunting. I had no connection on my phone, so my son got the job of navigating using the Street Art Cities website (see, it’s so easy even a kid can use it!). After some time with no results, I was getting pretty hot and bothered, but suddenly my son stops and points. And I very loadly exclaim: “Woaw, Martin Whatson”. The look of pride in his eyes for having found it, combined with the beauty of the wall, was just priceless.
My most recent discovery in the street art scene is: Not so recent, but during the summer I found some great stencils in Copenhagen, there are four really close to each other. I haven’t found any more across town, and don’t know anything about the artist, apart from the signature ‘Jochum’. I’m dead curious, really like the pieces, and want to see and know more.
Name a few artists you like to follow and why. These artists are all Danish, have their very own style, are super talented, and can be found around the streets of Copenhagen:
Do you collect art books, T-shirts, and other things? What’s the most valuable item for you? No, I’m not much of a collector as such, but I’m dead chuffed with a small piece by Tankpetrol, I bought and just received in the post the other day.
What is your favorite location fellow hunters should definitely visit? Don’t miss a visit to Bolsjefabrikken where local artist make new pieces all the time, cruise down Rentemestervej — possible the one street in Copenhagen with the mist murals. And of course Christiania — for art and the rest — but don’t pull out your camera on pusher street unless you specifically are collecting “exciting hunter stories”.
What are the benefits you find being part of a street art collective? Having found so many people with the same passion and so many of whom are very knowledgeable, and great photographers. I will start inviting myself for coffee and tours when I travel, so be warned.
Last but not least. What is the most valuable thing about Street Art Cities? The app is fantastic. It’s a great resource when travelling.

Copenhagen surprised me in the best way. It’s not loud or flashy, but quietly brilliant — measured, functional, and full of life in subtle ways. It might not be for everyone, but for me personally, this was the best city I’ve visited so far.
Here’s a breakdown of my impressions, what’s worth seeing, and what (and where) to eat.
Copenhagen feels like it was designed for a self-contained urban human — someone who values clean lines, efficient systems, and doesn’t need the sun to be in their top three happiness factors.
It’s expensive, but everything you get feels fair. There’s no sense of being ripped off — just a steady, Nordic standard of quality. English is almost a second official language, spoken equally well by both the young and the old. That stood out and made everything smoother.
The people are polite, helpful, but emotionally reserved. Not cold, not snobby — just calmly distant. The city itself is beautifully quiet: no diesel engines, no honking, no chaos. Cash is barely accepted, tips are not expected, and digital payments are the norm.
Public transport is flawless — fast, clean, reliable, and not overcrowded. The metro system especially impressed me. The cycling culture is on another level: wide, protected bike lanes on both sides of the street, and visibly fewer cars and parking spots than in Zagreb.
It’s not as immigrant-friendly as, say, London, and that affects the atmosphere slightly. Still, Copenhagen delivers a kind of living standard and order that’s rare anywhere else.
Home of CarlsbergMore than just a brewery tour. This place ties together Danish beer, scientific progress, and art collecting. Jacob and Carl Jacobsen — father and son — are the central figures here. The father was a master brewer, the son added branding finesse and a love of the arts. They even established their own science lab, where in 1883 they solved the problem of “beer sickness” (a sudden souring of beer) by isolating pure yeast. Today, they’ve created a keg that triples shelf life. The visit includes a tour and beer tastings.
GlyptoteketA stunning museum founded by the Jacobsen family, housing collections of Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Danish, and French art. My favorites were the sarcophagi, the mummies, and The Prodigal Son sculpture. The building itself is a piece of art.
Tivoli GardensThe second-oldest amusement park in the world and the inspiration for Disneyland. It’s charming and atmospheric, though pricey. I took my first and probably last rollercoaster ride here. Worth it for the vibe alone.
Danish Design MuseumDesign is taken seriously here — from childhood education to everyday product aesthetics. We saw an exhibition on the development of Irma, a 137-year-old supermarket brand that brought graphic design into daily life. Another focused on natural, innovative materials (chairs from mushrooms, lamps made from cow intestines, dresses from milk-industry waste). Unfortunately, the furniture design exhibit was closed for renovations.
NyhavnA classic Copenhagen postcard: colorful houses along a canal, boats bobbing in the water. It’s a bit of a tourist trap, but still worth seeing — especially if the sun comes out. HC Andersen once lived in one of these houses while writing his first fairy tale.
Freetown ChristianiaA self-declared autonomous neighborhood built on former military land. Around 1,000 people live there — hippies, artists, and others drawn to alternative living. It’s more a sociological curiosity than an actual utopia. Don’t expect magic, but it’s interesting for a short visit.
Rosenborg Castle & KastelletRosenborg is a small Renaissance castle built by Christian IV in the early 1600s. It’s beautifully preserved. Nearby, Kastellet is a pentagon-shaped military fortress, still in use today and perfect for a peaceful stroll.
Food in Copenhagen is pricey. Meals range from 110 to 250 DKK (€15–€34), pastries from 40 DKK (€5.50), and craft beers between 60–80 DKK (€8–€11). But the quality makes it worthwhile.
Here’s what stood out:
Gasoline GrillNamed one of the top 27 burgers in the world by Bloomberg — and the only one from Europe. It’s served from a small former gas station with four cheerful employees. Probably the best burger I’ve ever had.
Juno the BakeryThe cardamom bun here genuinely moved people to tears. The founder is a former Noma chef, and it shows. The almond croissant and pain au chocolat are also top-tier.
Format Café (inside the Design Museum)New Nordic simplicity done right. The carrot soup with tarragon oil, cream, almonds, and sourdough was exceptional. The open sandwich with chicken, beetroot, capers, kale, horseradish, and a mystery cream was surprisingly rich and complex. Easily one of the best meals.
SeksA stylish brunch spot. The chive-and-pepper omelet was solid, the apple pancake with cream excellent, and the Moroccan green tea unforgettable. Small portions, though.
Warpigs BrewpubTexas BBQ in a Danish setting. Three meats (smoked pork, beef, spicy sausage), mac & cheese, beans, slaw, and on-site craft beer. Heavy, indulgent, and very American in vibe — but worth it.
Broens Street Food MarketGreat spot on the docks. We had organic fish & chips with an IPA under the sun. Simple, fresh, satisfying.
Sankt Peders BakeryThe oldest bakery in Copenhagen, open since 1652. Try the Wednesday cinnamon roll — sold only on Wednesdays. They make up to 4,000 in a single day.
Absalon FolkehusetA unique community lunch in a converted Lutheran church. We had rice with spinach, almonds, coriander, and a peppery sauce. At just 60 DKK, it was the cheapest cooked meal we found — and still delicious.
Pølser Hot DogsThe Danish street food staple. Tried two: one at Carlsberg and one at John’s Hotdog Deli at the main station (Bourdain-approved). Both were solid, nothing mind-blowing.
GRØDA porridge-focused mini-chain. The classic version with apples, cinnamon, roasted almonds, and caramel was pure comfort food.
Pico PizzaStandard, good pizza. Clean, consistent, and just what you need after a few fancier meals.
Copenhagen isn’t trying to win you over with flash or charm. It doesn’t need to. It simply works — quietly, confidently, and beautifully. It’s a place that respects both the individual and the collective experience. For someone who appreciates subtle details, structure, and thoughtful living, this city delivers on every level.
Without exaggeration, this is the best city I’ve ever visited — but I’d never move there, unless the sun files for residency too. 😆

Can London follow Copenhagen's heat networks example?
All London boroughs are working to reach net zero, and decarbonising how we heat our buildings is a crucial part of that journey. One key solution here is the implementation of heat networks. These currently exist in pockets of London, but we must introduce new networks and connect more households to help us towards net zero.
In May, London Councils and The Danish Embassy in London worked together to take a group of London borough officers to visit the Greater Copenhagen area, a world leader in heat networks. The visit was funded by the State of Green (a not-for-profit, public-private partnership between the Danish government and the country’s three leading business associations) and provided valuable insights into Denmark’s successful adoption of heat networks and offered lessons that could be applied to our decarbonisation efforts in London and across the UK.
Denmark has made significant progress in adopting heat networks, with over 64% of Danish homes currently heated through this system. This figure is expected to rise to approximately 72% in the near future. Denmark’s’ heat network journey began in 1903 with the installation of the first district heating (DH) plant.
However, it was the 1970s oil crisis that triggered a rapid expansion in the use of coal-powered district heating, which was followed by the introduction of natural gas. Over time, Denmark has shifted towards incorporating energy from waste and biomass, and is actively exploring various waste heat sources to further reduce emissions — as we know London boroughs like Islington are also doing.
The Greater Copenhagen Heat Network
The Greater Copenhagen Heat Network stands out as an impressive example of a large-scale district heating system. It supplies heat to approximately 500,000 households — with almost all houses connected in the inner municipalities of the region. It relies on various heat producers, including combined heat and power (CHP) plants, waste-to-energy facilities, and reserve and peak load plants burning fossil fuels. The network also incorporates heat storage systems to ensure efficient and reliable distribution.
What did we visit?
During the visit, we had the opportunity to explore different aspects of Denmark’s heat network infrastructure and solutions. We learnt about the background of heat network development in the Greater Copenhagen region and witnessed initiatives such as the District Cooling system in Copenhagen, a large waste-to-energy facility in Roskilde, and the consumer-owned Greve Municipal District Heating company. We also observed smaller-scale innovative solutions, such as a Danfoss project to capture and recirculate heat from supermarket refrigerators in Energy Lab Nordhavn.
We gained insights into energy-renovated social housing and a low-temperature heat network in the Municipality of Albertslund. We also saw an exciting new heat pump system being installed to that extract energy from drinking water in Frederiksberg, in the heart of the city region of Copenhagen.
We learnt about the vital role of local government and municipal companies in planning, financing, developing, and operating heat networks in Denmark. The experience showcased the importance of effective and resourced local government to drive collaboration among stakeholders, all underpinned by strong regulation which gives price certainty to consumers.
We also learnt how heat networks have been expanding rapidly in response to global energy price increases, and that demand is higher for houses on heat networks.
The visit highlighted both some key differences and similarities between Denmark and the UK in terms of how we heat our buildings. However, both countries share similar climates, building characteristics, and ambitions for achieving net-zero emissions so sharing knowledge will help us both. We were happy to learn that the UK government is actively working with the Danish government to develop UK heat network policy, with a focus on introducing heat zoning which will help increase the uptake of heat networks.
This visit to Copenhagen offered valuable insights for London’s decarbonisation efforts. The Renewable Power for London Programme will be incorporating these as part of its Decentralised Energy workstream to help London Local Government accelerate our transition.

Welcome, wanderlust-driven adventurers, to the enchanting city of Copenhagen! Nestled on the scenic shores of Denmark, this vibrant metropolis boasts a mesmerizing blend of rich history, modern design, and irresistible charm. I would always stop by Copenhagen if I needed to fly from the Kastrup Airport. It is the coolest capital in the Nordic country in my opinion. In this article, five must-do experiences will be unveiled. So, grab your sense of adventure and let’s dive into the heart of this magical Danish capital!
Escape the hustle and bustle of the city and find tranquility amidst the lush greenery of the Rosenborg Garden. Located in the heart of Copenhagen, this expansive park is the perfect spot to enjoy a leisurely picnic surrounded by natural beauty in the typical Nodic summer afternoon. Spread out your blanket on the soft grass, bask in the warm Danish sunshine, and savor a delicious spread of local treats, a nice Danish sandwich will be a great choice.
The garden’s meticulously embedded flowers, tranquil ponds, and majestic trees provide a picturesque backdrop for your picnic. As you indulge in your culinary delights, take a moment to admire the stunning Renaissance-style Rosenborg Castle, which stands as a guardian over the garden. Whether you’re seeking a romantic escape or a peaceful retreat with friends and family, picnicking in the Rosenborg Garden is an absolute must-do in Copenhagen.
Step into a world straight out of a Hans Christian Andersen story at the iconic Tivoli Gardens. This whimsical amusement park, dating back to 1843, exudes an atmosphere of wonder and nostalgia. Stroll through enchanting gardens, take a thrilling ride on the roller coasters, and enjoy live performances by talented musicians and actors. As dusk descends, Tivoli transforms into a mesmerizing wonderland of twinkling lights, with charming food stalls offering delicious treats. Tivoli Gardens truly encapsulates the essence of Copenhagen’s charm and should not be missed.
For those seeking retail therapy, Strøget is an absolute must. This bustling pedestrian street stretches across the heart of Copenhagen and is one of Europe’s longest shopping streets. Lose yourself in a retail wonderland as you walk by the high-end boutiques, trendy international brands, and Danish design stores one after another. But Strøget is not just about shopping — it’s a vibrant hub of entertainment, with street performers, charming cafés, and historical landmarks along the way, like Round Tower, City Hall and the Parliament building. Take your time to explore the side streets and hidden courtyards, where you’ll stumble upon unique treasures and delightful surprises.
At the end of the pedestrian street, you can see the most colorful corner of Copenhagen, Nyhavn. It gives you a chance to embrace the picturesque waterfront district that perfectly captures the city’s allure. Its vibrant row of colorful 17th-century townhouses will transport you to a time when sailors, artists, and dreamers roamed these very streets. Stroll along the canal, admiring the quaint boats floating on the water, and indulge in the delectable Danish pastries at the local cafés. Nyhavn is a haven for photographers, and you’ll find endless photo opportunities at every corner. Soak up the lively atmosphere, raise a glass of Carlsberg, and toast to the beauty of Copenhagen.
Prepare to enter a world within a world at Christiania, an autonomous neighborhood that defies convention and embraces its own unique spirit. Founded in the early 1970s, this self-proclaimed “freetown” is a haven for artists, musicians, activists, and free thinkers. Meander through the colorful streets, adorned with vibrant murals, and immerse yourself in the eclectic atmosphere. Discover artisanal shops, organic cafés, and offbeat music venues. While Christiania’s unconventional nature may not be for everyone, it offers a fascinating glimpse into a subculture that celebrates creativity and alternative lifestyles, concurring with a typical hedonist Danish image.
While you’re around the neighborhood, why not visit the top of the Vor Frelsers Kirke? From there, you can look over the whole city, with everything under your eyes. The church also preserves the oldest pipe organs in Copenhagen.
In Copenhagen, where fairy tales blend with regal history, a visit to both Amalienborg and the Little Mermaid promises a captivating journey through time and folklore. Begin your royal escapade at Amalienborg, the present royal castle and residence of the Danish royal family. Marvel at the elegant architecture as you explore the majestic palace complex, composed of four identical rococo-style palaces surrounding an enchanting courtyard. Witness the Changing of the Guard ceremony, where soldiers in their distinctive bearskin hats create a scene straight out of a storybook.
From the regal splendor of Amalienborg, venture to the tranquil shores of Langelinie to meet the iconic Little Mermaid. A short stroll along the promenade leads you to the petite bronze statue perched on a rock, gazing longingly into the sea. This beloved symbol of Copenhagen, inspired by Hans Christian Andersen’s enchanting tale, captures the imagination of visitors from around the world. If you are lucky, you may see swans along side with the mermaid, making this walk even more fairytale-like.
Copenhagen, with its blend of history and creativity, is a destination that promises to captivate every traveler. It is a perfect choice for those who come to visit Scandinavia for the first time. Whether you find yourself lost in the whimsical world of Tivoli Gardens, savoring the colorful sights of Nyhavn, or immersing yourself in the bohemian allure of Christiania, this enchanting city will leave an unforgettable mark on your soul.

There’s a particular kind of focus that lives in voiceover. Not just technical — emotional, too.
As an actor, I’ve found something grounding in the simplicity of sound: a way to stay close to character, even between larger productions. Whether for narration, commercials, or more character-driven work, I approach VO as an extension of acting, just pared down to its essentials.

I’m a New York City girl.
I grew up in the neighborhood of Washington Heights, the area of Manhattan north of Harlem.
On the street I lived, everyone knew everyone. Apartment doors were often left open so kids could run back and forth. If we were out late —which meant once the streetlights were on — we’d be told by an adult, any adult, it was time to go home.
Home for me was on the fifth floor of a tenement building. And our apartment stood out in that drab building because our windows were covered with climbing blue morning glory my father planted every spring.
Those flowers were a bright spot on an otherwise colorless city street.
It’s years since we were back, and this summer it was a trip down memory lane when my husband Billy and I visited “the City”.
Billy grew up in Greenwich Village. Long the home of artists, his father, the abstract expressionist painter Harold Anton, had among his contemporaries, Jackson Pollock, as well as the…

Let me start by saying, I'm a huge fan of the S-train network in Copenhagen, Denmark, and especially for the simple and direct communication the transit map of the network provides. The design of the existing map is clean and simple. But it still has in my opinion some flaws and are missing some vital details.
So I have tried to make my own revised S-train map for Copenhagen, based of course on the existing map of the network. With tweaks and improvement to make it easier to navigate as a user.
Just want to see the new map, jump straight to it here.

ISRAELS PLADS
Copenhagen, Denmark
Introduction
Israels Plads is an urban plaza situated in Copenhagen, Denmark. It was conceptualised by Sweco Architects and Cobe in 2007 when the Copenhagen municipality invited Danish architects to reconstruct Copenhagen’s largest public square, which had fallen into disrepair as a derelict parking lot. [1] This essay will analyse the aftermath of the project to determine how successful the architects were in terms of heritage integration, user experience, and inclusivity.
Copenhagen is the capital and most populous city of Denmark. It was previously a Viking fishing village, and became the capital in the early 15th century. Since the early 2000’s Copenhagen has seen some strong urban and cultural development, led by the Copenhagen Municipality, through investments in its institutions and infrastructure. Israels Plads is one such urban regeneration project.
According to Cobe, the idea of transforming Israels Plads was to celebrate the significance of the history of the square, and to revitalize it, by turning it into a “vibrant, diverse plaza for leisure and sport, used by all kinds of people.” [7] Right from the get-go, we see that the architects placed a lot of importance on heritage integration, user experience and inclusivity.
The new site consists of an underground car park, with two blocks of buildings (a retail park and a private educational institute) to the North-West and South-East, along with two large market halls (“Torvehallerne”, which opened in 2011 and quickly became very popular, currently housing numerous cafés) to the North-East. The Plads also provides a link to a massive park (“Ørstedsparken”) to the South-West (Fig 1), acting as a transition from the bustling city to the serene park. [7]

Above the underground car park, the plaza acts as a multifunction space, housing a large playground, sports arena, skatepark, and areas for people-watching. At the centre of the square is an “egg-shaped area” (Fig 2), used by nearby schools as an extended recreational zone for all age groups. [2]

History
The space has historical significance dating back to the 13th century when Denmark built their stone wall fortifications and established a central plaza at this spot, where the city ended in a ring of protective ramparts. During the city’s extension in the late 19th century, with the demolition of the old city walls (that were now outdated defence mechanisms), the site became a vibrant market square. Israels Plads is placed on top of these historic ramparts (Fig 3).
Figure 3 Diagram of the city’s old fortifications, and Israels Plads’ location relative to the ramparts (Cobe, 2014)
According to Zerlang (2008), the square served as a starting point and meeting point for the forces of modern life [1], since its inception in the 1870s (Fig 4) and its renaming in 1968 as “Israels Plads”, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the “rescue of the Danish Jews”.[3]
Israels Plads was previously the home of Grønttorvet (1889–1958), a major market for fresh produce known for its special atmosphere (Fig 5). Due to the increase in traffic around the market and growing logistics needs, the market was relocated and the once-bustling square degenerated into an inner-city eyesore and occasional parking lot (Fig 6). [2]

“The plaza used to be empty, especially in the evening, and there were a lot of drug dealers” — Hans Peter Hagens (Architect of the Torvehallerne, adjacent to Israels Plads) [13]
Figure 6: The site’s usage as a parking lot in the 1950’s — 1990's
City Scale
The main reason for the decline of Israels Plads was the city and traffic planners’ inability and unwillingness to put city space and city life high on their agenda. Attempting to ensure the best conditions for car traffic, along with the mismanagement of the city-planning sector has led to multiple public squares such as this one being converted to dingy parking lots, teeming with crime and making the city unsafe, unsustainable and unhealthy. [4]
Jan Gehl, in his book “Cities for People”, criticises the Copenhagen municipality, for putting a low priority on public space, pedestrianism and the role of city space as a meeting place for urban dwellers. However, in recent decades, the government has realised its folly, and started reversing its erroneous moves by restructuring their street network, removing driving lanes and parking places in a deliberate process to create better and safer conditions for bicycle traffic. [4] The city of Copenhagen has a goal for its residents to “spend 20% more time in public spaces by 2025,” [7] and Copenhagen’s bicycles now save 90,000 tons of CO2 every year. Gehl notes that “[Copenhagen] has significantly improved conditions for life in city space in recent decades. Pedestrian traffic has grown, and the number of recreational optional activities has swelled.” [4] It is important to note that Gehl uses the term “optional” to describe activities that can only be done in good conditions, as opposed to “necessary” activities, such as going to school/work and grocery shopping, which have to be done regardless of the weather conditions. One by one the parking places in the city centre have been turned into squares that accommodate public life. [4]
Figure 7: The new and improved Israels Plads (Cobe, 2014)
Recent Developments
A change was triggered in the area of Israels Plads, due to the decision to erect the two market halls (Torvehallerne) on the site, evoking the “aura of the old vegetable market”. [2] The council’s brief for the reconstruction of Israels Plads demanded that the design concept should relate itself to the “history of the square, to the architecture of the surrounding houses, to the Ørstedspark at the southern end of the square and the Botanical Garden and the market halls at the northern end of the square”. [1]
The winning submission by Cobe and Sweco Architects envisaged a “flying carpet” spread across the entire square, where the cars would be “swept under the rug” with underground parking and organically shaped areas that are punched out of the surface to provide a variety of public recreational functions (Fig 7 and 8). [2]
Figure 8: The layers of Israels Plads, as envisioned by Sweco Architects and Cobe (Cobe, 2014)
User Experience
Zerlang (2008) declares that in the modern city, experiences are staged, and architects increasingly treat urban space with the eye of a scenographer. [1] Understanding that the consideration for the individual and their experiences presents a major challenge for modern urban planning, the question of “experiences” had a very high priority in the commission. The Council added a demand that the concept should consider the activities on the square, and also the pre-existing activities of the school children from the Zahles Skole (adjacent to Israels Plads), and the potential activities of the new-arranged square. [1]
The transformation of the public square focuses on its revitalisation as a living urban space [2]. Gehl (2010) urged urban planners and architects to reinforce pedestrianism as an integrated city policy to develop “lively, safe, sustainable and healthy” cities. He also ascertains that it is equally urgent to strengthen the social function of city space as a meeting place. [4]
Israels Plads provides a cohesive structure that offers “short walking distances, attractive public spaces, and a variation of urban functions”. These elements increase activity and the feeling of security in and around the space. [4]
Studies from inner-city shopping streets in Copenhagen show happenings, events and building sites where we can watch people perform, play music, etc. attract far more people to linger and watch than shops along building facades. Studies of benches and chairs in city space show correspondingly that seats with the best view of city life are used far more frequently than those that do not offer a view of other people. [4] The seating areas in Israels Plads are positioned so that people-watching is facilitated. The sloping sides of the sunken playing field can serve both as a barrier and as seating. [2] Wedge-shaped staircases at the western and eastern corners of the square offer a good view from an elevated position (Fig 9). [2]
Figure 9: Users seated on the wedge-shaped stairs, enjoying a sunny day (Cobe, 2014)
“The plaza has opened up to the historical landscape next door. The tree and water elements of the park are echoed on the plaza surface, and circles have been cut out to accentuate the big trees standing on the transition between city and park” (Fig 10) [7]
Figure 10: The cutouts on the plaza used to accentuate the trees. (Copenhagen Design News, 2020)
The cut-outs feature round bench formations underneath the trees, where people can observe the life unfolding on the plaza, a pre-requisite for Gehl’s ideal public space (Fig 11). The localised light zones of areas sheltered by trees also create an intimate setting for groups of people to gather and enjoy the night. The overheads and multiple sources of illumination, according to Schaack (2018), allow for visibility and facial recognition, which is crucial for users to trust their environment and the people using it. [3]
Figure 11: Round bench formations, ideal for people-watching (Copenhagen Design News, 2020)
Cobe’s founder, Dan Stubbergaard appreciates that Israels Plads has become a public meeting place and a playground for three different schools all year round. [7] It also helps that the design incorporates skateable aspects into the architecture of the space. Activities such as skateboarding, basketball and scootering are encouraged, which invites a lot more schoolchildren into the space. [11] Even the lighting is optimised for play. Four different lighting systems illustrate the complexity of the space at night. One of them illuminates the centre of the plaza to answer the need for visibility of sports users, basketball players and skateboarders. [3]
Figure 12: The public uses the Plads even in unfavourable weather conditions (Cobe, 2014)
Heritage Integration
“[The plaza] has a sculptural expression that refers to its historical past as part of the fortifications” [3] “Along the facades, a band of traditional Copenhagen pavement with granite slabs and Nordic cobblestones runs around the square (Fig 13), connecting the granite plate to its surroundings.” [8] These material choices are a throwback to traditional Danish building methods, and also match the colourful historical facades from the 18th century.
Figure 13: Nordic cobblestones and demarcation strips around Israels Plads (Copenhagen Design News, 2020)
The square itself often became the scene of political demonstrations in the 1880s [1] Similar to the 1880s, the square is still used for political demonstrations. In May 2019, the Revolutionary Antifascists group, organised a demonstration at the Israels Plads. [9] More recently, in October 2021, students of the University of Copenhagen assembled at the Plads to protest the University’s investment in Pro-Israeli companies that are involved in the demolition of Palestinian homes and building the Apartheid wall [10]. It is interesting to see how the Israels Plads’ usage has differed only very slightly from its original uses before the 1950s. Copenhagen also hosts WorldPride, the international festival celebrating the LGBTQ+ community, and one of the parades goes through the Israels Plads. [12]
Inclusivity
“This is where children play during recess, where friends meet for a beer after work, and where Copenhageners meet for flea markets (Fig 14) on Saturdays” [7]
Figure 14: The Flea Market that opens up on the Plads on Saturdays (Cobe, 2014)
An issue that I came across quite often when researching the inclusivity of such spaces, is the prevalence of anti-homeless architecture and exclusionary design, whether on purpose or a subconscious choice. A space such as this cannot be celebrated for its inclusivity, if it does not support ALL its citizens, including the homeless, individuals struggling with addiction, and the unemployed. Israels Plads has round benches with metal dividers (Fig 11), making them uncomfortable to sleep on, while the long tiered seating (Fig 9) lacks privacy and is open to the elements, which discourages anyone from taking refuge overnight. [15]
This goes against the policies of Jan Gehl’s “Humanist City” [4], pushing Copenhagen’s most vulnerable citizens out of the public space. Nina Hoegh (Director of Projekt Udenfor (Project Outside)) agrees, stating that catering urban design exclusively to the needs of the middle class in this way sends an implicit message about whom the city values. [15] Public space should be accessible and welcoming for all, without privileging one person or group over another. [16]
“Homelessness must be eradicated, but this process won’t happen overnight. Public places need to design for this reality, not ignore it” [16] Therefore I affirm that the architects of the Israels Plads have not been successful in their efforts to make the space inclusive.
Purpose Fulfilment
The architects have designed a method of directing cloudburst water into an artificial creek, which leads to a large water reserve in the adjacent park. However, their wish that the creek is an aesthetic and pleasant water feature during all other times did not come true, as the “creek” is almost always dry (Fig 15), and may be a hazard for a skateboarding student, or a person with a vision impairment. [7] The Danish Design Review also noted that the fountains and water channel at the park end are rarely running. [14]
Figure 15: The “Artifical Creek”, currently dry (Copenhagen by Design, 2015)
Despite its shortcomings, the plaza does serve as a new public space adding to the social and environment of Copenhagen, while fulfilling the still-existing demand for car parking in the city. The design of the space follows the policy of Copenhagen to be a sustainable and user-friendly city by connecting to the neighbouring park and food market, offering a recreational space with seating areas and sports facilities. [3] Israels Plads has accomplished its goal of being a multi-use space, seeing that it serves as a schoolyard during the daytime, a public basketball court and skate park during the afternoon, a “dining room” in the evening, and a flea market during the weekend. It is quite difficult to design a space where there is minimum clash between these activities, yet Cobe and Sweco Architects have managed to do it.

Some of these new and old car-free squares seem deserted while others teem with life. The difference comes down to the fact that some squares have only been designed to “ferry” pedestrians across, while others seize the opportunity to provide an experience, so that people combine walking and staying in the area. Studies show that the latter type of square registers an activity level of between “10, 20, and sometimes 30 times higher than transit squares” [5] There is no point in having a sheer amount of space if it is not correctly designed, and this is why I believe Israels Plads has been so successful in attracting the populace of Copenhagen as a public space where children can play, adults can people-watch, and almost everyone can enjoy.

Overview
Schrödinger’s cat was a thought experiment proposed by Erwin Schrödinger in a discussion with Albert Einstein in an attempt to illustrate the insufficiencies of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. The experiment questioned the validity of superposition and posed the largely unsolved question of at which point a superposition collapses into one of its possible states.
Superposition — Young’s Double Split Experiment
Superposition plays an essential role in the Copenhagen interpretation and thus Schrödinger’s thought experiment. It is the ability of a quantum system to simultaneously exist in multiple states until observed. The idea is demonstrated by Thomas Young’s double-slit experiment, where a beam of light is aimed at a barrier with two small vertical slits. The light that has passed through the slits is measured on a photographic plate. When one of the vertical slits is covered, a single line of light is observed on the photographic plate on the side of the uncovered slit. If both are left uncovered, however, rather than two lines of light, there are many more on the photographic plate. In route to the photographic plate, each photon exists in a state of each of its possible trajectories, demonstrating a concept called interference, which is essentially the superposition of waves.
In an attempt to further analyze the trajectories of the photons, experiments have been conducted to track their paths. Doing this, however, seems to disrupt the superposition of the photons, creating what would be expected by classical physics on the photographic plate, two lines of light mirroring the slits in the preceding barrier. It appears that the superposition of a particle can not be directly measured; its effects (interference) can only be observed.
Schrödinger’s Cat
Schrödinger’s Cat is a thought experiment that was proposed by Erwin Schrödinger in a discussion with Albert Einstein to highlight the seemingly ridiculous nature of the concepts of superposition used in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. The Copenhagen interpretation briefly states that a quantum system remains in a state of superposition until directly observed by the outside world. When observed, the superposition collapses into one of its possible states. For example, when the photons in Young’s double-slit experiment were measured, they collapsed into one of their possible trajectories, creating two lines of light.
Schrödinger, attempting to disprove the practicality of superposition, proposed a hypothetical in which a larger system was dependent on the superposition of a quantum particle. Schrödinger suggested that if a cat were placed inside a sealed box with a radioactive particle and a flask of poison and the poison was only released if the particle decayed and released radiation, the mortality of the cat would be subject to the state of the radioactive particle. Because the Copenhagen interpretation states that the radioactive particle is in a position of both decayed and not decayed, the cat, by extension, will be in a position of both alive and dead until observed by the outside world. The goal was not to propose the practicality of simultaneously dead and alive cats, instead the thought experiment emphasized the unrealistic implications the Copenhagen interpretation had at a larger scale.
The thought experiment had brought to light a question that is still largely unsolved today: “At what point does a particle stop existing as a superposition and collapse into one of its possible states?” The Copenhagen interpretation had assumed this would happen when an observation of the superposition takes place.
Von Neumann Interpretation
In response to the flaws of the Copenhagen interpretation, John von Neumann proposed the idea that the radioactive particle is observed by the device that detects radiation which is subsequently observed by the controlled flask holding the poison. The point at which the superposition of the particle collapses is not significant. The only point at which the superposition must collapse is when there is a conscious observer. Even this interpretation, however, has been rejected by a thought experiment proposed by Eugene Wigner called Wigner’s friend. Other interpretations include the ensemble interpretation, relational interpretation, and transactional interpretation all with the common goal of identifying at which point a superposition collapses, a question posed by Erwin Schrödinger’s famous thought experiment: Schrödinger’s cat.

My perfect day in CPH starts in Vesterbro, my favorite neighborhood in the city. Formerly a blue-collar neighborhood, it’s known for its hipsters, dive bars, and murals, so I feel right at home, thinking of the Mission District in San Francisco, my second home I left behind.
The main drag, Istegade is grungy and chic in turns: Central Station where Istegade begins crawls with junkies and hookers. Early in the morning, that area is fogged with old cigarette smoke and the clouded eyes of unseeing street-walkers. The Danes are modestly boastful about this last bastion of filth in their practical little city, and the fact that they invented the concept of modern porn as we know it.
My morning begins with pastries. I lived in Paris for years, but I might go out on a limb and say that the Danes’ pastry and bread-making skills are on par if not slightly above the French in general. Near the end of Istegade is BRØD, where a sandy-haired young Viking stands behind the counter and gruffly hands over fresh-baked bread, steaming heft and wholesomeness in his likeness.
One of the things you must do to fully enjoy CPH is rent a bike. The bike roads are so well-paved, the city so level, and the air so crisp, it’ll make you wonder what you did to deserve this bliss. Ride down the suspended bike-only bridge by Fisketorvet mall, and head to the docks for a canal tour, preferably one where they give you warm wine, or gløgg. (I swear I’m not choosing all of these words based on the funky-looking Danish “ø,” which is called a Faroese, you nerds.)
During the tour of the Copenhagen canals, you will learn many things about this watery city, like how it was founded in 1167, about the illustrious reign of King Christian IV, and their near-constant naval humiliations. But the most impressive of all is the newly built power plant, Amager Bakke, which imports waste from neighboring countries to generate energy. The smoke produced from the plant is 95 percent water, with which they aim to recreate the freshness of a mountaintop near the plant’s chimneys where the world’s largest man-made ski slope starts. If that is not doing the MOST good, I don’t know what is.
Back on land, it’ll be time for lunch. Torvehallerne is a fresh food market that delights the senses of food-obsessed world travelers and Copenhageners. Definitely have the smørrebrød, which is dark rye bread covered in all good things like smoked salmon, roast beef, or shrimp, smothered in aioli, nuts, and dill. After that you could check out the Design Museum, one of the best of its kind. But the mother of Danish design and supreme engenderer of material covetousness is Illums Bolighus downtown, the most spectacular design and living store I’ve been inside.
By the time I’ve had my fill of looking at pretty things I can’t afford it’ll be around 3 or 4pm, when people get off work. Yes, you heard me right. It’s time for a drink. A Danish friend told me Denmark has the highest per-capita consumption of coffee, ice cream, and beer. I didn’t check these facts, but I believe him because he’s a doctor.
Whatever you choose to drink, make sure to have a good view of the street to watch the commuting Danes. Other than the fact that they are ridiculously good-looking, one thing struck me as particularly notable: the amount of blond-haired children in the street accompanied not only by their beautiful mothers, but invariably by their fathers as well. Truly, I had never seen a city where so many men were catering to their children. This is the first place I’ve ever been where having kids and taking care of them isn’t emasculating for men or akin to career suicide for women. It was almost as though toxic masculinity had been wiped out. Maternity and paternity leave is mandated by law, and not a miserly few weeks for the mother only, but a whole year, that’s fifty-two weeks of paid leave to be shared between the parents. The government takes good care of its citizens.
Coming from San Francisco and Seoul, where none of my career-driven girlfriends dare having children until they are settled and secure well into their mid-thirties, I suddenly had the creeping suspicion that the rest of the world had got it all wrong. The Danes had figured life out. Everyone was well-fed, a feeling of wholesome well-being permeated the city with the brisk salty air coming off the Baltic Sea.
This was the ideal socialist Utopia, or the closest thing I’d ever seen. The possible future of feminism and mankind invigorated me. But looking around, my heart sank. No one here looked like me. People of color were rare and far in between: I would never belong here. I would always be considered a tourist, or worse, a Thai masseuse.
The Danes are kind but insular people who are sometimes described as cold by expats. Their days and weekends are filled with family picnics and parties that outsiders aren’t invited to. What they have, their culture, their practical sensibilities and husbandry of their surroundings, their dedication to the good life represented by hygge are treasures that should be protected.
But CPH is where one of the worst housing crisis in Europe is taking place for students, newcomers, and immigrants. Denmark receives less refugees per capita than any other Western European country excepting the UK. It is a far cry from what Denmark’s neighbor, Sweden is doing. The future and health of a city can be judged based on their treatment of outsiders, people who aren’t from there who want to move there. And it struck me as sad that some nationalists might cite Denmark as a good example to close their borders to people in need.
When I am about to be depressed by my own thoughts, it’s time to head to Christiania. Christiania Freetown is the jewel of Copenhagen, a radical morsel of prime real estate that hippies took over in the 70s smack-dab in the middle of the city. Until quite recently they didn’t pay for electricity or taxes, operating under their own laws. Before sunset is the ideal time to go there to check out the architecture, which is a euphemism for the only place that sells weed in the open in Denmark. Sit on the outdoor benches or by the water with a beer in hand and feel that brotherly love seep back into you.
When it becomes too cold to sit outside, I would head back towards Vesterbro to Kødbyens, the meat-packing district filled with restaurants and nightclubs to continue the night until the sun comes up. As I creep back home in the morning, the streets are quiet and subdued, foggy and windy like no one lives in this sleepy town. There is none of that anxious energy that makes a big city spin, spin, spin. Bukowski’s saying, “Find what you love and let it kill you,” is not a phrase that goes down well with the practical Danes nor with the soporific comforts offered by hygge.
And I love CPH because it helps me imagine a different life where I don’t have to kill myself for my career, or tamp down every instinct until I make something out of myself. If only one could belong here.

Have you ever arrived in a city so tired from traveling, but somehow the energy of the place wakes you up? That’s exactly what happened when I landed in Copenhagen…
We got to Copenhagen on Friday morning after a ridiculously early 6 AM flight, and we were dead tired. We didn’t have any time to lose so we set out for the hostel. We took the train to Steel House, which was hands down the best hostel we’ve been to yet. It had everything — pool, gym, cinema, you name it. We dropped our bags and headed to the city. Upon arrival we stopped and listened to a singer on the streets, it was super cool to see him perform.
Locating the Streets and Gasoline Grill
Copenhagen has an atmosphere that makes you just want to walk around. We walked around the streets, dropped by Rosenborg Castle, and let the city reveal itself. Somewhere along the way, hunger caught up with us, and we went to Gasoline Grill, which serves famous burgers. The burger was just what we needed and it set the tone for the day.
The Old Irish Pub and Barkowski’s
We continued walking and ended up at this place called “The Old Irish Pub,” where they had a live band playing. The atmosphere was just right with a good energy. We sat back, listened to the music, and just absorbed the atmosphere. It was a mix of locals and tourists, and it felt like one of those pubs you find on a college campus.
We finally checked into the hostel at 3pm and freshened up to then head back out into town. This time we headed to Barkowski’s, a restaurant/bar that was full of people. We had heard that they heard pull tables but didn’t see them at first sight. After an urgent search we headed downstairs to the basement and found the pool tables and asked some locals if we could play them. They were excited to play “The Americans” and spoke great english. We ended up beating them in a best-of-5 series and it felt very good to win. We hung out for a little while longer and listened to the jazz/rock that was playing, then called it a night.
CopenHot and relaxing, and partying at Rumors
The next morning, we were ready for something entirely new. We went to CopenHot, where they have hot tubs right on the water. It was busy, but in the best way possible — people were just hangin’ out, relaxing. We even did the ice plunge for a bit. The cold was terrible but the instant jump back into the hot tub made up for it. The soft music in the background made all this feel ultra peaceful. It was just the reset we needed.
Then we were hungry and went to War Pigs to get BBQ. As someone who is from Texas, I can vouch that it was some of the best BBQ I had had. The mac and cheese was phenomenal and it paired just right with the pulled pork sandwich. It was the ideal way to finish off a relaxing morning, and I would eat in again in an instant if I could.
We napped briefly, then prepared for the evening. We headed to The Jane, a former library turned bar. The music was just what you’d expect if you were in a library listening to music. It was definitely a first for me and it almost makes you feel like you are in a library. It had books on the walls and the lighting was very dim. It was a very mellow vibe.
Though that changed pretty quickly… We then headed to a club called Rumors. It was all EDM and sing-along tracks here, and the atmosphere was on a whole different level. People were dancing in what looked like a pit.. The music was blasting, and we got to feel what its like to almost be at a concert in Denmark. We met some locals, danced and then called it a night to end our trip.
The Copenhagen Vibe
By the time we got back to the hostel, I had concluded that Copenhagen somehow felt like Amsterdam — the buildings, the bars, the surprises around every corner. There’s a sense of never having any idea what’s gonna happen next and what place you will end up in. Everywhere we went was somewhere completely different and somehow we had a great time everywhere we went. And honestly, the music in this city ended up shaping the whole experience. It was the soundtrack to it all, establishing mood and rendering each moment a little more memorable.
Thanks for reading! If you enjoyed this post, make sure to follow my account for more travel stories and insights. Stay tuned for next week’s adventure .

Welcome to the United Nations Career Journey podcast where we interview colleagues working for the United Nations all over the world. Our conversations explore their fascinating career paths, what career satisfaction means to them and how they keep learning and developing on the job. My name is Alessia and our conversation today is with Paul Anderton from the United Nations Development Programme in Copenhagen in Denmark.
Welcome to the Career Journey Podcast, Paul, thank you very much for joining us. And it’s a pleasure to have you as our guest speaker today. Would you like to introduce yourself?
Hello there Alessia. Greetings, everyone. Yes, certainly. Thanks so much for having me. My name is Paul Anderton. I’m originally from the United Kingdom, but I’ve lived and worked in 11 different countries in my life now, including the last three years here in Denmark in Copenhagen. I am an international servant, international civil servant with the UNDP. As you just mentioned, I work as an HR manager for the Leadership Development team in the Office of Human Resources, in the UNDP’s Talent Development Unit. That would do is as a starting point. So back to you, Alessia.
Yes, thank you, Paul. That’s really interesting that you lived in 11 different countries. And so how did you become interested in this field?
I think when I go back and look at the course of my life, something fairly major changed for me when I was nine years old, when I moved from a small village where I was living in England, a small village that had more sheep than than people actually, that was very homogeneous. And because of my father’s work, we moved to Brussels in Belgium, one of the most international cities in Europe. I went to an international school, and all of a sudden, I went from going to a small rural primary school to a big international school, where I was sitting next to a boy from Tanzania, and a girl from Venezuela, and a boy from Bangladesh and a girl from Japan. And that really had an impact on me at that young age, and really made me interested both in travelling the world and seeing other places, learning, made me intensely curious about the world. And also made me passionate about the feeling of connectedness, the feeling that all of these different people in all different cultures around the world, we are all interdependent, and that an organisation like the United Nations really has an important role to play. And eventually that will be something that I will be able to, to contribute to. So, I guess that kind of international perspective was something that was influencing me from quite a young age, which I maybe didn’t realize so much at the time. But when I look at the kind of the path that my life took, both in terms of the places I ended up working, which includes Japan, and Zambia, Mexico, Nepal, I feel very lucky, very grateful for the possibilities that opened up for me to, to go to these kinds of places have an international career. And, you know, try to make the most of that, including my time here at UNDP.
Wow, thank you, Paul. That’s a really interesting story. I also went to an international school in my life here in Rome, and I do completely understand you when you say that you were sitting next to someone from Japan, someone from Bangladesh, I also had that experience. And it definitely gave me a bigger perspective of things of my life as well. So what does a typical day or week look like for you in this job?
So yeah, so maybe I should talk a bit more about what my job actually is. So as the manager of the leadership development team at UNDP, we’re overseeing all of the internal learning and development opportunities for UNDP’s leaders at all levels, and people managers, and that covers quite a wide range of of activities and programmes that we’re doing - obviously, a lot of online content, but also organising things like retreats, meetings and get-togethers. I would say that the one thing when we talk about a typical week is there is no such thing. There’s constantly different things that are being worked on, different projects, different initiatives. We have a really substantial work portfolio that we work towards with all the different leadership groups within UNDP. That’s Resident Representatives, whether it’s team leaders in country offices, keeping all those going while at the same time, UNDP is never shy to say okay, here’s a priority that we now need to give to you, whether that might be a Women’s Leadership Programme, or something related, due to inclusion of people with disabilities, so that variety is fascinating. The other thing that I think is absolutely essential for doing the job that I do is the kind of the communication and delegation with my team. So I’d say that the anchors are, in this, pretty variable and changing work schedule, the anchors are the regular team meetings, and one-on-one meetings I have with my team meetings. We have a distributed team, so we have a couple of people working with us here in Copenhagen, others who are located in other time zones and other parts of the world. And so therefore, it’s really important for us to have regular check-ins, to get on the same page in terms of what the work priorities are, who is doing what, who’s accountable for what, and I very much enjoy that part of the role as well, the people management, the getting to know other people. I found that the United Nations and UNDP in particular is a fascinating workplace, the people who work here are really interesting, have all kinds of fascinating stories. And I find that the best way that that we can kind of come and work together is to share those components of ourselves with each other that we’re most passionate about. That really elevates the team as a whole, and gets us motivated, even when we might be overwhelmed with a certain project or feeling tired, because we do we do have a lot of responsibility and a lot to do.
Okay, thank you. Wow, that was very descriptive and very useful for our listeners. And so what specific tools have been useful for you to develop career wise?
So in terms of tools, I was thinking, it’s in my career, it’s probably been less about kind of technical training or specific certification, so to speak, and more about kind of mindset and approach. So I think that some of the things in my career as a whole that have really helped me get to the point I am today includes things like agility, so being able to move from one thing to another, having, I guess, the self confidence that if I’m trying something that’s new to me that I can kind of fall back on the core skill set that I’ve kind of built up over time to get me through that, as well as the network of colleagues and others who can help me either with information or tips, mentor me through certain things to get me somewhere else. And when I was thinking about the idea of a career journey, my career — I don’t usually think of it in those terms, because it hasn’t ever really been kind of mapped out or planned to any great degree. The basic philosophy has been on my approach has been to be open to the opportunities that have come my way trying to follow my passions, which as I mentioned, have been around travel or around being an international civil servant. Also about international development work, that’s what my master’s degree is in, and I spent several years working as a development project manager and humanitarian worker before shifting more to an HQ role at UNDP. And that’s kind of incorporated some of the other skills and I guess, the different job titles that I’ve had over the years, all of those things have contributed different bits of pieces into the professional that I currently am. So I mentioned working in humanitarian worker in Zambia, Uganda in the past, but over time, I’ve also been a teacher, the university lecturer I’ve even though the short term jobs that I’ve had, whether that’s volunteering, I’ve done quite a bit of volunteering my life particularly with with refugees with the Red Cross, an International Rescue Committee, but also part time jobs as you know, things like a driver, a librarian, even a movie projectionist back in the day… All of these things have, you know, added little components into both my kind of my bank of experiences and skills, and also the way that I go about my job. So I mentioned kind of agility and moving from, from one thing to the next thing. Curiosity is also something that has been really important for my career, because that has meant that I have looked to keep growing and taking on different challenges, expanding the repertoire of things that I can do or will go put my hand up to take on. And in our team, the Talent Development Team here at UNDP, we often talk about the growth mindset, the idea that we’re constantly growing, we’re constantly evolving, we’re all on a continuous learning journey, where it’s not the case that — okay, after school in university, that’s it, your learning is done and you put it away. That’s not the way the world works. It’s not the way that work itself works. So, so that curiosity, agility, the growth mindset to keep trying new things. And I think, also important has been a willingness to take a few risks along the way. I kind of mentioned growing up in a small village in England, when I was young, I was pretty shy, I was not that confident. And I wouldn’t have dreamed, actually, that I would have taken on as many different things as I have done over the course of my life, taking chances to go and study for a year in the USA, where I didn’t know anyone, taking a first job after university in in Taiwan, part of the world where I didn’t speak the language, I didn’t know anyone, I have no idea what to expect. But it was a part of this…this kind of growth experience, and, led in all kinds of interesting directions.
Wow, that was really inspiring. I feel very inspired by that. Especially follow your passion. I feel like nowadays, it’s getting very competitive now, when you are in the search for jobs, but I do agree, follow your passion, agility, take risks, everything you mentioned. It’s nice to hear it once in a while. I feel like some people tend to forget, because of a lot of pressure in this in this environment with the job searching and stuff, especially after the pandemic, when you graduate as a student.
And I have to say as well, I can kind… in looking back, you tend to look at the highlights. There were plenty of lowlights along the way and plenty of moments of ‘oh my god, what is my next job gonna be’ or ‘what happens next’. And particularly when I think about my UN career, I’ve had every variety of contract there is, including being a pro bono volunteer, part time consultant, full time consultant, temporary appointment. I eventually got to a fixed term appointment, that was then abolished as opposed to, so went back not to having a post. I’ve gone through a team relocation, so all of these things are also happening, as well as along the way moments of great uncertainty about what what is the right thing to do? And where, where should I be, where should I be moving? And I do kind of see, not not just my career, but for all of us, our lives are a little bit in… in chapters that are being written as we go. And when you kind of look back at some of the completed chapters, it’s only then you can kind of see how everything came together. And I do sense that the moment that kind of the uncertainty and the questions that particularly young people have about, okay, what is our future going to look like? What kind of jobs am I going to have? What do I think about far from my career? It’s getting more and more challenging. And I think about that, in particular for for my daughters who are eleven and nine, so they still have a ways to go in their own education, but say, in 15/20 years from now, what the job market so to speak might look like is really hard to see. The speed at which the types of jobs that people are doing, or the jobs that people have, they’re just changing so rapidly. And that I think takes me back a little bit to what I was saying about being agile, being willing to change, and trying to build up your self-confidence that actually no, I will, be able to ride these waves and get someway good. And of course it helps a great deal ifunderneath that, the work that you’re doing or the place that you’re working connects to what you’re most passionate about.
Yes, yes, exactly. I agree with you. Overall, everything does move pretty fast, especially the market right now. But we’ll see, I guess, c’est la vie.
I think taking time to kind of really analyze and understand that for yourself. One thing I see that sometimes trips people up is that they might have certain expectations about what they think the world of work should be, or they joined a particular organisation and they have a certain idea — this is exactly what is gonna happen when I get there — And then maybe that’s not quite the reality. So I think the more research you can do, or the more analysis or reflection you can do, both in terms of the work and the job that you’re going into but also in terms of yourself and what you need or what you want to have in your career, that’s really going to help so. So take some time for self-reflection for analysis, and it might be that you see certain jobs where you think okay, well the job looks good, but actually, I’m not sure I fit in that organisation or vice versa, that’s an organisation I want to work for. But is that what they want to be doing? It’s not straightforward at all. And yeah, it’s something that yeah, I myself, I’m still in the middle of. You know, I’m mid career, I’ve probably got 15/20 years to go until until I’d be able to retire. So I’m also surfing the wave.
Yeah, you’re right. I think self-reflection comes with any age. But it’s definitely something that one should do once in a while, you know, especially when it comes to work. And just, overall, how you’re feeling with your job and what you want to do next.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, so one more question, which I believe it’s very important. What role does networking play in your career?
This is an interesting one, because I was thinking back to especially when I first joined the UN, I think I had a vision of networking that is quite different from how I see it now. Because back then, I had quite a hard view of of people who I saw as ‘networkers’. I thought that they were being a bit mercenary, maybe in terms of okay, to network, I need to find the people who are going to help me move up in my career, the people who are going to give me backing or information that’s going to get me a promotion, or get me where I want to be. And that all felt a bit inauthentic. And I think, certainly there are some people who take that approach to networking. But the way that I understand networking now, and how I’d recommend other people who maybe think more like me about it, who maybe don’t feel comfortable with that more aggressive approach to networking, is that really, networking is a long term thing. It’s something where you’re looking to make connections with people. And for me, I feel most comfortable when it’s authentic human connections in the workplace. And I mentioned before being curious, I am constantly curious about my colleagues, in terms of how did they come to UNDP or whichever partner we might be working with, what drives them? What are they passionate about? What do we have in common? And that I think helps the the immediate working relationship. But it also gives you this network of people who, in the future, they might come to you with a question you might go to them with something you want to ask about, there might be just kind of shared information, or just an awareness of, oh, okay, I know that person who’s really good at X, Y, and Z. I’ve got this one thing where I need some help with X, Y, and Z, I’ll just check in with them. And it kind of goes in both directions. So I guess my second recommendation would be not to see networking as something that you have to do to progress in your career, so much as something that can actually be an enjoyable human part of the work experience. We spend so much of our daily life at work, and one of the things I most appreciate about working in the UN is the incredibly diverse and interesting workforce that we have. That’s something that’s both meaningful to me and I think that’s been important in the work that I do and what whatever comes next. And one last thing, because it’s kind of, slightly off to the side, in terms of, of networking. I’ve been quite an active user of LinkedIn. And that’s something where you’ve got some virtual networking at play, which obviously, is not the same thing as what I’ve just been talking about. So on LinkedIn, you’ll have connections to some of your teammates, or people that you work with, or people that you know pretty well, then there’ll be looser connections to maybe people who are in your organisation, but you don’t know, or people who are outside your organisation in other places. And then there’s also connections to sometimes really random group of people who you have no idea who they are. But in that virtual space, there’s a different type of networking going on. And for me, the way that I use LinkedIn is pretty much in three ways. So one is to, to kind of help show the work that I do and the work that my team does to give to kind of highlight what it is that we’ve actually been working on, which can also help me as well in terms of remembering what we’ve what we’ve done over the years. Also, I think LinkedIn is very good in terms of being a good advocate for UNDP itself and for the UN itself, because there’s plenty of posts from different parts of UNDP or the UN system, in terms of the the good work that we’re doing, and I think anyone who works in the UN system, it is part of what we should be doing — helping to support and promote the UN values, you know, the amazing work that we are doing. And then the last thing is also in terms of some of the people who are looking for work themselves. So I regularly reshare links to job vacancy announcements or interesting career opportunities within UNDP or elsewhere that I think that people will find value in. So those are kind of two different strands of networking. I hope that makes sense.
Yes Paul, it completely does. I believe that when I started this internship, I think that the networking has given me a bigger perspective in the way that I network with my colleagues to enjoy the relationship and to get to know them and to understand where they’re coming from, what their values and missions are. This has been really nice, and I don’t know Paul, if you have anything else to say?
So thank you so much Alessia for having invited me to take part and thank you to anyone who’s made it to the end of this this interview. I appreciate you listening!
Thank you so much for coming and thank you all for listening. We hope our conversations will inspire you to keep learning and advancing in your careers. And make sure to share this episode with any social platform you all have. We will see you all for the next time!

“Jonathan just tested positive for Covid here this morning.” My son Dan called me from Copenhagen with the bad news. And he called just minutes before I was to fly there for a long-anticipated visit to Copenhagen, to visit Dan and his family. I was devastated. I knew it would be crazy at age 87 to head off to Copenhagen when someone in the household there had Covid. I canceled.
I had been reading and talking about Denmark for weeks and I found myself continuing to do research and hold forth on Denmark. And now, dear readers, I want to share some of the amazing information that I have learned and to tell you why what is going on in Denmark matters to each of us. Even if we never go there.
Denmark has been ranked as the best place on earth to live and also the best of all countries in terms of quality of life. It has been named as the least corrupt country in the world and number one in terms of protecting the environment and gender equality. It has been ranked the 2nd happiest country on earth, (after Finland) for…

Here is my usual guide to Copenhagen for tourists who enjoy the culinary side of life and want to visit Copenhagen for the first time.
In general I tell Taxi to use taxa.dk +45 35353535 or use Donkey bikes with app or use the electric scooters.
Packing: Copenhagen is rainy and windy and chilly. Check weather forecast. Plenty swimming opportunities, so bring a towel and swimwear if you want to swim.
Inner city: This is the old town of Copenhagen. Think small streets, alleyways, and historic squares. The main (shopping) streets are Strøget and Købmagergade. Sights to see: Parliament (Christiansborg) and the Round Tower (Rundetårn). You will find two good wine bards here: Ved Stranden 10 and Den Vandrette as well as restaurant Musling.
Christianshavn: An old residential neighborhood full of canals and colorful houses. Sights to see: Cathedral of Copenhagen (Von Frue Kirke) and the Freetown Christiania. Try Rufino’s delicious pasta if you’re in the area or grab a beer at Barr in the evening sun. Restaurant 108 is also located here.

My interest to explore Copenhagen stemmed from the immaculate design culture that I had heard of . In the quest to explore the origin of hygge life we left for about week’s adventure to Copenhagen.
Fun Fact: The Danish Royal Family holds the title of the oldest monarchy. If Queen Elizabeth visits she will need to bow down to the Queen and King of Denmark.
2. Food & Drink: During my visit, the surprising find for me has been the refined food scene here. Unlike other cities, I did not go here with a focus on devouring food all day but I was pleasantly surprised by the offerings. It could be the influence of René Redzepi’s Noma, which is seen as one of the best restaurants in the world potentially attracting a lot of culinary talent here. Although, I could not get reservation at Noma these are some restaurants that left me wanting more:
Similarly for drinks some spots to check out are:
3. Fashion & Art: When I travel, I love to check out local stores that depict the local style. For sartorial trends street style was definitely trending in the city. Most of the stores I went to showcased unisex easy to wear style. Some stores that were interesting to check out are:
You cannot leave Copenhagen without checking out the best in class design stores. Some to check out are:
4. Must see: As mentioned, Copenhagen is a beautiful city. To understand its past and present I would recommend you to check out these spots, which span all over the city and gives you a good idea on what Copenhagen is all about.
Nyhavn: Street with beautiful colorful building. Great for an evening stroll.
Garden Royal: Close to Aamann’s great to catch a break here and check the rose garden.
Supekilen: For all the reasons listed above highly recommend to check this out. Although a bit away from city center.
Freetown Christiania: This is a free commune which operates as a local body without any governance from local government. It is an interesting oasis in the middle of the city , which is worth checking out.
Nyboder houses: Built in 1757, these houses have lasted several city fires and provides a little flavor of the past.
Church of Savior: This church gives a great aerial view of the city. Worth climbing up the 700 stairs to check out the cityscapes.
Design Museum of Denmark: This museum provides Danish sensibility and evolution from everywhere across fashion, architecture, furniture.
5. Tips & Tricks: These are some quick tips that I wanted to leave you with while planning your trip.

What a weekend. I just had the pleasure to explore Copenhagen in Denmark for a bit. I took lots of photos with my beloved Fujifilm X100V and the conversion lenses. In this little article, I will share some of my favorite shots & spots from this trip.
All the photos you’ll see, have been edited with my presets. If you’re interested, you can get them here: www.chrisperkles.at
We arrived at a Wednesday night in the capital of Denmark, and we stayed in the Huxley Hotel in the center of the city. The location of the hotel made it easy to get everywhere by foot.
We started the first beautiful sunny fresh march day at Nyhavn, since it was next to our Hotel. The good thing was that on a Thursday morning, it was not too busy, and we could find a good spot for breakfast close to the water and in the sun.
After having some good brunch, we walked towards Kastellet along the water shore. Spotting some nice architecture and beautiful views.
Kastellet is something special. For me, as an old Stronghold gamer, this was very pleasant to see, how the castle was shaped and still used today.
After the castle, we walked back towards the center and checked out the Frederiks Kirke and Schloss Amalienborg. There we enjoyed a parade from the oldschool military.
Next on our list was Schloss Rosenborg and the attached garden. Since it was March, the garden was not that pretty because nothing was blooming. But the small palace was impressive.
Feeling: Hungry. So let’s get some food. In the area of Schloss Rosenborg, we found a place called Brdr. Price. Food was delicious, service was great and the location very pretty. 10/10 recommend.
Back on energy, we headed towards the Botanical Garden, but we’ve been too late, it was already closed. So the replacement program was the Rundetarn, an observatory with a beautiful view over Copenhagen.
That was the closing of our first day here. We spent a nice evening having some dinner and relaxing.
New day, new luck. We started the day with a quick breakfast and then heading towards the botanical garden again. This time we were on time.
In the evening we walked through the city, checked out some stores and just had a good time.
After all, this was a very beautiful trip, with some great food and beautiful weather. I can recommend copenhagen to everyone, but consider, that town is expensive as hell. The food compared to Austria is at least 50% — 100% more expensive. If you have any questions, send me a message on Instagram or leave a comment here.

Alright. I have completely fallen in love with Copenhagen. If I were to do college again, I would study abroad here… in the summer ; ). It’s seriously such a magical place — the parks, the bike lanes, the zero noise pollution, the food, the “hygge”… I could go on. Copenhagen is considered one of the happiest cities in the world, + I can totally see why.
Pro Tip — Bike… everywhere. Literally, everywhere.
1] Mad + Kaffe: MUST. HAVE. BRUNCH. HERE. They serve brunch until 12:30 every day. Wow. I can’t believe a spot like this is not in Chicago yet. This has been voted “best brunch in Copenhagen.”
2] Wulff + Konstali: Another — MUST. HAVE. BRUNCH. HERE. They serve brunch until 3 PM [even better!]. Go to the one on Ameagerbro, so that you can go to the beach after!
3] Grod: We went here for takeaway dinner, but I wish I could have come for breakfast! Everything is porridge based… sounds weird but it’s SO GOOD.
For Next Time (Brunch) — Baryl, Social, Bowl Market, Cafe Det Vide Has, Moeller Kaffe + Kokken
Coffee — Coffee Collective, Original Coffee, Statement Coffee, Prolog Coffee Bar
Bakeries — Sankt Peders Bageri [cinnamon rolls on Wednesdays! ++ Copenhagen’s oldest bakery!], Leckerbaer, Isoteket, , Juno The Bakery, Lilli Bakery, Hart Bageri, Meyers Bageri, Bageriet Brod
Sweets — Nicecream, ISTID, Social Foods, Granny’s House [in Torvehallerne]
1] La Banchina: Hands down favorite spot in Copenhagen for a few reasons: the food is incredible [apps = bread + olive oil, olives, + almonds… + then the starter, fish, vegetable, + dessert change every day!], THEN after dinner: jump in the water… + then warm up by the fire + SAUNA. They are also open for breakfast, which is probably so dreamy too.
2] Organic Boho: We stumbled upon this place on our way to Christiana [the hippy town] + WOW, obsessed. Get the burger with tempeh, + THE LOVE PLATE [my fav]. They have tons of beautiful drinks too — juices, smoothies, + rainbow lattes ; ).
3] 42Raw: I love that so many spots in Copenhagen have easy “takeaway” options. We ordered takeaway to bring on the Go Boat: acai bowl, green bowl [“this almost tastes too healthy” — Isaac], salad of the day, + chocolate PB cup. The sweet potato fries looked bomb, too.
4] Neighbourhood: Organic pizza + cocktails… what more do you need? Oh, + TRUFFLE POPCORN. Make sure to get the burrata love pizza.
5] Sprod: You know a place is good when they don’t have an English menu. We ordered the chicken sandwich to split as a snack… + then instantly ordered another one. SO YUM.
6] District Tonkin: This place has the “best banh mi in Copenhagen” + it lived up to the hype . Chicken lemongrass banh mi + pho = winning combo.
7] Souls: This won the most sustainable restaurant in Copenhagen, AND best vegan restaurant — so definitely go. The warm potato salad was liiiiiife. ++ the summer lemonade.
8] Aamanns Deli: A trip to Copenhagen is not complete without trying a smorresbrod. There’s a few Aamanns, depending on the experience you want — I liked the deli because you can eat it in the restaurant, or easily choose takeaway + bring it to a park!
9] Kodbyens Fiskebar: MUSSELS : ) This was the fanciest restaurant that we went to [on our last night]. It’s in the Meat Packing District… we hopped around to a few places — staying at each place for an hour while ordering: drink + one item from the menu to share, what we call #AppyHour.
10] Smag: The BEST salads + sandwiches, oh my gosh. Go before a picnic!
For Next Time — Morganstedt, SimpleRaw, dop, Bollyfood, WEDOFOOD, Gro Spiseri, Ma Poule [duck sandwich is apparently amazing], Kaf, California Kitchen, Mahalle CPH, Plantepolsen, Barabba, Amass [$$$$], Kadea [$$$$], Noma ; ) [$$$$ — named the best restaurant in the WORLD]
Markets — Copenhagen out did themselves with all the markets here. Like, WOW. Trovehallerne is obviously a must… make sure to get Smag, GROD, a chocolate peanut butter brownie from Granny’s House. Other fabulous markets are The Bridge Street Kitchen, Reffen, Rebel Food, + Tivoli Food Hall.
1] Mikkeller + Friends: Apparently the best spot for beer in Copenhagen.
2] WarPigs: Go for the beer, stay for the MEAT. Omg, literally — the brisket was to diiiiie for. *Make a stop here during #AppyHour.
3] Noho: Funky cocktails + hip vibe. *Make a stop here during #AppyHour.
4] Grab Wine… Literally Anywhere: Drink in a park, on the streets, by the lake, etc. It’s open container law!
For Next Time — Sidecar, BRUS, Baghaven, Himmeriget, Lidoeb, Malbeck Vinbar
1] ALL. THE. PARKS: Faelledparken, Svanemoelle Beach, The Citadel, Frederiksberg Gardens (*probably my fav because you get a shot of the zoo in the park + can see the elephants!), Superkilen, King’s Garden, Botanical Gardens… + more. If I lived here, I would spend every day in a park. They are all so gorgeous + unique. You must visit them all!
2] Walk Down These Streets:
3] Go Boat: We chose this over the Canal Tour [if I had time, I’d do both!] — you rent a boat to drive… yourself… with no experience required! Aha. It’s right next to the Islands Brygge Harbour Bath, which you should definitely go to on a sunny day. *Book ahead of time!
4] Tivoli: Copenhagen’s second oldest amusement park, + right in the center of town. It’s definitely worth a stop.
5] Visit The Cemeteries: Sounds creepy, but this is also a must. Vestre Cemetery + Assistens Cemetery are incredibly beautiful.
6] Christiania: The hippie commune — the only place hash/weed is legal in Copenhagen. Super funky to walk through... most people built their homes themselves! Couple things to note: I wouldn’t go there at night, no photos are allowed, + no running.
7] Shop Vintage: Check out this guide for the flea markets!
8] Wellness: I wasn’t able to test any of these out, but I heard great things about: YO Studios, NOR Nordic Health House, CopenHot, Hot Yoga CPH.
We stayed at Hotel SP34— incredible free breakfast every day, in a great spot in town [a bike store is like two seconds away… or you can rent bikes at the hotel], + WINE HOUR EVERY DAY! Also, there are a few other hotels close by in the same collective, so you can go there for wine hour, too ; ). Check out Brochner Hotels. / *One thing I will say is the room we booked was TINY.
There are so many components within Copenhagen that I want to bring back to Chicago — particularly BIKE LANES. ++ how they do brunch… + all the parks. I’m in loooooove. Please visit!
What did I miss? Let me know!
++ Elisabeth

Copenhagen, Denmark, has a unique and interesting transit system. When looking at it at first, most will just see the S-train network, that by any means is not the largest one in the world. But it’s a quite effective network. And when combined with the metro that got added to the Copenhagen transit network back in 2002 when the first 2 lines opened.
The S-train network has been running since 1934. It was the vision for the network, even before it was born that it should be 100% electrified. And it has been, from its start until today, it has only been running on electricity. This vision was part of some earlier work done by The Electrification Commission of 1926, that wanted to electrify many of the commuter rails in and around the suburbs of Copenhagen.
The first line opened the 3rd of April 1934, and ran from Klampenborg via Hellerup and Vanløse and terminated at Frederiksberg. This exact line is now defunct and does not exist in today's network. Along with a timetable…

I just got back from my two-week trip across most of Northern Europe. This is my third trip back to Europe. (My first was a summer abroad in Italy nearly 8 years ago and my second was another two-week trip in 2014 where we explored Dublin, London, Amsterdam, and Paris.) I daresay this was the best so far! Thom and I visited Stockholm, Copenhagen, Berlin, and again, Amsterdam this time around. In order to share our experience and to create a living record of its details, I’ve decided to write across a few posts on each city and its adventures. This first post serves to detail our overall travel plans, information on flights/places to stay, tips on light packing, and general advice for good travel. I should mention that I’m not an expert on any other these things but it’s worth sharing the little knowledge that I gained before, during, and after this trip.
To begin with, here are a few starting facts about our trip:
Let’s begin by discussing budget flights. Nine months before this vacation even happened I found some non-stop flights from Oakland to Stockholm for $600 a person. These flights kicked off the entire trip and made everything possible. I recall the very first time I ever flew to Europe. (Which was 8 years this summer!) It was to Genoa, Italy from Buffalo, NY. That flight had three stops (Buffalo to NYC, NYC to Frankfurt, and Frankfurt to Milan) and one train (Milan to Genoa) in order to get to my destination with a total of over 20+ hours at a hefty price of $1500. (Thanks Aer Lingus! 🖕) So to come across a flight that was only 10 hours and non-stop to my choice destination, it felt like fate...
Doesn’t that last sentence feel so inspiring? Statements and facts like those are the gold and shiny wrapper on the cheap bar of travel chocolate. Here’s the nitty-gritty of budget flying:
With some of the add-ons and extra taxes, our $600 tickets actually came to $711.30 a person. Our in-between flights from city to city were around $50 a person. (As compared to a train from Berlin to Amsterdam which was $120 a ticket.) In the end, you have to deal with the minor annoyances for that 💰deal.
Let’s move on to transportation.
Thom and I took public transit for the most part. (I’ll discuss the bicycling and Uber rides a bit later in some of my city posts.) For us, it’s a fun challenge learning a new city’s public transit. And unlike American public transportation, European public transportation is fast, convenient, and very, VERY reliable. Upon arriving at the Arlanda Airport, which is located just outside of Stockholm, we took the Arlanda Express Train that runs directly to the city center in just 20 minutes. (As compared to my 1.5 hour MUNI and BART trip to Oakland International Airport. 😑) Out of the four cities we visited, Berlin boasted the fastest and most reliable transportation (dat German innovation) with Amsterdam coming in at a close second. (Trams, trams everywhere!) All the trams, trains, and buses that we took were clean and clearly marked. My only complaint was the summer heat which was especially felt in the enclosed and non-air conditioned trains.
I plan to discuss each Airbnb in detail for each city post but in general our decision to use this service came from a few points:
Finally, let’s talk about packing. Much like my last Europe trip, I took a single backpack and personal bag with me. That was it! Now that this trip is over, I can say, quite proudly, that it was the best decision that I made for packing. After each city we visited, Thom and I both got a little better at packing our bags. It was a very efficient way to travel, IMO.
Here are some pros:
I admit that there are some cons involved with this kind of packing. While I can pack a mean bag, it doesn’t exclude the fact that the weight gets to you…no matter how light. If you’ve ever landed at an airport and took public transit into a city, the transfers mean a lot of walking between terminals and stations. The weight of the bag can cause a lot of stress on your neck and shoulders. Even this year, I packed a bag that weighed about 8 lbs total and after a while, say 20 minutes of walking, it can really push down on you. I should mention that my bag isn’t meant for hiking or true backpacking and therefore isn’t super ergonomic. I’m sure if I had chosen a small hiking backpack, my experience would be different. The bag that I took is just an everyday backpack for commuting which is why long walks with a lot of weight can easily become a small burden.
Backpacking can also force you to make some crucial decisions as to what you pack. One small error (should I bring a bathing suit?) and you’ll be forced to carry that item throughout the entire trip with much resentment. The last time we were in Europe, it rained for most of the trip. Thom brought an umbrella this year. He never needed it! 😂 🙃 Lessons learned.
A few surprising things that we did bring this year are:
I’ve only really traveled internationally in the summer months so packing has always been dictated by the warmer weather. I took mainly dresses with a single pair of jeans and shorts. A few shirts to mix it up and a hoodie with a jean jacket for cooler evenings/days. I took a pair of black flats since they’re so versatile and my Keds for comfort as I walked/biked everywhere. I kept toiletries to small sizes and bought anything else that might have run out.
Thom and I failed to exchange any currency prior to the trip. But I would recommend making that order with your bank if possible since ATMs abroad will charge you a fee for any withdrawals. Also, make the obligatory call to your bank letting them know that you are traveling abroad so that they don’t lock your card and account.
A kind co-worker provided us an extra SIM card and we had another already from past trips, so this year we both had data/service for our phones. Thankfully our SIM cards were both purchased in the Netherlands with Vodaphone. These cards worked in all the other countries we visited and we didn’t need to purchase new cards along the way.
Finally, I’ll add that we obtained Global Entry prior to the trip. It made entering the US very easy and fast when going through customs. If you are a frequent international flyer, consider getting Global Entry. Global Entry includes TSA PreCheck. So if you fly around the country frequently (which I do), it’s very convenient and handy for jumping those long security lines.
This post is a part of a series based on my recent two-week trip to Europe.

The Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics Is Not Idealist in Nature,https://medium.com/paul-austin-murphys-essays-on-philosophy/the-copenhagen-interpretation-of-quantum-mechanics-is-not-idealist-in-nature-797779e86290,"Sign up

The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics — and even quantum mechanics generally — has been both loosely and strongly associated with the philosophical position of idealism (see here).
Of course, there are almost as many varieties of idealism (from subjective idealism to absolute idealism to pluralist idealism) as there are idealists. So this isn’t the place to run through all of them. In any case, the kind of idealism I have in mind will become clear in this essay itself.
So take as an example the following passage (written in 2005) from Harry Nielsen:
“ Almost unbelievably perhaps, [the academics who developed quantum mechanics] chose to interpret the strangeness of quantum behaviour by denying the existence of physical reality. And as a standard textbook interpretation of quantum mechanics, physicists have been taught for the last 80 years that physical reality therefore only exists as a result of the act of observation. This is the ‘Copenhagen interpretation’ of quantum mechanics, developed in the late 1920’s by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. To quote Heisenberg: ‘I believe that the existence of the classical ‘path’ can be pregnantly formulated as follows: The ‘path’ comes into existence only when we observe it’.”
The passage above doesn’t actually mention “idealism” — yet the general gist seems to be that the Copenhagen interpretation is idealist (or at least subjectivist). And it isn’t at all odd that this writer thought this way about this interpretation of quantum mechanics.
So it’s important to stress that the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics is not idealist. Or at least the Copenhagen interpretation itself can be interpreted as not being idealist. That said, it is difficult to explain why that’s so. Indeed not many physicists — or even philosophers — have fully clarified why that is so.
Finally, there are stronger arguments which assert that quantum mechanics — if not the Copenhagen interpretation itself — is entirely subjectivist in nature. Yet there are clear differences between subjectivism and idealism. Indeed, Harry Nielsen’s words above can be interpreted as only claiming that the Copenhagen interpretation is subjectivist, not idealist.
Various philosophers (such as Karl Popper) have also argued against those who claim that quantum mechanics is subjectivist , let alone idealist (see Popper here).
It is therefore convenient that there’s a short and simple passage (as quoted in Karl Popper’s The Logic of Scientific Discovery) from the Austrian physicist Arthur March (1891–1957) which perfectly clarifies this issue.
Firstly, Arthur March makes an explicit anti-idealist statement. (It’s not clear if that was his main intention — indeed, it probably wasn’t.) He wrote:
“Naturally nobody is so mad as to assert that a body ceases to exist the moment we turn our backs to it [].”
[March was referring to quantum bodies such as particles; not cups, trees or human beings.]
An idealist, on the other hand, would argue that
a body ceases to exist the moment we turn our backs to it.
And that’s because, to an idealist, “a body” — and everything else — only exists in the individual mind or in some kind of collective mind. Thus, it does indeed cease to exist when “we turn our backs to it”. (Unless, that is, it still exists in the mind of God — as with Bishop Berkeley immaterialism, in some other being’s mind or in a collective mind.)
Arthur March, on the other had, stated that it is “mad [] to assert” that idealist position. Yet March did preface that phrase with the following words:
“One may say perhaps without fear of being misunderstood [] that for the physicist a body has reality only in the instant in which he observes it.”
It’s worth noting the phrase “for the physicist”.
This isn’t an expression of a philosophical view or even of a layperson’s position. As a physicist, March was speaking entirely as a physicist.
So even though it may be problematic to stress observation alone, this is still the stress of a physicist qua physicist. And, almost by definition, a physicist is only concerned with the observations of — and experiments on — a (in March’s word) body.
Thus March, qua physicist, stated that the
“[body] does cease, in the moment, to be an object of inquiry for the physicist”.
Why is that?
It’s
“because there exists no possibility of saying anything about it which is based on experiment”.
March’s statement above is true by definition. That is, what comes before the experiment can’t actually be part of the experiment. Or if someone does “say[] anything about it”, then what he says can’t be based on the experiment, and is therefore not itself physics. Indeed, even the mathematical formalism and/or the wave function required for the experiment has nothing to “say” about any bodies before the experiment.
The wave function has just been mentioned.
Thus, the standard interpretation of the wave function is that — in itself — it has no physical interpretation. It is purely a mathematical function. A tool. Something physicists use to do things with. Of course, it can then be given a physical interpretation.
Take the Schrödinger equation.
This doesn’t tell us what the wave function is — other than in purely mathematical terms. The physical meaning of the equation — i.e., what entities, etc. are posited — is a product of the interpretation of quantum mechanics the physicist adopts.
And even when physicists do “guess” at the (as it were) before-observation, that too is only a use of the wave function; which, again, is a large abstract mathematical object made of smaller mathematical objects.
So, basically, Arthur March, qua physicist, wasn’t interested in what might have been the case before the experiment. And, presumably, he wasn’t that interested in what was the case — i.e., in the experimental area — after he took off his white coat and packed up his bags to go home. Alternatively, if he was interested in both the before and after of the experiment, then it was as a philosopher or a layperson, not as a physicist.
As hinted at in the introduction, it’s at least partly understandable that some people see the Copenhagen interpretation as being philosophically idealist in nature. In the passage in the introduction, for example, Harry Nielsen quoted Werner Heisenberg.
So I’ll help Nielson’s cause along by also quoting Heisenberg stating the following:
“[A]n ‘objective’ physics in this sense, i.e. a sharp division of the world into object and subject has indeed ceased to be possible.”
Such passages from Heisenberg and others have provided grist to the mill for various idealists, mystics, New Agers and whatnot. Yet even here (on my reading of idealism at least) an idealist simply can’t make any distinction at all between “object and subject”. (Of course, it’s possible that the word “object” can be defined in such as way that it squares with idealism.) That’s because (to an idealist) literally everything is in the individual’s (or experimenter’s) mind. (Either that, or everything is in a collective mind or in the mind of God.) In other words, there is simply no object in idealism — we only have a subject or subjects.

When people hear ‘Danish,’ they typically think of Danish pastry, a multilayered sweet pastry with various fillings like cheese or a berry sauce. Or they think of Danish cheese.
From the moment I landed in Copenhagen, locals and people from my program told me to try the numerous famous bakeries in the city. Of course, as a foodie, I couldn’t say no.
But what I didn’t realize was how central of a gathering place bakeries are for Copenhageners (is that what they call them?). Their fast-paced life accompanies grabbing a pastry and cappuccino on their way to the office, or as a casual meet-up spot for friends as they get off work around 3 or 4 pm.
When I look back via camera roll at the delicious, warm, and fluffy pastries I tried, it evokes more than longing to have the level of freshness and quality these pastries have at an affordable price. It sucks me right back into highs and lows during my study abroad, new friendships blossoming, and lessons learned.
Here are five moments (and pastries) I am happy to share from my study abroad experience in Copenhagen:
A week into my stay, I found myself wandering through the streets near Kongens Nytorv, the city center filled with people, shops, and the famous Nyhavn canal. I was walking home after a class excursion feeling hungry and exhausted.
I was still figuring out public transportation (bus or train?) and I had unsuccessfully made any plans with new friends.
The homesickness and loneliness were starting to sink in.
I stumbled upon the nearest coffee shop, Farumhus, which translates to “farmhouse.” I walked in and ordered the Kanelstang, a cinnamon Danish pastry but elegantly twisted in various ways, depending on the bakery.
The place was about to close, so the lady ringing me up offered me an extra pastry for free. her kindness was a small act but stirred a few tears for me, sprouting a tiny sense of belonging in this new country.
Biting into the Kanelstang felt like a warm hug as well, with the generous layers of cinnamon and the intricate swirls, perfect for ripping pieces as I sat on a bench and people-watched for the evening.
I’ve been to this bakery twice during my stay and both times were with new friends I had made. My Food and Identity professor recommended this bakery, located in the Meatpacking District, to our class after a field study in the area.
My friends and I sat outside the bakery in Enghave Plads: this utopian park area where families, friends, and children gathered to chat, play, and spend time together. How I long for areas like these in the US. It was a great area to break the ice over delicious treats and get to know each other more.
As an Indian, trying a cardamom bun was absolutely out of my comfort zone. But strangely it’s a popular pastry option in Copenhagen. But the lemon tart was gorgeous. A light and fluffy meringue, with the tart lemon flavor, dare I say — it’s almost better than a key lime pie (shocker! as a Floridian.)
I was well into my study abroad and just completed my second session. Life was good, I was finally getting used to navigating the area, and made some good friends and memories. But I was longing for one of my favorite moments of my stay: my partner visiting me.
I purposely avoided a few attractions and restaurants to try when he got here, which included Skt. Peders Bageri, which translates to St. Peter’s bakery. A cozy bakery that hails as one of the oldest in Copenhagen, they’re known for their Wednesday snails (cinnamon rolls) that I regretfully did not try. I know nothing about authentic Danish food, but this certainly felt what ‘authentic’ would be.
I tried their plain croissant which was indubitably the BEST croissant I’ve had in my life (I think about it often..) and had to snag a blueberry pastry (pictured) as I saw a worker carry it out fresh from the oven.
Even trying my partner’s picks of pastries, every single item here was divine, fresh, heartwarming, perfectly sweet, with golden flaky crusts. This certainly ranks as the best bakery I tried on this list.
When I was down to a week left in Copenhagen, my friend and I scrambled to try the missing bakeries like Juno (pictured left), famous for its cardamom bun. This was the only bakery I waited an hour in line for. Would I say it was worth it? Maybe, if they had more options available.
But Juno sticks to what they do best and people line up for it, fostering this humming excitement waiting in line as people socialize — standing, sitting at tables, across the street if there’s no room — it feels like a hidden pocket of hygge [hue-gah], the epitome of Danish comfort and coziness.
I really was on my croissant high, trying one in both places, searching for a crust so flaky a knife would scrap across beautifully, a hint of sweetness and saltiness, and the soft multitude of layers inside.
After a long day of souvenir shopping my friend and I sat at Original Coffee, located in the heart of the Strøget shopping district. It’s located on the top floor of Illum, a department store, and serves as an excellent place to look at the city and reflect on the city.
We thought back on everything we got to experience and do, what we learned, whether would we even come back to Copenhagen, and when? What about a different place to study abroad? It certainly was a wistful atmosphere as we enjoyed our last few days being abroad.
My last ‘Danish’ meal before I headed to the airport to fly home, Joe and the Juice is the only place on this list that has a location back in the US. Their pricey smoothies and juices, along with the default Danish pastries, are available on every other corner of Copenhagen. They’re delicious and healthy. It’s no surprise that they’re one of the top food chains in Denmark.
Yet, it had me feeling nostalgic. Before coming to Copenhagen, I had heard and seen this chain but passed it off as a pricey, overly healthy spot that wasn’t worth going to.
However, coming to Copenhagen shook up my perspective on things, and now I was willing to try the very same spot in its original country. Studying abroad pushed me to try foods, and seek out places I would never go to back home. In Orlando, I’m so used to going to the same few spots, complaining about nothing new to do, and sending myself in the loop of my weekly routines.
But when I was in this brand new city, I was wide-eyed, ready to explore, and curious about each corner, hidden gem shawarma spot, an interesting castle, or nature an hour’s ride away.
I just hope to carry this newfound excitement in exploration as I explore my city and reminisce about my summer studying abroad in Copenhagen.

After a long, dark, freezing, and often soul-crushing winter, Copenhagen slowly begins to come alive in April. It’s green and beautiful with colorful flowers all over the city.
And right in the middle of so many colors, when the cherry trees blossom, their delicate white and pink petals create a stunning contrast against the lush green grass and the clear blue sky.
Copenhagen is full of cherry blossom trees. You see them everywhere. They are in the gardens of tall buildings and standalone houses, in playgrounds, near water bodies, and even lining the roads.
This was quite surprising for me during my first year here. I always pictured Denmark as people biking through the streets, taking icy dips in the sea, and sipping coffee with Danish pastries in cozy cafés.
But cherry blossoms?
That was something I never expected.
This was one of the sweetest surprises that Copenhagen, the world’s happiest city, has given me.
I’ve travelled to over 20 countries, some just once, others many times, but Japan has always remained a dream. Though I have planned many times, a trip to…

(a to-do list at the bottom)
A city that mostly moves to the rhythm of cycles. With 350km of bicycle tracks, it’s a city where legs and bicycles are synonymous. Silences and blank expressions can be easily mistaken for snobbery, while in fact being softness, simplicity, and kindness of the locals. The cinnamon swirls are sweet and the coffee is strong, old guys play chess in Wednesday evening clubs and old ladies bike by faster than both of us.
I was educated on what makes a city truly ‘emotionally intelligent’ by the architects of a smart city, and something they said that has become my rule to observe was that — a city is not defined by the buildings it has or makes, its energy is defined by the spaces “between” those buildings. Copenhagen is a city where urban development has been based on and around its nature and green cover- that’s really the true beauty of this place. They make it easy to carry luggage without using cars, to walk, bike to work or run back home through lakes and gardens without worrying about traffic or breaking rules. It is truly a sustainably intelligent city.
Areas in Copenhagen are spread out wide, and very self-sustained in terms of food, coffee, parks and culture. Someone living in Frederiksberg doesn’t need to come into Indre-by and someone in Christiania has no actual need to go into Vesterbro. While I loved the neighborhood local vibe of Norrebero and Frederiksberg, I did feel like my eventual place of stay around HC Andersons Boulevard. From airbnbs to eco-hotels, the average rate in Copenhagen doesn’t vary too much if you’re a last-minute nomad like me but I highly recommend at least 2 days in the hotel I stayed in (details at the bottom)
Eat & Drink- only my 2023 favorites, in no way exhaustive :)
Stay- my personal favorite is the Manon Les Suites Hotel — an eco hotel with the best of comfort meets conscious in a central location. If you prefer an Airbnb, check the ones around Norrebro and make sure you check step free access.
Getting Around- Rent an e-bike but not from a hotel.
Yoga - I’ll always check out yoga studios in every city as a personal rule and my favorite one here was ‘Rive Gauche’. The weekly pass makes it easier on the pocket than a one time pay.
Places to Run/Walk- The Lakes, Rosenborg Gardens, Frederiksberg Garden

Grundtvigs Church was erected in commemoration of the great Danish priest, poet, and reformer N.F.S. Grundtvig (1783–1882). This monumental church is referred to in modern terms as a gothic cathedral. Master builder and architect Peder Vilhelm Jensen Klint (1853–1930) died before the church was finished. The task was entrusted to his son architect and designer Kaare Klint (1888–1954), who completed the building of the church in 1940. Kaare Klint has also designed the chairs for the Grundtvigs Church — a chair made of beech wood with wickerwork seat — a Danish furniture design classic. Despite its massive size, the church seems to exude an atmosphere of calm contentment. Perhaps it is the appeal of the regular yellow brickwork forming the sole decoration of the church.

Conceived as an iconic building, which create awareness of cancer without stigmatizing the patients. Designed as a number of small houses combined into one, the center provides the space needed for a modern health facility, without losing the comforting scale of the individual. The houses are connected by raised roof shaped like a Japanese paper art origami, which gives the building a characteristic signature.
Nørre Allé 45, 2200 København N, Dinamarca
The close coexistence between private and communal spaces, often separated only by a thin door, makes this hall of residence quite unique. In fact, the dialogue between individuality and communality forms the very basis for the architecture and layout of Tietgenkollegiet.
Tietgenkollegiet was the result of an architecture competition organised by the Nordea Denmark Foundation with the intention of building a visionary version of the hall of residence of tomorrow. Lundgaard and Tranberg’s round building won the competition. On both the architectural and metaphorical fronts, it is all about inclusion, community and equality.
Rued Langgaards Vej 10–18, Ørestad North
Built for The Medical Association housing scheme and initially were known as Lægeforeningens Boliger. These well-built but relatively inexpensive houses for poor families were some of the first social housing in Copenhagen and were built on the initiative of doctor Emil Hornemann as an immediate and practical response to a cholera epidemic in Copenhagen in 1853.

Cirkelbroen
Cirkelbroen celebrates pedestrians. It reflects the daily life and intimacy that you find around the canal in the Christianshavn neighbourhood, its houseboats and sailing boats, the unique life on the ramparts. Copenhagen’s harbour was once a centre of maritime activity, and Cirkelbroen is a testimony to that history. While working on the bridge, I remembered the fishing boats I saw as a child in Iceland. In the harbour, the boats were often moored right next to each other, and it sometimes seemed that you could even cross the harbour just by walking from boat to boat.
Christianshavns Kanal, København K
The Kalvebod Waves
When addressing this infamously gloomy and desolated side of the harbor, the architects put their focus on two major design aspects: to create urban continuity and to locate the new structure on the sunny spots in the water.
Facing Southeast, the quay has fantastic sun conditions until the early afternoon, but to attract the public after working hours the architects needed to study the course of the shadows casted by the huge buildings along the promenade. The two new main piers are located in the shadow-free zones and programmed as active islands on the water. The project then re-connects those islands to the urban network and to makes them blend naturally into the city’s infrastructure. Two bridges link the tip of the main piers back to the old quay, creating two inner water-basins for watersport activities.
Superkilen
Superkilen is a park that supports diversity. It is a world exhibition of furniture and everyday objects from all over the world, including benches, lampposts, trash cans and plants — requisites that every contemporary park should include and that the future visitors of the park have helped to select. Superkilen reattributes motifs from garden history. In the garden, the translocation of an ideal, the reproduction of another place, such as a far off landscape, is a common theme through time. As the Chinese reference the mountain ranges with the miniature rocks, the Japanese the ocean with their rippled gravel, or how the Greek ruins are showcased as replicas in the English gardens. Superkilen is a contemporary, urban version of a universal garden.
Radio House
Politikens Boghal
With two floors filled with books written in Danish and English, Politikens Boghal is fairly-often considered one of the top choices for book lovers in Copenhagen. The warm bookstore associated with Politiken, one of the largest newspapers in the country, has been welcoming locals and foreigners since 1915. On its selves, visitors can find old and new releases of everything from fiction and poetry to nature and hobby books. Moreover, special events such as concerts, speeches, and presentations take place regularly throughout the year attracting the city’s intellectual crowd.
Politikens Boghal, Rådhuspladsen 37, Copenhagen
Cinnober Bookstore
Cinnober has been standing in the heart of the city center for approximately 10 years. Its founders, Ulla Welinder and Morten Voigt, have a great passion for graphic design and illustration. Therefore, a big part of their book selection consists of magazines and books that showcase the best of design, architecture, and art. Make sure to stop by while exploring the area around the Round Tower and rummage through the bookstore’s collection of local artists’ prints and paper products. Visitors might even find a special souvenir to take back home.
Cinnober Bookstore, Landemærket 9, Copenhagen
Palermo Hollywood
The colourful tropical storm that is Palermo Hollywood is the brightest workspace and concept store in all of Nørrebro. Its a modern mash-up, where art and pop culture, sensuality and seriousness, fun and quality — and especially GOLD & GLITTER — go hand in hand. The shop stocks contemporary english books from modern feminism to colouring books, stylish stationary and selected fashion accessories. Pop on down and feel the vibes the girls are bound to make you smile.

My brother, who’s a volunteer, greeted me in pink sunglasses, with a big smile, and an “I haven’t slept yet”. It’s Saturday, 9.30 at Ungdomsøen. In the short distance, I heard an intense bass blasting into the greyscale sky.
We dropped my bag at the camping area. Spending time at major festivals throughout the summer made me notice how clean it was. Despite me arriving four days into the festival, no trash was lingering around, no broken pavilions, no lonely crying.
As I got a tour around the island, I started to understand why there seemed to be an invisible cloud of respect and love. No brands were screaming their logos into my face, no careless investors were occupied with my amount of money. When you build with a pure heart, you attract pure hearts and pure behaviour.
It’s 11 in the morning. At Astral we sat down for a moment. Platforms vibrating with the music were occupied by sleeping cuddles, stretching bodies and tired dancers. The ambience sound playing was in my head the sound of the universe. The projections on the walls allowed my imagination to be imagination, as I closed my eyes and landed on planet Kune.
Close to noon, I understood that time is irrelevant. 15 people were dancing to an after-hour groove at Space. The atmosphere was uplifted, yet exhausted. A magical mix. At Vessel, the sound was fast, edged and deep. Several people came to say hi, saying that they haven’t seen me all week. As I explained that I just arrived, I was greeted with hugs, smiles and “please enjoy”.
I sent my brother to sleep, agreeing to meet again at night. At the harbour, I asked about the food, as I started to feel hungry for lunch. There’s no third-party involved, all food was thought and created at and by the festival.
People arrived at the same destination for a bite. Some before finally going to bed, some for a wake-up meal. They all smiled at me.
I spent the daytime napping, walking around, talking to people. In Copenhagen, I am so used to introducing myself with my job, my place of living. My commercialised existence. Here, no one cared about my fancy title, yearly income or place of birth. I met Daniel from Romania, Ash from Australia, Olivia and Lukas from Denmark, Toni from Hungary, Anne from France. English was default, as the world united on a small island in the middle of Øresund.
As the night sat, a few hours of sleep had done wonders to the face of my dear brother. He and his girlfriend gave me a tour around the many tunnels before we grabbed dinner in the kitchen. Tomato soup and a Moroccan stew warmed me up as my body was thankful for a fresh and homemade meal made with love and appreciation for its ingredients.
A beer and a drink later, I found myself in front of the speakers at Space. The darker it got, the more magical it all seemed. The stage was sculptured in wood as visuals reflected, played and enhanced the artwork. I couldn’t stop looking, moving, smiling.
I have spent many years feeling awkward, feeling wrong, feeling like the one on the outside. As if I was born on the wrong side of the glass, peeking in on the many people moving their hips, choking alcohol and aggressive consumption culture. I spent the summer missing Copenhagen 10 years ago. Back when Saxons, KB18, Christiania, Ungdomshuset and pirate parties were dominating the underground with heavy drum N bass, dubstep, techno, jungle and everything between and outside. But there, in front of the Space speakers, I finally felt like I did 10 years ago, I felt like I was on the right side of the glass.
At Vessel, I arrived at a deep and evil sound. The screens reflected my inner stage, as I let go. Of whatever was on the mainland, whatever was in the world, whatever was on my worried mind. I no longer cared for time, schedules, work or hate. All I cared about was dancing with people who like me, gave up modern slavery for a moment, only to be slaves of the bass. And damn, that bass deserved my soul.
The night was a pendulum between Space, Vessel, Amphi, Astral and water views. I got lost several times, but it didn’t feel like getting lost. I noticed how the clean behaviour continued into the dark. Trash was being sorted, pocket ashtrays used, water drank. Once in a while, someone in a red Kune-shirt asked me if I was feeling all right, they were the safer space guards. The funny thing is, that a small island with young people and 24 hours music sounds like a recipe for chaos and uncontrolled madness — but never have I visited a festival where I felt safer. People knew what they were doing, and did it with respect. For each other, for Kune and for themselves.
As the sun peaked above the horizon, I started to feel my sore feet at Vessel. We sat down, a random group of people. We shared a moment. Thoughts and ideas were aired, and I understood, that this is the place where the ‘angry young people’ smile. Not because they party, but because they feel free to let dreams touch reality. I came down, feeling like I landed on a soft pillow of utopian hope.
Thank you, Kune. Your revolution is heartfelt, honest and kind. I’ll carry it with me until I’ll see you again next year.

By Kai Chen
I studied abroad in Copenhagen last semester through DIS Copenhagen. Copenhagen is gorgeous! The colorful buildings, the cozy cafes, and the endless green spaces all make for the perfect European vibe. As soon as I got off the plane, I knew I was in for an incredible adventure.
As someone who is passionate about foreign languages, I was stoked to dive headfirst into Danish culture and start learning the language. The Danes are all about hygge (coziness), and the language has fun words and phrases you won’t find anywhere else. Plus, the locals were super patient with my attempts to speak Danish and were always down to teach me new words, as is the case with pretty much everywhere else I’ve been to in Europe.
Taking economics classes in Copenhagen has been a unique and enriching experience. One key difference between these courses and those at Duke University is the practical approach to learning in Danish economics classes. Through field trips to France and Belgium, I saw firsthand how economic principles are applied in real-world contexts. Traveling to those countries as part of one of my economics classes gave me invaluable insights into different economic systems and policies and how they impact societies. This hands-on approach to learning economics allowed me to directly apply the knowledge I gained in class and see its real-world implications, a departure from my classes at Duke that did not typically involve field trips. Another notable distinction was the informal relationship with professors in Denmark, as I could address them by their first names, creating a more relaxed and approachable learning environment. This unique blend of practicality and informality in my economics class in Copenhagen has broadened my perspective on the subject and enriched my overall learning experience.
But the best part? Getting to travel all over Europe! Copenhagen is such a perfect home base for exploring other countries. I hopped on trains and planes to visit cities like Hamburg, Amsterdam, and Paris. It was amazing to see each culture’s differences through their architectures, and I love to explore those cultures through their nature, and oftentimes, museums as well.
Back in Denmark, I loved exploring all the cool neighborhoods of Copenhagen. From the hipster vibes of Nørrebro to the quaint streets of Christianshavn, there was always something new to see. And the food? Don’t even get me started. Danish pastries, smørrebrød, and hot dogs (yes, hot dogs) were some of my favorites.
And let’s not forget about the people! I made some of the coolest friends during my study abroad program from all over the world. We bonded over our love of travel, languages, and hygge, and we still keep in touch today.
Overall, my study abroad experience in Copenhagen was one for the books. I got to immerse myself in a new language and culture, travel Europe, and make lifelong friends. If you’re into languages and travel like me, I can’t recommend studying abroad enough!

In the beginning of March 2023 we met in Copenhagen for a 3-day WP4 workshop focused on the ongoing development of our PwY decision support tool (DST) that is a deliverable of the Working Package 4. During these days, members of the Swedish team from Södertörn University met with colleagues from Copenhagen University for hands-on activities meant to advance our project on selected aspects of the decision support tool.

During these three days, we revised findings from WP2 and WP3. Work package 2 focuses on the study of current challenges and opportunities planners and other professional face in Sweden, Netherlands and Denmark in relation to the involvement of youth in spatial planning. Work package 3 focuses on testing, exploring and piloting with different participatory methods and it seeks to understand if and how these allow youth to participate in meaningful ways. In this sense, WP4 and its deliverable, the decision support tool, brings all that research insight together in an integrated way.
Image: Sofia Lundmark facilitating an activity for the workshop.
The workshop was facilitated by our team collaborator Sofia Lundmark, Senior Lecturer at Media Technology Department at Södertörn University. Sofia use methods from design studies to facilitate the sessions and led us over key questions.
Our project team is a combination of collaborators with different scientific backgrounds and experiences who are connected by an interest in interdisciplinary approaches to sustainability and urban planning. This diversity allows us to borrow tools and perspectives from each other’s discipline, stay fresh and be creative. This is particularly important when developing and designing a tool meant for use in different national contexts and by different stakeholders.
But what is the Planning with Youth decision support tool and whom is it meant to support?
Decision support tools are a compilation of information and data organized in a systemic way meant to assist professionals with their day-to-day work. A DST does not give a final answer as such but gives access to needed information and data for the professional to consider and use in decision-making processes on a given matter.
Planning and urban governance is a field with many decisions support tools and systems. But very few are developed in the context of youth and children participatory processes. Our objective is to contribute with a new tool for planners and practitioners to use when needing to prepare and delivery participatory processes that are meaningful for children and young people.
The DST will provide planners and practitioners with key information about methods for involving children and young people in participatory planning. We envision for the PwY tool to become a useful instrument. For the Swedish context, this is particularly relevant considering that from 2021 and following the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child, planners are obliged by law to include children and youth in participatory spatial planning processes. You can read more about the Swedish context and its challenges in this article produced by members of our team.
Furthermore, even in countries that have not enforced the inclusion of youth in urban planning, this remains an ongoing and necessary challenge that aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Ultimately, we hope that by using the DST urban planners will get the support they need to create (with youth) cities that are more democratic, sustainable and accessible and reflect the needs and uses of the entire population.

Stay tuned for more on our upcoming decision support tool!

Copenhagen inspiration from one friend of a friend to another
I recently booked a weekend in Stockholm to visit some friends who’d moved there. To make the most of being in the area, I added a few days somewhere I heard people consistently rave about: Copenhagen.
▶️ Instagram Highlights️️▶ Copenhagen Google Map▶ Visit Copenhagen Official Website
I put up a call for tips on my Instagram right before going and received so many wonderful tips that I felt I should make a guide linking it all together. The result is a combination of the top things recommended, with a bit of Stubborn Travel curation and personal favourites. I hope it can help as a quick planning aid to this delightful city, home to the happiest people on Earth.
A huge thank you to the awesome travellers and locals who contributed, especially Amalie, Courtenay, James, Nina and Caitlin.

Welcome to the United Nations Career Journey Podcast, where we interview colleagues working for the United Nations all around the world. Our conversations explore their fascinating career paths, what career satisfaction means to them, and how they keep learning and developing on the job. My name is Petra, and today, our conversation is with Iina Paarma who works as a Chief of the Talent Development Unit at the UNDP’s Office of Human Resources based in Copenhagen, Denmark. Welcome to the Career Journey Podcast Iina, it’s good to see you. And thank you very much for joining us. It’s a pleasure to have you as our guest speaker on the podcast.
Hi, Petra. Thank you. It’s my pleasure to be here with you today.
Thank you again. And could you introduce yourself to our listeners?
Absolutely. So, my name is Iina Paarma. And as Petra said, I’m the Chief of the Talent Development Unit at UNDP. I’m also a proud mother of two children. And I grew up in Finland and sometime in my early teenage years, I started dreaming of an international career in international development.
Lovely, thank you very much. My first question that I want to ask about your career is how did you begin your career? It can be internships, or maybe first job, so what was the start of your career?
Well, during my studies, I did have a chance to do an internship in my home country’s representation office in Vienna, in Austria. And I also studied one term in Geneva, as an exchange student during my master’s studies. And another one actually in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. But after completing my master’s degrees, I actually landed a job in the private sector, and then actually another job in the private sector. But somewhere during those years, I did realize that the sort of the dream to be part of the UN, or the international community, had actually never really disappeared. And so, I started applying for jobs in different international organizations. This was already around the time when I was approaching 30. It took it took almost three years, but then late 2012, I got my first assignment with UNOPS, actually here in Copenhagen, and I spent a number of years in that agency. And then, in 2017, I joined UNDP, in New York City after having applied for a position that I found on UNDP Jobs site.
Thank you for this introduction, Iina. And how was the transition into getting into UNDP, after spending time in the private sector and also in another UN organization? And also, which specific tools have been useful for you for this transition, and during this transition?
Yeah, I mean, when I joined the UN, then in 2012, early 2013, that’s when I was coming from the private sector, and I joined UNOPS in Copenhagen. So that transition wasn’t actually that, you know, that big one. It was really a dream to come true. But in terms of specific tools that have been useful, I think, first of all, I’ve tried to do my job as well as I only can. And secondly, you know, I have hopped on every opportunity that was given to me. And early on in the UN, in UNOPS, I also had fantastic bosses who believed in me and took me to meetings, and, you know, let me job shadow them. And that has been incredibly powerful, and I am really, forever grateful for this. And it was a pivotal steppingstone for me to be able to be sort of, on-the-job mentored by my people manager early on in my UN days. Then in terms of tools in general, I mean, I learned incredibly much from interactions with others. So, in that sense, the transition to the UN wasn’t a difficult one, it was a fascinating one.
That’s very good to hear. And I think these points are can be very useful for someone who is trying to look for maybe inspiration or ways to do that step to get into the UN system, but also just career tips in general. So, thank you so much for, for sharing those. So, your role as the Chief of the Talent Development Unit, could you explain a little bit to our listeners what is it about, what are some of the tasks that are a part of your daily job?
Yeah. So, you know, UNDP, we’re a big organization, we are close to 20,000 people in 170 countries. So, this role is really to lead the Talent Development Unit that focuses on leadership development, people manager development, career experiences, capability development. So, we have the three sort of main components in the unit. And overall, we are catering for the talent needs of the whole organization. We are really looking at talent development and learning as something that happens in the flow of work. It’s, it’s not a one-off sort of exercise, it’s sort of part of our DNA as an organization. We believe that creating a learning organization is something that is embedded in every aspect of the organization. And UNDP puts a lot of effort in talent development, we see that as a catalyst for organizational performance, for sure. But also, people’s careers, their career development, and their professional development.
This is great, and working with learning and talents, that must be something very rewarding for you as well, to help the people to develop themselves. But I would like to ask you my next question, and that is, what do you like the most about your role? What aspects of your job of your current job bring you career satisfaction?
I think for me, I am a people person. So definitely teamwork and learning from others. And the fact that I do feel very privileged to have the opportunity to work with people from all over the world, it is extremely rewarding to constantly, you know, develop oneself as one hears about other people’s perspectives based on their backgrounds, you know, be it educational, or cultural, or other backgrounds. The UN is also a big part of my identity. So, so serving this greater purpose of the UN is something that brings me enormous satisfaction. So then when I think about the current role, our team is not in the frontlines of international development. But what brings us satisfaction is the fact that we can develop the ones who are closer to our beneficiaries. And we can see that directly translated into better results on the ground.
That sounds great. And I think this is something that is a big motivating factor for many people working at the UN. And you also mentioned that it was your dream, when you were younger, that, you know, you really wanted to work for the UN. So, it’s actually great that it’s now a part of your daily motivation and career satisfaction. On the other hand, what are some of the more challenging, perhaps, aspects of your job? Or something that you need to continuously work with? Could you just share some of those with our listeners?
Yeah, you know, I think in terms of challenges, this is a global organization that’s present in 170 countries like I mentioned, and this means that someone is always awake, and the work never stops. So, I would say, you know, UN colleagues in general are very committed, you know, hardworking people. So, it’s very easy to sort of get into that sort of ‘someone is always awake’ mode. So, I would say that what I’m trying to learn is to manage myself in such a way that I allow enough time to rest and recharge, so as to be the best version of myself in the workplace.
That’s very good to highlight because I think this topic is very important. And to highlight the need for, you know, strengthening your resilience and well-being is something very important. So, thank you for bringing that to the discussion. And that actually kind of leads to my next question. Sometimes our mental health can be challenged by big changes, challenging moments, and it can take a toll on how we feel about our careers. So my next question is, could you share a time in your career where you had some big changes in responsibilities of your role, and how did you approach it and what did you learn from it?
Yeah, I think, I think maybe the sort of critical juncture for me was when I joined UNDP, in 2017, and moved to New York, the new role was quite different from my previous role and UNDP, as an organization also worked in a very different way than my previous organization. So I think I learned to appreciate that it takes some time to grasp the new context and asking the right questions and understanding that, you know, one should not assume that what worked well in your previous role and organization is, is sort of directly applicable in the in the new content, or in the new context. I think the learnings maybe happened, sort of, in some kind of internal after-action review and reflection, also now in hindsight, realizing that UN, especially when it comes to relocations, those are not only your decisions, if you have family members who are joining you, and so, so certainly reflecting afterwards, the appreciation of the willingness of my family to join me and also looking back at not only those years, but also throughout my career in the UN, as someone who was raising children as well, I am having such gratitude and sort of humility. And understanding that those people around me, you know, grandparents and relatives and their immediate family members have certainly been enablers for me, and for that I am, I am very grateful.
That’s lovely, thank you so much for sharing that. And, yeah, I can totally imagine that these changes of relocating to a different country, different continent, changing your are a big milestone in everyone’s lifetime. And so sharing those learning outcomes might be very useful and good to hear, and I’m sure a lot of our listeners can relate to it as well. Talking about living abroad and having different international experiences, experiences from different career paths and career experiences, what are some of the best tips you have gathered throughout your career so far, when it comes to either creating a career that you like, creating a satisfying career, or just navigating a career in general?
Well, I think it’s important to follow your heart and your passion, when you enjoy what you do, it makes, it makes it all so much easier. And it shows also in the results you deliver, you know, when I grew up, the mentality was a little bit like, you know, job is a job, and then life happens outside of the job, and you should sort of play the same card, you know, study hard and get a job that you can have until you retire. And, you know, we all know, especially the young generations, that those days are over. So, I think maybe, you know, understanding that these type of career moves and career aspirations, they always come with a certain risk. You can’t have it all, you know, you should always in mind, you follow your passion, and understand that that’s not necessarily always the most sort of stable path. But if that’s what you truly want, you should go for it. And then I think in general, I mean, when it comes to sort of career tips, I’m not sure if I’m the best one to share any of those. Once someone much wiser than me told me that, you know, essentially, there are two ways to plan your career, either you go with the flow, or you have clear goals of the type of roles and profiles you’re aspiring for, and then, you know, you make a roadmap and follow that path. Honestly, I have personally been one of the sorts of go with the flow type of profiles. And, you know, that has worked for me. I have jumped on the opportunities that had been in front of me, and sometimes it’s been daunting, but I would say, you know, go for it. All jobs are extremely valuable. You learn things in whatever role you have, for however short time you would have that, you know, it teaches you about the role itself, but it also allows you to meet different people who might have different tips.
These are really great tips and advice and I’m sure the listeners will find it very helpful because I think it’s always good to be reminded of, you know, following the passion and having that as the guiding… guiding light of when you’re trying to navigate through the career so, so thank you very much for that. I’d like to ask you, where would you like to be career-wise in the next coming years? Or do you have any maybe aspirations as well? I know you just shared with us that you prefer to, you know, maybe go with the flow. But is there anything you’d like to achieve in the next coming years in terms of your career?
Oh, thanks for the question. You know, I love my current role. I‘ve been in this role for some 18 months. And I feel that I still have quite a lot to give in this current position. And then future will show what’s the what’s next in in store for me.
Well thank you very much, and I wish you all the best! I really enjoyed our conversation. And I found it very interesting and insightful. And yeah, I hope you had a good time as well.
Absolutely. My pleasure Petra, and keep up with the great job, great work that you’re doing here with the podcast.
Thank you very much! And thank you to all our listeners. We hope you enjoyed this episode and that our conversations will inspire you to keep learning and advancing in your careers. If you liked the episode, please share it with your friends and colleagues, and make sure to tune in for the next one.

Just about a year ago I moved into this incredibly small and beautiful country called Denmark all the way from India to pursue my PhD. I had dreamt about it for a long time and it was so surreal when I actually landed in Copenhagen. Noone back home understood why I chose this strange far away cold land when I could have been applying to top universities in the US; hustling away in pursuit of an empire I had no desire to build in the first place. To me, a safe, happy and a peaceful place would make moving my entire life to another country absolutely worth it. Copenhagen consistently ranked among the top three livable cities in the world while Denmark is popularly known for being one of the happiest countries across the entire world. I knew that as an expat the rules would be different; I wouldn’t share the same benefits that the Danes enjoy and perhaps, my opinions about the happiness index would be different from how the Danes perceive it. That is not say that the index is wrong because it is indeed the opinions of the Danish citizens that actually matter.
My priorities in life were always different. I didn’t care about owning a car and a house to display how successful I was in my social circle. To me, peace of mind, having just enough of what you need and want, and respect were above materialistic desires. That is not to say that money didn’t matter to me. I want to be wealthy in terms of experiences, good health, healthy relationships and money is just a part of wealth. As an overly anxious, introverted and sensitive person, I learnt from a very young age what my triggers were and how to cope with them and so I knew that working in an annoyingly bureaucratic corporate structure and culture was not for me. While I have financially successful friends I really respect and admire, I have no desire to talk the same language as them. I started working young and ensured that I would never have to borrow money from my parents anymore whether it was for my education or materialistic pursuits. If I couldn’t afford it, I wouldn’t buy it. I chose academia simply because at the time it gave me the freedom to think, read, and write the way I wanted and I was given due credit for it. I wanted to move away right after my Masters but my father was clear that unless I had a scholarship, it wouldn’t be worth it. And, that’s when it all began! A six year long journey post my Masters making peanuts but doing what I loved, saving just enough to finally take the leap. I had my eyes on Denmark for many reasons, the most important being safety and gender equality.
One year down and I wouldn’t call it perfect but I know it in my gut that I made the right choice. They ask, what was the biggest culture shock for you when you moved here? I laugh! Because India has given me far more cultural shocks than I expect to experience anywhere else. I have lived in different parts of India and navigated life across language and cultural barriers. We were united by the delicious food and our diversity itself! I am grateful for my journey from a tiny Indian town noone knows of to this beautiful city where I am living the life I always dreamt of. Life in India prepared me for life in a strange country I had absolutely no connection to. The struggles are not unfamiliar— a different language, the lack of a social circle, having to find an affordable living arrangement, getting familiar with the rules and regulations. Things that took me a while getting adjusted to was the right-hand traffic and the fact that there was barely any traffic :D Sure, the weather is rough and the winters are dark and the Danes are reserved (you know the stereotype), but every single day I am in awe of how this tiny little dot on the world map evolved into an architectural beauty, home to some of the largest MNCs and holding an impressive reputation of being politically progressive.
Danmark er virkelig et dejligt land! There was not a single day when a Dane refused to help a “confused” me trying to get used to the city. Often they would greet with a pleasant smile and would appreciate you trying to speak a little bit of broken Danish while making small talk. I deliberately chose to work with a Danish supervisor for two reasons — first I wanted to push myself to work with unfamiliar people (since Indians tend to flock to each other everywhere in the world; I am guilty of this too) and second, I had some serious toxic boss baggage from India that I knew would ease off in the flat heirarchical structure Scandanivian countries are famous for. Wait, I could call my seniors by their first names and they wouldn’t mind? And did you say they don’t call you after work hours (they never call you at all if you are lucky)? Also, you are not obligated to respond to their emails after 5 pm? Wait, did they ask for my opinion? Oh wait, the professors consider their PhD students “colleagues” and not slaves? And…whaaattt!! I am paid a living wage as a PhD student? To me, this was a dream! This is where I felt I could become a well-rounded person whose opinions were equally important and my gender didn’t decide how much I was paid.
I won’t lie I did have my own insecurities (thanks to our colonial past and the ensuing inferiority complex). I was in this land full of white people with beautiful blue/green eyes and blond hair, ones I had only seen on Television up until I moved to Denmark. Soon enough I realised we are bonded by similar desires and experiences that is only natural to the humankind and it is not the color of our skin but our openness to embracing the unknown that really mattered. Sure, I felt unseen many times in a conversation across a table that only white people could connect to (endless discussions over the origins of wine and cheese like we talk about chai and samosas) but this would be followed by a few empathetic people (or those afraid to be perceived as politically incorrect…kidding!) displaying a little bit of curiosity into my culture. I was suddenly representing India in these conversations; not my tiny hometown, not the cities that I lived in but the rich and diverse country that India is. I was educating people who had these preconceived biases against the Indians, some of which were quite ridiculous and rude to be frank (if you don’t eat red meat, you are religious; most of India is polluted, poor and filthy). Some of them had ill-informed opinions about Hinduism and the political situation in the country! On the other hand I was surprised by how India was perceived by Europeans in general. Many considered it to be the land of CEOs, shooting for the galaxies, full of lucrative investment opportunities, ofcourse Bollywood and interestingly home to the good “green stuff” (if you know what I mean ;)). Some applauded me for the bold choice to move to a cold country all the way from India while some struggled to grasp why any South Asian would want to move to this part of the world. I just enjoyed the ride! I am not one to get offended easily. It is only natural to have your prejudices but come to me with an open mind and I will answer all your questions. How you frame your words and the way you speak them tells me a bit about your upbringing and the conscious efforts you put into educating yourself to get rid of your biases often shaped by problematic western constructs. So hey! It has nothing to do with the color of your skin. You can be brown, white, black, straight, gay, queer and whatever you identify as and still be a vile person. In Denmark though, I have mostly met the nicest and most open minded people. They are not intrusive (which unfortunately we Indians could be most of the time), they are polite and respectful of other’s time and space, they call a spade a spade and they really do have a wonderful life outside of work (hygge anyone???). This is the place where I feel my own person, where nobody cares about my age, gender, marital status and whether or not I have kids. I am a far more evolved person than I was when I first moved here and I am doing things I never believed I would be able to do.
So that’s my first Medium post here, a short story of an Indian smalltowner in Denmark. Not sure if I would still call this the happiest place in the world but this sure is the happiest I have ever been :)

I remember well the last days before I left my Vilnius. Days, where I have been walking in the city, going to the places that I have always wanted to, but did not have time for it, spending time with my family and meeting with good old friends. Those days were great. However, the time flies fast. And even though I was quite excited to start a new life in a foreign country, I was also a bit worried. Who will be my new friends? When will Ifind a job? Will I like the studies? How will Copenhagen greet me? After a year of living here, I have found some answers.
Copenhagen greeted me with big white clouds and the hustle in the airport. The hustle of the people greeting their fellow travelers and the hustle of the people running for their planes. An airport is a place where people come and go. And I was one of the many arrived to Copenhagen. I remember that I was not at all impressed by Copenhagen in the first days. So many buildings so similar to each other, so few green spaces compressed between them and cyclists with their angry faces.
It is now, a year after living in Copenhagen, I understand that Copenhagen has so much to offer. Small details matter in this city and it feels like the community is trying to make it with a personal touch. Buildings in different neighborhoods do not look alike and there are very nice green spaces within the city. Only my perception of cyclists did not change.
Nevertheless, I came here to study Organizational Innovations and Entrepreneurship (OIE) — a masters program organized by Copenhagen Business School (CBS). The program offered quite an interesting path of studying, combining theoretical knowledge and practical classes with the most diverse class that I’ve been a part of in my life.
The beginning of the studies was quite interesting. We’ve had an introduction week, organized by previous OIE students, where we had a chance to visit some of the most prominent startup hubs and companies in Copenhagen, mingle together and get to know what awaits us in the future.
And the future was…
Studies at OIE program comprise of two different sets of subjects divided into 4 quarters throughout the first year. One subject will be practical (lectures which are happening in Studio) and the other one — theoretical. On the second year of education students are allowed to choose between exchange, electives, summer university or internship. Or it can be a mix of everything (up to 30 ECTS credits). After that — only master thesis and graduation, where everybody is happy :)
But let’s get back to the first year with compulsory subjects. As it was mentioned before there were 4 quarters with different focuses:
Furthermore, we have also had an elective course — study trip to Silicon Valley, where we have met 28 different companies throughout 2 weeks. You can read more about it in my previous stories on Medium (beginning, part 1, part 2).
As the courses implied, we have been working hard on different business ideas every quarter. I remember it like yesterday:
Q1. Developing an app for finding people/friends with similar interests
Q2. Developing a lip balm for winter sports enthuziasts
Q3. Developing a YouTube channel about local undiscovered places
Q4. Researching the “precariat” & changing spaces (in our case — CPH Village and containers made livable).
Plus we’ve had some of the theoretical classes related to the classical understanding of entrepreneurship, strategic management of innovations, the art of innovation (like design-driven innovation) and some other interesting activities combined together.
Last, but not least, CBS really tries hard to develop in us the entrepreneurial spirit, creating opportunities for the students to go further and make the ideas real. As part of our program, we have been also introduced to Copenhagen School of Entrepreneurship, whereas we, if there is any business idea, could try to get in and use the co-working spaces, advisors and other useful programs for free throughout the different stages of development.
Overall, the OIE program allows to develop the skills and abilities, necessary for becoming an entrepreneur or working with innovations within different fields. Plus, if you have a business idea — you can go for it. Nevertheless, the living costs in Copenhagen are not cheap and a big part of a Danish student life will be described in the next chapter.
Most of the students in Denmark are combining studies with student jobs. That’s a fact. Even though they are generously paid by the government scheme called SU, they are still working as part-time employees in different companies, starting from cafes and bars and ending with study-related jobs.
As my finances did not allow me to live here for two years without having an actual job, I started to look for the new opportunities in Copenhagen. Even though it took me some time (including exams and other activities) to find an actual first job (to be precise — 4 months), I had a great experience learning how the Danish job market operates.
Throughout the 4-month period I had 6 job interviews with different companies, where I had a chance to present myself and also get to know the other side of the table. In the end, I have landed a job at a local food chain, where I have been working as Operations Assistant, learning to deal with numbers, revenues, Excel and developing programs. Nevertheless, during the summer situation has changed and I have to find a new job, which I would like to learn from most, combining my previous experience with my skills and knowledge.
One lesson that I have learned throughout the year — try to be more unique in every aspect that goes throughout the job search adventure. And, the most important, show the companies what you can bring to the advertised position and show that you are a valuable person worth the salary that you will get while working there.
Pro tip: students from EU — if you have a part-time job, working min. 10–12 hours/week — apply for a student scholarship (SU) to be equal with Danish students. More info: www.su.dk
What is a student life without fun? The answer is easy — it is not a student life. People, with whom you are studying, can bring a lot of joy, happiness and adventures throughout the years that you will be studying together and, most probably, they will become the friends for life.
I had the honor to meet with people from different countries and cultures, with whom I had a lot of fun and great things done together. Copenhagen is a great city, where if you want to do something — you will find it. It offers a wide variety of events, places, bars, cafes, parks where you can hang out with your friends, meet even more people and learn about Danish traditions. And, the most important thing, not to be lonely, because sometimes that feeling of being such can come.
Last year I have visited many different places and hometowns of my friends — Bornholm, Aalborg, San Francisco, Asturias. I have also participated in many local traditional events and learned more about Danish culture and who are Danes. Funny enough, but while being in Denmark, I have learned a lot about Mexican culture :) I had a lovely Christmas-New Year’s Eve period, seeing the local traditions and participating in them, seeing how Danes can be welcoming and how cozy are their homes.
Pro tip: check out the Survival Guide in Denmark, it is a great guide to find almost everything you need before your arrival or during your stay.
The first year in Denmark was an amazing experience. The weather was great (4 months of sun in a row), the people are awesome, the studies and the job gave me lots of new skills and knowledge.
I believe that the next year will be even better, with more interesting discoveries, experiences and amazing people. Especially now, when everybody will be back in Copenhagen and will be ready to rock’n’roll.

Copenhagen, Denmark (population of 799,033 as of 2020)
Copenhagen aims to be the world’s first carbon-neutral capital city by 2025 (The CPH 2025 Climate Plan, Copenhagen — Urban Development). Politically, the city also intends to demonstrate how it is possible for big cities to combine growth, development, and an enhanced quality of life while reducing carbon emissions at the same time. This goal sets Copenhagen as a frontrunner in the international arena.
Copenhagen designed its Climate Plan Roadmap in three phases and set on the first phase of the net-zero journey in 2013 with the ultimate goal to become carbon neutral by 2025. The plan was developed in line with the emergence of new knowledge and technology, as continued innovation allowed to make carbon reduction strategies possible and at scale. At the same time, the CPH 2025 Climate Plan seeks to enhance the quality of life for Copenhageners using carbon neutrality goals to change behavior and stimulate innovation, job creation and investments.
By 2018, Copenhagen has successfully achieved a reduction of carbon emissions per capita by 57% while the city’s population grew by 22%. This reduction was mostly due to the green conversion of power-generation and district heating systems from coal to biomass and the erection of wind turbines.
Figures 5, 6: Copenhagen carbon emissions actual and projected, 2005–2025
According to Figure 6, while the 2018 progress has been remarkable, it will require significant additional efforts to reach the 2025 targets. This aggressive goal is based on the city’s climate plan’s four pillars: (1) Energy consumption, (2) Energy production, (3) Mobility with reduced emissions, and (4) City Administration initiatives.
Energy consumption. This pillar primarily focuses on achieving energy efficiency for district heating and transitioning from oil to renewable energy systems. City of Copenhagen collaborates with large building owners on efficient management of their properties by monitoring their energy consumption and optimizing building operations.
Energy production. Copenhagen is powered mostly by renewable energy with more than 50% of electricity supplied by wind and solar, and approximately 80% of all electricity coming from renewable energy sources including bioenergy and geothermal energy (“A record year: Wind and solar supplied more than half of Denmark’s electricity in 2020.” State of Green). The city has ambitious efforts to add at least 460MW from wind turbines by 2025.
Mobility covers two groups of transportation: road and maritime. The city plans to convert all its public busses, road and harbor busses, to renewable energy sources and run on electricity, biodiesel, bioethanol, biogas, natural gas-electric hybrids or hydrogen fuel cell busses. The city is looking to expand public transportation and promote the use of bicycles to travel around the city. In addition to achieving a reduction of CO2 emissions, this initiative will have the benefit of significantly less street noise and reduced local air pollution (“Copenhagen aims to become a carbon neutral capital/Sustainable Transit.” Green City Times).
City Administration. This category sets an example for the Administration to lead the way to reduce the city’s energy consumption, green procurement and transition of the city’s vehicles and infrastructure to operate on alternative fuels. This is important in stimulating public-private partnerships, cooperation with other municipalities and other organizations, and engaging the citizens in the green transformation.
Copenhagen is showing an impressive reduction in carbon emissions. Two specific projects the city is proud of are EnergyLab Nordhavn and seawater use for cooling (“This is how Copenhagen plans to go carbon neutral by 2025.” World Economic Forum). EnergyLab Nordhavn is located in Copenhagen’s waterfront city district North Harbor. The EnergyLab was launched in 2015 in close partnership between academia, industry, utilities, and local government to design a full-scale smart city energy lab with innovative solutions in the areas such as intelligent waste handling, low-temperature district heating, clean public transportation, and super cycle highways. This project is looking at the whole energy system as one, integrating heat, electricity, and transport and testing new solutions such as large batteries and EVs to reduce peak load on the grid, intelligent heating of buildings, and a heat pump and storage system to improve flexibility and optimize local district heating network (“Cities 100: Copenhagen’s new Nordhavn neighborhood is a center of innovation for small energy systems.” C40 Knowledge).
Copenhagen also uses seawater from the harbor for its cooling system with the potential to cut emissions by 70% and keep about 80,000 tons of carbon out of the city’s direct atmosphere. In addition to the climate and environmental benefits, it costs less, takes up less space and it makes no noise. It works by pumping seawater of about 6C, using this water for the district water supply and returning water at about 16C back to the harbor (“Seawater keeps Copenhagen buildings cool.” Climate Change Adaptation).
This is a case study for the main article, Urban Path to Net-Zero: Leading Strategies of the Most Energy-Efficient Cities.

This is a short summary of what I saw in the conference, what I liked and didn't like and what I think was most interesting or worth notice considering my personal preferences and needs.
It was my first international conference and also the biggest conference I've attended so far, so please take that into account when reading this.
The conference had a good amount of different topics, I was satisfied with the balance between topics related with soft and hard skills, although, some of the mandatory talks could be frustrating to some people due to the lack of technical points or a practical guides.
Talks presented by partners (sponsors) weren’t simply trying to sell their solution, but were tackling problems or showing general solutions that can benefit you or your company even if you don’t use the partner specific solution. It was great to see the power of Kafka, GraphQL and Erlang/Elixir.
I was happy to be able to catch up on some topics like AI and quantum computing, the talks in general were well presented, not too long or too short and relevant. I felt that some topics should have had less talks considering that talks on similar subject were already present as part of the mandatory talks (AI and machine learning for example). I believed that the topics could had been better distributed (maximum number of talks per topic). On another side I understand that some redundancy is built-in for the different days and for people that might not be able to attend certain talks due do conflicts with parallel sessions. I understand that it’s not an easy to solve problem, and even with these remarks the overall experience was incredibly positive.
On a personal note I really liked the talk from Saša Jurić about Erlang and Elixir, seeing what Erlang and Elixir can do really gave me the extra push needed to dive into it. The talk from Adam Tornhill ""Prioritizing Technical Debt as if Time and Money Matters"" gave me a new perspective and even actionable points (although not easy) to deal with the trade-off between improving existing code and adding new features. Finally I was surprised with the extreme digitization in China presented by Christina Boutrup, it gave great insights which I believe are not on the radar of standard western people.
I currently live in Switzerland and I have to say that the Danes seemed to me to be even more punctual and organized! No real issues with talks being late or running over time, the duration and number of breaks helping to keep your attention on each talk you attend. Registration and overall logistical organization was very good ( quality of the food and amount of options was great).
The area for partners was cool and well structured, good amount of swag and most partners were easy to interact and have a good conversation during the quick breaks between talks.
One point that I really didn’t like was the amount of talks that were not being recorded, I don’t have enough conference experience to know how much this is common practice but feeling forced to attend to certain talks that might, or not, be of interest just for fear of missing out isn’t a great feeling in my opinion.
I didn't know most of the speakers, but was satisfied with the quality of the talks. As celebrities go, it was cool to see Steve Wozniak in person!
Most of the talks contributed more or less in the same way and a lot of them helped me into catching up with the current state of the industry (at least in a high-level view).
I'm less scared about AI and I think the field still has to evolve a lot before an AI tries to destroy humanity, still I would bet that many people will have their jobs taken by AI based solutions, but it's difficult to say how fast this will happen even for specialists in the field.
China is really a place to pay attention to, we can learn from them, as they seem to be able to foster innovation despite being very restrictive on their market and ideas.
Machine learning is finding more efficient and precise methods to do things in ways that humans can't understand, so it’s something I think everyone should pay more attention to as the results so far are already impressive (and seem to be less dangerous than what we normally associate with AI apocalypse, although strongly related).
Elixir is really awesome and I need to start experimenting and learning asap.
There are different ways to handle the trade-off between adding new functionality and improving existing code, I have much to learn!
The new perspective from Adam Tornhill is something that I believe will have an immediate positive impact on my daily work as in any fast paced and competitive business it’s part of the day to day job to weight the benefits of improving existing code versus the many new features that business requires in the short and long term. This talk gave me a different perspective on how to look at the problem and directions on what needs to be considered on a more technical and practical stand for me to be able to keep the best balance between business value added and the long term evolution of our platforms, while also keeping our 24/5 high frequency trading system competitive.
As a possible mid/long term contribution I think I would like to partner with our big data and BI teams and see what I can do using machine learning to improve the overall business. I now, more than before, believe that machine learning can really help businesses to take big leaps forward in ways that we humans simply can’t predict.
I wish I have the time and opportunity to put some Elixir in action at Swissquote as I believe that the very nature of the business can benefit immensely from the platform features (Erlang/Elixir) that support high availability, fast recovery and the benefits of the actor based model (processes in Elixir). Perfect for my needs in the Forex business line!
Thank you for you attention.

GUEST ENTRY: Pleo’s Jeppe Rindom gives his opinion on Copenhagen’s current ability to attract the best of the best.
Hi! My name is Jeppe Rindom and I am CEO and co-founder of Pleo, a fintech startup that automates expense reporting.
In 2015, my former colleague from Tradeshift, Niccolo, and I founded Pleo in Copenhagen. We had and still have big and global ambitions but with the limited access to digital talent in Denmark, we wondered, right from the beginning, if we would ever be able to scale a global company without moving our base.
It is evident that digital graduates are produced at a much slower pace than what our fellow startups (and desperate ‘we-fear-disruption’ corporates) are screaming for. But hey, our country has pretty architecture, bikes, great food, and the happiest people in the world. So, as bold entrepreneurs we figured; ‘let’s not bring Pleo to the talent — Let’s bring the talent to Pleo!’
Fast forward 30 months, our organisation now counts +40 employees and more than half are non-Danes. What a great success one might conclude, but actually I would argue the opposite, because only in one single case did we, as a company, succeed in convincing an international candidate to relocate to Denmark. And in this specific case, the relocation was caused by a strong friendship to an existing employee.
We consider Pleo a fairly attractive workplace. We’ve been recognized with international prizes and have attracted substantial investments from venture capital firms. I believed so much in our ability to attract international talent that I naively wrote a blog post with the title ‘Let’s conquer the World, not each other!’, which was a shout to the Danish digital ecosystem to hire internationally instead of stealing talent locally. Yet, we’ve never been able do so. But Why?
The Danish ‘package’ is not competitive
As much as I am proud of the Danish welfare system as well as the Capital of Copenhagen, I have come to the conclusion that the Danish ‘package’ sounds much more compelling than it is.
A classic Danish startup package looks somewhat like this:
1) a non-competitive salary, which is really no news if you want to work in startups.
2) high taxation due to our welfare system. Here you might say ‘you get what you pay for’, but that’s actually not true. Most candidates we’ve tried to relocate have a 3 to 7 year perspective for staying in Denmark. They are at a stage in their lives, where access to free education, free healthcare etc. is of very little value.
3) a high cost of living. Being a foreigner without a place to stay in Copenhagen is really tough. Even if you’re willing to settle for just a room in a shared apartment, you will likely end up paying +€1K a month.
On point 1 and 3, Copenhagen is not much different from cities like London, Paris and Stockholm but on taxation, our offering is much worse. And that’s not only a shame, it’s a deal breaker.
So, how have we made it to first base?
I’ve always had mixed feelings when it comes to our ‘open’ (read: free for EU citizens) education system. Today, I praise myself lucky. It saved my a.. Big Time. When we were 1.5 year into the journey, we, as everybody else, couldn’t recruit Danish digital talent, and when our team turned 15 employees, I was still the only Dane. Looking around me, I realised that everyone else were here because of our good and open education system. Luckily for us, many had decided to stay after graduation and in hindsight, I should have done more to build relationships to schools and universities and would encourage any startup to do so.
Second, we right from the beginning had an international company culture. My co-founder is Italian so the Danish way was really never an option. It was of course an obvious thing for us, as our ambitions goes far beyond Danish borders, but our strong international company culture has also become a strong selling point when we hire. Today, Pleo has 14 different nationalities and we still have strong focus on maintaining a welcoming, family-like company culture.
Third, we have had a lot of media attention both inside and outside of Denmark. Today, it mostly relates to our business traction, but in the beginning we did serious efforts to create some buzz, both in terms of being present at conferences, startup events and constantly trying to get media coverage. That helped us tremendously — also in our recruiting.
Fourth, our foreign employees have been great at enabling their networks. Because of that, we today have a handful of engineers working remotely. And it has worked surprisingly well, not something I expected initially and that I believe is strong correlated to the fact that all remote workers were familiar with other Pleo folks (and vice versa) right from the beginning. So get your employees to enable their networks! Chances are that they already know a handful of relevant candidates.
We praise ourselves lucky to have made it to first base. But I fear that more challenges will come when targeting second base and growing our product organisation from 15 to 50 in the foreseeable future.
The bigger picture
We have to join forces on promoting Copenhagen as a European techhub. Organisations like CPHFTW and Copenhagen Capacity are doing a great job building, empowering, and promoting our tech community. But there’s a need for more ambassadors spreading great stories of the Danish tech ecosystem. We just hired a candidate who chose to move to Denmark before having a job. She decided to seek opportunities in Copenhagen (and relocate from Madrid) due to her positive perception of the Copenhagen startup scene. What a win!
We also need shared living at a reasonable price for foreign workers, who relocate to Denmark. Shared living initiatives such as LifeX have also proved to be social catalysts in the tech community. A place to meet like minded people outside of work. Being a foreigner and having social success in Denmark can be hard. Let’s admit it, Danes are pretty reserved when it comes to being inclusive of foreigners. Foreigners with a social headstart are more likely to stick around.
Lastly, I want to come back to our taxation. Our tax society has previously been creative, when facing the lack of talent. In the 90’s, we invented ‘expert taxation’ (in Danish: Forskerordningen), a favourable tax system for researchers and well paid employees recruited abroad. At that point in time, most of the Danish growth arrived from research-heavy organisations.
Today, our world is upside down. Big corporates face challenges maintaining growth and leadership positions and younger growth companies are contributing increasingly to the economic growth.
I strongly encourage Denmark to expand the ‘expert taxation’ agreement, so that tax incentives are created for medium-income but much-needed digital talent moving to Denmark.
Because there is no way we can scale our businesses without help from abroad. So let’s spread those great stories, let’s do our utmost to welcome foreign talent and let’s continue to push our politicians for more attractive framework conditions.
Jeppe

""Why Copenhagen?"" has been the common question when we told people we got married there. I am a Cambodian; my husband is English; and we live in Berlin. Wouldn't it make more sense to get married in Berlin, England, or Cambodia?
Yes, we did have a big fat wedding celebration in Cambodia. But more to that later. What I'm talking about is the legal/civil wedding where you sign a paper that legally binds you as husband and wife.
So… Yes, we live in Berlin. No, we don't speak very good German. This makes it hard because (1) we will then need an official translator at the wedding, (2) it would be tough throughout the whole application because of the limited German, (3) the paperwork is just too much. This article here could tell you more about everything you need to do to get married in Germany. One of the most ridiculous document you need to provide — in my opinion — is the Ehefähigkeitszeugnis aka Certificate of no impediment to marriage from your country of origin (and if I'm not mistaken, from all the countries you have lived at prior to Germany). Did I also mention certified copy of birth certificate? It's not easy business to get that for some countries.
And ""why not the UK then""? Which is actually a good question. UK is a bit simpler (probably because it's all in English so we could understand stuffs), but then we found out there is this requirement that ""In order to actually start the marriage process, you and your partner have to have been living in the UK for at least 7 days prior to notifying a designated registrar office of your plans to marry"". Read more from this article.
So yeah. Getting married in Germany seems hard. Getting married in the UK was also tricky. Thanks to the sponsored Google ads, we found out that a lot of expats in Europe goes to Denmark to get married. It looked like Copenhagen was the Vegas of Europe! No joke! Looking deeper, it was not like Vegas. There's no drive-through or laundry weddings. I know, disappointing right? But still, everyone claimed it was the best decision one could do if one of us are not German and not willing to go through the bureaucracy. So yeah, we decided to do Copenhagen.
There is literally this website that we found: https://gettingmarriedindenmark.com/ that provided a very clear step by step explanation of what to do. (FYI this is not a sponsored post or anything, I'm simply sharing information) They also provide the consultation service that helps you through with a fee. Honestly, the process is simple enough that you probably would not need the service, but we got it just for the peace of mind (and admit it — less stress for the bride).
So here is what we did.
Voila! Now you just need to turn up for the wedding!
We got married at Copenhagen city hall. Everything was straightforward and relaxing, and the whole ceremony was done in less than 10 minutes. We did not even have to bring any witnesses — they have those if we need. The people who performed the ceremony was nice and friendly, and we felt really comfortable. You can do vows too if you like. We didn't though. None of us really like to say emotional stuffs, so we skipped it. We simply said ""I do""and exchanged rings, and kissed. And oh, we signed the papers too.
It was just the two of us. So simple. So easy. Not a care in the world about guests, how we looked, or anything going wrong. We focused on getting married and did exactly JUST that.
As you could see, we dressed up a little though and had a photographer to capture the moment. You can skip all these and just rock up. I told the consultant agency what I was looking for, and they gave me some recommendations. However, there's plenty of photography, makeup, and flower services at different price points that you could go for if you google or check on instagram. They are pretty nice and friendly too, so just send them a text with your needs. Some people also opted for the fancier packages where you get married it at your own venue or a little off the bustling city center area.
None at all. We spent a bit of money but it was smooth and I recommend any expats living in Germany or Europe that struggles with the bureaucracy where they live to consider Copenhagen as their wedding destination. You can make it a little holiday and even invite people you care about to attend the ceremony.
Lots of love, from the newly Mrs ❤ Let me know if you have any questions or would like to know which photography and makeup service we used.

Alex Martin shares his love of history with people in Copenhagen, Denmark, through his job as a tour guide. This last Tuesday, April 5th, Martin led a food focused tour with a group of students from Semester at Sea.
Semester at Sea is a floating university where students from all over the world spend the semester taking classes on a ship, the MV World Odyssey. During the semester students get to travel to 10–13 different countries. While in country, they can travel independently or with field programs organized by Semester at Sea and tour companies from each country. Martin’s tour was with a group of journalism students.
Martin has been living in Copenhagen for 20 years. He started working as a tour guide because of his love for the city and his love for history. Because of his wide range of knowledge, he is able to lead tours related to a variety of topics. This tour focused on the food scene in Copenhagen, but just the day before Martin led another tour with Semester at Sea that focused on social movements with a group of political science students. Martin introduced the group of journalism students to the rich history of food in Denmark by telling them the story of rye bread, and its importance in the country. According to him, rye bread is a staple in most Nordic cultures because of its rich nutrients. The bread uses flour made from rye grain instead of wheat grain and includes a variety of seeds. Historically, people used to even put wood shavings in it to bulk up its nutritious value. Danish farmers used to use this bread as an edible plate and bring their leftovers to the fields for lunch, creating an open-faced sandwich called the smorgasbord. This practical and inexpensive dish was later adopted by bars who would serve it to clients in effort to get them to buy more drinks. The public really enjoyed these sandwiches and began to request specific flavors. The bars responded to this interest by making the smorgasbord a permanent item on the menu, and restaurants soon followed. Smorgasbord is now considered the national dish of Denmark and, although it has practical roots, it is presented as a delicate, elegant dish at many dining establishments.
After teaching the students about the history of rye bread and smorgasbord, Martin brought them to CPH Cooking Class to try and make the dish themselves. The group prepared three different variations of the dish. The first variation was vegetarian and consisted of buttered rye, boiled potatoes, mustard mayo, fried onions, and dill. The second was rye topped with chicken salad made of shredded chicken, mayo, green apple, green onion, and herbs. The last variation was fried fish and vegetables served on top of rye with lemon. Martin said the fish was a red spotted fish popular in Denmark because of its supply in the North Atlantic. The group was able to eat their creations with popular fruit juices while having time to ask Martin and the CPH Cooking Class staff questions before heading off to their next activity.
A short bus ride took Martin and his students to Reffen, a famous Copenhagen food market where the stands are made of recycled shipping containers. Martin explained that Denmark is one of the most sustainability focused countries in the world with a huge emphasis on recycling. Making food stands out of old shipping containers near the capitol’s shipping port is just one of the innovative Danish techniques that Martin taught about. He also pointed out a complex of student housing made from the recycled containers, a garbage incinerator that creates power for the city and has an artificial ski hill on top of it, a group of windmills near the coast, the importance of bikes in the city, and the use of recycled materials in Copenhagen’s hippie commune, Christiania. He gave the students free time to explore the food market, interview business owners, and taste more unique dishes. According to Martin, Reffen is a great place for aspiring chefs and business owners to enter Copenhagen’s already dense food industry.
For their last stop, Martin took the students to one of his personal favorite spots, Halls on the Plaza in the city center. This food market offers many take home options and is conveniently located downtown, making it a popular spot for Copenhagen residents on their way home from work. The plaza consists of two buildings constructed on top of an underground recycling complex. While it is expensive to rent a space at, the heavily trafficked area generates steady business making it another great place for people trying to enter the city’s food industry. Martin’s personal favorite things to buy at the plaza are fish cakes and chocolates.
Bellies full of Danish food and heads full of information, Martin took the group of students back to their ship. When asked if he likes his job he replied, “I get to learn new things every day, what’s not to like?”
Thank you to Kris Kodrich and Semester at Sea for facilitating this field class.

I would like to share my overall impressions about the flight to the Faroe Islands and why I chose this airline.
The company made its first flight on March 1988. Since then, much has changed, and the company has become larger. Now Atlantic Airways has 184 employees. The fleet consists of 3 planes and 2 helicopters, the aircrafts are relatively new, including the brand new Airbus A320NEO and Leonardo AW139 helicopters. The airplanes and helicopters are named after the outstanding artists of the Faroe Islands.
The decision to fly to the Faroe Islands came very spontaneously, and there was little to no time for deliberation and plans. However, at the same time, I was pleasantly surprised by the cost of tickets, even when buying a mere 10 days before the departure.
As an experienced tourist, I decided to register on the site and get a frequent flyer card, but something went wrong, and I was confronted with an error on the website. Looking ahead, I would say that this is the only minus that I can note. In any case, I was not upset, as the primary goal was to buy flight tickets, and this can be done without any registration.
Go to the airline’s website, and right on the main page, you can immediately see all direct destinations:
North
South
There is also an option — to see the calendar of low prices.
The process of buying tickets is quite simple, all prices on the website are in Danish kroner. Choosing a date, you can see prices for a few days back and forth, which will allow you to find the best option.
You can also buy tickets using mobile apps on iOS and Android devices.
You can use the app or web to Check-in online, and you don’t need to print out boarding passes, you can use them directly from the mobile app.
Before buying tickets, I recommend checking the information if you need a visa since the Faroe Islands have their own permission.
Information on countries whose residents need a visa can be found here.
If you still need a visa, the list of embassies can be found here.
The Faroe Islands are not part of the Schengen Area, and therefore you can’t get here using a Danish visa. You must apply directly for an Island visa.
After all the preparations had been completed, finally the long-awaited day of the departure had arrived. The route consisted of a stop off in Copenhagen then onto Vagar.
Check-in and baggage drop-off at the airport closes half an hour before a flight. If you have luggage, you can choose 2 options:
In the first case, the airport staff will help you arrange everything. Although if you decide to use the second option, you need to scan the boarding pass and select passengers with luggage, after which the machine prints a sticker that must be attached to the suitcase. After that, just a few meters away is the baggage drop-off point. If your baggage weighs more than 20 kg, it’s classified as heavy so you will need to attach a special tag to it, which you will find right next to the scanner.
Wave goodbye to your luggage and head to the gate for boarding. If you are departing from Copenhagen Airport, I would highly recommend you to arrive early, as there are a lot of shops and various cafes inside.
The gate was in a small remote wing of the terminal. Most of all, I was worried about company loyalty to hand luggage. The hand luggage restrictions are 55x40x25 cm and 8kg weight plus a laptop bag.
As I noticed, there were no questions from the airport staff regarding the size and quantity of hand luggage and boarding was speedy.
I flew on the brand new AIRBUS A320NEO, and my impressions were only the most positive, not only from the plane but also from what was happening inside.
I was almost the last person to board the plane, and this did not hinder me from putting my suitcase on the luggage rack. The shelves were not full, even despite the fact I was flying to a cold country, and people would need a lot of outerwear.
I think it’s not worth saying however that the seats were in excellent condition as the plane is still new. You are able to change the position of the chair and headrest.
I was surprised by the mobile device holder, as well as USB charging for each seat.
Atlantic Airways provides an app for passengers. The main functionality is
How to get the app? Connect to WIFI AtlanticAirFi and open airfi.aero in a browser.
Atlantic Review Magazine is published 4 times a year and has been available to airline users since 1990. On the airline’s website, you can find all the old publications since 2010. The journal tells about the sights, entertainment, and events on the islands, as well as historical information.
Oh, what a delicious sandwich, you can create songs about it ;)
A selection of free drinks provided on board: sweet soda, juices, and coffee or tea.
I especially recommend you to try tomato juice. I would even say that it is not juice, but a ready-made cocktail with spices, incredibly tasty for spicy lovers.
Food can be ordered in several ways:
You can order sandwiches or rolls as well as desserts and drinks, but if you travel in the morning, breakfast may be your choice too.
A feature of the menu was the opportunity to try craft beer, specially brewed in collaboration with the brewery and the airline.
Föroya Bjór fly WIT me
Atlantic Airways asked Föroya Bjór to brew beer specifically for passengers, and as a result, we got a fly WIT me. This is Belgian Witbier (Bière Blanche), and experts say that the best place to drink beer you can have at an altitude of 10,000 meters. Föroya Bjór is the oldest brewery in the Faroe Islands and was founded in 1888.
Okkara Hop in the Air
Another beer is Indian Pale Ale brewed together with Okkara, which has been brewing beer since 2010 and is very famous for its collaborations with other breweries.
If you are planning a trip to the Faroe Islands, this airline may surprise you.
Read my blog, and you will find a lot of useful information for traveling around Europe.

Healthy. Organic. Paleo restaurant
Inspired by our latest trip to Berlin and how much wifey and I enjoyed the #SexyGood healthy delicious Simply Keto restaurant/cafe in Berlin, Germany, I realised how much I had enjoyed a similar experience last August when we had gone to Copenhagen Denmark.
The entire #SexyGood + links to the 3 visits to Simply Keto can be captured here https://medium.com/@abhijitpradhan/the-launch-of-the-true-life-metric-95a305856195
We had done a short 5 day trip to this amazing city for the following reasons
After paying homage to the Coffee Collective at their roastery outlet in Godthabsvej/Freidricksburg, we came to the famed Torvehallerne, the hip and happening food hall ( there are 2 big halls ).
And while hunting for lunch options, my eyes settled on Palæo which I had read about earlier. Luckily, as one could pick up food from any kiosk and sit together in one place, I didn’t have to worry about wifey, who was frankly not too interested in the place ! ( It took her a trip to Berlin last month to finally nudge her !). She looked at the different food options, but her attention quickly wandered off and she came back with a multi cheese platter as her lunch !
I went to the counter and the person taking orders was friendly and helpful. The place was more a snack/fast food/smoothie kind of place. Apparently there was a “restauranty” style Paleo outlet somewhere else in the city, but she told me the food was essentially the same.
I ordered a salad which was heavy on keto bread, avocado, nuts, berries, etc.
She suggested I go for the Sweet Potato chips. I did. And my main course was a “grass fed” Hot dog with the sausage wrapped in an egg omelette.
I was in seventh heaven as one did not get such treats back home-especially the grass fed hot dog !
The other thing that struck me after reaching Copenhagen was the sheer quality of their produce. Especially the vegetables. I told wifey that I could happily give up meat for ever, if I get a constant supply of such awesome vegetables. This theme continued throughout the trip and even in the Michelin starred restaurants that we ate in and loved, the vegetables were like from another planet !! #Swoon
Torvehallerne became a very convenient lunch spot for us. It was next to the hub station, Norreport, so it was connected to all places in the city ( Metro, train, bus) and dinners were strategically chosen and booked by wifey to feed her chef soul, so basically I got a license to have most of my lunches at Palæo ! Yay ! Think I did at least 3 :)
My favourite dish was discovered when I ordered their burger. The same friendly order taker told me the bread used for the burger was not as heavy as their regular bread as it used more seeds than nuts. Cool !
I loved it. The meat was obviously grass fed beef and from the first bite I was transported to my school days where my dream meal was in one of the fast food burger joints ( Hardees, Dairy Queen etc.) and my favourite dish used to the burger ( specifically the Mushroom & Swiss burger in Hardees).
I ensured that I had the burger again in my next and last visit here !
This experience gave me hope that Sexy and Good can co-exist and my recent trip to Berlin and Simply Keto has only reinforced that hope !! Also, it was heartening to know that Michelin star chef Thomas Rode Andersen was behind the design of the menu ! #SexyGood in action !https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/mar/02/fast-food-restaurant-caveman-diet-copenhagen
I had turned “Paleo” way back in 2012 and in fact tried to use that approach while running marathons but it didn’t work as after 30 k of running, the system would just revolt and scream for quick carbs. Energy gels, potatoes. I was eating more and more unhealthy stuff just to fuel my runs !
It was only in 2016 where I discovered “Keto” which actually gives me hope of plugging that energy crash issue that I always faced on the longer runs.
Paleo can be seen as High Protein ( which I realised was not actually good for me) + Low Carb + Low Fat whereas Keto is High Fat + Moderate Protein ( a crucial tweak) and Low Carb
When ( and if ) your body adapts to the High fat and low carb component of Keto, it slowly starts prefering to burn fat as a fuel ( which is far cleaner) rather than the extremely dirty and volatile carbs as source of fuel. I know now that if I had managed this during my marathoning days, it would have made a world of difference ! I don’t do long runs anymore as it took me a very long time to get over a knee injury and I realised that my body thrives on high intense short bursts of activity rather than the prolonged abuse that I was subjecting it to + after the recent Paris + Berlin trip, I re-connected with “walking” as it probably activates health in my system better than any other activity ! Wow.
The above is a short recap of how I arrived at #SexyGood in terms of diet, nutrition and exercise.

When this Airbnb host in London decided to be an Airbnb guest in design-conscious Copenhagen, he found much to be inspired by in the galleries and museums. If you’re also looking for design/art inspiration, here are three spots you should include when visiting Copenhagen. (Although just being in the city itself seems to activate latent design genes…)
The SMK houses 700 years’ worth of Danish and Nordic art and sculpture with a clear demarcation between the original architecture built in 1896 and the stunning, light-filled modernist section built 100 years later. If you like a chronological context, you can work your way from the front and understand the big themes through the centuries with clever diversions into more obscure and ‘problematic’ branches every so often.
A short train trip north of Copenhagen takes you to another repository of modern art in a stunning waterside setting, housed in an architectural marvel.
Louisiana (named after the original owners three wives, all named Louise) is a day trip in itself. The permanent collection boasts works by Picasso, Klein, Arp, Moore, Warhol, Hockney, Giacometti and oodles more. The current exhibitions included a immersive retrospective of Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama, Lucien Freud and ‘Africa’, a hugely thoughtful and surprising treatise on architecture, art and culture from the continent today.
If Copenhagen can’t have a stunning museum of design, what hope is there for anywhere else? The museum has the lofty twin ambitions to both serve ‘as a source of inspiration for people active in industry’ while making ‘contemporary consumers both critically aware and discerning’.
This translates of course into a whole lot of #chairporn…
So, despite ostensibly taking a break from London, Airbnb and design, I find myself filled with a better understanding of how Danish design works. Now to bring some of that all important hygge to Kith & Kine.
Kith & Kine is a stylish two-bed property close to all the hip/tech action in Shoreditch, London. Come and stay and see how far we’ve got recreating some Danish hygge…

“Travel has been the fire that has shaped my current self, accumulating layers of complexity in my thinking, thoughts, and actions as a result of my journey’s successes and failures.” Gabriela Trofin-Tatár
My Erasmus University exchange in Odense, Denmark, during the spring semester of 2006 was an unforgettable chapter in my life. Immersed in the vibrant atmosphere of Tehnisk Kollegium, I discovered the power of collaborative learning through teamwork, an experience that would profoundly shape my educational journey.
Moreover, during the semester, I traveled both in Denmark and abroad, expanding my horizons and becoming more curious about my studies.
In the following sections, I invite you to read about events and places that had a positive impact on my love for Denmark and my cultural awareness during that time.

I am not often in Copenhagen. It is a one-hour drive from where I live. And I can get my shopping and entertainment needs covered closer to home. But I do go there occasionally. And when I do, I see reminders of our racist past everywhere.
I will start with a disclaimer. I am a white dude, who is soon approaching 40. I am a history buff. And I have always tried to fight racism where I can. But I am aware I can not fully escape my racist history.
Many Europeans acknowledge the blatant racism in the U.S. But they falsely believe that it is a uniquely American problem. It is not. The slave ships that brought these slaves to the U.S. sailed from our harbors.
Racism is a European invention. We had to invent it in order to justify our atrocities against people of color. And guess what. We think our invention was so smart, that we Europeans call the historic period where we shipped slaves and exploited our colonies “The Age of Enlightenment”.
Yes, racism is systemic. And trying to censor this truth in our classrooms will not make it untrue.

Based on a meeting in Copenhagen, one call to Australia, a number of tweets, Linkedin and Yammer posts, the word was spread and the first #ResponsiveOrg meetup in Copenhagen became reality Thursday 27. November 2014 — read about the preparation here ,
Eager to meet the people who signed up for #ResponsiveCoffee in Copenhagen on Meetup.com I got to the cafe about 30 minutes early…
tables where placed in a corner, and the coffee was just about to brew — we where ready to meet.
All interested and curious we gathered and the talking started by one to one introductions as people showed up, then the non existing agenda developed in this way:
6 men joined — Kenneth has listed ResponsiveOrg Copenhagen relevant tweets here — and here are the names of the 6 men at the first meetup
admitted - it looks a bit as a bunch of..
“..handsome, thoroughly clever, perfectly plump men in our prime” as Karlsson on the roof says
The conversation touched diversity and all agreed it is needed for future meetups. Also discussing the need for a meetup in english, which is obviously is an option if non Danish-speaking wants to join — please let us know at meetup.com or as a comment here.
I am not really sure, but I know that I have found likeminded people whom I want to share my experiences with, and I am sure they will share interesting angles on topics that relates to #futureofwork, #ResponsiveOrg, #worklikeanetwork — add the # you like, or tell the story as Matt Partovi
http://player.vimeo.com/103393370
One thing it instantly brougth was Kenneths scoop.it on Leadership a ressource of inspiration for future topics, and so much more.
And the all participants was featured in this tweet
Wanting to get into a series of meetups, the next meetup is planned as #ResponsiveMorning for the 14. January at 9:30 - you can signup via meetup.com
Do you want to give a 10 minute speak about a topic you care about? If so suggest a topic for the meetup, and suggest a topic anyway.
A big thanks to all of you showing up, and for those of you who showed interested but couldn’t find the time, come by in the future.
To all of you who liked, retweetet and shared the posts to make the noise — most appreciated!

August 4, Sabbatical Day 23
Sunday did not go at all like I had planned. I walk out of my apartment at 10:40am, planning to bike to church (that starts at 11am), only for rain drops to start falling. So I pivot to taking the train … only that adds to my travel time and makes me 10 minutes late to church. And I’m sleepy in my movie-theater seat in the back of the auditorium, fighting heavy eyelids. And if we’re being honest, I don’t get much out of the guest pastor speaking.
But I’ve still got the entire day, right? Only it’s pouring when I walk out of church, so I linger a little longer in the lobby, game-planning my day on my phone.
Church attendees are slowly making their way out (this church takes place in a hotel conference center). And one makes it’s way over to me. Glasses, ash-blonde air a little ruffled, lanky and crooked smile. No rain jacket.
“Were you at Hillsong?” He asks in heavily accented English.
“Yes, I’m visiting Copenhagen and every time I’ve come to the city before, I have come to church here.”
He proceeds to tell me that he just moved to Copenhagen last week from Bratislava, Slovakia. He’s staying in a hostel now, but wants to live by the beach. He tells me about the bike he bought from a guy a month ago (the guy just left it on the street for him to buy!), and how it was locked up on the street for the last month waiting for his return. I tell him about my journey to Copenhagen, my sabbatical.
Eventually I see the rain lightening up, and say my goodbyes. I walk off to the metro, planning on taking it to Norrebro to get this focaccia sandwich I dreamed about getting last visit. And just as I make it down the escalator, I hear an alarm going off.
“Evacuate immediately,” it says.
So everyone makes there way back up the elevator, crowing under the metro awning outside, because — mind you — it’s still raining. Sirens start in the distance, and a fire truck rounds the corner.
I make the call to try for the bus instead, since clearly this train station won’t be opening back up anytime soon. I walk back past the church, past the Slovak, and to a bus station a block away. The bus is 10 minutes late, but finally arrives. By this point, it’s nearing 2pm, and the sun has broken through — you’d hardly know it was so nasty 30 minutes ago.
I get my focaccia sandwich from Rondo, inhale it, and start walking back to my apartment to pick up my bike. I think I take a wrong turn somewhere along the way, because it’s taking longer than I anticipated. I’m cutting through Fælledparken, and start realizing — if I want to go visit Grundtvigs church, I need to do it now, since they close at 4 and are closed Monday. So once again, I backtrack to the bus station. And what do you know, the heavens open up midway. I wait under a tree for a couple minutes, waiting for it to lighten up, then make my way to the bus stop. The bus is late, which I’m starting to realize is a Copenhagen trend. I start seeing a bunch of people walking in the same direction with jerseys, and realize there’s a match on today. Do I want to go? I calculate the time it takes to get to the church, take a quick spin, then go back to my apartment to change, then go to the game. It’s a lot, so I decide against. This is all being thought through while I’m on the bus.
Eventually I get to the church … only to walk up and find that it’s closed due to water damage. And honestly, I’m more bummed about the hour of travel time round trip than the actual church being closed.
So I make my way back to my apartment, changing out of my church clothes and swapping my bag for coffee shop books and journals. There’s one right around the corner from my apartment that a guy from Hagen Espresso in London recommended. It’s pretty full for 4pm when I get there, so I snag a seat inside since there’s not a seat open outside to enjoy this gorgeous weather.
But right after my drink is delivered, one does open up, so I gather up my bag and cortado and relocate. I’m sitting outside for around 20 minutes before I see a young guy — who I think is not Danish — walk into the shop. He’s by himself, wearing a Cyprus cap, along with a green market tote bag.
He sits at the table to left of me, back to the street, while I’m facing the street, Mere Christianity in hand. I keep eying him — do I make conversation with this fellow traveler? After all, sometimes I’ve found some of my best travel moments behind starting a conversation. But how to start — do I ask him about Cyprus?
At this point, I pull out my phone that’s plugged into my power bank. And that’s my opening (or rather, his).
“Do you have a USB-C cable?” He asks, once again in accented English. “I have a power bank, I just need the cord.”
And this, reader, is where I thank God once again that I bought a power bank with several types of cords.
“No, but this has one in it. Here, you take it,” I insist. “Are you visiting Copenhagen?”
“Yes, I just arrived today.”
“Oh, and where are you from?”
“I’m from Ukraine, but I’m living in Italy now.”
“Oh, where in Italy?” I ask, thinking about my January trip there.
Outside of Florence, he tells me. “I’ve hitch-hiked here from Florence.”
Cue my jaw dropping.
“I first went to Berlin, where I stayed with some friends. Then hitchhiked here. I wanted an adventure, and I had things that I wanted to figure out for life. But now I think I know what I need to do next, so I’m going to just fly home. Plus hitchhiking is exhausting.”
The conversation that follows is not one that I could have predicted.
I find out more about his life — He lived in Italy from 2019 to February 2022, making money so he could come back to Ukraine flush with cash — rich in their eyes. This is when he says he thought his dream, ideal life would start. But he didn’t have to explain it too much — Russia invaded a month later. Eventually he got out of Ukraine (which he didn’t explain, but I know means avoided being conscripted). Back to Italy, working in services industry — a textile manufacturer, I think.
He said his life was comfortable, but he didn’t want to blink and life fly by. I asked him what his realization was, and he answered, “I need to leave Italy.” He has various gripes with Italy and Italians — lack of openness and diversity, lack of parks, lack of opportunities to connect with others. He also doesn’t know what to do work wise — he’s tried a lot of different things.
I couldn’t help but think at this point — “Oh buddy. You’re searching for a happy life, but that’s never going to satisfy.”
I ask him what brings him joy, and he says talking with people — at some points he struggles to find the words in English. He likes providing advice, or crisis management, as he says.
He asks about me, too. I tell him about my sabbatical, about processing life, what I want to do next.
“How satisfied are you with your life? Put a number on it.”
I tell him that while I love my life, of course there are things I’d love to be different. I’d love to be married, I’d love for experience physical healing. 75%, I say.
“That’s pretty high.”
We talk some about singleness — I say there are things I could not do if I was married. Like working with the youth kids that bring me so much joy. I probably could not do a trip like this if I was married. That’s when I’m surprised to find out he’s married (no ring). Just left his wife back in Italy to hitchhike for a bit.
I explain that in the south in the U.S., people get married younger. My sisters both married young.
“Do you feel pressure to? From your family?” He asks.
“Not really.” It’s more the pressure of my own timeline. But my parents don’t quite understand the different world I am dating in, and find themselves befuddled that being asked out is so non-existent for so many of my friends.
We shut the coffee shop down, and move to a bench next door. At some point, he has me follow him on Instagram so we can keep up with one another. How much, we’ll see. Near the end of our conversation, he asks me, “So what’s your plan from here?”
I clarify — “Do you mean for today, this trip, or my life?”
“For your life.”
Oof. How to answer this?
“Here’s the thing, I can make plans for my life, but ultimately, I could die tomorrow –“ He recoils a bit at this — “I mean, I hope not, but I know where I would be if I did. And here’s the thing, as great as all this is,” I wave my hand at the street in front of me, “Heaven is better. So I can make plans, my life is not my own. My life belongs to God. He has plans for me. One of the things I love about God is I can do x or y, but he’s going to use it regardless for my good and his glory.”
He’s watching me as I talk and I don’t know if I’ve entirely lost him. I feel the need for honesty not pontifications.
“Listen, is it easy to say that? Absolutely not. I want to be tight fisted with my life. I have to remind myself regular to let go, because I know his plan for me is so much better.”
He doesn’t respond to any of this, and that’s okay. I don’t need him to. The conversation peters out some from there — but before we part, I ask to take his picture and he acquiesces.
We stand — he’s VERY TALL — and bends at both the knees and the waist to give me a very awkward hug. “Don’t die tomorrow,” he tells me.
I smile at that, and tell him I’ll try not to.
I walk off in the direction of the grocery, reeling a bit. Did the last hour and a half just happen? I’ve never had a conversation with a stranger like that before.
I rewind through my day — the delays and redirects and ending up at Prolog Coffee outside at 4pm. It would be easy to look at my encounter with Bogdan (that’s his name) in a silo. But I can see the fingerprints streaking across the window of my day, and I can see how the fact that I ended up there was not happenstance. Who knows if any of that will stick with him, but it was as much for me as it was for him.
There’s this rewiring starting to happen inside of me on this trip.
Life with God is an adventure. I’ve said that before, but I’ve thought about it more in the large-scale sense. Adventure of career, dating, etc.
But now, now I’m starting to realize that every day is an adventure. To look at the margins — or lack of — and invite him in. Surprise me, God.

I heard someone say once that they had “a curiosity that spans the universe.” And I thought, “That’s me.”

When I arrived in Copenhagen six years ago, after a particularly hard year in New York, I needed to regroup, re-think and reinvent myself. I was stressed out, exhausted and confused — everything you’d expect a New Yorker to be. My salvation came from the most unexpected source — a bicycle.
If in New York cycling was saved for hipsters, exercise fanatics and tourists at that time, in Copenhagen, it was (and is) the main mode of transportation. Bike roads run alongside car roads there, with dedicated traffic lights, and bicyclists are respected and given priority. In return, they obey strict rules and laws. The whole thing is very civilized. No yelling, no honking, no confusion.
After two weeks of taking overpriced buses like a tourist and gawking at masses of bicycles at intersections, I gave in and bought a used bike. Little did I know, my rusty two-wheeled companion was to become my best friend in Denmark’s cold capital and my best chance at finding happiness.

My old friend Kathrine invited us to stay with her a while at her new tiny house in Copenhagen. For our first night out, she looked at a number of options: There was a weird performance art piece by The Center for Militant Futurologi, drummers were needed for a climate change demonstration on two tallships sailing down whatever the big river in the middle of the city is called (I swear I can’t find this information anywhere), and a jam session was brewing in Freetown Christiania. Kathrine said her best bet was a metal show at a small bar called Lygtens Kro, with a headliner from Sweden (Gothenburg, naturally) who played in the style of the 1980s. “Power metal?” I asked, and her boyfriend said that sounded right to him. I became partly acquainted with the numerous highly-specific metal subgenres back in my nightclub days, and I do my best to keep up as the lexicon matures; but I’m never sure what names to use.
So we met at the Metro station, hit the bar, and got a round of Golden Ladies (a slightly-higher-priced form of Tuborg lager, analogous to ordering a Miller Genuine Draft instead of a Miller High Life). The opening band, I thought, was good but not great. They could use a new guitarist. Still, it was enjoyable enough, stoner rock with a vein of grunge in there that might have resulted more from a lack of rehearsal than an aesthetic choice. I figured this was what would be on the menu tonight. I couldn’t have been more wrong. After a short set break, during which I smoked a comically tiny joint outside, the headliners took the stage sans announcement and began to play. I happened to be near the door that was nearest the stage, headed straight in, and got myself an enviable position in the very front of the room to see and hear a band called Hypnos.
Holy shit, these boys could play. There was an Iron Maiden thing happening, sometimes escalating into Queensryche territory or putting its root down into Soundgarden. If you know those bands, then a certain kind of metal vocals are playing in your head now that speaks to a certain era of rock — “No one sings like you anymore,” as the late great Chris Cornell lamented — and you’re right on the money. This singer Linus Johansson was extra fun — a sensuous and playful front man with frizzy blond hair and a porno mustache, with a voice like Geoff Tate and moves like Robert Plant, graceful arms and serpentine torso, with penetrating eye contact at such close quarters. This bar didn’t even have a stage, so I was just standing right in front of these guys, able to really get into what the players were doing, and they were doing plenty. The lead guitarist, Pontus Isebring, was positively fucking rad, an inspired shredder in a paroxysm behind his veil of dark brown hair yet locked in tight with the rhythm section. To call them a rhythm section is to undersell them a bit, in fact: The younger-looking second guitarist Oskar Wersall often harmonized with solos and melodies note for note, leaving the chugging rhythmic floor to dead-serious bassist Anton Kallmin; and even that mustachioed and muttonchopped warrior was doing some pretty fancy shit when space opened up on the bottom end. Drummer Oskar Brindmark was a beast and a scientist, not a drop of sweat on his brow as he assembled and deconstructed patterns with breakneck speed. They were one sick five-piece metal outfit, my friends. This isn’t even my kind of music, particularly, but I know greatness when it’s blasting me in the face.
It wasn’t all about technical chops, either. Part of what made Hypnos so much fun to watch was that they were all having so much fun, enjoying one another’s company on stage in a way that lots of bands fail to do even in their honeymoon years. Anton and Oskar W. stepped in to share backup vocals on a single mic, eyes flashing and heads bobbing at one another. Linus couldn’t get enough of Pontus’ solos — every time the latter cut loose, the former sidled up real close and let his own fingers wiggle up and down his mic stand in a celebratory air guitar dance that brought to mind Bowie/Ronson in the Spiders From Mars years. I guess this singer isn’t even the original guy — he joined the band in 2017 — but having watched them play I can hardly imagine Hypnos without him. That this band remains so infatuated with the stage and with each other on their fifteenth year of performing says much about their special chemistry, and for an audience member it makes all the difference.
At the end of the set, Linus asked us to make sure and buy something at the merch table. “We don’t have any money!” he cheerfully informed us. Sadly, I hadn’t a dime to spare at that very broke point in my own independently-booked tour of Europe; so the best I could offer was my congratulations and this article. Hypnos seems to be on tour at all times, releasing music on The Sign Records that you can buy right now and generally doing the work of a rock and roll band in the prime of life. You should find an opportunity to see them play live, ideally in a small venue, and bring enough cash for the CD or the t-shirt or whatever. Folks like us are out here scraping by in 21st-century showbiz, even living metal gods from Sweden, and time shovels dirt over all of us soon enough. It’s up to the fans to keep the scene alive. As long as there are heads in the club, Hypnos is sure to keep them banging.

[Note from Massimo: This article by my friend Jim Baggott is a bit on the technical side. But if you care about our deep understanding of the world, or about the nature of science, or about the relationship between science and philosophy, enjoy.]
I read Massimo’s essay “Physicists don’t know what the world is like, at bottom” (29 May 2020, also here) with considerable interest. And no little frustration. In the epilogue of my new book Quantum Reality (published in the US in September) I close with a brief analysis of a survey of attitudes on the interpretation of quantum mechanics that was conducted among physicists in 2011. Massimo’s essay concerned a more recent (and more extensive) survey published in 2016, which I’d overlooked. Thankfully, in most respects both surveys produced similar results.
Massimo observed that, despite all the popular media attention given to fantastical interpretations which invoke the existence of multiple, parallel universes, the Copenhagen interpretation remains the most favored. (And I heaved a sigh of relief, as this was true also in 2011.)
But what I found even more fascinating is that the 2016 survey, conducted by Sujeevan Sivasundaram and Kristian Hvidtfelt Nielsen at Aarhus University in Denmark, included questions which allowed them to go beyond this simple statement of…

It’s Monday, the start of a new week. Nat and I are both working at our desks, which at this moment is a small wooden kitchen table in our Airbnb in Vesterbro. The sun is shining into the living room after a split second downpour — after less than two days here we’ve already come to understand this is totally normal. Not your typical tropical rainstorm, but a charismatic part of the city I’ve embraced rather quickly. Ask me again in a couple of weeks…
We arrived on Saturday evening. After meeting our Airbnb host, who was very friendly and helpful, we unpacked quickly into our home for the next 3 weeks and took advantage of the late-setting sun to wander around our neighborhood. Copenhagen hasn’t been short of hubbub since we landed: Saturday was the Pride Parade; Rapha Nocturne, a nighttime cycling race ironically hosted in London for the past 10 years, was set up a few blocks away; and IRONMAN had its triathlon all throughout the city yesterday. We made our way through the liveliness to explore what Vesterbro had to offer, with the not-too-distant goal of finding a place for dinner, too.
The main street was decorated with rainbow leaflets and cutouts from the Parade, but ultimately, pretty desert when compared with the West Village in New York in June. To be fair, Pride in Copenhagen is a full 5-day event including open-air concerts, Drag Night and After-Pride Chill Out… no need for post-Parade rowdiness, even if it is a Saturday night. We walked by a few cool-looking bars and restaurants... lots of starring on our Google Maps for future ventures… and got drawn to a place called Madklubben for dinner.
There was a huge line outside — a large group of ladies waiting to get seated — which, as my Dad always says, is always a good sign a place is worth trying (not the ladies, but the line…). We waited at the bar for a table and got served by two very suave, attractive Danish men, shaking their shakers in unison and making stoic yet flirtatious conversation with the single New Yorker sitting next to us. Nat got a beer.
Dinner was delicious, though the stools not too comfortable. Guess that’s what you get when you go to a “minimal spot for unfussy dining” (quote from Google).
Next stop: a drink! It was Saturday night after all. We tried a speakeasy called Duck & Cover but they had no space — not packed, just full. Another night, perhaps. Instead, we headed to CURFEW, which had the coolest signpost at the entrance. A horizontal cutout with a light shining through, projecting the bar’s name on the wall. And a spider, fairly large, dangled comfortably. We almost believed it was fake.
Is this day zero? I asked Nat, not wanting to give up our first day so soon.
Nat ordered one of CURFEW’s award-winning drinks — key ingredients: Tanqueray gin, tarragon and mango — and I went for a refreshing alcohol-free fizz. Big mistake. Nat likes to say I’m a cheap date because I don’t like to drink, but considering how delicious this Little Dragon was, my new theory is I take only the best.
The vibe was perfect. 1920s Prohibition style, matching music, bartenders in suspenders… Nat and I didn’t even talk, we just enjoyed the moment.
The next day, it’s really day one. Or day two… I haven’t decided yet. We rented bikes — the only way to travel in Copenhagen — and Nat mapped out a whole itinerary for us. Christiansborg Palace, Rundetaarn, Botanic Gardens… today, we’re tourists, not just digital nomads. We ate lunch at Torvehallerne and biked to Kastellet, a 17th-century fortress on a star-shaped island. It seemed like anywhere we biked, another beautiful palace, church or building was there, waiting for us. This city is just stunning.
www.instagram.com
The surprising thing is we’ve adjusted so quickly. 48 hours in, we feel like we know our neighborhood decently well; we’ve gone to and made friends at our first CrossFit class at Butcher’s Lab; we’ve cooked our first meal and slept the best couple of nights we’ve had in weeks. As this first work day comes to a close, I’ve finally settled on a name for my poetry project, Midnight Plume (you’ll notice the first sneak peek in this post). I’ll properly launch it this week. I hope you’ll follow along… it’s quite personal and something I’ve thought of doing for quite some time. I’m so excited to finally share it.
And while I’m not yet sure how this travel blog will take shape, this hereby concludes my first post. I’m sure I’ll include more places and spaces we’ve seen and loved, and I hope to dive more into the feelings and questions intrinsic to this adventure. Thanks for reading, and see you soon! ***

In the last two years running has occupied a great place in his life. All this time, I slowly, slowly walked the small steps to the next goal — to run a marathon.
Preparation began in the farthest February: I trained and participated in competitions that interested me. But he tried to plan his running calendar for 2019 so that the peak of training and running occurred in April and early May. And so it turned out: at this time I ran three half marathons (Poznan, Slavutych and Białystok), one run in Brovary 11 km and 30 km. in Kharkov. The latter was important before the marathon, as he had to show how my body would respond to heavy loads.
Although at first I wanted to stop at the Prague Marathon, but its start coincided with the Bialystok Half Marathon. The problem was that this year he decided to run the “Crowns of Polish Half Marathons” and the “Bialystok Half Marathon” was on the list of this series. After thinking about the month, he preferred the Bialystok Half Marathon over the Prague Marathon.
Two Scandinavian marathons in Stockholm and Copenhagen caught my attention. Having long wanted to visit Denmark, I stopped at the Copenhagen Marathon. He also started 40 times and had an interesting route.
You can register for the marathon on the marathon page: http://cphmarathon.com. There you had to fill in your details (name and name; country; contact details; if there was experience in marathons, approximate time for which you were going to run 42 km). You could also choose the size of a T-shirt. After paying the starting fee, the system automatically assigns a starting number. The marathon route was held in one circle by the central and surrounding streets of Copenhagen, passing by the main architectural monuments of the Danish capital.
Ancient packages can be banned on Friday, Saturday and Sunday before the marathon starts.
After paying for the starting number, getting acquainted with the route of the marathon, it is time to plan the trip itself, that is, buy airline tickets and book accommodation. I decided to fly to Copenhagen on Friday night to have a free Saturday and get to know the city a bit, visit the Sport Expo and pick up the starter pack in advance.
Arriving in Copenhagen on Friday evening, my route ran from the airport to my place of residence, and at the same time enjoyed a stroll in Copenhagen in the evening.
The main task of Saturday was to find the starting number, so I followed him in the morning. The extradition took place at the Sparta Hallen Sports Complex, which also hosted the Sport Expo, Kids Running. To get the desired starter pack, you need to have a passport and a certificate from the participant who came to the mail after registering for the marathon.
The first half of Saturday came with the launch pack and the Sport Expo. The latter is well organized: in addition to the usual sports goods and equipment, there was a lot of interesting information about various marathons in the world.
After the preparation for the marathon was over, it was time for a walk in the city, a little evening jog and rest before the marathon.
I decided to run the marathon only with water and isotonics without gels, so in the evening I bought them at a local supermarket.
Sunday morning was good weather. Especially in the morning when the sky above the city was overcast and everything was indicating possible rain. This could not but rejoice, because in the heat did not really want to run.
The starting town is spread out on the waterfront on the island of Bruges. Immediately it was possible to use the cameras, get the start numbers, change clothes. In the morning, the runners began to gather here, the closer they got to the start, the more and more they became. Someone dressed up, someone kneaded before the marathon, and someone admired the views of Copenhagen, which opened from the waterfront.
All marathon participants were divided into sectors according to their time of running the marathon. The marathon runner could choose his own time before the start, unlike the Polish races, where the participant must start in the group that he chose at registration. The starting numbers were all the same and not divided into sectors by color. And the runner himself before the start chose in which sector and for what time he wants to run.
The marathon started at 9:30. The participants gradually started to run one solid mass, which again was not very convenient at the beginning of the marathon. For myself, I chose place-holders for 4 hours 10 minutes and tried to hold on to them.
The first half of the marathon was easy enough, it ran comfortably. First, the route is almost flat, with only a few climbs. Secondly, it was overcast, starting to get clear by 12 noon.
He used the hydration points constantly as soon as he met them on his way. The first part of the marathon I tried to hold on to the placemakers. In 2 hours 2 minutes I overcame the first half of the track. The movement to the finish went well. The second part of the marathon started under a very beautiful arch, informing the runners that half the distance had been passed.
The next psychological boundary after the 21 km mark was 19 miles for me. Why this mark? Mainly due to the fact that I had already overcome the 30 km distance during the Easter run in Kharkiv and knew the approximate time of its passage and that I would not encounter any problems in overcoming this distance.
One of the main tests besides the 42 km mark itself, the physical and psychological strain was a 15-mile climb to the trestle. Psychology has played even more here. The experience gained during the same “Kharkiv Half Marathon” became relevant when you just ran down one hill and you were already waiting for a descent and a new one. Another such rise was not very much wanted to overcome on its way.
I overcame the second psychological mark of 19 miles in 3 hours and 10 minutes, which again is good — in Copenhagen I spent 1 minute longer than in Kharkiv. Running towards the finish line was in the planned rhythm. The distance was 4:10–4:20 because one hour would be enough to cover 7 miles of the route. Although these are all theoretical calculations that do not always coincide with what is happening in practice. The closer I was to the finish line, the more I met on the sidelines of the runners, whose parameters were brought back to normal, and the slower I started to run.
The last 7 miles could already be described as running from one hydration station to another, where you could drink a little water, isotonics, and some to eat a banana or orange. It was a little distracting from fatigue. For those 7 miles, I stuffed everything I had just encountered along the way: from the Danes’ pizza to redbull. At about 39–40 km I began to save power, although it was difficult to find them here, which would make the last dash that would have taken me over the finish line.
A preliminary detail about the runners was in store for a surprise: a minor row on the bridge. When he appeared on the horizon, in the main sense the thought was: “it does not fit, although it is small, but I do not want to draw”. the last test, after using the descent and the finish line.
There were fans on the side of the road, adding strength to the run. From this atmosphere and the thought that even a little more and you will see the cherished word “Finish”, the forces do not understand where they came from.
After 4 hours 48 minutes of running and overcoming 42 km of my feet, I was still brought to the coveted arch with the inscription “Finish”. There I was waiting for the restoration of strength with delicious fruits, hot chocolate, cola, pastries. And most importantly — it was possible to take a breath and already nowhere to escape.
My first marathon fully met all expectations. He presented wonderful emotions, both from the run itself and from the atmosphere that dominated it. It was extremely nice to run near the Embassy of Ukraine in Denmark, where there were Ukrainians. The hometown flag is especially inspiring in the second round, when you are already exhausted and looking for some positive things to move on. A very well thought out route along the main architectural monuments of Copenhagen, the whole route is accompanied by fierce support of residents and visitors of the city. After the finish, there are a lot of different flavors for everyone to recover, as well as massages and showers. The task for this marathon was first and foremost to run it without injury so that it would not be the last.
In the beginning, I wanted to run better and finish in the range of 4:10–4:20, but in the process it goes to the background and the bar is already reduced to 5 hours — the main thing that would be no injury.
The Copenhagen Marathon has taken management to a new level of development as a runner, so in the last northern year marathons will take their place in my two main calendars.

an artist, a brewery, a restaurant
I’ve spared you the gory details on most of my other museum visits, but I have to write a little about Olafur Eliasson’s installation Riverbed at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art (located about 30 minutes outside of Copenhagen by train) because Eliasson is one of my favorite artists. Earlier on my trip I saw his Turner color studies at the Tate Britain — painted perfect gradients of colors sourced from famous J.M.W Turner paintings onto donut-shaped canvasses. But before Riverbed, I’d never seen an installation by Eliasson. He makes a lot of different types of art, but his installations are what he’s best known for.
Riverbed is, on its face, very simple. You walk down a hallway with boardwalk flooring into a typical museum art gallery. White walls, well lit, etc. The floor in the gallery, however, has been transformed into a virtual riverbed, covered with smooth stones of various size. An actual trickle of water running through the whole thing, cascading down the steeper bits of rocks where there are stairs. And it’s not just a layer of gravel that’s been thrown down; the floor has significant topography, and seems to ignore the walls and doorways of the gallery space.
There’s no designated path through the landscape, you just kind of wander until reaching a reading room at the end, at which point you must turn around and exit the way you came in. It’s natural but very sparse, much like the photographs of Iceland Eliasson published in a new book also debuted at the exhibit. Perhaps more than anything, this exhibit made me really want to go to Iceland sometime.
It’s art that’s participatory and immersive; as a visitor you are part of it, and it’s all around you. It’s not confined behind proximity sensors or crowds of people; you literally get to walk all over it.
I also think the practice of creating simulated nature inside an art museum space is interesting. You can look at it as a sly middle finger to stuffy gallery spaces, or a statement that natural beauty deserves to be examined with the scrutiny that manmade art is. Or maybe it’s just meant to be a meditative spot. In an interview about the piece, Eliasson said “It’s about exposing yourself to time, to things taking time. The walking is time unfolded.”
Personally, I did find it to be meditative. It’s funny how just putting something inside a museum makes you pay more attention to it than you might otherwise. Writing about it now, after my trip is over, I still remember the feeling and sound of walking over the layer of rocks, and watching others do the same. Eliasson’s first exhibition at MoMA was titled Take Your Time, and you get the feeling that’s what he wants you to do here too.
Still, I get that it’s not for everybody. I heard somebody upon reaching the end say “That’s it?” Some of his installations deal more with doing impressive things with light, mirrors, color, and haze. I would love to see some of those too, but I thought Riverbed was pretty cool.
Also in the museum was a theater showing some of Eliasson’s films and, and one of my favorite parts, a “model room”. The model room is essentially a table covered with hacked-together bits of wire, 3D-printed plastic, foam core, and other materials. It’s rare to see an exhibit focus so much on process and intermediate products, and I love seeing that stuff. It reminds you that works don’t just get conjured out of nothing, and gives you a peek into what the tables at Eliasson’s large Berlin studio must look like.
I highly recommend exploring some of the stuff he’s done using “Your uncertain archive” on his website. Even if you’re not interested in Eliasson, it’s a really cool piece of web design.
OK. So I’m done gushing about an artist. Time to gush about something else. I have also spared you the gory details of food and beer I’ve had on my trip thus far, but this place also requires an exception to be made.
The first time I ever heard about Mikkeller, I was with friends at the excellent Northdown Tavern in Chicago. After a couple drinks, our probably drunk bartender leaned in and started speaking in a hushed tone. “Listen. You guys wanna try some really good shit?”
Of course we did. He brought out a fantastic beer by Evil Twin Brewing (Imperial Biscotti Break Natale — Pretty Please With A Cherry On Top, for all the beer nerds out there) and mentioned that the brewery was called Evil Twin because the guy was the twin brother of the guy who started Mikkeller. “Between the two of them,” he said, “they’re making some of the best beer in the world.” In my experience thus far, he’s right.
A couple days into my Copenhagen visit I remembered that Mikkeller was based in Copenhagen. While I couldn’t find any sort of brewery tour type of thing, they do have a few bars sprinkled around the city, and a new restaurant that specializes in smørrebrød– Danish open-faced sandwiches. I was sold.
The place is called Øl & Brød (pronounced oel og broed… yeah, good luck with that), aka “beer & bread”. The interior is very hip– extremely well decorated, with an almost comically meticulous table setting and Scandinavian rock played over the speaker at the host’s podium. In addition to having several taps of delicious beer from Mikkeller and others, they also have the most extensive Akvavit (a spiced Scandinavian liquor) list of any bar in Northern Europe. Didn’t get around to sampling any of that though.
I wanted to get a real Danish delicacy, so I went for the pickled herring sandwich which was topped with fennel, cabbage, apples, and onions in various states (pickled, grilled, raw) and aioli, piled on top of a slice of very dense, dark rye bread. I took the menu’s recommendation (it has beer pairings for everything they sell) and got a glass of Boon unblended lambic beer to go with it. You’ll hear more about lambics when I write about Belgium, but the way they’re brewed makes them tart or even sour, which was perfect for complimenting the pickled bits of the sandwich and cutting through the creamy/oily bits.
After the meal I walked next door to the Mikkeller bar, tried a few tasters of beer, and talked with a pilot from Phoenix, AZ who was stopping by on his day off. Beer nerddom, like any nerddom, is great for making quick connections while abroad.
Needless to say, if you’re ever in Copenhagen you need to give this place a look for lunch. It’s a little pricier than just going to a kebab place or something, but it’s still reasonable (for Denmark) and entirely worth it. One of the best meals of my trip. And if you’re not going to Copenhagen any time soon, keep an eye out for Evil Twin or Mikkeller beer at your local bar or liquor store. Be sure to read the labels; both breweries have excellent senses of humor.
Just as a reminder, I’m choosing to write about favorite spots and stories in each city I visited as opposed to major attractions which you can read about in any guidebook. Yes, I visited Christiania and the Nationalmuseet and the Little Mermaid statue and all that. If you want to hear more detail about my trip, just talk to me ☺

Two cities I have not visited--Copenhagen and Tokyo--and you've given me a beautiful glimpse of both. And, you've made me hungry. That onigiri looks and sounds wonderful. I think that fusion with smoked salmon would be delicious. Thank you for a wonderful article.

In November 1981, having lived in West Berlin for four months, I was given the unexpected privilege of having four days off from my job at the Hotel Schweizerhof. I was ready for an adventure and gave careful consideration regarding where I should spend the days.
Paris was too far away, a fourteen-hour train trip. It took very long to get anywhere in Western Europe from the walled-in city that was closer in distance to Poland than it was to West Germany. A co-worker told me it was possible to go to Copenhagen directly from East Berlin. Not only was it a much shorter trip than going through West Germany, but it was also significantly cheaper.
I didn’t need much time to think it over. I was going to spend my little vacation in Copenhagen.
I went through the always intimidating checkpoint at the Friedrichstrasse station in East Berlin and procured a transit visa. This was a rather routine affair and didn’t require the complicated application process for obtaining a tourist visa. I had not even considered spending my holiday in East Germany, the nearest country. Ironically, that’s what I would end up doing.
I was excited as the train pulled out of the East Berlin station and headed north toward the Baltic Sea. By the time we reached Warnemuende, the seaside town from where the ferry would cross to Denmark, darkness had already descended.
There were not many passengers heading for the ferry terminal, perhaps fifty or sixty, and all appeared to be Westerners. Of course, that is not surprising considering the fact that East Germans were generally prohibited from traveling to Western countries.
The train soon pulled out of the station and headed back to East Berlin. Meanwhile, I gathered with my fellow ferry passengers in the terminal. I immediately had the sense that something wasn’t quite right. I looked out on the dock and didn’t see a ferry.
My ears picked up someone speaking English and I gravitated to that voice. It belonged to a young South African, who I later learned was heading to Copenhagen to spend a semester at the university there. He was speaking with a Danish couple.
They told me the ferry was delayed because it couldn’t make the crossing safely in the stormy sea. I never even thought about weather conditions. In my mind, I pictured a serene sea and a calm, relaxing three-hour crossing. The news that the sea was not at all as I imagined made me worried. I am not a sea-faring person. I always prefer to have my traveling feet on solid ground, or at least on reliable tracks. I have given in to air travel as an unavoidable necessity.
The Danish couple made inquiries and then informed us that it was unlikely the ferry would be arriving that night.
My initial reaction was relief. I wouldn’t have to face a multi-hour ferry crossing on a stormy sea. Always the optimist, I assumed the storm would subside during the night and the next day the sea would be calm, and we would be able to make the crossing under a blue sky, basking in the autumn sunlight. Okay, I was waxing poetic in my mind and not being particularly realistic. I was shaping the adventure I wanted to have.
There wasn’t much we could do. I was realistic enough not to expect the East German terminal police to provide us with mattresses and blankets. People grabbed the few chairs that were around, but most of us had to make do with the hard floor.
Needless to say, it was not a restful sleep. In fact, I doubt that I dozed off for more than a few minutes.
We were stirred awake by a not very cheerful “Guten Morgen” (Good Morning) and informed that we had the opportunity of purchasing East German marks (currency) so that we could have breakfast if we wished. Of course that would be at the one-to-one ratio that East Germany maintained was the true value of their money, when in reality it was about six East marks for one West mark. But who would be foolish enough to argue with them? I was hungry and didn’t really mind.
I stayed close to Dennis the South African, and the Danish couple in order to get the latest information about when the ferry would be arriving. I looked outside and was disappointed that my fantasy image didn’t appear to be manifesting. The sea was gray and stormy.
The couple was not about to spend the whole day waiting for a ferry that may or may not come. They had an alternative plan. They informed Dennis and me that there was another ferry, a very reliable one, that sailed from Sassnitz, a town in the far eastern part of East Germany. This ferry, however, didn’t go to Denmark but rather to Sweden. It would then be fairly easy to cross over to Denmark.
The couple walked up to the terminal police and indicated their plan to travel to Sassnitz. Watching from a distance, I could see that the police did not like the idea, probably because we didn’t have tourist visas for traveling around East Germany. We all just had transit visas for the route we were on.
But the couple was not going to be dissuaded and somehow got permission to leave for Sassnitz. Dennis decided to join them. I elected to as well. I didn’t want to spend most of my four-day trip in a ferry terminal. I thought it would be an unexpected adventure to travel across the northern region of East Germany and end up a stone’s throw from Poland.
A few hours later, the four of us boarded a train for the journey east. I soon realized that train travel in East Germany is laboriously slow. The tracks were obviously not in great shape. But I really wasn’t in a hurry. I had nearly forgotten about my original destination and now embraced the unexpected change my journey had taken.
We were on a local train route and made innumerable stops at small, dilapidated stations. In between the stations was a very pleasant countryside, fields and farms with an occasional small lake.
I was aware that we were attracting attention from the other passengers. Many of them, living so far from the capital city, East Berlin, probably never heard English spoken and it was unlikely that they ever encountered Westerners.
I wondered if the East German passengers were looking at us with envy that we had so much more material wealth than they did. Or perhaps they were expressing disapproval of us as decadent capitalists. German facial expressions are difficult to interpret.
It was already late afternoon when we saw in the distance a beautiful old town with a soaring steeple. The November light cast a soft golden haze over it. For some reason, the train was not stopping there. My companions told me it was Stralsund, one of the historic Hanseatic towns on the Baltic Sea. They heard that it had a well-preserved medieval center. I made a mental note of it for a future journey.
At last, we arrived at our destination. Although we were close to Poland there was no border crossing nearby. Sassnitz was more like a village than a town. But it was from this out-of-the-way location, at the eastern extremity of East Germany that the reported reliable ferry would be departing for Sweden. We easily found the tiny terminal and there was in fact a ferry there.
My fellow travelers were excited and walked immediately to the ticket booth to purchase a ticket. I stood back and gave some thought to whether I would join them. I looked at the sea. While it was not as stormy as it had been at the other location, it nevertheless did not match my ideal of calmness. It would also be a much longer crossing than with the other ferry. For Sweden was quite far from East Germany. I only had two days left of my allotted time off. I would arrive in Denmark just in time to depart.
That might not have dissuaded me from continuing on with the others, however; what really convinced me not to go was the sea crossing. The prospect of a long, rough crossing on an unpredictable sea was not inviting. I thus bid farewell to my companions as they prepared to board the ship.
I walked to the little train station and purchased a ticket to East Berlin.
I seemed to be the only one boarding the night train to Berlin. I had the compartment all to myself. It was going to be a six-hour journey. I stretched out and rested but didn’t fall asleep. I was waiting for the conductor to come in and check my ticket. But no one came. I wondered if it was just me and the train engineer on the train. I heard no footsteps and no one boarded or disembarked from the train at each stop.
We arrived in East Berlin at half past four in the morning. I walked up to the entrance to the intimidating maze of mirrors and glass partitions that constituted the Kafkaesque passport control office that one needed to navigate in order to enter West Berlin. But it was closed.
It would open in one hour. I didn’t know where to wait. Not a single person was around. I didn’t want to simply stand there for an hour. So, I walked outside into the deathly still nighttime city center.
As I walked up dark, deserted Friedrichstrasse, I didn’t feel so much afraid, as I would have been on the streets of any American city at that hour. But I felt rather nervous because I was there illegally. I had no tourist visa and thus shouldn’t be strolling around the city. Fortunately, I encountered no uniformed agent. It was eerily silent. After walking back and forth along the street, I returned to the border crossing office.
At exactly half past five, the gate opened, the lights came on. I was the first and only customer. I promptly walked up to the glass partition and handed the agent my passport. He saw the transit visa issued three days earlier. He clearly was not pleased.
Still holding on to my passport, he walked away and spoke with other agents who were standing around with nothing to do. He returned and gestured me into an open area where I was soon surrounded by seven or eight border police agents. I was told to sit down on a chair that was in the middle of the area. The police gathered around me.
In normal circumstances, I would have been nervous finding myself in this situation. But I was exhausted, having hardly slept the last two nights, and so I was rather calm. I felt very American at that moment, thinking what are they going to do to an American citizen? Thank you red, white, and blue.
Then the questioning began. Fortunately, they spoke slowly and clearly so I could understand most but not all of what they were saying. I was having some difficulty responding in German and generously sprinkled my sentences with English words. I understood what the problem was. It was now my third day in the German Democratic Republic but I didn’t have a tourist visa. All I had was a transit visa issued three days before. They wanted to know exactly where I had been during all that time.
I managed to give them an account using increasingly more English words. They seemed to understand, or at least some of them did. While they noted that I spent the previous night on the train, they were perplexed about where I had been the night before. I proudly informed them that I spent it on the floor of the ferry terminal in Warnemuende.
This was apparently shocking for them to hear. I then added a bit cheekily that it wasn’t very comfortable accommodations.
That seemed to do the trick. They were not about to prompt another flare-up in the Cold War. I was allowed to re-enter West Berlin without any further delay.
I soon breathed the not particularly fresh air of freedom in West Berlin and headed back to my furnished room. I actually wasn’t disappointed that I never made it to Copenhagen. My unexpected adventure behind the Iron Curtain proved to be highly memorable.
My heartfelt thanks to Darren Weir for his editing suggestions and assistance with the photos.

Jebiga…
This is a pretty often word used by myself: Filip Malek, a 22 year old Software Development student, part time full stack web developer and a part homeless student from Croatia.
Let me give you a little back story and the reason of writing this article. It all started many, many, many years ago when I was a little angry, 6th grade rebellious kid who preferred running through forests playing airsoft, spending every single dime on surplus military equipment rather then spending time with his peers and doing all the usual shit that kids do at that age.
Why?
Its simple — I just couldn’t do what all the others did… It just didn’t make sense. I hated the idea of following trends and being just another fish in the sea following the usual everyday routines.
Why am I telling you all this?
Well, because going to the country you have never been to, with very limited financial resources, to a accommodation you have no clue is any good, without knowing anybody there that could help you out and if that isn’t good enough — flying for the first time in your life (if we ignore flying when I was 5 years old) — requires some serious guts, or craziness, or both…
The reason I opted for ‘Living in Copenhagen’ as the name of this article is because its just that — living, not studying.
There’s so much more to just studying in Copenhagen.
You don’t come here to study, you come here for a whole package. All the good things,bad things, headaches, relationships (both love and friendships)...
Studying in Denmark is very much different from, for example, studying in England or at the campus in the ‘states’. There you have a dorm room that you can live in as long as you study which is not really the case in Denmark. Of course there are dorms here but nobody is gonna find them for you and waiting lists for the bad ones are up to 12 months… It is completely up to you to find accommodation and even though you might get tips from school or others, it is still very, very hard.
You might be getting a hint on what I’m aiming with this article. No, it’s not the fact that finding a room/apartment in Copenhagen area is a living hell or that the weather is pretty sh**** or, in fact, that jobs you will do when you start off are pretty sh**** as well.
It’s just one man’s observation on the fact that life is HARD! And trying to start off in a country such as Denmark isn’t the easiest thing in the world and you won’t be padded on your back nor congratulated on every step of the way.
It is just a wake up call and a slap in the face from the life itself. You see, life is a tragedy, we can’t argue that. Ancient Greeks knew it way back when life was much simpler. Jordan Peterson wrote about it in his book “12 rules for life” — which I definitely recommend by the way! We just have to make sense of it all if we were to survive and live a meaningful life. To set of in a world at the age of 19 with circumstances that I had was a bold move and still, 3 years later, I am not comfortable enough to look at myself and say that there is no work left and let alone sit back and relax.
But I did actually kinda relax. I was living the life. Living super close to city center in my own place (I sublet a room with its own kitchen, toilet and separate entrance in a much bigger apartment), working was just 5 mins away and school barely 7, hitting the gym often and just being happy. I was super lucky to get that place. After being kicked out and having to crash at a friends sofa for a few days I got contacted by a lovely woman who offered me the room. That just doesn’t happen in Copenhagen. Usual practice is to send 10 messages a day to landlords looking for tenants and hope that after a few weeks you get invited for an open house. I knew that this doesn’t just happen and I treated it as such.I respected the rules and I decorated the place to my own taste. Bought a black board to note shit down (always wanted one), put Star Wars posters all around, old Copenhagen Tuborg commercial posters, Copenhagen Street Food memorabilia (used to work there for 2 years). Made a hygge corner (google it) with candles and stuff… It was a really nice place and I felt at home there.
Then life decided to happen…
On 1st of May there was a some plumbing work being done in my building so they cut off the water from 0700 to 1700. My upstairs neighbors did a small mistake that led me to being kicked out again… Don’t get me wrong, they are generally nice people. I don’t know them that much though. Small talk is considered awkward and you can really see a Dane not enjoying it if you don’t know him well, that is. So I didn’t talk to them. Except saying “Hello” when I saw them in the stairwell or “Tak” (danish for thank you) when they held the door for me or vice versa. All I knew is that they were a couple with two small kids. On 1st of May — when plumbers were plumbing away — their kid left the faucet open and around 1500 — when they connected the water back on — it started to flood everything… At least that’s what they told me. I am not blaming the kid (even though, technically it is his fault). He is just a kid after all. Maybe plumbers messed up when they turned the water on too early… I came home from work only to see my room being completely wet and water dripping form the ceiling. To be honest I wasn’t angry or anything. I just wanted to go to the gym. I even bough a Ultra White Monster and a Reese's bar. I waited until they shut down the water but didn’t want to wait for repair man to come so I told my landlord that I will be going to the gym. She was okay with that as there was little to nothing that I could do. Few days after insurance company came and said that I will have to move out along with all of my stuff until latest August. I was speechless, to way the least… By then, the damage should have been fixed.
This was 5th time that I was moving in almost 3 years of being in Denmark and I definitely wasn’t happy about it.
Then life showed its beautiful side and I stumbled upon a room 25 km from Copenhagen until my place gets fixed. My cousin met a Danish girl in Bulgaria on some kind of student event. Her parents have a house in Kokkedal (district somewhat close to Copenhagen) that they rent out to students and turns out that they had one room free just for me (rhyme is on purpose here :) ). I took it without too much thought. I am still extremely grateful to these wonderful people because without them, I am not sure what would have happened.
In the time of writing this article I am still living there. Three months have passed and repairs are only 50% done and I don’t know how long will it take them to finish but I at least hope to move back in once it is done.
I guess that at the end of the day this is life. Sometimes good things happen and sometimes bad things happen. You might get 10 bad things happen and then only one good thing or vice versa. Only logical thing to do is — and I quote great Jordan Peterson — to “Stand up straight with your shoulders back” and take it like a man.
Wining and complaining never helped anybody anyway…

Facing Copenhagen City Hall across the street, Tivoli is the second-oldest amusement park in the world. I hold a special affection for it, because two same-sex partners in one of my favorite pioneering Chinese LGBTQ novels, Beijing Story (later adapted into the well-known film Lan Yu), bought a house in the suburbs of Beijing and named it Tivoli, hoping it could be as dreamy as the amusement park since they couldn’t be openly together in the city.
Tivoli became not only a shelter for them but also a haven where they could express and nurture their love. Many years have passed, yet we still need and yearn for such a place in reality.
I couldn’t hold back my excitement and took a quick look at Tivoli in the cold wind before running to catch up with my friend into Copenhagen City Hall.
My friend, K, walked ahead, glancing back repeatedly to check the wedding veil pinned to her shoulder, fearing it might fall. Her wedding with another girl, J, was to be held at City Hall in just half an hour. Two Chinese girls, getting married in a foreign country far from home.
The quiet and solemn City Hall was carefully decorated, with rainbow flags hanging in mid-air, rainbow stickers on the…

By the time we got to Femøren metro stop the wind had picked up and the rain was lashing down. More inappropriate weather for a sea swim you couldn’t imagine. But it would take a bold — and rash — person to stand between me and a swimming adventure and so we pressed on, holding umbrellas horizontal, like shields in battle against the driving rain.
Half an hour previously, scurrying from the warmth of our cosy hotel to the metro station, we had had a tiff about umbrellas. Between us, you thought that one small black collapsible umbrella was not enough: it was raining, windy and miserable. You wanted me to shelter under the brolly beside you and and I didn’t want to pin myself to you to keep dry. I don’t care for umbrellas. I prefer getting wet and bedraggled to the fuss and bother of an umbrella. My protestations of “Look, I’m waterproof!” and “I’m not cold! I don’t mind getting a little wet!” didn’t convince you. It made you feel ungallant, you said.
“What if it’s really rainy when we get to the other end and there is a long walk?!” you wailed, persuading me to let you go and buy a second umbrella.
Thank goodness for the second umbrella, I had to concede. It was much worse by the time we got off the metro. A less determined expedition would have turned back. Instead, we pressed on. I was going to have my swim. We skirted through an industrial estate, crossed 4 lanes of traffic, and squelched our way across the sodden and marshy grass of a park because it seemed marginally quicker than the pathway. Anything to get out of the driving rain.
I’d seen pictures of Kastrup Sea Bath in glossy design and architecture magazines. It looked beautiful: an elegant curved wooden construction, warmed and weathered, at the end of a long jetty, where locals can swim, sunbathe and dive, sheltered from the elements.
On a day like today there were no swimmers, sunbathers, no hanger-outers. Not a soul. It looked beautifully desolate, forlorn, slightly spooky. The usually silvered wooden timbers were black and sodden with rain. The planks looked more like the snaggle-toothed weathered boards of a wrecked ship than a haven. There was nobody around. Had they all abandoned ship?
We walked out along the jetty to investigate more closely, I had a sense of foreboding. I hoped it might appear more inviting close up, but it felt just as bleak. Doors to changing rooms were locked, it felt like the world had left for the summer and well and truly locked up on the way out.
We decided, I decided, that a swim from the shore, from the beach, might be more prudent. We walked back along the jetty to the beach and found a large spartan changing room nearby and stripped off.
As we stood in our swimming gear on a cold autumn day, in the rain, in the middle of nowhere, slightly hysterical, miles from civilisation, a middle aged woman rode up noncholantly on a bike. Seemingly unphased by the vile weather, she leaned her bike against a wall, and walked along the jetty to the sea baths. The lifeguard had arrived! As we watched from the beach she wandered around the sea baths unlocking doors and settling in for a quiet day at the office. I felt more reassured by her arrival.
Back to the reason we’d come. We tiptoed into the water. Sand underfoot. Wincing. Cold. My feet hurt. Undeterred I waded in deeper, reasoning that being under the water would somehow would be warmer, because I’d be out of the wretched wind. You let the water dance across your thighs, and then turned back, not as convinced by the beauty of the cold as I was.
Emboldened by the presence of another human being who might be able to help if something went wrong (what would go wrong?!) I headed out from the shore. Breastsroke at first — to take in the view — and then front crawl. Out past the edge of the sand into an area of tall seaweed beds. I tasted the water — it was suprisingly unsalty. Is it the sea? Or a river to the sea?
Becoming bolder, I headed further out — swimming alongside the jetty, with little choppy waves to slap me as I went. Arriving soon at the haven of the wooden platform I was greeted by the lifeguard, a middle aged Danish woman, smoking a cigarette, wrapped up against the weather. As I treaded water, we smiled and said hello. “14.5C” she offered, unprompted, with a friendly smile. The international language of swimmers. Would she swim, I asked? Perhaps. How many people would swim today? About five to six.
Then I saw you wandering back along the jetty, in only your trunks, to join us.
And there we were, the three of us, chatting away: one fully clothed and bundled against the cold, one standing half naked in the wind, and one bobbing about in the water. On a swimming platform, out to sea, in the wind and rain. Oh Copenhagen. What better way to experience a place than to be right there, surrounded by it. Inside it.

The whole idea of moving from Brno to Copenhagen came to my mind sometime around November 2015. The main reason for me was that I had already completed the majority of design classes at my university in Brno and I was struggling with math and algorithm classes. I didn’t want to spend 2 more years studying calculus day and night and shifting my focus away from design. So I started researching schools around Europe. I looked for the ones focused mainly on design and suitable for me to continue my studies. From all the schools I looked at, I found the best fit in the Copenhagen School of Design and Technology, where I eventually applied. I had to wait until the 1st of July to see whether I am accepted or not. Luckily I passed the admission process and I could continue my studies in Denmark. It sounds quite effortless now but I was terrified at the time. I had just landed a great job heading the Edookit design team and I was also involved in a number of my own freelance projects. Yet I took advantage of the opportunity and with all the projects in mind I moved to the capital of Denmark.
After a few months of living here, I have to say it was a good decision. I managed to keep my work at Edookit as well as my work on private projects (such as this blog). Living in a completely different country and working for a company based in Brno taught me how to manage my time well. I have already detailed my time management routines in a previous article.
The city itself is undisputably stunning. Colourful buildings, huge parks and bikes everywhere. The history of Copenhagen is rich, yet the city maintains a modern feel. I am a big fan of the bike culture, I still cannot imagine a single day here without my double-wheeled friend. The year of 2016 was the first year in history when there were more bikes in this city than cars. Coming from Brno, where you can easily be killed when riding a bike, Copenhagen feels like heaven. Overall the bike infrastructure is very developed with futuristic bike bridges over canals and self-driven metro. All of this is supported by city train lines called S-trains which go up to 40 km/h from the city centre in each direction. I was using the B-line of the S-train often because I lived in a nearby suburb town of Taastrup.
I fell in love with this town and the house I have lived in and as I said to my landlord, it will always remain a great part of my life. Taastrup is a quite small town inhabited mostly by families and made beautiful by the pristine nature surrounding it. A lot of different opportunities for running, huge shopping centre called City 2 and a lot of Danish architecture. The main squares are full of traditional shops, which are maintained by people who spent their entire lives developing their skills. Quiet, inspirational and friendly — the best place for a creative person to live in.
Studying at KEA (Copenhagen School of Design and Technology) taught me a lot that I could immediately utilize in my actual work. The school puts emphasis on research as well as on pitching ideas. I also wrote an article about one of the projects we did as an assignment for a new museum in Copenhagen.
I knew that research is a crucial part of UX design and design in general but until I became involved in research at KEA, I think I hadn’t thought about it quite as deeply as I perhaps should have. Leaving my comfort zone, talking to users and consumers and creating new design processes are only a fraction of what I have learned here. I have had the opportunity to work on our school projects with many talented designers, who were already able to achieve so much in their lives and some of them are already members of teams working on projects with worldwide impact. I am thankful for getting to know them and being inspired by them to learn even more about design and continue working towards my goals.
I was lucky enough to get a place in a minor, semester-long program, which is focused in particular on digital product design. I wanted to get a place there badly, as this program could really help me understand the work I do even more and teach me a lot about designing experiences. After spending a semester focusing on research and theory of design, I am looking forward to coding and high fidelity design. And so I have to move again and leave Copenhagen. After Christmas spent in Slovakia with my family and friends, I will spend most of January in Brno at Edookit headquarters preparing my work for the next couple of months and then move to Amsterdam, starting the next chapter of my life.

Since I’m already at the end of my journey to Denmark, I figured I would talk about some of the most interesting places I visited in Denmark. I must admit that I didn’t venture very far from Copenhagen, but if you are only visiting for a week or two, most of what I’m going to present can be done.
It might be obvious, but we tend to forget that most people in Denmark live in this city area and by far. The second largest city, Aarhus, has only 1/6th of the population of Copenhagen. I won’t say I saw everything there is to see, but here is my personal must-do list:
This is the classic tourist place you find on all postal cards from Copenhagen. Still it’s a must see. Be sure to walk around the harbour and enjoy the seaside, the old houses and the beautiful boats. With some luck, you might even get a nice sunny day.
Near the old harbour across the pedestrian bridge, you can find this strange, but cool place called Papirøen. Inside the building you will find a LOT of different street-food for every taste. Wandering inside the building is a unique experience for the senses. Grab something to eat and take a seat in front of the canals.
From Papirøen, you can walk toward Christiania. This hippy community claims itself independent, but make no mistake it’s still part of Denmark and the laws still apply. However, they do have two rules you MUST respect:
- Don’t run (because that signals a police raid)
- Don’t take photos
It’s a nice place to grab a beer and, if you like that, smoke. Multiple stands openly sell all you will ever need.
To end the day, I suggest a GoBoat tour in the canals. You can rent those electric boats for one or two hours and wander around. They have a picnic table on them, so bring some food and alcohol to do a nice meal on the water. It’s one of the best experience you can have in Copenhagen and another way to see the city.
In the middle of the city, you will find the artificial lakes. It’s perfect for a morning walk or jog and you will find many Danes doing their work out there. They are not too big, but the scene with the old building is very beautiful.
Not very far from the lakes, you can find the Botanical garden. It’s a big and nice garden with at its center an old charming Greenhouse. The entrance is free so it’s totally worth the detour to observe some tropical and indigenous plants gathered over the many years of its existence.
Just beside the Botanical garden, you will find the King Garden. It’s not as pretty, but it’s worth a walk to see the flowers and the status. You can also visit the Rosenborg Castle. It’s usually full of tourists and quite expansive so I didn’t do it.
Biking is an important part of the modern Danish culture, so you will find plenty of very nice and well maintained cycling tracks. This is the itinerary I did:
The first part of this itinerary is the green belt that goes around Copenhagen, you will find a lot of old bunkers along this road with historical explanation (only in Danish though). After, you will get to the beautiful seaside and into a natural park. You can finish your journey in the charming fishing village of Dragør. You can back to Copenhagen by using the metro from the airport which is nearby.
Bike or take the train to this very nice location near Copenhagen. On the weekend, you will find many Danes there. The sandy beach is a nice spot for a picnic and you can walk a long time in the natural park of Dyrehavn after. You will see many many deer in this park, it’s what it’s famous for.
If you come to Copenhagen in the first week of June, you will be able to experience Distortion. During a couple of days, around 100 000 people invade the streets to dance and drink as much as they can. The event is described as: “A week of Emerging Dance Music and Orchestrated Chaos”. It’s a very special experience that you can’t find anywhere else in the world.
This city is located around 50km north of Copenhagen. It is easily accessible by train from Copenhagen Central Station. This is where the famous Kronborg Castle is located. If you are a fan of Hamlet this is the perfect spot. If you are like me and you don’t know what Hamlet is, this is still a nice castle to visit.
Just near the castle, you can also visit the underground Danish naval museum. Just for the architecture of the building it is worth a look. The exhibition by itself is quite short, but pleasant. The nearby library is also worth the detour. The mix of modern steel and glass with an old brick factory is uniquely beautiful.
From there, you can grab something to eat in the interior street food stands and take the direction of the small harbour. There, grab a beer in one of the bars or from the convenience store and enjoy the armada of sailing boats.
I finished the day by walking in the old city streets. The pedestrian only street is particularly beautiful even if it is not as long as the Copenhagen one. You can catch the train back to Copenhagen any time you want.
Bornholm is an island in the middle of the Baltic sea between Sweden and Germany. This is the farthest I went from Copenhagen. It takes around 3 hours to get to Rønne (the biggest city on the island) from Copenhagen. Take the bus 866 to Ystad, Sweden and from there take the ferry.
The bus service on the island is not too bad and works similarly to the mainland, but you cannot you use your Rejsekort. You can buy 10 zones tickets for 85 kroner cash from the driver and use the old-school stamper at the entrance of the bus. You can almost go everywhere on the island. My Airbnb was in Nexø which is well located in the southern part of the island.
From there, I decided to visit the small city of Svaneke which has won the price of the most beautiful city of Denmark. I was a bit sick at that time, so I took the bus, but I highly recommend renting a bike for the day. The country side is charming and is worth exploring.
This old harbour city is very well preserved and it’s nice to walk around the houses and shops. From there, the walk along the coastal line is also pleasant and beautiful. Bring some food for a perfect picnic on the relaxing sound of the waves.
From Nexø, it is also easy to visit Dueodde. Praised for its sand beaches, this is the perfect spot to relax and take a sun bath. If you are courageous enough, you can try a dip in the water, but it is very cold even in the middle of July. Visiting both Svaneke and Dueodde can be done in a day.
My other trip on the island was going to Hammerhus. This is a medieval castle ruin and one of the most important archeological site of Denmark. It is also very popular so I suggest going early. It is around 1h of bus from Nexø. From the ruins, you can walk along the coast to see some impressive cliffs. I then took the bus again to go back to Rønne. I didn’t find the city particularly interesting, but you can relax in a Café until you catch the ferry.
Denmark is not a big country, but you can visit a lot of nice places quite easily with public transport. The coast is very beautiful and worth taking the time to enjoy it. In the next and probably final blog post, I will talk about my internship experience at Pleo. See you soon!

I took fairly easy train ride from Stockholm, through Malmo, and then over a gigantic bridge that spans the sea between Malmo and Copenhagen. I had no idea what to expect from Copenhagen, but somehow I knew I was going to enjoy my week in the home of Carlsberg. It turned out to be one of my favourite cities in Europe and the first time I stayed in a hostel with triple bunk beds.
Copenhagen was a fascinating city with an interesting mix of old and modern architecture in addition to many parks areas and canals. The bike lanes were also the best i’d used in Europe. I was able to skateboard on them anywhere I wanted in the city without having to go on the actual roads at all.
Apparently there was a study done about the Copenhagen bike lanes and the conclusion was that it was actually faster to use the bike lanes to bike to your destination than to drive within the city.
Copenhagen also had what I consider one of the best modern art museum that I visited in Europe, the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art.
Set a bit outside of the city on the coast, the building is at first unassuming by appearing to be a diminutive house, but when you enter it opens into a vast underground exhibit area.
In the surrounding grounds there was a pond with a small forest and various sculptures perched around some walking trails.
There were also some large open lawn areas with more sculptures and installations overlooking the sea. It was a beautiful place.
After being in the Copenhagen for a few days I could notice some contrasts between there and the Stockholm, most notably the liquor laws. Stockholm’s laws were more conservative than the redundant Canadian laws, forcing you to buy alcohol from specific government run liquor stores that close around 7 pm on weekdays, 3 pm on Saturdays and are completely closed on Sundays. Furthermore it was illegal to drink outside of establishments, and the latest almost all bars and clubs stay open till was 3 am. In contrast, in Copenhagen you can drink on the streets, buy alcohol from the corner store and party all night if you want to.
An interesting thing to note is the bottle deposit is so high on beers cans and bottles in Copenhagen that anytime I was sitting in a park enjoying a beer with some friends there would be at least five people coming up to you to ask for your empties, which was great because you never had to concern yourself with finding a garbage can to dispose of them. Win for the Danish.
During my week in Copenhagen I went to three music festivals. The best one was a free festival the city put on in the middle of a park called the King’s Garden that had a castle on a hill. Everybody was chilling on the grass drinking beers and enjoying one of the nicest days of the summer while music blared from a stage set up underneath the castle. I met some friendly people and ended up being invited over to somebody’s house for some after party drinks.
One of the most compelling aspects about Copenhagen was the existence of Freetown Christiania. Christiania is a place that exists in the city center of a Copenhagen, which is a self-proclaimed republic that stemmed from squatters living there since the 1970s. Christiania is it’s own world.
There were only about 800 official residents living there that have built themselves all kinds of strange houses and have even built their own schools to teach their children their own curriculum.
Street art was splashed everywhere all over the buildings and there were numerous small cafes and restaurants around that only accept cash.
The part about Christiania that most people come for though was the open selling and consumption of marijuana. There was a street called ‘pusher street’ that was lined with at least 20 stalls selling all kinds of hash, marijuana and edibles.
Here you can buy a joint, light it up, smoke it and nobody will bother you. It is fascinating that such a place existed right in the middle of one of the most modern cities in Europe. Still what happens in Christiania was technically illegal so the residents had established two rules for visitors. The first rule was no running, because if people are running the residents assume it’s a police raid and they will start to run away as well. I later met some Danish dude that told me if you are caught running in Christiania you will receive quite the beating. The second rule was no photos, which was unfortunate because there are some many cool art installations and works of street are littered around the self-proclaimed republic.
Still I was able to sneak a photo or two, but there was one instance where I took a photo of the entrance sign with a resident in the photo and he came up to me and made me delete the photo from my phone.
In the end for me Copenhagen was an ideal blend of south Europe and Scandinavia. It was a clean, organized, well thought out city that has a little bit of everything for everybody where you didn’t have to look over your shoulder to go drink a beer. I actually looked into immigrating there, but unfortunately I would have had to learn the Danish language, which, according to one of my Swedish friends, takes the Danish more time than any other group of children in the world to learn their native language.

This year we decided to visit more international events and since we heard that Copenhagen’s MeasureCamp organized by IIH Nordic is well-known for hosting many international guests and that the official language is always English, it was a no brainer.
Just after the landing in Copenhagen Airport we traveled into the city center by metro (the city is probably not that big, since it only has two metro lines more than Brno). The navigation looked exactly like a line-up of a heavy metal festival (just the fonts are a little less diverse).
When we got out of the underground the first thing that surprised us was the amount of bikes on every corner of the city centre and insanely heavy bike-traffic (probably a bit increased by the nice weather on Thursday). We were also surprised to see actual nudges preventing littering. But they were white — someone would call that “a typical Danish sloppiness”.
As we arrived on Thursday, we were looking towards meeting with the other attendees before the main event, so we asked the organizers if there is any Warm-up party. There was nothing officially planned, but the idea clicked and we arrived at the venue on Friday evening, helped a little with moving a couple of chairs and got beer-support and a tip, that drinking on an embankment after work is a popular Danish thing to do. We know how hard is to organize a perfect event, so we understood when the organizers themselves were not able to attend (we also hope that we didn’t cause too much trouble — Yeah, yeah, sorry, sorry), but at least it looks like we have founded a tradition for the next issues of Copenhagen’s Event.
Czechocalypse! We bet that the second country with most attendees at #mccphg19 was Czechia. Here they are: Tony, Marek, Marina (one ex-russian, ex-australian, currently-finnish exception), Leona, Milan, Martin, Tobiáš, Hana (Lukáš is missing, maybe he was stalking Simo somewhere).
In Czechia there’s a saying “drinking like a Dane” (= a lot), we guess that after this weekend there will probably arise a similar phrase in Denmark — “drinking like Czechs”. As we know that the best experience you can take from MeasureCamp is to present and at the same time that most attendees fear public speaking, we decided to donate a bottle of courage (nice mellow rum from Barbados) to all attendees so they may overcome this hurdle.
This new GTM feature had pretty good coverage by both Julian Juenemann and Simo Ahava. They were mentioning them in their presentations and discussing various aspects related to this forward-looking promising move of Google. This attempt to regain mutual trust in between marketing and IT departments (partially lost due to marketing collateral of Tag Management Systems stating that managing JavaScript tags can be done by circumventing slow and complex IT processes) by providing far better control allowing for increased security and supporting best development practices seems to click with the analytics community.
Simo also presented an open-source project of himself and David Vallejo to build, maintain and share reviewed templates and asked attendees to contribute.
The topic was mentioned in the morning session lead by Jeff Doctor and later again in presentation by Steen Rasmussen. Especially Hana is always excited if someone is about to speak for a more broader point of view considering all the consequences.
Especially the networking conversations emphasized what bad could be done with new powerful data tools, if we’ll use it without making some policies about it. With Steen it was more in the practical way related to analytics and social media, with Jeff it was more philosophical (❤) about knowledge without wisdom and turning statistics into a dangerous tool not reflecting relations among people.
Topics related to these discussions are also GDPR (legislation trying to catch-up with the technology trends) and a new “war” (as mentioned in the presentation by Alban Gerome) sometimes referred to as cat-and-mouse game between the browser vendors and marketing technology providers around cross-site scripting and inadequate data sharing. We already have the ITP series (1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2) from Apple/Safari and Mozilla/Firefox joining the effort as well, so we kind of hope that our industry will still exist after future revisions of such actions even if we, at least for now, are still able to find feasible workarounds (like the one against latest issue of ITP presented by Simo Ahava).
Usually, we enforce each other so all of us have a session, but this time, only Lukas and Hana made it through.
This “unconference” is really awesome! I love the everyone’s drive for data and web analyses. It’s not like science conferences, where everybody has to present their results to be more visible, for reference to their articles and scientific collaborations. Here, it is different — no reviewers and abstracts or choosing who is suitable enough to have a presentation. You can talk here on your own topics, in case you find it interesting for somebody. Just to share the knowledge and data tricks, no need to get anything back. The schedule board was magic — there was balance between spaces and sessions. Next time I would be proud to stick my own session card on the board as well.
As we probably overestimated the fear and the session board filled up pretty quickly in the morning, the rum was finally useful as an acceleration of the After Party, when we upgraded the game of beer-pong with it.
We were offered to play our favorite songs at the After Party. That wasn’t a wise decision, because since we arrived to our Airbnb, we switched local AppleTV into Czech and started to play two songs: Promiň (Sorry) and Dělám stojky (I do handstands). Those songs are from the bizarre category and we recycled the phrases in them again and again during our stay. We’re so sorry, that even other people had to listen to these. But to enjoy the stupidity, here’s a typically Danish sloppy translation into English, so you can suffer with us.
Does anyone know who is this creepy guy trying to take photos with everyone?

I didn’t grow up in Denmark so I’m a bit of a coward when it comes to biking in winter. The cobblestones around Copenhagen are tricky enough without adding ice or slushy snow into the mix. Happily, the city has fantastic public transport including a rail system that can get me anywhere I want to go, almost round the clock.
I live in Sydhaven on the edge of the city proper. A good selection of buses run nearby but I love the S-train so it’s worth the 10-minute walk.
At Sjælor station, I slap my rjesekort (travel card) against the blue check-in light on the platform and hope to hear a chirpy ka-ching. The uh-oh loser chime means insufficient funds but it isn’t a problem, public transport is cheap in Copenhagen and a few kroner go a long way.
The suburban-urban S-train is integrated with the city Metro and about half a million people use the system every day. The trains are frequent and usually clean, unless tagged by teens with cans of spray paint. If that conjures up subway nightmares, fear not — this isn’t New York and…

In 2018, Copenhagen’s new waste-to-energy plant will not only set the bar high for environmental performance but also for architectural integration into the landscape with the plant containing a variety of green and recreational spaces.
By Robert C. Brears*
The city’s waste-to-energy plant, Copenhill / Amager Bakke, is being constructed by Amager Resource Center which is owned by five Danish Municipalities. The plant, projected to open in the summer of 2018, will be equipped with two furnace lines and a joint turbine- and generator system. This replaces a 45-year-old plant that had four furnace lines. With the new furnaces, Copenhill will burn 2 x 35 tons of waste per hour. Overall, Copenhill will:
Grey+Green Infrastructure
In addition to the technological achievements of the plant, Copenhill will be architecturally integrated into the surrounding landscape with the inclusion of green and community spaces. Almost 3,000m² of the roof surface will be dedicated to the green landscape with planners creating ’10 places and 10 routes’. The places will contain a number of areas for visitors to look out from, take a break or work out in, while the routes will comprise a variety of walking and running routes that range from an inspirational hiking landscape to short-sprint and challenging training routes.
Along the perimeters of the building, there will be green areas for visitors to enjoy the view of the city. An artificial ski slope covering 600m², along with a ski centre providing equipment, ski passes, and clothing to the public, will provide extra recreational opportunities for the public to enjoy.
Finally, adventure-seekers will be able to climb the sides of the plant with the Danish Climbing Association involved in preparing a future climbing wall which will be one of the highest in the world at 80 meters.
The take-out
Infrastructure of the future will be a mix of grey+green enabling multiple benefits to accrue from one site.

Onstage at Lantern Theater Company January 11 through February 18, 2018, Copenhagen explores a pivotal moment in the relationship of Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, two scientists at the cutting edge of the development of quantum physics. The play explores the notion of being on the forefront of incredible discovery — and what your responsibility is to the world and to your loved ones once those discoveries are unleashed.
Quantum physics is a branch of science that examines the workings of the smallest parts of our world: the atomic and subatomic elements of nature. By the turn of the 20th century, scientists suspected that the classical laws of nature might not apply at the atomic level, and quantum physics sprang from the desire to learn more about what might govern the building blocks of all matter.
Newtonian physics was the dominant belief for two centuries, and a major tenet for that system is causality. According to classical physics, knowing the initial conditions for an event means that one could theoretically predict every event that would follow, thanks to the laws of motion and conservation of energy. Quantum physics shakes that belief to its core, embracing instead the idea that deterministic causality may be impossible at the atomic level.
According to the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum physics, formulated primarily by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, uncertainty is at the heart of the discipline. In his Uncertainty Principle, Heisenberg posited that it is impossible to know with certainty both the position and the momentum of an atomic element, like an electron. The more precisely you measure one factor, the less precisely you can hope to measure the other.
This is largely because of the Complementarity Principle, contributed by Bohr. This states that matter has properties of both particles and waves — which would have been impossible in Newtonian physics — and that both are necessary for a complete understanding of atomic elements. By accepting that both states are true, we can begin to understand the seemingly contradictory behavior of atomic and subatomic elements.
Another main tenet of the Copenhagen Interpretation is that the act of measuring or observing essentially changes the thing being observed. For example, sending a beam of light to find a particle means that a photon will collide with an electron, which tells that electron’s position. However, that collision knocks the electron off its path, meaning that its momentum and velocity are now different than they were before the scientist went looking for it. For quantum physicists who adhere to the Copenhagen Interpretation, this means there is an essential unknowability at the core of the science.
This is why some major physicists of the time, including Einstein and Schrodinger, rejected the Copenhagen Interpretation; rather than seeing the lack of knowledge as its own kind of knowledge, they saw it as giving up on finding out. Bohr and Heisenberg were standing against hundreds of years of classical physics, and against some of the leading minds of their field.
“Quantum provides us with a striking illustration of the fact that though we can fully understand a connection … we can only speak of it in images and parables. We must be clear that when it comes to atoms, language can be used only as in poetry. The poet, too, is not nearly so concerned with describing facts as with creating images and establishing mental connections.” — Niels Bohr
World War II was ramping up as the theory of quantum physics made room for practical application, and theoretical physicists began exploring the possibility of nuclear energy, with Bohr and Heisenberg at the forefront.
Nuclear fission is the splitting of an atom’s nucleus into two smaller pieces, as a result of either a reaction with free neutrons or radioactive decay. This releases tremendous energy, paving the way for both nuclear reactors that produce power and nuclear bombs that rain destruction. A chain reaction is necessary to sustain this energy release; each instance of fission releases neutrons, which can then go on to fission other nuclei in the material. The longer the chain, the more energy is released.
In order for the chain reaction to be self-sustaining, the fissile material must be at critical mass: the precise amount and shape needed to produce a self-sustaining chain reaction, which it can be controlled by density, mass, and other factors. This mass is determined in part by a diffusion calculation, which measures how the freed neutrons are distributed throughout the system. This equation helps discern how much of a particular isotope is required for the neutrons to fission in order to produce a self-sustaining chain reaction — and therefore how much would be necessary to build an atomic bomb.
In their visionary leap and embrace of uncertainty, Bohr and Heisenberg stood against hundreds of years of classical and deterministic physics, and some of the leading minds of their field. They also had a hand in fundamentally changing the direction of modern warfare, and the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.
Copenhagen is onstage at the Lantern January 11 through February 18, 2018. Visit our website for tickets and information.

Hopefully by now everybody recovered from the New Year’s Eve party and ready for the next weekend ahead us. Let me give you a short guide to the best bars in Copenhagen, based on my own experiences to make the choice easier.
1105 — You’ll find only the basic information about the 1105 on its website, but in fact, there is no need for more because its fame speaks for itself. 1105 has been around a while and was inspired by the London hotel bars. It was designed in the spirit of the Danish “hygge” and if you don’t mind, you can sit and socialize together with strangers. Many locals and non-locals as well simply consider it as the best in town, because of the vaste cocktail selection and the professional bartenders. https://www.facebook.com/1105cocktailbar
The barking dog — This is my personal favourite from the list, however, I’ve been there only once. Located in another party district of Copenhagen, Nørrebro, you can be sure that this place is full with party people on Friday/Saturday nights. This bar is smaller than the 1105, so if you arrive in couple or in a smaller group, it is almost sure that you have to share your table with others. The retro atmosphere evokes for me the ruin bars from Budapest and the cocktail menu is creatively edited, with a short story encolsed to the cocktails. http://www.thebarkingdog.dk
№64 — The concept of this cozy cocktailbar is that you have to pay 64 DKK (8,5 EUR) for a cocktail. This doesn’t affect the quality though. Don’t miss the delicious home-made ginger shots, which will warm you up in these cold months and not only because of the ginger, if you know what I mean. During the weekends, it’s a good idea to book a table in advance, because it might get very busy, but if you miss it, the good thing is that you don’t have to hunt the free tables, because at the entrance the staff will help you right away. http://www.no64.dk
Madam Chu’s — This bar is situated at the Gammel Strand, together with other trendy cocktail bars, what makes this outstanding though is its oriental style. After you draw the black curtain, you enter a whole new world. The cocktails are strong, and these ‘forbidden delights’ come with unusual ingredients such as dill and caramel or red pepper. Don’t forget, ‘anything is possible and everything is for sale’ here. http://madamchu.dk/home/
Taphouse — This one is an exception on the list, but such a great bar that I couldn’t leave it out. If you’re a huge fan of beers then this is your place to be. Before I moved to Copenhagen, I couldn’t really drink any other type than wheat beer, but since then I discovered a whole new world of IPA’s, brown ales and red ales. The Taphouse is situated in the very heart of Copenhagen and you can choose over 60 different types of beers, with real rarities and many seasonal offers. Don’t get scared of the prices, only 2 glasses of beers kick off the party and your good mood. http://taphouse.dk

This guide by Sondre Sommerfelt is a gift to all his fellow sailors onboard Christian Radich for the xVoyage, however it should guide any lost sole in Scandinavias most continental city.
www.entrepreneurship.one
The Guide is splitt into the inner city København K and 4 (5) main boroughs that surround it:
- Vesterbro and Nørrebro, working-class districts that has gentrified increasingly into a rich kids playground (but they’re still charming. )
- Nørreport , which is not its own borough, but feels like one.
- Amager, CPH own New Jersey.
- and Frederiksberg, aka Manhattan, which is actually its own city, inside the other city. Frederiksberg is not exactly a city-state either, as you’re still in Denmark, but even so, it’s just as strange as the Danes are comfortable about having it.
Østerbro: The slightly more refurbished district north (or is it east?) of the city and Søerne lake(s).
The Seminal restaurant Noma has opened again, so Copenhagen’s reputation as a culinary excellence endures without them and their foraged moss. Danish design is world renowned and its city development — kicking out the cars, redesigning its city for bikers and pedestrians, and thinking ahead, always asking, ‘what does our citizens need(?), before they know it themselves — is a trailblazer in modern urban planning.
Equally noteworthy is the city’s vibrant and varied nightlife: lax drinking laws (plus lax cannabis laws) combined with an emphasis on good design and epicurean innovation make for an embarrassment of great bars and lounges. If you know where to go, you can easily stay out until the sun comes up — which in the dead of winter is very late indeed.
Always have in the back of your mind the very traditional Danish bodega, or dive. At these establishments there’s no craft beers, only [cheap] Danish beers like Carlsberg and Tuborg, or the oldest ecological industrial beer in the world, Thy. But as with any good dive, you don’t go to these bodagas for the drinks. Drink Thy, smoke cigarettes, play dice, and generally unwind.
Very important Info:
Whatever you do, the party often ends at Kødbyen — the meat district — at Vesterbro or at some of the late night bodegas mentioned in this guide.
Most Importantly:
WHATEVER you do, the only thing you need to do visit in the city of Copenhagen is the dive bar Bobibar.
Tips for the summer:
Pumpehuse — Cultural hub and live venue in an old industrial area. Great garden, Byhaven, with free concerts all through the summer.
The kiosk ‘Khioskh’ has an insane amount of different types of beers. (Check out the basement). Pick out some fine samples, and sit on the lawn in front. For some reason, you’re not allowed to drink your purchased fancy-brew at their benches in-front of the kiosk, so you’re shown to the grass next to the benches like a dog, a brew dog.
On warm summer nights, sit under the trees at one of the bars by Søerne lake. Or rent a Swan-boat, bring loads of rosé and pedal around the lake like a boss.
Islands brygge: buy the cheapest red wine and a bottle of Spirte at the local grocery store, go to the pier, jump in the sea, get up, mix yourself a big glass of ‘Tino de Verano’. When the sun sets, everybody is here. You’ll make friends. We promise.
Plenty windy beaches, we choose Amager beach park
Buy an ice-cream cone with ‘det hele’, which means — literally — with everything.
WHATEVER you do, the only thing you need to do visit in the city of Copenhagen is the dive bar Bobibar.
The Urinal
The area around Larsbjørnsstrædet, Studiestræde and Sankt Peders stræde (also called Pisserenden (The Urinal) or The Latin Quarter) is filled with people & bicycles. As Latin quarters should, it has a relaxed atmosphere perfect for knocking back some beers in the sun (well, that’s a description that fits all of CPH — perfect for knocking back beers in the sun). You can always just sit on a doorstep or a trashed bike and drink your brew, instead of at the cafes. Or it used to be like this, but things are changing: the area has become increasingly touristy lately, and ‘nobody’ (read: the cool cats) ever goes here besides its ‘hood-rats’ and people that are lost. If you go further down the street you step into a sunny beach looking area with random youth clubs (Vestergade).
Anyway, there’s indeed a relaxed atmosphere and good salads and sandwiches on the Icelandic Kaffesalonen, (Sankt Peders stræde), or at Livingroom, located right at the intersection of Larsbjørnsstrædet and Studiestræde. Also worth checking out is the cafe and bar Din nye ven (Your New Friend) which is a sweet hangout. And the restaurant Brother has great New Nordic food.
When it comes to shopping, there’s a lot of 2nd Hand & Vintage joints in the streets mentioned above, and in Kompagnistræde / Læderstræde.
Kongens Have
The King’s Garden is perfect for knocking back beers, on the lawn, in the sun. Although this spot is very popular for both students, people from the provinces and drunken Swedes (or Norwegians), it’s indeed classy as King’s gardens should be.
Bo-Bi Bar.
Bo-Bi Bar, our favourite bar in CPH, it’s vintage in its exterior, interior and clientele. It’s probably one of the best dive bars in the world (that’s a fact), and has been like this since back when making dive bars was a popular pursuit, under the times of prohibition, although Denmark never had any prohibition. Dangerously tempting, even on school nights. During the day they play classical music, serve hardboiled eggs and have a ’no cellphone policy.’ Smoking is encouraged.
Byens kro
Just down the street from Bobibar is another slightly more refurbished den with slightly more refurbished people. Byens kro (‘The City’s Bodega’, its name none the less) is open and hour or two longer than Bobi, which is convenient if you’re still thirsty and sleepless late after midnight.
Pumpehuset
Cultural hub and live venue in an old industrial area. Great garden, Byhaven, with free concerts all through the summer.
La Fontaine aka Laffa
Jazz club with special beer offers on Fridays — 3 for 1 (or is it 3 for 2. We can’t remember). Popular hang out for both musicians and intellectuals, and probably also intellectual musicians, and musical intellectuals.
Jazzhouse
Best venue in CPH and they serve some mean cocktails. The music is more than ‘just’ jazz, if you like the music at Blå in Oslo or Cafe Oto in London, you’ll love it here.
Gasoline Grill
Named one of the best burgers in the world recently. It is located in an old gas station at Landegreven (close to Kongens Have). Be there early, they only make around 50 burgers a day and close when they are sold out…
Fars Dreng
Vine & food.
Ofelia Plads
Arty space by the harbour — installations, concerts, theatre, panthomime, contourtionism, who knows what arty people do? Go into the playhouse next door and get a glass of wine, bring it outside and chill.
Botanisk Have
Botanical garden. Go for a stroll. Bring wine. And a harp.
Café Dyrehaven
Café Dyrehaven (‘The Animal park’, named after a deer park North of Copenhagen) on Sønder Boulevard, perfect for both brunch and evening drinks (Closes at 1am). And as the Baudelairen name implies — probably the best place in town for people spotting. Try ‘kartoffelmad’, potato sandwich, or other contemporary interpretations of traditional (open) Danish sandwiches. (Yes, our American friends, its only one piece of bread and topping, no extra bread on top. Crazy!) Or just go for the brunch platter, always a treat. They also have decent and reasonably priced dinners.
Blomsten e.l.
Blomsten (The Flower) on Istedgade: beer, smokes, hipsters, dicey locals & jukebox in a healthy mix. This is an authentic Danish bodega: as real as it gets, and a must see. Closes at around 02:00.
To make a cultural walk out of it, why not go on a binge? When in Rome, set out on a Danish binge crawl of Vesterbro: From Skipper’s Bodega in Istedgade, walk up the street to McKluud, before ending at Blomsten. It’s three fine dens where they play Danish folk and sea shanties, populated with a bouquet of gentle Danes of all ages and sizes, new teeth or toothless. Classic and hypermodern at the same time, if that’s even possible? Yes it is. Denmark in a nut(s)shell.
Bang & Jensen: Food, bar, beer, cool elderly clientele, and, or first dates.
Brass Monkey
A Tiki bar & a cocktail hangout with a Twin Peaks-ish atmosphere.
Riesen bar in Ohlenschlægersgade
If you manage to spell the name of this street you’re probably too sober to go here, or you have a PHD in Danish linguistics. If you don’t, like most human beings, and you’re bold enough to dare to go down the primordial path, this is the most decadent bar in town: intimate, packed with pity or petty nihilists, charming and cute narcissists — and their nemeses. Or to translate from latin, this is where everybody goes to pick up someone or somebody. So, it’s a perfect spot for drinks after you’ve been through all the other bodegas mentioned above. It usually starts out as a tranquil place, but it can change its rating from Calvinist retreat to good old Roman debauchery in seconds. So beware! Closes at about 4am.
Guldregn Bodega.
A morning tavern and would be your last resort. At Guldregn aka The Golden Shower (Yes, that’s the name of this den.) Be aware, it’s been suffering from its own success (if you can call it that?) and therefore they’ve employed bouncers and mandatory wardrobe. However, worth a visit if you still hang out and about at Vesterbro in the morning mist. Free your mind and your body will follow.
Enghave Kaffe
A motorcycle garage themed coffee shop, with a no lap top rule, which means you talk with your fellow coffee drinkers. A regular morning stop.
Enghave Smørrebrø
The next-door neighbour of the above. Same theme, but instead of coffee its beer and smørrebrød (Danish open sandwiches). A great lunch spot.
Jagger Fast Food
Michelin chefs who made a burger bar to make better burgers than Burger King but in the same price range.
Riga
A small outdoor wine bar only open in the summertime. Owned by the people who also do a stressfully trendy festival on a beach North of CPH, ‘Musik i Lejet.’ located on the square, Litauns Plads, hence the name.
Beat
A big record shop /coffee shop
Bevi Bevi/Osteria 16/Mercato
The italian trio on vesterbro. Bevi Bevi is a nice ‘enoteca’, that is ‘pub for wine’ at good prices. They also have nice apertivo dishes to share. Located on the same street as Riesen bar (yes, on the street with the long impossible name). Osteria 16 is a small and cosy anti pasti place with a cheap fixed menu decided on the day. Located on Haderslevgade 16. Mercato is an italian grocery shop on Enghave Plads with fresh organic produce and italian specialities flown in from the famous Ortomercato market in Milan.
Spagettherria (owned by the same guys as Osteria and mercato)
Cantina with a fixed menu and open until 2. Turns into quite the party at night. Be careful not to trip over all the woodwood jackets and Soulland hoodies.
Mangia
‘OMG!’, said the guy from Napoli! Owned by the guys from Bevi Bevi -best new Italian place in town. Also turns into a party until 2 — be there on a Friday. Don’t drink Aperol Spritz. Its not 2015. Go for the negroni and pretend all is ‘bene!’
Tove Hallerne
Is not its name, but something the locals call it. The name is Westmarket, and is a cheap and not-as-good copy of Torve Hallerne. It got its name ‘Tove hallerne’ by the locals because the location used to be a bankrupt mall called Toves Galleri named after a famous Vesterbro author, Tove Ditlevsen.
Absalon
An old church that has been altered into a culture house by the people behind the Flying Tiger shops. Here you drink cheap coffee, sodas, beers, play Ping-Pong or board games, do yoga. In the evenings they have a folkekøkken-styled restaurant where you sit together with 200 people and share whatever food the chef decided to make. It’s very very cheap and the food is very good. Come early, because the neighbourhood fills it up fast.
Kiin Kiin Bao Bao
The Nørrebro michelin restaurant Kiin Kiins little brother who focus on steamed bao buns.
1+1
Best chinese takeaway in CPH, they focus on street food and not deep fried shit. Located on Enghave Vej
Brød
An awesome bakery located on Enghave Plads from the people behind Kihosk.
Shopping
Motorius
A shop on Enghave Vej that sells cool biker(ish) clothes and spare parts for your motorcycle.
Istedgade and its side streets are always a treat if you’re out shopping: coffee shops, small boutiques and record stores. The hippest store in the northern hemisphere, Kyoto, is a must to check out. Pick out your finest sailor outfit.
The street of Værnedamsvej is also worth snooping into. On weekends it’s the place to go for brunch and people-spotting. Check out the French-style cafe Granola or wine bar Falernum.
Khioskh
The kiosk ‘Khioskh’ is an attraction. It has an insane amount of different types of beers. (Check out the basement). Pick out some fine samples, and sit on the lawn in front. For some reason, you’re not allowed to drink your purchased brew at their benches in-front of the kiosk, so you’re shown to the grass next to the benches like a dog, a brew dog. (Which is okay in the summer, more of a hassle in the winter.) If it’s windy, or, when it’s windy, which it always is, Danes are totally fine with you seeking shelter on their doorstep with your beer, so you can always find a spot in the sun away from the wind.
Kødbyen
The Meat District has numerous places for the modern mammal; gourmands, flaneurs and mixology. If you get there early, check out the galleries and have Copenhagen’s best pizza at Mother.
Warpigs bbq and brewery. The flagship of the Mikkeller micro brewery empire
Hija De Sanches, the former sous chef at Noma who now
makes awesome tacos.
Mesteren og Lærlingen (Master and Apprentice) is the designated place to try out your latest dance moves.
Partying until 5–6: Jolene’s and Bakken ( just becareful of pickpockets at the last place! But always some Italian exchange students to pick up, so you win some and lose some.)
Enghave Parken
The only park in Vesterbro, similar to English private inner city garden squares, but open for everybody.
Torvehallerne — The food court. Two buildings, stroll through the first one with coffee from Coffee Collective and collect tasters from Denmark’s finest marzipan and chocolate brands, Anthon Berg and Summerbird. Eat healthy salads and amazing cakes. Head over to the second building for some sushi or tapas, or get fresh meat, fish, seafood, lobsters and vegetables to cook at home. Also, make sure to get some fine Danish cherry wine.
Slurp
But of course Copenhagen has its own superb Ramen joint, startet by a former sou(p)-chef at restaurant Noma. (Every food entrepreneur in this city has started their career at this holy shrine.) Now in his early 20’s we wonder at what age they start child labouring at this celebrated restaurant. Slurp means slurp, and that’s what’s what you supposedly do while eating ramen, according to Ramen-connoisseurs, which this little joint has plenty of. And they’ll tell you. Yes it’s a small place, and has no toilet. If you have to, they’ll direct you two blocks up the street to Torvhallerne Food Court’s underground public toilet.
Wood Wood Museum — outlet for the überhip Danish clothing brand Wood Wood. Sometimes you’ll get good deals here.
Kalaset — Swedish cafe & bistro at the corner of Vendersgade and Nansensgade. A place for brunch.
Mikropolis, good cocktails and local beer on tap.
Funch Vinstue — (in)famous bodega. Closes late, or early, depending on your circadian rhythm.
Møllegade
Møllegade is Copenhagen’s ‘book street’. Do some intellectual window-shopping at Møllegade Boghandel or at Ark books, they’ve great selections and the staff gives excellent advice. Support these non-profit volunteer-run bookstores by investing in a book or two. LiteraturHaus, the city’s own literature house of culture offers exhibitions, debates, art talks, film screenings, workshops, seminars, reads, concerts and performances. Bring your new books to the café [superkaffeforsyningen] (with brackets) for coffee. They also serve breakfast and lunch all day, and have outdoor seating.
kartoffelrækkerne
Danes loves potatoes, so it can’t come as a big surprise they’ve named a neighbourhood built on a former potato field, the Potato Rows, which in the prosaic English language doesn’t give justice to its amazing, impenetrable, portmanteau name, k.a.r.t.o.f.f.e.l.r.æ.k.k.e.r.n.e. Just like when tasting grandma’s potato pie, these sweet lakeside houses, surrounded by scenic parks and lakes, and only a short walk from the city centre, makes a quick and mindful shift from hip urban tension to lazy rustic life. Yummy!
Aamanns Deli
Modern take on the Danish open sandwich, smørrebrød, the eatery and deli is situated between Søerne Lake and the Botaincal Garden. Perfect for quick lunch and a stroll.
Blågardsgade
Plenty of cosy bars to hide out in the street of Blågardsgade. Most of this street is pedestrian, so in the summer the café tables are all over. Very continental indeed. Kate’s Joint has good and reasonable dinners, their menu depends on the chef; Indian, Arabic, Malaysian, African. They also have a wide selection of vegetarian and vegan options. Cafe N in Blågårdsgade has cheap but decent vegan and vegetarian food. Kimia, same street, go there on Fridays, it turns into quite the 90’s hiphop-hooray party. No drugs, only joints.
More coffee and booze in the nearby streets of Nørrebrogade and Ravnsborggade. Bevars in Ravnsborggade is a delightful café to sit and work, drink wine, eat antipasto, drink more wine, listen to live jazz, drink more wine. At the corner of Elmegade and Guldbergsgade there’s an eco-soup kitchen and cocktail bar (the cocktails are probably eco too).
On warm summer nights, sit under the trees at one of the bars by Søerne lake. Or rent a Swan-boat, bring loads of rosé and pedal around the lake like a boss. It’s good lunch offers at the cafees by the lake, too.
Props
When at Nørrebro, one has to pop by the Props bar at Blågårdsgade 5, the local den of iniquity and one of the finest establishments in town. Across the street lies Harbo, also a nice bar and café. And on the corner to the square Blågårds Plads you’ll find Blågårds Apotek. Worth checking out is the square St. Hans Torv. Don’t know if any of the cafes at this piazza are any good, but you can always sit on the benches with an ice cream from Paradis is.
Mayhem
A small user operated venue showcasing music of experimental and noisy kind. Located in the outer rim of Nørrebro on the boarder to Østerbro and an semi abandoned lot formerly used by the local government to house the street maintenance machines (we think). The vibe is very similar to the old Ungdomshuset, which was pretty (in)famous at least localy. It’s the venue that gave birth to the new punk wave that spawned Iceage and that gang. Bring cash, because it’s punk.
Diligencen
A good mix of local drunkards and arty people on their way home from vernissages. They served potatochips straight from the bag. Authentic as fuck.
Shopping
This area is a good shopping district. Specifically Elmegade, where there also is an Acne Outlet. (Every Scandinavian city with ambitions has an Acne Outlet). A little further into the barrio of Nørrebro, in the old Hell Angles quarter at Jagerborggade, you’ll find cute small shops to buy clothes, cactus, caramel, shoes, organic hair cuts (whatever that is?) and the restaurants Relæ and Manfred (New Nordic Michelin-sprinkled restaurants). Jægersborggade is also lovely at Christmas, where the shops and stalls sell Eblegløgg (Apple Glühwein) with calvados. Around the corner in Stefansgade you’ll find Denmark’s most famous micro-hipster-brewery Mikkeller. It’s bar is not super cosy, but the beer is good, just tell the very competent bartenders what your into and they’ll find you the perfect match.
For arty books, tote bags and pamphlets, check out ARK Independent book store in Møllergade 10, and Møllegades Boghandel in Møllegade 8.
Månefiskeren at Christiania is cordial on Sundays to sit on the benches and chill in the sun. In winter remember to drink Glühwein. At Christmas time there’s a hippie fair next door on weekends.
Christiania Jazzclub
Same entrance as where the Greenlanders sell their spiced up cigarettes, and under the local opera. Jazz sessions on weekends with everything from old rusty heroes to young and aspiring students from the Copenhagen Music academy. It’s a David Lynch’ atmosphere: Hip music fans, elderly couples in their best clothes out on a dance, local Christiania hippies.
Eiffel Bar, local corner bar by the canal. Ask for the Tour Effel. Or don’t.
Copenhagen street food on Papriøen. Obviously best in summer, but a nice walk along the canal and harbour on a good autumn & winter day as well. As the Danes are clever city planners, there’s a new walking bridge connecting the inner city at Nyhavn and Papirøen. Very practical, indeed.
If you’re going to Amager beach park, stop by Ingolfs coffee bar on the way, the only really good place for coffee at Amager. They have really nice brunch and dinner and it’s a very cute little place, like everything else in Copehagen.
Islands brygge
Go for a dip, or jump in the sea (or harbour) followed up with plenty of beers at the pier on a good spring or summers evening. When the sun sets, everybody is here. You’ll make friends. I promise.
Cafe Intime. Yup.
ART:
Check Kopenhagen.dk for openings and exhibits. We’d really recommend their ‘3 picks’ for the week’s best openings. And, there’s always (almost) free beers and wine! Start your Friday night with a few openings, and end up at a bodega for some cheap beers and strange Danish pool. Yes, they have their own form of pool game. W don’t understand the game, but it’s the efficient way to make friends with Danes.
Always check out what’s on at Nikolaj Kunsthall — a former church, now a contemporary art gallery, in the city centre nikolajkunsthal.dk
Louisiana Museum.
One of the world’s most prominent modern art museums. And a great site by the sea in a cute seaside village 30 min train ride north of Copenhagen. The train ride is cute too. (In the kiosk at the Nørreport or Østerport train station one can purchase combo train ticket to Humlebæk village and entrance to the museum).
SMK — National gallery of Denmark. Their permanent exhibition of classical Nordic and European art is always free, and the contemporary exhibitions are often good, though a little pricey. Check out their monthly SMK Fridays for free entrance, performances, dj’s, food trucks and a lot more.
Kunsthal Charlottenborg — One of the biggest and most beautiful exhibition spaces for contemporary art. It’s located in an old Dutch baroque palace, that earlier was a part of the historic Charlottenborg castle. This has been a gallery for contemporary art since 1883. They also have a great bookstore, many events, talks etc. And great parties. Remember to put on your best wig!

If something new is happening in architecture and design today, Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, is one of the leaders in this direction. This Scandinavian country has produced many designers who made a big influence and created an environment for innovation.
The main purpose of my “design trip” was to see the creations of architect Bjark Ingels and his office,Olafur Eliasson bridge, the building of Rem Koolhaas and to attend the 3daysofdesign festival. I always try to see and study the designs that I like in person and share my experience with my students.
Sketch by Tazo Arunashvili
I’ll start with Olafur Eliasson, a Danish artist who started his career in architecture. This bridge is an example of the synthesis of sculpture and design, and Ólafur himself is an example of how a person in the process of self-expression can move from one profession to another (for example, from architecture to art) and be nourished by both.
Sketches and photos by Tazo
“Yes Is More” — Bjarke Ingels with this phrase is a part of the logical chain, which was put in front of us by Miss van der Rohem from Bauhaus with the phrase “Less Is More”. Bjarke impressed me with his productivity, hedonistic vision of sustainability, hard work, innovation in the Danish identity and crazy ideas. It was my second time seeing his works, but to better understand his vision and work I bought his book and went to his office. His company “BIG” unites about 700 designers and architects.
As for the design festival, the main focus of “3Daysofdesign” was the design of household accessories: lamps, furniture, interior decorations, new materials, introducing the principles of sustainable design… In total, about 500 events were held within the festival. Clearly, it was impossible to attend all of them.
Personally, I am very impressed by the continued relevance of perennial design companies at the expense of innovation and quality. In this case, the increase in innovation is “soft”, not sharp, and the cause of it is in caring about the environment with maintaining high quality.
This year’s slogan was impressive — ”Dare to Dream”.
Due to my profession, industrial design and its relative — architecture, which I grew up with, I think that it is a very effective means of self-expression of the country and era, came into the center of my attention.
There is active production of on water offices, the utilization of the surface of the year has been in the plan for a long time. Buildings floating on the surface of the water is one of the old ideas, Bjarke also has some conceptual ideas about it. And in Copenhagen, on a small scale, but they have already started to implement it and sell the entire container (ready-made block). The student works were also interesting, namely the chairs made of a material similar to wine corks. These chairs move and will especially appeal to those who are restless while sitting. Although it looks weak visually, it is designed for 200 kilograms and is actually very durable.
Focusing design on smart devices and green design is relevant. Hardware engineers actively collaborate with designers and create amazing lamps with excellent aesthetics and ease of use.
A very memorable conference was with the Swedish company IKEA and its designers, none of whom were Swedish. Italian, Cypriot, Indian and Argentinian designers combined their own southern vision with Scandinavian principles in synthesis. Today’s world is open, it is not locked in one country and nationality. Innovations are the result of a large intellectual chain.
In the Swedish pavilion, we found a tent furnished with all white IKEA bedroom furniture. We approached this whiteness cautiously, and to our surprise, it was announced this is the conference place, all surrounded with white beds, sheets and carpets, and we could sit/lay and drink coffee on it while listening to speakers.
While we were relaxing on our beds and listening, the following question was asked: “Does the world need another lamp?” — here opinions were divided into two. Consumer world and such unprecedented production the world does not remember, but do we need another one? In my opinion, yes we do. We don’t need another lamp of the same kind, but a different one… This is a leap from 0 to 1. Man is the only creature on earth who is not satisfied with existence and tries to improve it. Therefore, yes, we need another lamp that will be more user centric and at the same time in harmony with ecology.
For Danes, the main thing is the person, not the form, that’s what “user centric design” really is. Here the formalism is outdated and has little connection with the human happiness index (Denmark ranks second after Finland in the happiness index). Each chair, trash can, bottle, building and even lamp is adjusted to human happiness without harming the environment, being aesthetic and it is setting an example for others.

Every city has its unique character, tastes of the food, breath of the wind, peoples faces, streets. Of course, at the moment globalization made a huge step to make different cities close to each other, especially big ones. But a curious traveler still can find and feel the soul of such city like Copenhagen.
The first evening you mostly feel a cold wind, messing up your hair, you are surprised how locals are not frozen to ice and can wear just light sweaters, cycling around on the simple bicycles. Later, looking for a place to eat, you are surprised once more with high prices in every cafe and restaurant, even if the place looks like the simplest kebab take away. Especially this is hard for vegetarians. Ashamed to admit, but the very first evening we ended up buying some vegetables and water in the local supermarket and sitting in the hotel room with a good view. That was actually good.
Looking for a hotel, which can also have a high price, it’s better to look for a location, rather than hotel regalia. Even the simple Cabinn Scandinavia gives you a nice and cozy place to relax after the whole day of walking around. Each morning I feel replenished with energy by staying in such a calm and quiet place. In the morning you can walk around a local pond with a family of swans living in it.
One of the next days, while I was at the conference, my wife found a great place to eat. There is no surprise, that it is an Asian place called Wok On. Usual take away or sit and eat place with different woks, as usual, you can make your work by selecting components. But everything there just makes you finally relax, eat with great pleasure, sit there how much time you want, observing seagulls fighting for the food outside. Even in the center of Copenhagen, the wind is strong enough to carry seagull right over the cafe table in the street. The chef keeps preparing new dishes right in front of you, fastly operating 3 woks. To complete the impression, the waitress will ask you how was the food, and you understand that she means it, the question goes right from the heart.
Of course, there are plenty of other restaurants in the city for any kind of taste, with different cuisines, with Michelin stars. But such a simple kind of place helps you to feel the life around you and just talk with ones who you love. We talked about Andersen museum, located close to city hall. This museum has live illustrations of Andersen fairy tales. Keep your heart and soul open while walking there. You will have a chance to dive into the Andersen world. You will walk by the place where he wrote his tales, pass by a little girl trying to warm up herself with matches, on the other side you will see naked king, seeing his dressed image in a mirror. Sometimes what you see there makes you shivering of fear. It gives you a good impression of how the world of those times looked like. Or should I say, how the world of Andersen’s mind looked like? You to decide.
When I was in the airplane on my way to Copenhagen, I found an article about local street food market, popular here. So the next day after arrival to went there to see and try what’s it like. The market is called Reffen and it works every day. In the mornings it will be almost empty, but later after 12 am more and more people park their bicycles near the market entry. Location is somewhat unexpected from the beginning, it’s part of the port, filled with used steel sea containers, which were re-worked into cafes, food trucks. The majority of cafes there are dedicated to the Mexican cuisine or street barbeque, some Asian places and just one or two places with famous local smorbreads. Smorbread is actually just a piece of bread with something atop of it. But the variety of different options of it, look and tastes surprises you. The other good option to try it — market called Foodhalken, very close to Norreport subway station.
We tried several dishes from food trucks and just sat for hours looking to the sea harbor. Actually, not just this. Reffen is also a place for extreme amusements, like banjo jumping from a crane! Every ten minutes crane lifts up a basket with instructor and jumper. When on the top, the crane will turn jib to keep the basket right above the sea and… loud scream will notify everyone that another thrill seeker felt from the height. One of them actually took a dip and get back with wet hair!
Close to the evening, we visited a workshop held in the local coffee roastery. Here I need to admit the Copenhagen has kind of a good taste to coffee, roasteries, and traditions in it. Man in Reffen Roastery described in tiny details process of the coffee roastery, showed us a machine for it and nicely answered all the questions. I can say that all the time I spent there was filled with love to coffee and this tradition. By the way, I was told that at that very moment bosses of roastery were in South America in the coffee plantation!
I need to say, that it’s not the one single place with a good coffee in this city. Copenhagen has a culture of the coffee roastery and brewery. One of the famous coffee beverages here is coffee Cortado, which might not be so famous in Eastern Europe for instance. More like cappuccino, but with less milk and more passion. Another tasty coffee can be also found in the already mentioned Foodhalken market. This place is not famous among tourists, local people also visit it a lot, we’ve seen several families with kids.
Speaking about locals, sometimes I got a feeling that even with all the European comfort and pleasure of living, life here is not something absolutely easy. Conferences small talks revealed to me high taxes here, especially taxes to buy a new car, which can triple the car price. One person exposed the opinion, that most of the locals use bicycles not because they care about the environment, they simply don’t have another choice.
As a big city, Copenhagen has own kind of nightlife. Or I would say — evening life. A lot of restaurants and coffee places are getting closed around 6–7 pm, except some chain cafes like Espresso House which can prepare a cup of Cortado even at 9pm. And people gather around pubs and bars, which are presented in a big variety of choices here. Walking in the evening streets gives you a view of the younger generation drinking and hanging out. If your choice is to jump into a small cozy basement pub, you might have a chance to observe the performance of an old jazz band with the even older audience sitting around with a beer. The music touches your heart, but still, you notice also a little touch of sadness. Which keeps growing in your mind while you see homeless people and other difficulties of locals who live in the old city with plenty of modern European issues.
Needless to say, a lot of locals are in fact from other countries. That’s pretty common for most parts of Europe nowadays, Denmark is not an exception. I talked to street juice seller, he asked me if I want ice in juice. Of course not, it already cold outside, you practically feel freezing breath of the arctic ocean. He agreed and told me that it’s much colder than in his native Poland.
Having so big diversity turns the city into a very adaptable organism. For instance, we checked several Thai food restaurants and no one had Tom Yum Soup. I asked why in one place, and the answer was — we have it, but the name is different. No one here would understand what is Tom Yum Soup, but most people would try Spicy Lemongrass Soup. Such details make you think more and more about globalization and merging of different culturies into something bigger. I don’t know is it good or bad, it is what it is. But as an outcome, we can find a very beautiful shop with stones, sculptures of Budha, figures of Indian gods and plenty of other stuff from Asia, which wakes up some sleeping inner strength of your soul. When I did a research on the internet for such things in Copenhagen — nothing. The city will lead you to a place which you actually want to find, even if you don’t know yet. The only thing you need to do — relax and try to hear it, to feel it.
There are other places for any kind of choices, which I cannot describe just in a couple of pages, but I will mention a couple of things which took my attention for a bit. There is a pipe shop for those who interesting in traditional smoking. It is more than 50 years old and is run by several generations of a single family. There are several lego shops, which a little bit different from each other. Of course, you will say, any city would have a lego shop. But this city is a place where lego was born, which makes it a good souvenir with a meaning.
Every city is unique, and Copenhagen is not an exception. It gives you feeling of something very historical, but with thoughtful modernization, something very old and battered, but also turning maybe a new page of its life book. They have little space but use it with a perfect sense. A cheap hotel room can be thought out to every little detail and you will feel like at home on a rainy day, warm inside. I think their houses and apartments are even better in this meaning, just visit any fo furniture and home stuff store to see it. No one other country has so nice and so many shops for home comfort. And Denmark also has something called hygge, which to my understanding is a mix of what I told. But I left it to you to find out.

I’m from Brazil and I’ve been living in Copenhagen for 2 years. In Brazil we have more than 2000 freshwater fish species, but Pike isn’t one of them and I’ve always wanted to catch big Pike, after watching on TV how violent this fish is.
Looking for Pike in a lake in the middle of the city (Valby, Copenhagen)
I live 3 km away from an urban lake, so it was the first lake I wanted to try fishing in Denmark. Last year, in 2019, I went there 2 times in the summer and didn’t catch anything, and I considered the lake just dead water.
I wanted to give the lake another try in the summer this year, one year after my last trip to it. It was a Saturday in August and I was immediately greeted by a small pike, caught in a small weightless spinner (known in Brazil as “varejeira”) rigged with a bombarda (a kind of float with weight). My first pike ever! I finally crossed this specie off of my list. But still, far away from the big pikes that I saw on TV. Anyway, on this same day, I ended up catching more than 50 small pikes. It was basically one pike per cast!
The next day, Sunday, I got there after lunch and ended up catching dozens of small pikes and even small perches. I decided to move around the lake, until at 18:00, my friend Ricardo cast a small spinner and hooked a big one, which immediately got off the hook, due to how small the lure was. He agreed on me throwing my big wobbler right where he lost the pike and finally, I hooked the big one!
In my mind, it was huge, because I was used to hooking only tiny pikes! Five minutes afterwards, I cast close to where I caught the big one and I hooked one which appeared to be twice bigger than the previous one! Spot on! I finally found the one I was looking for! Even the previous pike could now be considered “small” compared to this one!
Going Bigger
Afterwards, I went there almost on a daily basis after work and hooked medium to big pikes constantly. I even got a reasonably sized one in an ultralight set with 0.08mm braided line (thin as a hair).
One day I decided to try a “pen toy rod” that I bought from China for only US$ 3 and I hooked a lot of small pikes.
Suddenly, I saw a wave nearby, and it was the biggest pike I’ve ever seem. It was just taking a look at the small pikes that I was releasing, in a place where it’s probably 15 to 20cm deep. I switched to my bait casting set and a bigger lure. Unfortunately it ignored all my casts. I switched more than 10 different lures, until I got it… but my fluorocarbon leader was only 0.35mm and it cut the line. I was hectic. I quickly tied another leader (still 0.35mm) and put a 16cm lure, and then I cast in parallel to the shallow area where the pike was. Unfortunately it was gone, it was a sad 5 minutes for me. Anyway, I decided to keep casting the 16cm lure parallel to the shallow surface, until suddenly, I hooked it! After fighting it, I managed to bring it out of the water!
A very long but thin pike. The head itself was bigger than 25cm. My record pike so far! And to think that it all started with the toy rod that day.
Halloween Night Pike Fishing (Going even Bigger)
As a Halloween challenge, I made my own Halloween pike lure and I went night pike fishing at the same lake! The night delivered 3 big pikes, all above 100 cm, where one of them was a BIG FAT MAMA (big curved belly when you hold it), my biggest and heaviest pike, and I wonder if this one is the biggest in that lake? I ended up getting one with my custom lure and 2 with a Danish lure made especially for pikes.
I can now identify the pikes from my local lake from their patterns and from their scars, and I even started calling them by name, because I caught some of the pikes more than once the past 3 months, that’s also the magic and emotion of catch and release! For me, it’s a very happy moment to release the fish and see it swimming back!
Never underestimate your backyard lake!

It only takes me about four days in Copenhagen before I start Googling “Copenhagen apartments for rent” and “Can Americans buy property in Denmark?”. I love how easy it is to walk everywhere, how stylish it is, how friendly the people are, and (of course) how delicious the food is. We planned our trip to Europe around dinner at Noma. While Noma was worth the pilgrimage, it was far from the only good meal of our trip. Here’s my recap of our Copenhagen dining adventures.

The story sounds familiar: A utopian city where the streets are clean, traffic is orderly, and the people are tall, beautiful, and calm. It’s the stuff science fiction novels are made of…
I didn’t have many expectations for each city that we visited during this trip but I had some thoughts going to Copenhagen.
Some quick backstory:
I’ve grown up to with the American work ethic of the “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” kind. So to come to a country where socialism plays an important part of the governing system, it immediately brought thoughts of lazy dependence on an overtaxed government from beatnik no-doers. I should say that most of my understanding of socialism spews from good ‘ole propaganda-filled American public education. It has led me to believe that socialism is THE anti-American way of living and is often told much like a scary bedtime story to caution wayward capitalist children about the tyranny of the Soviet Union. 👻
In reality, Denmark is not a socialist state but rather it upholds a socialist democratic practice. The objective is not for the state to own the means of production but rather it refers to a political philosophy that supports economic and social policies that promote social justice in a capitalist economy in a democratic way. Most people see this through the way they govern a tax-financed health care service. (Universal healthcare 🚑) Others might refer to it as a social welfare country due to its extensive services for children, the elderly and the poor. Denmark also provides special provisions for universal education, support for unions or collective bargaining, and sensible (ostensibly) government regulation of industry to preserve the environment and health and welfare of people within the jurisdiction of the country. Either way you spin it, the country operates with private and publicly run businesses and Copenhagen is considered to be one of the top ranked best city in the world for standard of living. So with that in mind, I came to Copenhagen with a lot of curiosity for the way everything worked and operated.
Here’s a breakdown of our trip to Copenhagen:
We arrived in the late afternoon of our first day. CPH was quite nice and fairly large. Having flown a lot domestically within the US, it was a night/day comparison to see a privately-owned airport. (As compared to the airports owned by the government much like the Port Authority NY/NJ) Even the bus lines are privately owned in Copenhagen and I was mostly impressed by the clear signage, cleanliness, and on-time reliability.
We decided to purchase the 72-hour CityPass ticket to get around on public transit since it encompassed the entirety of our stay in Copenhagen. (We got in late our first day and left at noon on our last for a total of three days.) Public transit is a bit pricey here. A one-way ticket throughout the 3-zones that the city encompasses is $36 DK or $5.39 USD. So to purchase their $200 DK 72-hour card, it only cost about $30 USD for three days. We didn’t rent bikes this time around but rather walked. If I return again, I would rent a bike for the entirety of our stay since the city was very bike friendly and central to most points of interest.
Our Airbnb was conveniently located just a few blocks from the Nørrebro Station. Thom and I really enjoyed our stay there. Our guests were very welcoming and the apartment was very comfortable. If you follow me on any other social media, then you’d know that I’ve already posted a short video of our stay.
A lot of the time making this video was spent find creative ways to shoot still video without a tripod though. 😝
The location of our Airbnb was absolutely great! Again, we were very close to public transit but also a short walk away from The Lakes, Copenhagen’s Botanical Gardens and parks, grocery stores, and the famous Torvehallerne.
On our first evening, we walked over the Lakes and ate at Thai Pan. I’ll admit that food is a bit pricey in Copenhagen in general, but this restaurant had a great three-course menu that provided us with a lot of leftovers for the next day. They make a super tasty coconut soup with chicken and mushrooms. That alone was well-worth the price and trip!
Also that first night, I received the best email that I could ever imagine:
Noma has an open spot for you and one other to dine on the following day. Would we care to join?
WOULD WE CARE TO JOIN??!! WOULD WE EVER!
I think that I’ll save that experience for it’s own special post since the meal was over 3.5 hours long and consisted of 14 courses and a tour of the kitchen and grounds. Long story short:
It. was. amazing. 😍
The other two days we spent walking around site-seeing. We visited:
One place that we did not have time to see was Tivoli Gardens. I still don’t know if I regret this or if this was something to easy miss. I haven’t been to a theme park since my short visit to Disney World over three years ago. The idea of long lines, large crowds, and rollercoasters just doesn’t appeal like it used to when I was 14. But Tivoli is one of the world’s oldest theme parks and has some beautiful gardens. If I had the chance again, I think that I would go to see and visit the grounds alone.
Here are some shots from our stay in Copenhagen:
Some shots around Christiania. You aren’t allowed to photograph some parts within the free state:
Out and about Copenhagen, including: The Lakes, Botanical Gardens, and Nyhavn:
And that was it! An overall great impression of the city. What really stuck out to me was the overall infrastructure of the city and how well maintained it is. I enjoyed the serenity found in the heart of the city and loved the fact that people were out and about strolling in the parks or by the Lakes late into the evenings. My only criticism is the near-perfect state of everything. There weren’t any brash forms of expression of any kind whether through the city itself or it’s people. It’s of no surprise that a place like Christiania had established it self so long ago. It acts as the only visual protest of all the conformity found throughout the rest of Copenhagen. Even staying in the multicultural Nørrebro neighborhood, I felt that there was a tragic loss of diversity, especially compared to places like Berlin and Amsterdam. (SO many blonde-haired, blue-eyed people everywhere in Copenhagen!)
It’s truly a give and take with this city with this ultimately in mind: High prices for a better standard of living.
My last take: Not to live in, but I would visit again.
This post is a part of a series based on my recent two-week trip to Europe.

In June, the Civic Commons Learning Network in partnership with the Better Block Foundation hosted Civic Commons Learning Journey: Copenhagen, a four-day study trip that immersed learning network members in the public life, policy and culture of the city. Through explorations of the city by bike and frank conversations with local leaders on the work they are pursuing, we considered how the city is building and sustaining public assets that deliver more public value. On our final day in Copenhagen, we hosted a workshop session to distill learning from the two dozen participants representing Akron, Detroit and Philadelphia.
Here are 10 key lessons from the trip:
Copenhagen is known as being one of the most liveable cities in the world. But it wasn’t always this way. In the early ’90s, the city faced bankruptcy. Seeing a bleak future, the leaders of the city came together to create several strategies for change. One of these was to focus on pilot projects. The city began to expand and scale pedestrian street conversions originally built in the 1960s and parking lots that, in the 1980s, had been transformed into public squares. The goal was to create visible changes quickly that would encourage the citizens to come together. Just as important as the pilot projects was following up with permanent investments when the pilots proved successful.
In the ’60s, many cities around the world expanded their freeway infrastructure by building elevated highways. But when this idea was proposed in Copenhagen people protested. In the ’90s, when the city was nearing bankruptcy and had little money to invest, it put the money where it could be stretched — toward bicycling infrastructure.
Copenhagenize, which highlights cycling life in Copenhagen, said that because infrastructure investments of the ’60s and ’90s made it easier to bike, more people started biking. In fact, now 56 percent of Copenhageners use a bike every day. By making bicycling the most convenient option, and by keeping the cycling infrastructure simple and legible, Copenhagen has made biking the easiest, fastest and cheapest mode of transportation. “Copenhageners are just as lazy as you are,” said Morten Kabell, COO of Copenhagenize. “Fifty percent of us only ride a bicycle because the city of Copenhagen has made it fast and easy.”
In Denmark, design is everything. Every single element of every single space has been designed with the user in mind. One small example: trash cans. Each trash can has a lip on the outside for cans and glass. This way, it’s easier for people who need those items to grab them for recycling.
The city has also found ways to maximize its spaces by taking down the fences and designing areas to support a wide variety of activities. An example: a large courtyard next to a marketplace that serves as both a schoolyard playground and common space with a basketball court. During lunch, multiple worlds collide in one cohesive space. And in terms of policy, the city is redesigning all of its schoolyards to be fenceless so they are open and welcoming to the community.
We ended our trip at Gehl Architects, where Mayra Madriz talked through the firm’s approach to building cities, highlighting the importance of design. “Consider urban life before urban space and urban space before buildings,” Mayra said.
Copenhagen’s architecture policy promotes a people-first approach. Chief City Architect Tina Saaby holds position of influence, advising politicians and city administrators alike. When a development proposal crosses her desk, her first question is, “Who is the landscape architect?” She recognizes that the space between buildings is where public life either thrives or fails to thrive.
When a crisis faces Copenhagen, the city’s response often comes in the form of investments in public life. While bankruptcy spurred some of the best bike infrastructure in the world, climate change catalyzed the concept of cloud burst parks. This network of green public spaces mitigates flooding by holding and filtering excess water. They also serve as a natural playscape.
For significant neighborhood-wide investments, the project managers from the city’s urban planning department don’t do their jobs from city hall or in an administrative building downtown. Instead, they work in the neighborhood’s culture house. For example, Eva Christensen and Sia Boensen, project managers in the neighborhood of Nørrebro, lead a diverse team of architects, planners and social scientists who will be based in the community for six years. Their mission involves co-creating a set of projects. Together with neighbors, they’ll reimagine Hans Tavsens Park as a cloud burst park that combines stormwater management with recreation, complete neighborhood-wide transportation planning and develop safe streets. But the city and the planning team see their work as much more than capital projects. The team is also interested in understanding existing social networks and the exploring the connecting between infrastructure investments and building social capital.
Whimsy. That was the one word that kept coming to mind when visiting the various parks and public spaces throughout Copenhagen. Trampolines embedded in sidewalks are just the start. Each park was unique, playful and a reflection of the neighborhood that surrounded it. For example, Monstrum, a playground design company, created the Crooked Houses in the Brumbley neighborhood. The houses can be climbed in and on, slid down and crawled between. They are a near-identical reflection of the neighborhood homes, yet slightly topsy-turvy.
But the parks in Copenhagen aren’t just about kids. They allow for unexpected moments of joy, relaxation and, in some cases, the thrill of fear for all ages. At Folkets Park, for example, a bridge was designed that wasn’t reflective of the community’s needs, so a new designer transformed the bridge into a parkour course. The bridge has self-moderating aspects (such as a second step that is too high for most children to make) to keep it safe while still allowing for a thrill. And many parks offer cafe kiosks for adults to buy a coffee and chat with a friend or a stranger.
From Torvehallerne to Reffen by Copenhagen Street Food, there is no shortage of great food markets in Copenhagen. These sites are serving as on-ramps for entrepreneurs to test their products. They make it easier for vendors to focus on their products, while providing shared services like bathrooms, seating, trash, permitting and marketing. They also happen to be public spaces capable of attracting people from every background, if they keep an eye on price points to ensure they remain welcoming to all. Reffen’s founder, Dan Husted, has proven his concept once before with a temporary food court that gained acclaim. He hopes to do the same with this new concept in a forgotten area. “We decide the primary colors, then we invite the public to paint the canvas,” he says.
Jacob Hartmann is an instigator turned city bureaucrat, and his Sharing Copenhagen mini-grants capture a spirit of “yes” in a way not often seen in municipal government. The grants are tied to the vision for the city and allow everyday citizens to test new ideas for change, from a floating sauna to a pop-up farm to a program that encourages hitchhiking. And when the easy answer is “no,” we can’t allow for that, he works with urban innovators to get to “maybe” — and sometimes asks for permission later. From inside city government, he has developed a program that fosters active citizen engagement in making the city more sustainable, and more fun.
Nearly every city has them: natural features that were once polluted and still carry the stigma of being dirty and unsafe. Just 15 years ago, the water in Copenhagen’s harbour was so polluted that it posed a health risk. Alongside unsexy municipal efforts to make the waters clean, like wastewater treatment plants and a modernized sewage system, the city also made public space investments like the harbour baths, parks and pathways along the water that have drastically changed the use and narrative of this waterfront. Now harbour baths are packed on warm summer days, a bicycle chef uses a harbourside spot as his homebase and a maritime education center cultivates oysters and mussels in the urban waterways.
There are many reasons Copenhagen is studied, imitated and beloved. The bicycling infrastructure alone makes it something to strive for. However, the city is not perfect. No city is. While we experienced many beautiful examples of infrastructure, public space and collaboration in Copenhagen, we were jarred by the discussion of race, immigration and who truly belonged. Or, perhaps, by the lack of discussion. In some of our conversations and experiences in the city, multiculturalism was characterized as a burden, rather than a value. This article offers context for what we witnessed.
It was a stark reminder of why Reimagining the Civic Commons holds socioeconomic mixing as a goal for public space investments. Bringing people of all backgrounds to share in public life and build trust will not happen without intention.
We realized that, while we went to Copenhagen to study and be inspired, our demonstrations cities are inspirational, too. Through their approach to revitalizing and connecting public assets, they are setting a new standard for advancing civic engagement and “creating the welcome.” This realization reflects the value of learning journeys: they create moments for team members to experience, to learn, and to reflect on our shared work with a fresh perspective.

Back in 2014, the news in Copenhagen was that the modal share bikes exploded between 2012 and 2013, from 36% to 45%. A whopping 9% increase in people arriving at a destination in the City of Copenhagen for work or education. That had never happened anywhere before. At the same time, the modal share for motorists fell from 27% to 23%.
We were in the midst of one of the greatest urban transport experiments in the world, and didn’t really realise it.
For years I’ve espoused the benefits of following the simple traffic planning guide at the top of this article. Prioritise the three, inherently inter-modal transport forms on the left — bikes, pedestrians and public transport — and make driving a car a pain the ass. Make it the slower option, make it more expensive and difficult, and you’re on your way to a bright transport future. I call it A2Bism. It’s what every human who has ever lived wants the most: to go quick from A to B. Humans are like rivers — we’ll always seek out the quickest route.
So what happened between 2012 and 2013 in Copenhagen? The City made it a pain in the ass to drive a car. Not on purpose, mind you. The construction of a new Metro line, with 17 stations, was underway and, in a glorious coincidence of bad municipal communication, the city also dug up streets to upgrade the pipes for our district heating. The city was one big squiggly line — primarily for cars. In biannual surveys since the 1990s, a continuous majority of Copenhageners have declared that their primary reason for riding a bike is the fact that it’s the quickest way from A2B. The City inadvertently enabled them to go to the next level, at the expense of car traffic.
Fast-forward to late 2019. The new Metro ring line has just opened. The contstruction hoarding has been removed and roads are returning to how they were before the work began. This great urban experiment is going to go one of two ways. Either the City learns from it and keeps that squiggly line or we just return to the car-centric status quo we started with.
I’ve never been a fan of the Metro expansion. A city this size doesn’t need a metro — it needs tramways like so many other cities in Europe. I don’t advocate shoving citizens underground. They should be on street level on foot, on bicycle and in trams. My colleagues around Europe basically point and laugh when I tell them that we have bus routes with 50,000 passengers a day and the City ISN’T building tramways. The main problem in Copenhagen is that we have so much money and we have delusions of grandeur.
But hey. I guess I didn’t succeed in talking the city out of building the metro expansion. The new M3 line doesn’t go anywhere new. It just spins around in a circle and goes to places that have been easily accessible by bike for over a century. The Metro has been falsely advertising travel times for years. Advertising station to station, but not the first and last mile to and from the station. I sent out a team a few years ago to map travel times using real world scenarios and — no surprise — the bike usually beats the Metro in Copenhagen.
There are more great statistics from the glorious period of 2012–2013. The average bike trip length in Copenhagen rose 35% from 3.2 km to 4.2 km between 2012 and 2013. That means that the oft-quoted statistic about how Copenhageners cycle 1.2 million km a day needed to be upgraded to 2,006,313 km per day.
When the results of the travel survey came out back in 2014, journalists were scrambling for answers. Two researchers at DTU were “surprised”. They were quoted in the Danish press as saying things like, “uh… the City’s new bridges and traffic calming on certain streets seem to have worked. Giving cyclists carrots encourage cycling.”
The detail they forgot was that the new cycling bridges weren’t finished yet, nor was the traffic calming on Amagerbrogade. The Nørrebrogade stretch is from 2008. Cycling rose on that street by 15% but that was BEFORE 2012. Duh. Basically, there hadn’t been much carrot dangling in this city for a few years. So forget about THAT hastily thunk up theory.
It was simply a combination of construction sites and district heating pipes being upgraded. It was a fantastic urban experiment.
In the original feasibility study for the new M3 line, I found an alarming statistic buried in the document. It was estimated that cycling levels in the city would drop by 2.8% after the completion of the new line. Then we saw that fantastic, unexpected rise of 9% between 2012 and 2013.
Can we now expect a drop in the modal share for bikes of 12% in Copenhagen? Perhaps. You read it here first.
Unless, of course, the City of Copenhagen has the cajones to embrace this experiment and use it to finally make The Leap — as described by author Chris Turner — into the future of our city. Expanding and widening the cycle tracks. Reallocating space from falling car traffic to bicycles and public transport. The new BRT route in Copenhagen is a good step. Let’s see how much farther we can go. Designing cities instead of engineering them.
They can listen to me or they can just listen to the simple logic of children.
The citizens have shown us that they will be on our side if we do the right thing.
Otherwise, this rich petri dish experiment will just rot and be forgotten.

Copenhagen is the best of Europe distilled into one city, the continent at its most perfect.
From the airport, we take the metro, a clean, modern train, glass-walled to let in the pale sunlight. The airport was like this too, not the gray, military aesthetic of Reykjavik where we had a layover, but a space with curves and glass and white paint.
The ride reminds me that I’m back in Europe. Well-dressed people in coats and scarves and shoes that click against the ground step on and off. The train moves with an almost silent whir down tracks that look new but must be at least a century old. Outside, red-brick houses flash by that make me think of England: the same gabled, tiled roofs, the same compactness.
Our hostel is in the Nørrebro district, at the end of a long, connected row of 19th century red-brick buildings. On the way, we pass falafel and shawarma places, cool, dark bars in tiny storefronts, and well-lit cafes where people work on laptops. There’s at least one bike shop on every street so far, and special bike lanes separated from the road where the cyclists breeze by with enviable nonchalance.
The hostel is simultaneously hip and cozy: long wooden tables, old, circular metal lamps shining dark yellow light, and a bar that sells both coffee and beer. Large windows look out onto the quiet street, where a row of parked bikes points down to a 19th century building, mostly brick but renovated to include a glass elevator, and a church on the adjacent block looming against the gray sky.
We check in with the receptionist, who like everyone here looks at once elegant and casual, with blonde hair in a ponytail and the sleeves of her gray sweater rolled up to reveal forearm tattoos. Our room is in a separate building, and we get there by following a trail of sheep painted onto the sidewalk.
Out primal need is sleep, but after washing up, we head out to find food. Yelp suggests a “toast bar” which proves to be excellent, with dark, rich coffee and sandwiches smothered in various melted cheeses. The barista is a guy with a beanie, a beard, and tattoos who talks in a loud, echoing voice and looks like he runs a bike shop part-time. There are a few others in the cafe, but two are on laptops and the other two are a couple who aren’t talking, which gives the room a strange silence. We sit at the window, where a candle drips white wax onto the counter. Outside, bundled up pedestrians walk small dogs. In the building facing us, a guy stands at the window, having an intense cell-phone conversation. Across the street is another cafe, with a black exterior, a dark interior, and a small chalkboard sign advertising pricey lunch specials. To the left is a park with a modernist sculpture of twisted metal bars and a brick apartment building with the words “FREE GAZA” written in large, white block letters.
At one point, the two women working on their laptops go outside to smoke. They leave their jackets inside and stand huddled in their sweaters, breathing out a mix of smoke and cold breath.
From there, we walk down to what I at first think is a river or a canal but later learn is an artificial lake, created back in the Middle Ages. Across the water, the houses have that grand, 19th century look: mansard roofs, symmetrical windows, brick and stucco painted various shades of red and white. They go on endlessly down the bank and remind me of Budapest, but with warmer colors. People walk dogs and linger along the grass and feed the swans. A couple sits on a bench, talking about sex in Danish-accented and perfectly articulate English. I notice that everyone in Copenhagen is as young as we are, as if the city exists only for millennials. Los Angeles by contrast always feels slightly older, a city for tired people in their late thirties and early forties.
We cross the lake at a large embankment, along a pedestrian path separated from the busy street by trees and manicured shrubbery and past a large white pavilion, late 19th or early 20th century, situated along the water. On the other side of the lake, the street becomes H.C. Andersens Boulevard, and the buildings are bigger are more varied. Across the street is a brick building that’s an unfortunate mix of architectural styles — a neo-Gothic crenelated tower centered between two large, gabled roofs, like an orphanage from a Dickens’ novel, 19th century kitsch — and beyond it rise the flat roofs of the 20th century and the shining glass walls of the 21st. We walk leisurely down the sidewalk in these buildings’ shadows while everything breezes by us, the bikes and the cars and the pedestrians walking briskly in coats and scarves, all moving with a comforting urban indifference.
Traffic here is the densest we’ve seen in Denmark, as busy as Wilshire or Santa Monica Boulevard. Somehow, though, it all seems more orderly, less chaotic, as if like everything else here, it too is better regulated.
#
In the center of the city and across from the train station sits Tivoli Gardens, an 1840s-era amusement park supposedly built to distract the country’s population from protesting the absolute monarchy, now bedecked with Christmas lights and related items: trees, gnomes, snowmen, a building lined with several austere Nutcrackers, a wooden reindeer that looks like a Trojan Horse, a strange mirrored wall mounted with polar bear heads wearing Santa hats. There are lots of children about, and the adults are mostly mothers in groups pushing strollers, or young couples enjoying the kitsch. The park is like Disneyland, and was in fact one of the inspirations, though it’s smaller and quainter and less corporate. There are different sections corresponding to regions of the world — some pagodas representing either China or Japan, domed mosques for the Middle East or India, a lighthouse and a pirate ship possibly signifying Europe. It’s only vaguely and benignly racist, and nothing out of the ordinary for the 19th century. Bronze statues from that era are sprinkled throughout the park, including one of the founder, Georg Carstensen, looking proud and dapper with his mustache and top hat.
We stroll leisurely through the crowds, past food stands and stores selling magnets and memorabilia. I buy a glogg, which tastes pleasantly warm on a day this cold, though the best part is getting to recycle the plastic cup in one of the futuristic red kiosks, which lowers my cup down into the void with a mechanical whir and then gives me back 5 kroner. It’s an extremely practical and efficient solution to incentivize recycling, which is probably why the United States would never use it.
In the middle of the park we find an octagonal glass theater, a replica of one built in the late 1800s, which Nazi sympathizers burned down in the 1940s. Out beyond the walls of Tivoli, meanwhile, rises city hall, red brick towers capped with green spires, built in the early 20th century but speaking much more of the 1600s.
In this moment, I feel very close to the past. Like the crenelations on city hall, it feels like a ring surrounding us. Take away the phones and the electric lights and make the coats longer and give everyone top hats and we might as well be in the 1800s when the park first opened. Take away the park and give everyone ruffled collars and we’d be in the 1600s. Only 600 years before that, and we’d all be Vikings in huts.
#
The National Gallery, or the Statens Museum for Kunst, is across the city, though still within walking distance. It’s colder now, so we pull our scarves tighter as we walk down the empty streets. Soon we reach the white stone of Christiansborg Palace, and across the canal from it, along Nybrogade, a row of picturesque 17th and 18th century houses, narrow and built against each other, painted red and white and dark-brown. The sunset above streaks the sky with wisps of purple and brings out the color of each building. Even the yellow construction crane is more vivid and seems a remnant of past centuries.
We reach a small bridge and cross it into a Christmas market selling gnome statues and wooden souvenirs, and food of course. I smell sausages and see mushrooms simmering in a vat of butter. Behind me, the sun dips behind two rows of houses on opposite sides of a canal, and paints the whole scene, including a distant bronze statue, in a cold, yellow light — a sunset-hued cityscape, postcard-perfect, on all sides colors like an artist’s palette.
The city darkens as we move across it, past contemporary shops and dark streets and cyclists. It’s only 4:00, but it feels much later. A languor settles over us, and I remember our lack of sleep.
We reach Rosenborg Slot, Christian IV’s 17th century palace, and we walk across the park behind it, down a path lined with trees whose bare branches meet overhead. The castle looks romantically sinister silhouetted through the trees, but also small, “like a toy castle” K______ says, especially next to the block-long 19th century houses stretching down the parallel street. The park and the castle remind me of Oxford — a small patch of the past preserved despite the various encroaching presents pushing in from all around.
Just past the park is the museum, a grand, 19th century building reminiscent of museums from Britain, built to reflect the glory of the nation, or whatever. We’re both tired and cold, but on the walk up the large steps I feel exhilaration.
Inside, we find familiar European art. There’s a Titian portrait of a gentleman staring thoughtfully off to the left, a painting by a follower of Bosch of tiny figures against a bleak brown landscape, and quite a few Lucas Cranachs — various women with big heads and weird chins, and one work titled Melancholy depicting three oddly shaped infants trying to push a stone ball through a hoop with sticks while a winged woman watches them wistfully and several witches ride goats in a distant corner. But the highlights of the museum are the Danish pieces, a tour through one of the lesser known traditions of European art. In the first room are portraits of Danish royals from the 17th century and 18th century, all painted by the same Swedish-born court painter, C.G. Pilo, and opposite them, portraits of the bourgeoisie by Jens Juel, the most prominent one of an odd-looking middle-class family standing before a plantation. The room’s juxtaposition is perfect, ingeniously displaying the fundamental change of the 18th century, the rise and triumph of the bourgeoisie in all their awkward glory.
The next room has allegorical and historical paintings, and the following room works from the Romantic Era inspired by Caspar David Friedrich. A late-19th century room has some vaguely orientalist paintings of reclining women by Elisabeth Baumann and a wonderful work by Carl Bloch, of a man and two women eating dinner at a table and staring in surprise back at the viewer, their wine carafes tellingly half-empty, a guilty look on the man’s face. I assume his wife must be the viewer, having just caught him in the early stages of what might have become a threesome.
There’s also a beautiful late-19th century piece by J.F. Willumsen, titled En bjergbestigerske (A Mountain Climber), of a woman in a white sweater standing in front of a mountain, her walking stick leaning casually behind her, her cloak hanging lightly off her shoulders, and her hip thrust to the side as she looks boldly into the distance. According to the plaque, Willumsen’s artistic movement was called vitalism, and vitality is exactly what the woman gives off. She is more alive than the inert, distant mountains, a triumph of humanity over nature, her fierce stare made bolder by the vaguely impressionistic style of the piece, the soft colors and the murky brush strokes.
Finally, there’s a room of paintings by Vilhelm Hammershøi: cold, melancholy portraits of empty artist’s studios and solitary women, like sad Vermeers. Everything is cast over in a gray-blue pallor, all bleak, forlorn — how appropriate for the dawn of the 20th century.
We leave around 6:00 PM, very tired now, and buy falafel and shawarma from near our apartment. We eat in the hostel common room, quickly, not talking, plastic bags and foil strewn everywhere. Back in our rooms, we shower and are asleep by 8:00.
#
Biking in Copenhagen is exhilarating. We sail without much effort along cold winds, over bridges, down through old buildings, along wall-paved, separated bike lanes. Cold air whips at my face and nose and my poorly wrapped scarf comes untangled in the wind, but it all feels glorious moving among the herd of cyclists, not worrying about passing cars, feeling safety in numbers. We stop at an intersection behind a cluster of ten bikes, mostly young people like ourselves, some mothers with babies strapped into tiny seats, a few older men who look fitter than me, everyone leaning gracefully to one side as they wait for the light to change.
#
Christiansborg Palace, the old seat of the monarchy and the current seat of Parliament, is largely a lesser-Versailles, a 20th-century reconstruction of the site’s various older palaces which all burned down. But amidst the standard set of stately and filigreed reception rooms we find the Great Hall, a room whose expensive chandeliers and 18th century allegorical ceiling are belied by the floor tiles’ 20th-century black and white pattern and, the room’s highlight, the 17 ultra-modern tapestries. They chronicle Denmark’s history, from the Viking era to the 21st century, and are done in a self-consciously non-Western style, reminiscent of Diego Rivera’s murals in Mexico City, with vivid, wild colors, bright reds and dark greens and deep purples. We take our time before several of them, using the laminated guides to identify the various figures. Some names I know — the Viking Kings Ragnar Lothbrok and Harald Bluetooth, the Arab traveler Ibn Fadlan, Margaret “the Lady King” of the medieval Kalmar Union — but most are unrecognizable, a rush of history that swirls together in all the bright color.
There’s one tapestry titled “The Future” depicting two men in suits hovering in a nebula of blue and purple, surrounded by floating microbes and crystals and drawings of atoms and solar systems, “the bionic men” as K______ calls them. The irony of course is that Denmark already is the future: a country with safe bike lanes and universal healthcare and free higher education and a minimum wage twice as high as the United States and 5 weeks paid vacation and 32 weeks paid family leave and 85% voter turnout and overall some of the happiest people in the world.
#
The National Museum has an impressive collection of historical artifacts. We spend most of our time on the bottom floor, amidst the pre-Viking stuff, prehistoric arrowheads and cerated harpoons and burnt animals bones offered as ritual sacrifices. There are large skeletons of an aurochs and an elk, and a grave from 5000 BC with the bones of a 40-year-old woman and her 3-year-old child. The description tell us she survived several blows to the head.
Farther down we reach the Bronze Age, where we find more bodies and objects preserved in bogs or unearthed from barrows: swords, helmets, shields, jewelry, a wooden folding chair from 1400 BC, a tree-trunk coffin from 1370 with the remains of the Egtved Girl, her ragged clothing, bits of her skin and teeth, and a large bronze belt. Later, in the Iron Age we find a metal carriage pulled up from a bog, with large wheels and small decorative details, and following that the Gundestrup cauldron, a large silver bowl decorated with strange non-Viking figures and animal imagery, evidence of Denmark’s early connections with the wider world. Beyond them, finally, is the Viking era, where we find shining swords and shields, drinking horns of various sizes, large rune stones etched with unfamiliar letters, and the remnants of a wooden longboat.
The museum’s most interesting item, though, is the Trundholm sun chariot, from 1800 BC: a bronze statue of the sun pulled along in a chariot by a small horse. The sun is still gilded on one side and shines brightly in the dark museum gallery
I find this evidence of Bronze Age spirituality particularly fascinating. In our modern world the word “religion” has developed such negative connotations, dogmatism, stupidity, intolerance. But everything in this museum, from this chariot to the Early Modern allegorical ceilings on the floor above us to the animal bones in the Paleolithic room, show the need for some kind of religion — perhaps not the ones we have today, that speak of abstract principles of righteousness and morality, but ones like these, of people who viewed the afterlife and the supernatural in the literal terms of their own small worlds, who buried themselves with the physical objects they imagined they might need in whatever awaited them hereafter.
What would we be buried with, I wonder? Our phones perhaps?
#
Later, at the Christiansborg Palace stables, I notice how similar the royal carriages look to the iron age wagon pulled up from the bog.
#
We walk back along Rantzausgade, looking for a place to eat. Signs of Danish coziness are everyone, people visible in windows seated around a table, not bundled up like we are, candles before them, all eating and drinking slowly while relaxing and talking, signs of community, of warmth, inviting from the cold. We see one such group in a well-lit interior, drinking wine around half-empty plates, and I can’t tell if it’s a restaurant or just young people having dinner at home. Because of all the glass walls and big windows, at night every interior becomes so well lit, so easy to see from the street. The lack of privacy feels deliberate, as if as if projecting this image of coziness is part of the charm of the city.
We find a small place, run by a woman who both cooks and takes orders. We sit at the well-lit window, next to the dark street and split a hummus sandwich, vegan chili, and a nice, fruity Danish IPA. Afterwards, K______ goes to sleep, but I stay up in hostel with a pilsner and write. Around me is the same atmosphere I saw in all the windows. A group of Spanish tourists are chatting at my long table, everyone in sweaters rolled up at the sleeves, their scarves and jackets piled on a chair in the corner. A candle flickers in a holder amidst their beers, and mellow music plays from overhead. I feel a pleasant warmth from the outside cold.
#
The buildings on the canal-side streets of Christianshavn are nicer, richer — some are older, painted red and ochre, and some are made of brick, and along the waterfront are a few modern apartments, red stone reinforced with black metal.
Nearby is an 18th century warehouse, a long, beige, brick building, bland, unassuming, rectangular. Now it houses an art gallery and the Michelin-starred restaurant Noma, supposedly the best in the world. Dinner there would have been 2000 KR (roughly 250 dollars) each, for 6 courses. Another tourist couple are taking pictures under the sign. It’s not yet open, and the inside is mostly dark, save for the candles flickering in the window. A white shape, probably a waiter, moves in the shadows beyond the yellow flames.
Beside the warehouse is an old wooden, ship, tied to the dock and resting silently in the water. A man sits on it, eyes closed, so still he’s almost part of the boat. Against the contemporary black steel of the apartment behind it, the ship looks particularly ancient.
The warehouse’s art gallery features an Icelandic artist, whose work deals with water and climate change and methods of measurement. One of the sculptures on the second floor is a ticking clock, which echoes through the bright and empty room.
Because of the new light wood flooring and the white, newly painted walls, it’s hard to imagine this gallery as a warehouse. I try to see the sacks of grain and barrels of herring that would have lined the walls, ready to load onto merchant ships like the one outside — but I can’t. The space seems like it was built not in 1767 but in 2015, as an artistic aperitif for the haute-bourgeois diners of Noma.
#
We have lunch at Copenhagen Street Food — a hipster food market located in a former paper factory — and then bike farther north towards Refshaleøen, an old industrial area that our guidebook recommended, now mostly used for warehouse parties. The ride up takes us off the main road and along a smaller bike path that winds between broad, grassy plains, and past varied and interesting buildings, some contemporary glass and steel, some pre-industrial brick and stone. We cross a small bridge, and a large fluttering Danish flag comes into view, and below it a statue of what looks like a merman holding aloft a smaller Danish flag, angled forward, like he’s carrying it into battle. In the distance is a strange-shaped factory, a square metal hulk with a rounded top, sending darkish-white smoke up into the grey sky. The sun is still hidden, as it has been all day, and the air is bitterly cold, but the sense of adventure is enough to keep us going. Wind whips at my face, my nose is numb, my cheeks stinging, and I can feel the cold through my gloves as they’re stretched across the handlebars — but we’re moving so quickly, flying around concrete roads, bouncing across gravel, following the memory of a Google Map through an unfamiliar landscape, past signs we can’t read, the grey warehouses growing larger ahead of us. Only a few cars pass us, one or two vans, one bus, a handful of cyclists, and so it feels to us as though the landscape is all ours, Denmark a private playground.
We reach the end of a gravel road, where it meets the water. Behind us is the Mikkeler warehouse. Cinder blocks lie stacked outside the sheds and a few old cars sit empty and rusting. Everything is quiet now, and the warehouse windows dark, and no one is about expect the solitary biker who’d pulled up to a building somewhere behind us. We walk our bikes across old metal tracks which run along the gravel next to the concrete barrier separating us from the water. It’s quiet, peaceful, and majestic, to look out across the water at the row of brick buildings, now the familiar skyline of Copenhagen, the grey sky bringing out their pre-modern red. Behind us, the word “Refshaleøen” looms, written in big black letters across a gray factory building.
We take in the landscape for several long moments, our hearts still beating from our bike ride. Evidence of history stands all around us, the 18th and 19th centuries in brick out across the water, the 20th in metal stretching out behind us — but right now, it feels emphatically like the present, nothing else but 21st century, and I don’t wish we were anytime else.
After a moment, a white car turns a corner to our right and approaches us with bright headlights. The spell broken, we mount our bikes and ride back into the city.
#
From there we bike to Nyhavn then up to Amalienborg Palace, where the queen lives. We watch the guards in blue and black doing a march, which makes me think of England and Buckingham Palace. The idea of monarchy seems even more absurd up here.
From there we go inside the large church we’d seen from across the canal. It’s big and grand, but I don’t feel impressed, perhaps because Christianity hasn’t figured so prominently here. It may be the country’s Protestantism, but also probably that the religion in general only reached Scandinavia in the late 900s. It’s been Protestant almost as long as it’s been Catholic, and it was pagan up until almost the Crusades. A thousand years of Church history and tradition don’t even exist here. Warehouses seem better symbols of Copenhagen than churches.
From there, we go to the Danish Design Museum, where we find among other things an exhibit on chairs. “The chair is one of the most culture-bearing objects we ever invented,” the description says. “It reveals everything about the age and society in which it was created.” A folding chair from the 20th century makes me think of the folding chair from the bog we saw yesterday at the history museum — as with the carriages, a consistency from past to present.
From there, we bike up to the Little Mermaid Statue. The sun has almost set now, and to our right over green hills rises a stone church, beautifully backlit against the fading day. We pass though the Kastellet, a star fortress from the 1600s, the walls now mostly crumbling stone. We walk our bikes between quaint red buildings and watch three soldiers conduct a flag ceremony. They look like Boy Scouts rather than grown men.
The Mermaid is naked, like a Greek statue, and very sad, sitting atop a pile of rocks and looking longingly out across the water. It’s 4:30 now, and practically dark. Across the canal, we can see Refshaleøen, where we just were, the black letters written on the gray building. It seems so far to have come in just half a day.
#
Rosenborg Palace is dark and poorly lit, as expected in a 17th century building, and outside the latticed windows rain falls from a gray sky. But inside, the various royal treasures sparkle: gilded chests, fine wooden cabinets, small objects of ivory and amber, paintings ranging from humble landscapes to wild allegories to austere portraits of men, women, and horses, all in all an impressive collection that takes us from the castle’s construction in 1606 under Christian IV to the end of Denmark’s absolute monarchy in 1848. On the top floor is the throne room with antechambers holding the King’s collections of glass and porcelain, and in the basement is the royal treasury, with crowns and scepters and gold rings. The palace’s most interesting object, though, is tucked away in a small glass case against a wall of one of the 19th century rooms: the pen King Frederick VII used to sign the 1849 constitution.
Afterwards, we go to the Worker’s Museum where instead of rooms glorifying individual Kings we find a space honoring the nameless millions of the 20th century. In the central hall where union leaders once met hang the flags of various labor organizations, most of them a vivid, socialist red against the beige walls. In one of the exhibits in the basement, several old union flags have been stitched together into a single red banner, now reading “HOPE NOT FEAR”.
One of the rooms has a small exhibit on Thorvald Stauning, Denmark’s first social democratic prime minister, elected in 1924, and the country’s longest serving PM of the 20th century. He came from a working class background and trained as a cigar sorter before getting involved in politics. We stare at his big, bearded face in some surprise. As we’d just learned, Denmark had still been an absolute monarchy only 74 years before. And now, 90 years after, it’s one of the world’s preeminent social democracies.
If Denmark can change that much so quickly, then why can’t we, the United States, already born as a republic?
#
The only thing that frustrates us here in Denmark is the small window for lunch. It’s 3:00 and we’re wandering Kødbyen, the former meatpacking district in Vesterbro, going warehouse to warehouse only to find that most of the bourgeois restaurants are closed until dinner at 6:00. The fish place our guidebook recommended is open till 3:30, but it looks too expensive. The Indian restaurant does take-out only. A pub serving beer and burgers is open all day, but it looks like something we could find in Los Angeles. Eventually, at 3:30, we sit down in a packed Italian place. Neither of us particularly wants Italian food, but we’re both hungry. After ten minutes, though, the waiters still haven’t brought us menus, so we get up and leave. The waitress gives us an irritated look as we button up our coats.
We eat ultimately at Øl & Brød, a slightly upscale lunch place attached to the Mikkeller bar we were at earlier, open till 4:00. The tables have white tablecloths and the clientele is mostly older, except for a group of six posh guys in their early 20s, all wearing sweaters over button-downs and with the same expensive haircut, like some Danish version of the Bullingdon Club. We’re too hungry to bother converting the prices on the menu until after we order. The food is delicious: 3 open faced sandwiches (smørrebrød) and a savory chicken tartelet filled with gravy.
When the bill comes, we have just enough cash to cover it.
#
One our final day, we wait on the empty platform for our mid-morning train to Stockholm. It was warmer earlier, and even a little sunny — but now the sky is gray again and the temperature dropping.
Now and then a train passes with the smooth sound of sliding metal, and the occasional bundled up pedestrian or cyclist moves by on the street above. But for the most part everything is quiet and almost desolate. The tracks would be abandoned-looking if they weren’t so pristine and well-maintained. But this ghost-town quality is an appropriate way to bid farewell to Copenhagen, as we felt it several times over the last few days, from Nørrebro to Refshaleøen to Kødbyen. As always, everyone must be inside now, staying warm behind the yellow lights.
In looking at all the buildings, I can’t help, of course, but note the mix of centuries: the brick train station of the early 20th century in the foreground, the elegant mansard roofs of the 19th century repeating down along the street, the distant concrete of the late 20th century, and out beyond the floating glass and steel of today.
Dominating the horizon is the ugly SAS hotel, a Le-Corbusier-inspired tower of misguided modernity. There was a brief section on it in the Design Museum, about how when it was constructed in the 1950s, the architect Arne Jacobsen sincerely believed it would be the pinnacle of architectural form, functionalism perfected. It looks even worse here than similar buildings do in the United States, too clumsy next to the elegant brick or the floating glass. But considering everything else we saw, its imperfection is forgivable.

Shortly after joining Tymit, I started hearing whispers about KotlinConf’25 in Copenhagen. I’d never been to an international conference before — let alone one dedicated to a language I use every day as a Junior Android Developer. The excitement was real! I couldn’t wait to see what the global Kotlin community looked like up close.
When I finally arrived, I was blown away by the energy. The event was so well organized — registration was fast, the talks started on time, and everything felt super professional. I had been worried that most of the sessions would be too advanced for me, but there was something for everyone, no matter your experience level.
What really struck me was seeing Kotlin’s potential in action. I already knew Kotlin was powerful, but it’s something else to be in a room full of developers from all over the world, sharing their passion for the language. The enthusiasm was contagious — even developers who don’t use Kotlin every day were getting inspired! I was especially surprised to see backend and even iOS developers interested in Kotlin Multiplatform. It made me realize that Kotlin is much bigger than just Android development; it’s a growing ecosystem with a place for everyone.
Attending KotlinConf with my Tymit team made the experience even better. We picked out talks together, grabbed lunch between sessions, and just enjoyed being part of the event as a team. It helped us bond and made the whole trip unforgettable.
The conference started with an inspiring keynote by Roman Elizarov, who walked us through how Kotlin has evolved and teased some amazing features coming soon. The talk that stood out most for our team was “Rich Errors in Kotlin” by Sébastien Deleuze, which introduced a new way to handle errors in Kotlin.
Day 1 Highlights:
Day 2 Highlights:
A lot of talks focused on AI and Kotlin Multiplatform, both of which I’m really excited about. I left the conference full of ideas for side projects and new tools to try at work.
We also got to see Junie, JetBrains’ new AI assistant for their IDEs like Android Studio. We’re planning to try it out on our team, hoping it’ll help us automate tasks and boost productivity.
The Rich Errors proposal especially caught our eye — we think it could make our app even more robust.
Overall, KotlinConf’25 was an amazing experience. I’m so grateful to Tymit for making it possible. If you ever get a chance to attend, don’t hesitate — you’ll come back inspired, connected, and ready to level up!

Copenhagen is my city. I still feel like that, even after having moved (far) away and not lived here for years. It still feels like home.
I’ve walked through its parks with my boys when they were little chubby babies sleeping in warm blankets in their prams.
I’ve cycled along its lakes for a decade on my way to work.
I’ve discussed world peace and literature and art with my friends at its cafes and bars for countless hours.
I know its streets and parks, and museums and galleries like the back of my hand.
And furthermore, it is home to my closest friends.
In other words, this place has a special place in my heart, which is also why this guide and description might be a tad bias. I hope you can bear with me.
I just spent ten days in Copenhagen. And from the moment I arrived, the special Copenhagen feeling seeped through my bones and made me feel at home and eager to get out walk and cycle and sit at the harbor area with a glass of white wine and wind in my hair.

After a long, dark, freezing, and often soul-crushing winter, Copenhagen slowly begins to come alive in April. It’s green and beautiful with colorful flowers all over the city.
And right in the middle of so many colors, when the cherry trees blossom, their delicate white and pink petals create a stunning contrast against the lush green grass and the clear blue sky.
Copenhagen is full of cherry blossom trees. You see them everywhere. They are in the gardens of tall buildings and standalone houses, in playgrounds, near water bodies, and even lining the roads.
This was quite surprising for me during my first year here. I always pictured Denmark as people biking through the streets, taking icy dips in the sea, and sipping coffee with Danish pastries in cozy cafés.
But cherry blossoms?
That was something I never expected.
This was one of the sweetest surprises that Copenhagen, the world’s happiest city, has given me.
I’ve travelled to over 20 countries, some just once, others many times, but Japan has always remained a dream. Though I have planned many times, a trip to…

The Danish National Opera House — opened in 2005—is located on a small island in Copenhagen’s inner harbor. It is one of the most technically advanced in the world. It is also one of the most expensive, costing a cool half a billion dollars.
Situated very strategically, the opera house is sited at the end of what is called the Amalienborg Axis in the very heart of Copenhagen, Denmark’s capital city. The Axis is equivalent to the National Mall in Washington D.C. It is a stone plaza that bisects the Queen’s residential compound, terminating at the Marble Church, the largest in Denmark, and a holy shrine. Directly opposite, and clearly visible across the harbor, sits the Opera House.
The bulk of the money to build it came from the A. P. Møller Foundation, who controls the enormous fortune of the founder of the gigantic Danish shipping company, Maersk. Møller himself has a reputation for being imperious and heavy-handed.
The imposing facade of the very Danish Modern glass and concrete Opera House looms over the harbor. It was designed by the prominent Danish architecture firm, Henning Larsen. Like most established architectural design firms, Henning Larsen is big and conservative, but not that conservative. As the story goes, A.P. Møller arbitrarily overrode some of Henning Larsen’s design decisions, and this did not please the architects. Møller’s ham-fisted meddling with the architect’s design is at the heart of this story of Danish rebellion.
Less than a mile from the Opera House is the autonomous neighborhood of Christiania, encompassed entirely within the city limits of Copenhagen. Formerly an Army barracks, Christiania was abandoned in the late 1960s only to be occupied by hippie squatters in the early 1970s. The authorities never bothered to kick them out and left them to their own devices, so they established their own informal government and rules. It’s home to several successful businesses like the eponymous cargo bicycles that are ubiquitous in bike-loving Copenhagen. Today, the community is home to about 850 people, most of whom are artists, craftsmen, performers, and other creative people who, like their hippie forbears, lean to the left politically.
Christiania, though, is famous for marijuana. For more than 40 years the Copenhagen authorities have turned a blind eye to widespread pot selling and smoking as long as it stayed within the boundaries of the former army base. Christiania residents confine pot sales to one short avenue, often called “Green Street.” Photography on Green Street is strictly forbidden, and brandishing a camera might get you summarily escorted out of town by a dozen offended citizens. Even though Christiania now has its own government, commerce, mayor, and many respectable full time residents, it remains a bold counter-culture statement right in the heart of conservative, Christian, Copenhagen, a living symbol of tolerance and independence. Christiania also proudly flies its own flag, which is orange with three yellow circles in a horizontal line. More than anything else, this iconic flag represents the anti-establishment spirit of Christiania.
The imposing Opera House, on the other hand, is an important civic building representing traditional values and the triumph of global trade and capitalism. But even vastly wealthy, self-important capitalists need to hire creative people, and it is unwise to abuse them, as A.P. Møller learned.
Long after the industrialist Møller forced the unwanted changes on Henning-Larsen’s design, and long after he innocently approved the lighting plan, which included the installation of three gigantic round chandeliers in the auditorium foyer, it gradually dawned on the good citizens of Copenhagen that the Henning-Larsen architectural firm had got the last laugh. At night, after it gets very dark, the entire Opera House glows a certain shade of orange, and the three giant round chandeliers shine a certain shade of yellow, all in a horizontal line with a characteristic spacing, all clearly visible from the Marble Church, the Amalienborg Axis, and the Queen’s Palace. It’s a gentle, subtle, anti-establishment gesture of defiance to those with more dollars than sense.
Heartwarming, isn’t it?

The Liberators: Unleashing Organizational Superpowers

Last week, we visited the LEGO Group’s office in Copenhagen. Where the office in Billund is hard to miss, the one in Copenhagen is nicely hidden in the city center. It reminded me of Harry Potter searching for platform nine-and-three-quarters. 😄
One reason for our visit was to gather feedback from real users of our product, Columinity. We can look long and hard into our crystal ball to search for clues about customers’ experiences or ask them instead. With 150 active teams, it shouldn’t be too difficult to find someone using it. 🔎
During our session, we focused on talking with various Agile Coaches using it to support their teams in continuously improving based on scientific insights and evidence-based feedback.
We *almost* started a classic open discussion (the horror 😱)…
Luckily, the idea of running a lightweight version of the Liberating Structure “User Experience Fishbowl” came to mind. This seemed to make sense, given our goal of collecting real users’ experiences. 🤔
The flow was simple:1. A small group of Agile Coaches positioned themselves in a circle in the center. For about 10 minutes, they started talking about their experiences using Columinity. 2. At the same time, Denny de Waard, myself, and a few others were listening. Whenever a question came to mind, we threw fish food (representing the question) into the bowl. Christina Mumm had the brilliant idea of using LEGO bricks as “fish food.” 🐠 3. After 10 minutes, we flipped roles. The users became the listeners, and we (the original listeners) positioned ourselves in the middle and shared what we noticed in the first round. What experiences stood out? What did we like, surprise, and maybe even worry about?4. For a final time, the users returned to the center of the fishbowl and continuously shared new thoughts and experiences. 5. After roughly 45 minutes ⏰, we closed the UX Fishbowl.
I considered it a valuable experience. It resulted in lots of feedback we can use to improve the use of our product. It was also an excellent (IMHO) example of how you can use Liberating Structures in a lightweight manner without any preparation.
Now, you probably think:
“Hey, why haven’t you included real-life pictures? Did it actually happen? Or are you just making things up here…”
Fair point. You’ll never know, but it’s a nice story, right? 😃
Additional thoughts by Christina Mumm — Agile Coach Competency Lead at the LEGO Group:
“This is not only modeling the value of Liberating Structures ;) It’s about deliberately creating opportunities for necessary conversations across any divide. In this case, we are choosing to close the gap between internal and external (customer- vendor). Working as one team brings value to everyone much faster. Why would we want to keep a distance? I hope we can inspire others to do the same by walking the talk this way.”
Whether it happened or not, why don’t you try this yourself? If you already have used UX Fishbowl, how did it work for you?

If you are visiting that part of Europe that is carbon neutral and scores high on sustainability, you’ll be rewarded with a perfect, clean, and green getaway like Copenhagen. From the perspective of someone like me who is an advocate for sustainable travel, their endeavors to protect the environment are laudable. I had the privilege of visiting the beautiful, bike-friendly capital of Denmark, endowed with a rich history and culture. It had long been on my bucket list and finally, the dream was fulfilled. Copenhagen was everything that I hoped for and more.
We could manage to set aside only 3 days out of our 20-day Europe itinerary and to make matters worse the weather Gods were not on our side. The day we landed was bright and sunny, but incessant rains dampened our spirits on the main day that we were there and had reserved for sightseeing. However, we refused to let the gloomy weather get us down and made the most out of our time in the city.
Copenhagen has something for everyone. From world-class museums and art galleries, centuries-old castles and palaces, and delicious food, to charming shops, cafes, and entertainment parks.
For history buffs Christianborg Palace and the Rosenberg Castle would be fascinating, giving a walkthrough the lives of Danish royalty. You may feel like skipping them if you’re there for a short time, but these grand places are worth a visit. We too were in a dilemma whether to go inside or miss it, but finally, it was a yes from everyone, and it was a great decision.
The center of the Danish Parliament, the Christianborg Palace may not have attractive exteriors, and you may not be much impressed. But once you step inside you’ll find the opulent interiors awe-inspiring. From the decor and chandeliers to the furniture and artwork, a glimpse into the lives of royalty was fabulous.
The most famous touristy spot in Copenhagen is Nyhaven. Once a 17th-century fishing village, is now a dazzling waterfront entertainment zone, with a string of cafes, restaurants, and brightly painted houses. An amusing anecdote about the reason behind these vibrantly painted houses is so that the owners recognize their homes after returning drunken in the night from the bar.
You’ll also come across centuries-old iconic wooden ships at Nyhaven, taking you back in time. It’s a pleasure to walk beside the canal and enjoy the views. There are coffee shops with fireplaces that provide hot drinks and offer a haven from the chilly winds outside. Must try is the crispy, layered Danish pastry, which is delicious.
The Little Mermaid — based on a fairy tale written by a Danish author, this bronze statue of the little mermaid sitting on a rock is situated by the waterside at the Langelinie promenade. This is a great photo spot full of tourists.
Another Copenhagen highlight is a guided boat tour of the canal. Find significant historical landmarks on this tour as described by the guide, while admiring the beauty and listening to engrossing tales from the past. The witty incidents narrated had the audience enthralled. It was interesting to know that the author of the famous story the `Ugly Duckling was a resident of Copenhagen too.
Something that is unpredictable in Copenhagen, like most of Europe is the weather. Our canal trip was therefore interrupted by showers, but thankfully the boat had a glass roof so we could still take in the scenery. Considering the erratic weather having raincoats and umbrellas with you is a necessity. Even though it may mean hauling heavier bags, it is preferable than getting drenched in the midst of your vacation.
Several modern and historic museums dot the city. We decided on the Design Museum, having a very contemporary vibe and numerous masterpieces on display.
“Sail while the breeze blows, wind and tide wait for no man” — Danish Proverb
Impromptu plans are what make holidays enjoyable. The museum was on the waterfront, and from the terrace, we located a ferry point. Just as the last of the ferries was about to depart in the evening, we hurried and got on to it for what turned out to be an adventurous ride. Though there wasn’t any specific agenda, and the program was made on the spur of the moment, the sunset boat ride was worth it. And doubly so, it was absolutely free.
Getting around is quite easy in the capital of Denmark. Though there are various modes of transport, like, metro, bus, cab, or even ferry, using a bike is common. Specific tracks on the sides of roads, make it so convenient for cycling. It not just saves fuel but keeps the surroundings free of carbon emissions. Walking around on foot appeals to some as well.
Staying at the centrally located Mayfair Hotel was a pleasant experience. Not only were the rooms comfortable, the food and ambiance nice as well. As much as we wanted to, because of a shortage of time, missed going to the famous Tivoli Gardens. Probably, a sign that we ought to come here again.

While we are nowhere near the tipping point, there are many cities, especially here in Europe, that are redefining their urban development and scaling back their planning to something more life-sized. Back to a modus operandi that predated the automobile — and that attempts to fix the planning mistakes made because of it.
Things are very different here in Copenhagen and in Denmark, however, where they are planning megaprojects like it’s the 1950s. As I’ve highlighted before, they’re also just copy-pasting plans from the 1950s and 1960s instead of adapting urban development to the new century.
The biggest monster in the city at the moment is the proposed artificial island at the head of the harbour called Lynetteholm. An environmental catastrophe unfolding before our eyes, propelled by developers and their political lapdogs.
This article is a history lesson as much as it is a cautionary tale about the current political desire for more motorways and vanity megaprojects.
Megaprojects generally cause two reactions among the general population. Firstly there is often a strong fascination bias when they are proposed. It’s so big and shiny and impressive that it has to be a good thing. Secondly, after a megaproject is approved, in comes a sense of surrenderism where people become resigned to the fact that the fight is over.
This article is about a series of massive megaprojects that were planned for Copenhagen, approved by politicians and then… disappeared. Which gives hope that we can defeat the current projects.
Urban development mega-projects are usually something that we associate with the years after the Second World War when the car started its advance on our cities and we desperately tried to make space for it. In my research, however, I discovered that there are examples that go farther back.
In 1910, there was a serious proposal to build a tunnel under the harbour from the city centre to the southern shore — probably the Christianshavn neighbourhood. The proposed location was Nyhavn, the now iconic canal with the coloured houses and old sailing ships that provides Copenhagen with its most Instagrammable backdrop. Nyhavn was always the most colourful part of the city in many ways. Sailors went ashore here for centuries, in search of alcohol, tattoos and sex workers so it has always been a neighbourhood that politicians wanted to “fix”, even well into the 1950s and 1960s.
In the post-war years, as we know, cities around the world were seduced by American traffic engineering and the idea that the car was the only future we would ever need. The bombed cities in Germany offered clean slates for drastic urban renewal. Indeed, the transformation of Hannover was called The Miracle of Hannover when the wide, car-centric streets were completed.
Even cities that were spared the bombs started planning similar urban renewal projects. I’ve seen the wild plans for Amsterdam, Oslo, Helsinki, Glasgow, Paris and even Vancouver, to mention just a few cities that were intent on future-proofing themselves. Stockholm was the only Nordic city that actually went ahead with the American Dream. The urban planning joke in the Nordics is that they bombed themselves before and after the war — and they’re still dealing with the issues it caused.
Copenhagen was no exception. In the 1950s, a national strategy called The Big H was launched, aimed at connecting Denmark with motorways, inspired, like the US and other countries, by the Autobahn network associated with Hitler. What a role model. The right side of the H would run from the ferry from Sweden (this was long before the Øresund Bridge was built to Sweden), down through Copenhagen and onward to the ferries to Germany. The first motorways that were built were the ones that led to the capital, starting in 1956 and never really stopping since.
In 1958, massive megaprojects in Copenhagen were proposed. The Lake Ring — Søringen in Danish — was the first, and the one that would dominate the narrative for years to come. It would sweep into the city from the north, turn right at The Lakes and continue on to the south of the city. Over the next fifteen years, space for the coming motorway was found and buildings were bulldozed.
The most extreme examples are still visible today. Buildings along Lyngbyvej to the north were knocked down, the road leading to the city centre along the harbour was widened, as was the Langebro bridge over the harbour.
Closer to the city, a green strip along Tagensvej and Fredensgade was where the Lake Ring would be placed. Amorparken at the top and what is now Fredenspark at the bottom.
Amorparken dates from 1910, when it formed splendidly landscaped gardens outside the main entrance of the national hospital. Most of the beautiful hospital buildings were bulldozed and, in 1970, the new Rigshospitalet opened. Across the street, construction of the Panum Institute (built 1971–1986) started later, but the idea was the same. These two brutalist monsters would be located on either side of the monster motorway.
Farther down from Amorparken, the road bottlenecked through a densely-populated neighbourhood around Fredensgade. In 1972, a large swath of buildings were removed, despite protests. The strip of green is, today, a welcome buffer between the buildings that remain and the busy road, but these are not parks that citizens write home about. They often feel like non-places due to their awkward location in the dusty, leftover motorway plans.
The Lake Ring would roar down to The Lakes and turn right, running along the southern shore. In places, 30 metres of water would be reallocated to cars and flyovers would reach the height of the second floor of the buildings.
At the end of The Lakes, the initial 1958 plans featured a tunnel that would emerge in the area around Halmtorvet, to the west of the city centre. I have learned that the tunnel was later dropped when the plans evolved and grew in scale. Instead, the motorway would just plough through.
This is where the Lake Ring would now merge with its evil twin — City Plan Vest (West). In 1958, the tunnel would have preserved many traditional buildings and most of the motorway infrastructure would have been placed on the location of the Meatpacking District (Kødbyen).
Over the next decade, that changed drastically. The entire area was earmarked for destruction, with huge new commercial buildings rising up on the spot instead, with the motorway roaring through and then branching out to the south and west.
This would have seen the total and utter destruction of an entire neighbourhood, with thousands and thousands of people displaced and hundreds of buildings knocked down. Below, you can see the huge scale of the City Plan Vest project and where the places we know today are located.
If you have ever been on Halmtorvet Square in the Vesterbro neighbourhood, you might have wondered what one odd-looking building is doing there, looking totally out of context with the traditional architecture around it. This is now a police precinct called Station City. Like the National Hospital and Panum Institute, it was built in anticipation of the coming motorway and urban development.
The Lake Ring and City Plan Vest were considered to be a sure thing — so much so that buildings were erected in advance of them. Now they all look so sad, awkward and out of place.
It is interesting to mention that the mediaeval city centre, in many of the plans of the age, was either going to be car-light or even car-free. Parking garages, in some of the plans, would be placed in the Nørrebro neighbourhood or even under The Lakes and people were expected to take trams into the centre.
One article even envisioned electric buses replacing the trams back in 1967. Later, in the mid-1970s, the Dutch city of Groningen adopted this model of garages outside the city centre, with marginal success.
Reading all of these old documents from back then is pretty scary. In the Generalplan of 1954, you can see how the bicycle — that traditional transportational workhorse in Copenhagen — was regarded.
“The plan regards the massive bicycle traffic in the city’s streets as a spatial problem that must be addressed. Cyclists must be encouraged to take the tram instead. Trams take up less space in the city.”
That was a different age, indeed.
There were many actors through the decades who were tasked with these huge projects and other smaller ones but in Copenhagen there was really one primary protagonist — or perhaps antagonist.
New York had Robert Moses bulldozing his way through the poor neighbourhoods to make shiny new motorways for the future but in Copenhagen we had the most ironically named mayor in the history of urbanism: Urban Hansen.
He was Lord Mayor of Copenhagen from 1962 to 1976. He drank the American Kool-Aid and went to work planning massive motorways, as well as brutal redevelopment projects that cleared out undesirable, low income neighbourhoods.
He built social housing developments that later failed miserably, like his namesake Urbanplanen and also Tingbjerg. He was the man who ripped out the Copenhagen tram network after 109 years, replacing them with buses in 1972 — the year before the first oil crisis. Oh, the irony. Today, Copenhagen is one of the few cities in Europe without trams having built a vanity mini-Metro instead and sending the city into a massive debt.
Urban Hansen was one of the main proponents of the Lake Ring, City Plan Vest and all the other mega-projects. Calling him the Robert Moses of Copenhagen is not an understatement. I would go as far as to say that he was the most destructive mayor in the history of this city.
The desire for motorways back then was as strong as the desire to raze low-income neighbourhoods to the ground to make space for social housing. The neighbourhoods of Vesterbro and Nørrebro — traditional working-class areas — were constantly under the threat of urban renewal. They were poor areas for decades well into the 1980s and were at the top of the list when the suits in City Hall looked at “improving” and “modernising” the city.
A new transport minister, Ove Guldberg, launched the idea of Forumlinien (The Forum Line) in 1970. I stumbled across it a few years ago and could only find a couple of visualisations of it. Few people have ever heard of it and it’s hard to find any reference to it at all, even though it hung around for two years.
I’ve stared at this drawing — one of the only ones that I could find — for more than a decade, wondering what the hell it is.
Motorways above and to the left and a Corbusier-esque street on the right with car traffic below the new buildings along Nørrebrogade. But right there in the centre is a huge housing project on The Lakes in Copenhagen. It looks like it is six floors high on the left and maybe up to twenty on the right. Surrounded by leafy green areas.
It wasn’t hard to figure out the proposed location of this monster so I overlaid it on a current map of this part of Nørrebro — Denmark’s most densely-populated neighbourhood then and now.
Look at that. Total destruction, total elimination of an undesirable low income neighbourhood and even reaching over into the City of Frederiksberg on the left. But that’s all I knew about this project, despite hunting for more information.
Recently, I succeeded in tracking down the original document. Very few remain, and it has taken me literally years. What I saw in it completely blew my mind.
In response to the growing resistance against the Lake Ring, the government and city didn’t propose a softer option — they went ballistic. The Forum Line route runs through Nørrebro, Frederiksberg and Vesterbro — and on to the south of the harbour.
With morbid fascination. I zoomed in on the details and saw how my own neighbourhood and many places I’ve lived in this city would have been completely destroyed.
I can’t imagine how many people would have been displaced and how many buildings would have been knocked down. But in the next image, you can see they had already figured that out.
Remember that weird round building I mentioned? I discovered in the document that it was just part of an entire row of them on the north shore of The Lakes. It was just one visualisation of social housing. There are other proposals as well. All dystopian images of a future that was seriously proposed by politicians and the national Road Directorate.
A lot of work was put into these proposals, complete with detailed maps of the entire route, with the motorway casually superimposed on densely-populated neighbourhoods.
There seems to be a lot of focus in all of these documents on one particular area of the proposed project near a square called Blågårds Plads. It seems to be an epicentre for all of the plans to raze that entire neighbourhood to the ground.
After two years of work, the Forum Line was killed off in 1972. It simply wasn’t a feasible replacement for the Lake Ring. The Transport Minister Ove Guldberg took a last stab at it and started work on an outer motorway ring road called Ydre Ring (Outer Ring). But it didn’t gain much ground. All traffic investments in Copenhagen were stopped and the first oil crisis in 1973 slammed the door on the whole debacle.
It’s amazing to think that all of that over there on the far side of The Lakes would be gone forever.
We are so incredibly lucky that none of it happened, but this was the kind of insane thinking that was the norm back then. Unfortunately, it’s the norm in Copenhagen again today with the current politicians in City Hall, the National Parliament and the company overseeing all the new crazy shit: By & Havn.
By 1972, the pushback had grown so strong that a last gasp attempt to save the project was proposed. Same-same, but different. A tunnel beneath The Lakes instead of an elevated motorway. The people, however, didn’t buy it. Time was running out for the Lake Ring project.
Even back in 1965 there was increasing pushback from the public. One architect was the public face of the project and a massive fan of it: Ole Nørgård. He was quoted as saying this:
“Copenhagen in its development has reached a point where it is necessary to expand a network of motorways through the city to ensure its orbital functions. Motorways will change the city’s appearance. If this change is to be for the better, then the normal fear of development must be replaced by the courage to control that fear.”
Yeah. Okay, Boomer.
But as the years progressed, he and other proponents had to change their approach and start selling it all differently and reassuring people that there would still be pedestrian access to the water. Well, in certain places, anyway.
Some publications fervently supported the whole idea. They put an enormous amount of effort into a multi-page article singing the praises of the whole urban development plan for the city. Moving the airport to the island of Saltholm, parking garages in the Nørrebro neighbourhood, filling in the south of the harbour to create more land. And so on.
In this article you can read this:
“Most of us mourn when the city grows and obliterates accustomed landscapes, but the coming city will have totally new values.
Future generations will hopefully think that our age acted wisely and rightly when we finally pulled ourselves together and planned urban development.”
Oh, boy.
It was a national newspaper called Politiken who really added fuel to the fire of the protests in 1968 with an article entitled The Lake Ring — Fake News or Fact? They had previously been on board (HELLO, fascination bias) but with this article they called bullshit on the project. Other more conservative newspapers were still fans, but question marks started appearing.
There are still leftovers from the project in this city. Large buildings and widened roads. Most of them eyesores to this day. One particular leftover has to be the biggest regarding infrastructure. The motorway flyover named Bispeengbuen.
Aside: isn’t it ironic that many large developments in the world are named after what they ended up killing? Bispeengen (Bishop’s Meadow) was killed with the flyover. The Lake Ring would kill The Lakes. City Plan Vest would kill the west of the city. Even shopping malls adopt this sub-conscious naming concept. Here in Copenhagen, Fields Mall occupies the fields that used to be there. You can see what other malls eradicated — it’s in the name: Fisketorvet (Fisherman’s Square), Spinderiet (The Weavery), Waterfront. Same thing wherever you live.
Anyway, Bispeengbuen is today a piece of dinosaur infrastructure and a barrier between two thriving neighbourhoods. It was opened in August 1972 at a time when protests against the huge projects were reaching a peak.
After it opened, Copenhageners could see what the future might look like and the protests increased by a notch or two. No more wooden models to discuss. There was now concrete evidence — quite literally — that motorways through the city were probably a bad idea.
There is now a popular movement to remove this urban highway and to bring back the original stream currently buried in a tube beneath the cars. Like they’ve done in other cities like Milan, Aarhus, Seoul, Utrecht, and so on.
It’s important to remember that it was also the early seventies back then — an age of radical social change. All these factors led to the Forum Line and the Lake Ring projects being put to bed in 1972 and 1973, respectively. And of course, without the Lake Ring, City Plan Vest was rendered irrelevant.
After spending so much time researching these failed megaprojects, it is completely mind boggling to me to think about how close we were to having this negative, destructive urban planning forced down our throats here in Copenhagen. Other cities in the world were not as lucky.
It is also just as mind boggling to think about how there were humans living here in this city who thought this was a good idea. It was a different era, I know that. It was a different generation of planners and engineers doing what was considered normal back then.
It is of utmost importance, however, to point out that this is not only a tale of all those crazy people back in the day. This is, sadly, very relevant today. Megaprojects are once again being planned.
Those crazy people from back in the day? They are back from the dead. With the same communication strategies, the same verbatim quotes and approach. The same arrogance towards the citizens of this city and this nation. From municipal and national politicians and from the company By og Havn. They all ridicule citizens who oppose these projects in interviews and op-eds. I’ve experienced it myself.
But let’s remember one thing. This cautionary tale about megaprojects that ended up dying should also serve as both a wake-up call and call-to-arms for modern Copenhageners. Megaprojects can — and should — die. Citizens can push back and decide the fate of their city, region and nation.
Keep up the fight.

Before you actually begin your dream journey, your Copenhagen Trip Planner is here. Copenhagen is the largest city in the country and also the capital of Denmark. Sitting on the two coastal islands, Zealand and Amager, this beautiful city is full of historic attractions. Consulting your vacation guide can be a good option if you do not want to miss any particular places of interests here. Every year a huge number of tourists visit this city which still possesses a distinct touch of European culture. Copenhagen is packed with various great attractions and tourist spots. Here are some of the best places that you can include in your travel planner if you really want to make most of your time here.
Among the various interesting places in the city, including Christiansborg Palace in your Copenhagen Trip Planner as top priority can be a brilliant idea. Located in central Copenhagen, on a small island, this palace is still used by royal families as the seat of Danish Parliament, Prime Minister’s office, and Supreme Court. Boasting more than 800 years of history, this palace has plenty of attractions to offer you, such as the royal reception hall, the Chapel, the Ruins, and the Royal Stables. The tallest viewing platform of the city is in this palace which offers an excellent panoramic view of this beautiful city.
Tivoli Garden is basically an amusement park in Copenhagen and is a must visit for all tourists. Founded in the year of 1843, it is known as an international attraction and also a national treasure of Denmark. With more than twenty types of different rides, various cafes and restaurants, Tivoli Gardens has become an absolute wonderland for the visitors. It is also the second oldest functioning amusement park in Denmark.
Your trips to this Danish capital may remain incomplete if you do not add a visit to the Little Mermaid in your Copenhagen Trip Planner. Made of bronze and granite, this sculpture was a gift to the city from the Danish brewer C. Jacobsen. Apart from being the city’s most famous tourist attraction, it is also the official emblem of the city.
If the history and culture of a new city are something that truly interests you then your journey guide may suggest you visit the National Museum of Denmark. You can find exhibitions from almost all the different periods and ages here. Exhibitions from the Stone Age, the Middle Ages, the Viking Ages, the renaissance period and modern Danish history are perfectly displayed here.
Nyhavn Harbour can also be there in your travel plan. At the very end of the harbor, you can witness the anchor which is kept there as a memorial of those Danish sailors who lost their lives during World War II. With the brightly painted houses by the harbor and the museum ships, this place happens to be the most featured one in the photographs, describing the city.
If you have not yet included Bakken in your Copenhagen Trip Planner, then it’s high time that you would. Being the oldest amusement park in the world, Bakken is a wonderful green area where you can enjoy various exciting adventure rides. In the entire Scandinavia, it is the only amusement park that has more rides than any other in the country.
By including these most-visited places of Copenhagen in your vacation plan, you can have the most unforgettable experience in your life. Let’s keep your Copenhagen Trip Planner with you as your best guide and start exploring the majestic city Copenhagen.

I recently returned from a two-week trip to Europe, and I obviously spent a lot of time observing pedestrian and bicycle culture and infrastructure. Rather than simply envy our neighbors across the pond for their walkable and bike-friendly cities and believe that we Yanks could never match their high active transportation mode shares, I was constantly thinking how I could translate my experiences and observations into on-the-ground change here in the U.S. I also realized that we have some progressive transportation infrastructure on our own soil to be proud of.
We first made the pilgrimage to Copenhagen — the Promised Land for many Americans in the bicycle/pedestrian profession… And it lived up to the hype! The comprehensive network of physically separated cycle tracks was incredible and refreshing, of course, but I was more impressed by how easy it was to walk around the city. Several of the major streets were actually pedestrianized, with motor vehicles prohibited. While some examples of this concept exist in the U.S. — including Santa Monica’s Third Street Promenade — they feel rather manufactured and not organic.
Even with the dreary weather, we were sad to leave the playground of Copenhagen. But Paris was awaiting us! I had a mental image of Paris as the small, charming town along the river that is shown in films and travel magazines. However, I was immediately made aware of the city’s sprawling size and wide, auto-clogged boulevards. In a way, I was reminded of my hometown of Los Angeles, except that Paris’s Metro system blankets the region. In a flip from my experience in Copenhagen, I had gone to Paris expecting a walker’s paradise, but instead saw a budding cycling haven. The city had already squeezed cycle tracks along many of the major boulevards, and the famous Vélib’ public bicycles were as common a sight as sidewalk cafés and baguettes. The bicycle network appears set up to help Parisians close the “first mile/last mile gap” that often exists in a trip using public transit. I would love to see Los Angeles and other U.S. cities with mass transit networks pursue a similar course.
Finally, we ended our vacation by hanging out in the pedestrian paradises that are old Spanish cities. Barcelona, our first stop, was seemingly built to make walking a pleasurable experience, with interesting side streets, promenades, and commercial districts around every corner. Barcelona and other Spanish cities like Granada and Toledo also make good use of shared streets, or woonerfs, to make streets safe in constrained neighborhoods.
Finally, the many plazas and parklets in Spain’s cities were a never-ending source of resting space and excellent people watching.
Although very different in many ways, Los Angeles can and should follow the lead of European cities by creating safe and pleasurable spaces for people to walk or bike and be outside enjoying our near-perfect weather. And I’m proud to say that the LA region is beginning to seriously take on that mission. Both Long Beach and Temple City now have cycle tracks. LA County Metro is planning a regional bike share program. And through the LA Department of Transportation’s People St. program, several plazas and parklets have been created or are planned for previously underused road space. I’m excited that our leaders are beginning to push for progressive changes to restore some balance to how we move around our own cities.

Working in 3 Labs Over 5 Weeks in Copenhagen— What I Learned,https://moloonaila.medium.com/working-in-3-labs-over-5-weeks-in-copenhagen-what-i-learned-beb76abdf8c5,"Sign up

In the ninth grade I came across bioplastics, plastics derived from renewable biomass, for the first time. Since then I have spent hundreds of hours researching the space and coming up with an idea for a bioplastic made from duckweed. The thought process was that bioplastics today generally come from biomass like corn, potatoes, sugar cane, etc. but these take up acres of land to grow and need to be consumed by humans (especially with the rise in climate change causing a shortage in food supply). Thus, duckweed, although possessing a bit of an odd name, has been a large focus of mine for two years now.
Shortly after I discovered bioplastics, the CEO of Pond Biomaterials became a mentor of mine. Pond is a startup based out of Denmark and I have been working with them (virtually) for these two years. This summer, though, I finally got to come to Denmark in person and Pond set me up to work in three labs across Copenhagen for five weeks, including Novozymes, the Technical University of Denmark, and the University of Copenhagen.
The reason for three labs instead of just one is that to build this project requires work in many different areas of science, including microbiology, biochemistry, and chemistry.
Below, I will go over what I worked on in each lab as well as my biggest learnings / takeaways.
Novozymes was the first lab I worked in. This is a private company, and the world leader in industrial enzyme production. I had never worked on my project in a lab that was not in a university, so this was a very different experience. I worked closely with Ulla Rosenberg and Kim Borch, two individuals I am incredibly lucky to have met. I always had help in the lab and the support was unreal. My days were usually 9–11 hours long but there was always someone by my side sticking it out with me and it was honestly so much fun.
For the first week I worked on an optimized enzymatic procedure for the duckweed. We experimented with different parameters and got the highest glucose concentrations I have seen out of my duckweed. I learned a lot about enzymes themselves, dilution series, and how to run an assay.
The next few days, I worked on fermenting the sugar solutions where I was in the microbiology lab with Robin Dorau trying to produce lactic acid. Some of the things I learned about were buffering capacities, measuring the optical density of bacteria via a spectrophotometer, and how to ensure the bacteria had enough nutrients. We ended up getting very high lactic acid concentrations, although I also learned about some other compounds present in my mixtures that have led to more discoveries about the duckweed and experiments themselves.
We were working large scale, with hundreds of grams of duckweed, so we had to be innovative with our setups. It doesn’t matter what lab you are working in: you always have to do some improvisation. Here are some examples of us simply having to figure it out:
1.) We had to have our samples stirring at a certain temperature for the enzymes to optimally operate, however our system kept dropping in temperature. In order for the setup to be self sufficient, we improvised and used aluminum and towels for insulation, and poured boiling water into the tub our samples were in. It worked like a charm, but definitely looked a little interesting.
2.) Another scenario where we had to just figure it out was when our samples would not filter prior to fermentation. I have been working on a smaller scale in Ottawa so although filtering was an issue I wasn’t on as much of a time crunch and had less material to work with. What we ended up doing was going to the brewery lab and their pressure filters (used for beer) worked perfectly. This taught me another valuable lesson, which was the importance of interconnectedness and asking others — even if in a completely different space of work — for help. Working at Novozymes was so unique because there are so many individuals working on different things and yet everyone can help each other, even a beer brewery lab and a biotech lab.
One more valuable lesson for me was to not always trust the results you get. When we did colorimetric analysis (basically determining the concentration of a chemical compound using a colour reagent) we got very low lactic acid concentrations which was honestly very disappointing because I never would have expected my results to be in this ball park. Later, though, we ran an HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography, a method that is much more precise) and our results were over 20x higher than we had initially thought. This really changed the next steps that had to be taken, so it’s important to ensure that when doing a test like an assay or something generally less precise (usually because they are easier and cheaper) they can have large margins of error in the results they yield.
The second lab I worked in was at the Technical University of Denmark, DTU. Here I was working on something I had never done before: the separation of lactic acid from the fermentation mixture. This process was quite difficult and was certainly not a success, but I learned a lot about purification technologies and namely, their complexity.
My biggest takeaway was to not underestimate how much time something new can take. I would have figured I would have learned this by now but it’s easy to have too high of expectations in science. Since I had never worked on the purification side of things before, I did not fully comprehend the difficulty of it until I tried it out. Researching and ideating is one thing, and actually doing it is something else entirely! For example, we attempted something called an azeotropic distillation on my first day (see the photo below) which theoretically should have worked quite easily but in fact did not at all. Even removing the water without evaporating other compounds was hugely complex and when I researched what to do, I was greeted with hundreds of research papers.
Thus, I learned something else that was very important which was to keep my solutions as clean as possible. What I mean by this is that in prior steps to the purification I am adding enzymes, buffers, extracts, etc. to my mixtures, but I have to in reality remove everything to get pure lactic acid at the end. When working on prior steps it is very important to keep in mind the end goal and future steps that must also be optimized for.
Another takeaway was to utilize online videos for the use of analytical equipment because there is so much online that can help. I had to be much more independent in this lab, and through a video I learned how to do infrared spectroscopy which was very helpful.
I had a hard time coping with failure at this lab overall but it offered many insights into what comes next in this project, as this step will be the key to producing the bioplastic and will be a challenge on its own.
Finally, I worked at the University of Copenhagen with Peter Ulvskov, a professor in plant biology. This tied more into what I had been working on at Novozymes, but instead of optimizing the enzymes being added to the biomass we were working on what could happen even prior to this: cell wall degradation, mechanical methods of breakdown, etc. Honestly, I found this so much fun and full of learning. I truly got to understand the duckweed to a greater extent, like what exists in it that may inhibit bacterial growth, what polysaccharides it contains, and how the starch granules behave. For the first time I got to look at the duckweed under a microscope — microscopy was actually key in my work at KU. For example, before degradation of the cell walls, we could see the starch granules stuck in the duckweed cells (left image, where the granules are dark blue) and then after we could see the granules released from the cells (right image).
Something else we worked on was the removal of pigmentation from the duckweed to explore how this may hinder future steps in my procedures (see the below picture, where the rightmost beaker contains a much lower content of chlorophyll). I found I was looking at duckweed through a different lens because of how much unique experimentation I got to do at the university.
Likely my biggest takeaway was the significance of writing absolutely everything down and taking many pictures. This is of course something I have always had to do in the lab but Peter put a lot of emphasis on organization and I came up with a much better system for taking notes, keeping track of which photos are which, etc. It can be easy to recognize what a microscopy image is showing a few minutes after you’ve taken it, but a month later, the importance of that image to you may be gone.
My second takeaway was to keep in mind everything that is required for each part of my project and look at how this may translate to a real world protocol. For example, when we were grinding the duckweed we made sure to use equipment that could be scaled up easily as opposed to only something that works small scale.
Another one of my learnings was the importance of going back to the very beginning — the foundations of a project — because this is where the most improvement can transpire. Breaking down the cell walls to a greater extent was not helping me in the purification of the lactic acid, but eventually it could help me get more lactic acid to work with by creating improvements in glucose yields. Every step holds weight.
All in all, getting to spend time in Copenhagen was such a neat experience and I am so grateful to everyone who helped me. I also felt that I became a more independent person as I lived alone for around five days which I have never done before! Getting to meet my supervisor Martin from Pond was a huge highlight, as well as exploring the wonderful city (and the crêpe stands👩🏽‍🍳).

I remember seeing the term Hygge for the first time while looking for Airbnb experiences in Copenhagen. A quick google search showed that Hygge meant “a cozy quality that makes a person feel content and comfortable”. It gave me the image of resting by the fireplace on a cold winter’s night, which didn’t feel too relevant for my upcoming summer trip, so I kind of forgot about it.
When I was in Copenhagen, I remember feeling occasional waves of inner joy, in a “just glad to be here” kind of way. It was otherwise sublime and hard to describe, and even harder to attribute the cause. I didn’t try to analyze it too much — after all, I was on vacation and taking in the idyllic vibes of a Danish summer.
On the metro to the airport, we zoomed past a father and his child running through some grassy expanses with the backdrop of the sea. I remember feeling a sense of delight and ease, and recalled the term Hygge; that’s when I realized I had profoundly learned what it meant during my trip.
I won’t try to describe what Hygge is; I reckon you have to experience this for yourself to understand. But I’ll tell you some things when I was in Copenhagen that brought me Hygge, and also some that did not.

Name: Malene Sabinsky
What do you do all day? Boss people around and talk very loudly– no really, that’s what project managers do. *laughs*
Hometown: Copenhagen, Denmark
Hunting territory: Copenhagen and beyond
Can you tell us a bit about the difference between the street art in you town compared to the rest of the world? As in, what makes your town really stand out!? I don’t know if there’s a major difference, as a lot of international artists have made pieces in Copenhagen too, but of course the local artist make it completely unique.
Where do most artists get there inspiration from in your town? That would be unfair of me to answer, as I don’t know.
Is there more currated or illegal work? The murals are mostly curated, but there is also a fair bit of illegal activity
What is that one artwork you need to see in your hunting territory? I have to cheat and choose two: DALeast because I cycle past it everyday, and never tire of looking at it. Copenhagen, for me, wouldn’t be the same without it now. And ‘Creativity is Freedom’ by Danish artist Don John. I really love his work, and there are so many great pieces by him around town.
Who introduced you to the street art scene? Nobody did. I am still waiting for my official introduction :-)
When were you infected with the hunter virus? I’m a newbie really *laughs* I’ve had an interest for at long time. I lived in London for many years, and it’s hard not to notice and appreciate street art when living there. But it didn’t actually become a real (active) passion until summer 2015, when i saw the Surface exhibition by Danish photographer Søren Solkær in Copenhagen. And alongside this, I followed the creation of new murals for “Outdoor Surface” (the DalEast piece being one of these).
My hunting kit includes: It’s a very simple kit: bicycle, iphone, headphones and wind in my hair.
When you are out shooting, how much of it is instinctual versus planned? With increased passion comes increased planning! Of course I still stumble upon new pieces when on general eplorations, but mostly I plan to go to a certain place, because there is something specific I want to see.
Do you take photos more for yourself, or for others? Mostly for myself, but I don’t mind sharing :-)
How would you define your style in taking photo’s or writing a (instagram) post? Lacking style in general! I’m not a skilled photographer, so it’s a good thing the art speaks for itself. The same goes for posts. I’m too impatient to write a lot, so an artist credit and an emoji tends to suffice.
Who are some of your favorite classic photographers, and how did they influence you? I like a lot of photographers: Cindy Sherman, Martin Parr, Nan Goldin, William Eggleston, Andreas Gursky etc. And of course I have to mention both Søren Solkær and Martha Cooper, for combining the art of photography and street art. They haven’t influenced me in any particular way, I just admire their skill and art.
What is your biggest challenge of being a hunter? Too much rain, and too little time.
What is the best piece of advice I can give to newbie hunters? Be curious and open-minded. Credit artists where you can , they deserve it. Do it out of passion and interest, not the likes.
Or ignore all that, and just download the app and get yourself a bicycle.
Can you tell us the most exiting hunter story? Any close calls with getting your equipment robbed or caught by the police? Haha, no close calls at all. I’m too well behaved.
I will share a non-exciting, but vivid hunter memory with you though: I was touring California (and beyond) with my two kids a few months back, and when we stopped over in Vegas, we had to go hunting. I had no connection on my phone, so my son got the job of navigating using the Street Art Cities website (see, it’s so easy even a kid can use it!). After some time with no results, I was getting pretty hot and bothered, but suddenly my son stops and points. And I very loadly exclaim: “Woaw, Martin Whatson”. The look of pride in his eyes for having found it, combined with the beauty of the wall, was just priceless.
My most recent discovery in the street art scene is: Not so recent, but during the summer I found some great stencils in Copenhagen, there are four really close to each other. I haven’t found any more across town, and don’t know anything about the artist, apart from the signature ‘Jochum’. I’m dead curious, really like the pieces, and want to see and know more.
Name a few artists you like to follow and why. These artists are all Danish, have their very own style, are super talented, and can be found around the streets of Copenhagen:
Do you collect art books, T-shirts, and other things? What’s the most valuable item for you? No, I’m not much of a collector as such, but I’m dead chuffed with a small piece by Tankpetrol, I bought and just received in the post the other day.
What is your favorite location fellow hunters should definitely visit? Don’t miss a visit to Bolsjefabrikken where local artist make new pieces all the time, cruise down Rentemestervej — possible the one street in Copenhagen with the mist murals. And of course Christiania — for art and the rest — but don’t pull out your camera on pusher street unless you specifically are collecting “exciting hunter stories”.
What are the benefits you find being part of a street art collective? Having found so many people with the same passion and so many of whom are very knowledgeable, and great photographers. I will start inviting myself for coffee and tours when I travel, so be warned.
Last but not least. What is the most valuable thing about Street Art Cities? The app is fantastic. It’s a great resource when travelling.

Copenhagen surprised me in the best way. It’s not loud or flashy, but quietly brilliant — measured, functional, and full of life in subtle ways. It might not be for everyone, but for me personally, this was the best city I’ve visited so far.
Here’s a breakdown of my impressions, what’s worth seeing, and what (and where) to eat.
Copenhagen feels like it was designed for a self-contained urban human — someone who values clean lines, efficient systems, and doesn’t need the sun to be in their top three happiness factors.
It’s expensive, but everything you get feels fair. There’s no sense of being ripped off — just a steady, Nordic standard of quality. English is almost a second official language, spoken equally well by both the young and the old. That stood out and made everything smoother.
The people are polite, helpful, but emotionally reserved. Not cold, not snobby — just calmly distant. The city itself is beautifully quiet: no diesel engines, no honking, no chaos. Cash is barely accepted, tips are not expected, and digital payments are the norm.
Public transport is flawless — fast, clean, reliable, and not overcrowded. The metro system especially impressed me. The cycling culture is on another level: wide, protected bike lanes on both sides of the street, and visibly fewer cars and parking spots than in Zagreb.
It’s not as immigrant-friendly as, say, London, and that affects the atmosphere slightly. Still, Copenhagen delivers a kind of living standard and order that’s rare anywhere else.
Home of CarlsbergMore than just a brewery tour. This place ties together Danish beer, scientific progress, and art collecting. Jacob and Carl Jacobsen — father and son — are the central figures here. The father was a master brewer, the son added branding finesse and a love of the arts. They even established their own science lab, where in 1883 they solved the problem of “beer sickness” (a sudden souring of beer) by isolating pure yeast. Today, they’ve created a keg that triples shelf life. The visit includes a tour and beer tastings.
GlyptoteketA stunning museum founded by the Jacobsen family, housing collections of Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Danish, and French art. My favorites were the sarcophagi, the mummies, and The Prodigal Son sculpture. The building itself is a piece of art.
Tivoli GardensThe second-oldest amusement park in the world and the inspiration for Disneyland. It’s charming and atmospheric, though pricey. I took my first and probably last rollercoaster ride here. Worth it for the vibe alone.
Danish Design MuseumDesign is taken seriously here — from childhood education to everyday product aesthetics. We saw an exhibition on the development of Irma, a 137-year-old supermarket brand that brought graphic design into daily life. Another focused on natural, innovative materials (chairs from mushrooms, lamps made from cow intestines, dresses from milk-industry waste). Unfortunately, the furniture design exhibit was closed for renovations.
NyhavnA classic Copenhagen postcard: colorful houses along a canal, boats bobbing in the water. It’s a bit of a tourist trap, but still worth seeing — especially if the sun comes out. HC Andersen once lived in one of these houses while writing his first fairy tale.
Freetown ChristianiaA self-declared autonomous neighborhood built on former military land. Around 1,000 people live there — hippies, artists, and others drawn to alternative living. It’s more a sociological curiosity than an actual utopia. Don’t expect magic, but it’s interesting for a short visit.
Rosenborg Castle & KastelletRosenborg is a small Renaissance castle built by Christian IV in the early 1600s. It’s beautifully preserved. Nearby, Kastellet is a pentagon-shaped military fortress, still in use today and perfect for a peaceful stroll.
Food in Copenhagen is pricey. Meals range from 110 to 250 DKK (€15–€34), pastries from 40 DKK (€5.50), and craft beers between 60–80 DKK (€8–€11). But the quality makes it worthwhile.
Here’s what stood out:
Gasoline GrillNamed one of the top 27 burgers in the world by Bloomberg — and the only one from Europe. It’s served from a small former gas station with four cheerful employees. Probably the best burger I’ve ever had.
Juno the BakeryThe cardamom bun here genuinely moved people to tears. The founder is a former Noma chef, and it shows. The almond croissant and pain au chocolat are also top-tier.
Format Café (inside the Design Museum)New Nordic simplicity done right. The carrot soup with tarragon oil, cream, almonds, and sourdough was exceptional. The open sandwich with chicken, beetroot, capers, kale, horseradish, and a mystery cream was surprisingly rich and complex. Easily one of the best meals.
SeksA stylish brunch spot. The chive-and-pepper omelet was solid, the apple pancake with cream excellent, and the Moroccan green tea unforgettable. Small portions, though.
Warpigs BrewpubTexas BBQ in a Danish setting. Three meats (smoked pork, beef, spicy sausage), mac & cheese, beans, slaw, and on-site craft beer. Heavy, indulgent, and very American in vibe — but worth it.
Broens Street Food MarketGreat spot on the docks. We had organic fish & chips with an IPA under the sun. Simple, fresh, satisfying.
Sankt Peders BakeryThe oldest bakery in Copenhagen, open since 1652. Try the Wednesday cinnamon roll — sold only on Wednesdays. They make up to 4,000 in a single day.
Absalon FolkehusetA unique community lunch in a converted Lutheran church. We had rice with spinach, almonds, coriander, and a peppery sauce. At just 60 DKK, it was the cheapest cooked meal we found — and still delicious.
Pølser Hot DogsThe Danish street food staple. Tried two: one at Carlsberg and one at John’s Hotdog Deli at the main station (Bourdain-approved). Both were solid, nothing mind-blowing.
GRØDA porridge-focused mini-chain. The classic version with apples, cinnamon, roasted almonds, and caramel was pure comfort food.
Pico PizzaStandard, good pizza. Clean, consistent, and just what you need after a few fancier meals.
Copenhagen isn’t trying to win you over with flash or charm. It doesn’t need to. It simply works — quietly, confidently, and beautifully. It’s a place that respects both the individual and the collective experience. For someone who appreciates subtle details, structure, and thoughtful living, this city delivers on every level.
Without exaggeration, this is the best city I’ve ever visited — but I’d never move there, unless the sun files for residency too. 😆

Can London follow Copenhagen's heat networks example?
All London boroughs are working to reach net zero, and decarbonising how we heat our buildings is a crucial part of that journey. One key solution here is the implementation of heat networks. These currently exist in pockets of London, but we must introduce new networks and connect more households to help us towards net zero.
In May, London Councils and The Danish Embassy in London worked together to take a group of London borough officers to visit the Greater Copenhagen area, a world leader in heat networks. The visit was funded by the State of Green (a not-for-profit, public-private partnership between the Danish government and the country’s three leading business associations) and provided valuable insights into Denmark’s successful adoption of heat networks and offered lessons that could be applied to our decarbonisation efforts in London and across the UK.
Denmark has made significant progress in adopting heat networks, with over 64% of Danish homes currently heated through this system. This figure is expected to rise to approximately 72% in the near future. Denmark’s’ heat network journey began in 1903 with the installation of the first district heating (DH) plant.
However, it was the 1970s oil crisis that triggered a rapid expansion in the use of coal-powered district heating, which was followed by the introduction of natural gas. Over time, Denmark has shifted towards incorporating energy from waste and biomass, and is actively exploring various waste heat sources to further reduce emissions — as we know London boroughs like Islington are also doing.
The Greater Copenhagen Heat Network
The Greater Copenhagen Heat Network stands out as an impressive example of a large-scale district heating system. It supplies heat to approximately 500,000 households — with almost all houses connected in the inner municipalities of the region. It relies on various heat producers, including combined heat and power (CHP) plants, waste-to-energy facilities, and reserve and peak load plants burning fossil fuels. The network also incorporates heat storage systems to ensure efficient and reliable distribution.
What did we visit?
During the visit, we had the opportunity to explore different aspects of Denmark’s heat network infrastructure and solutions. We learnt about the background of heat network development in the Greater Copenhagen region and witnessed initiatives such as the District Cooling system in Copenhagen, a large waste-to-energy facility in Roskilde, and the consumer-owned Greve Municipal District Heating company. We also observed smaller-scale innovative solutions, such as a Danfoss project to capture and recirculate heat from supermarket refrigerators in Energy Lab Nordhavn.
We gained insights into energy-renovated social housing and a low-temperature heat network in the Municipality of Albertslund. We also saw an exciting new heat pump system being installed to that extract energy from drinking water in Frederiksberg, in the heart of the city region of Copenhagen.
We learnt about the vital role of local government and municipal companies in planning, financing, developing, and operating heat networks in Denmark. The experience showcased the importance of effective and resourced local government to drive collaboration among stakeholders, all underpinned by strong regulation which gives price certainty to consumers.
We also learnt how heat networks have been expanding rapidly in response to global energy price increases, and that demand is higher for houses on heat networks.
The visit highlighted both some key differences and similarities between Denmark and the UK in terms of how we heat our buildings. However, both countries share similar climates, building characteristics, and ambitions for achieving net-zero emissions so sharing knowledge will help us both. We were happy to learn that the UK government is actively working with the Danish government to develop UK heat network policy, with a focus on introducing heat zoning which will help increase the uptake of heat networks.
This visit to Copenhagen offered valuable insights for London’s decarbonisation efforts. The Renewable Power for London Programme will be incorporating these as part of its Decentralised Energy workstream to help London Local Government accelerate our transition.

Welcome, wanderlust-driven adventurers, to the enchanting city of Copenhagen! Nestled on the scenic shores of Denmark, this vibrant metropolis boasts a mesmerizing blend of rich history, modern design, and irresistible charm. I would always stop by Copenhagen if I needed to fly from the Kastrup Airport. It is the coolest capital in the Nordic country in my opinion. In this article, five must-do experiences will be unveiled. So, grab your sense of adventure and let’s dive into the heart of this magical Danish capital!
Escape the hustle and bustle of the city and find tranquility amidst the lush greenery of the Rosenborg Garden. Located in the heart of Copenhagen, this expansive park is the perfect spot to enjoy a leisurely picnic surrounded by natural beauty in the typical Nodic summer afternoon. Spread out your blanket on the soft grass, bask in the warm Danish sunshine, and savor a delicious spread of local treats, a nice Danish sandwich will be a great choice.
The garden’s meticulously embedded flowers, tranquil ponds, and majestic trees provide a picturesque backdrop for your picnic. As you indulge in your culinary delights, take a moment to admire the stunning Renaissance-style Rosenborg Castle, which stands as a guardian over the garden. Whether you’re seeking a romantic escape or a peaceful retreat with friends and family, picnicking in the Rosenborg Garden is an absolute must-do in Copenhagen.
Step into a world straight out of a Hans Christian Andersen story at the iconic Tivoli Gardens. This whimsical amusement park, dating back to 1843, exudes an atmosphere of wonder and nostalgia. Stroll through enchanting gardens, take a thrilling ride on the roller coasters, and enjoy live performances by talented musicians and actors. As dusk descends, Tivoli transforms into a mesmerizing wonderland of twinkling lights, with charming food stalls offering delicious treats. Tivoli Gardens truly encapsulates the essence of Copenhagen’s charm and should not be missed.
For those seeking retail therapy, Strøget is an absolute must. This bustling pedestrian street stretches across the heart of Copenhagen and is one of Europe’s longest shopping streets. Lose yourself in a retail wonderland as you walk by the high-end boutiques, trendy international brands, and Danish design stores one after another. But Strøget is not just about shopping — it’s a vibrant hub of entertainment, with street performers, charming cafés, and historical landmarks along the way, like Round Tower, City Hall and the Parliament building. Take your time to explore the side streets and hidden courtyards, where you’ll stumble upon unique treasures and delightful surprises.
At the end of the pedestrian street, you can see the most colorful corner of Copenhagen, Nyhavn. It gives you a chance to embrace the picturesque waterfront district that perfectly captures the city’s allure. Its vibrant row of colorful 17th-century townhouses will transport you to a time when sailors, artists, and dreamers roamed these very streets. Stroll along the canal, admiring the quaint boats floating on the water, and indulge in the delectable Danish pastries at the local cafés. Nyhavn is a haven for photographers, and you’ll find endless photo opportunities at every corner. Soak up the lively atmosphere, raise a glass of Carlsberg, and toast to the beauty of Copenhagen.
Prepare to enter a world within a world at Christiania, an autonomous neighborhood that defies convention and embraces its own unique spirit. Founded in the early 1970s, this self-proclaimed “freetown” is a haven for artists, musicians, activists, and free thinkers. Meander through the colorful streets, adorned with vibrant murals, and immerse yourself in the eclectic atmosphere. Discover artisanal shops, organic cafés, and offbeat music venues. While Christiania’s unconventional nature may not be for everyone, it offers a fascinating glimpse into a subculture that celebrates creativity and alternative lifestyles, concurring with a typical hedonist Danish image.
While you’re around the neighborhood, why not visit the top of the Vor Frelsers Kirke? From there, you can look over the whole city, with everything under your eyes. The church also preserves the oldest pipe organs in Copenhagen.
In Copenhagen, where fairy tales blend with regal history, a visit to both Amalienborg and the Little Mermaid promises a captivating journey through time and folklore. Begin your royal escapade at Amalienborg, the present royal castle and residence of the Danish royal family. Marvel at the elegant architecture as you explore the majestic palace complex, composed of four identical rococo-style palaces surrounding an enchanting courtyard. Witness the Changing of the Guard ceremony, where soldiers in their distinctive bearskin hats create a scene straight out of a storybook.
From the regal splendor of Amalienborg, venture to the tranquil shores of Langelinie to meet the iconic Little Mermaid. A short stroll along the promenade leads you to the petite bronze statue perched on a rock, gazing longingly into the sea. This beloved symbol of Copenhagen, inspired by Hans Christian Andersen’s enchanting tale, captures the imagination of visitors from around the world. If you are lucky, you may see swans along side with the mermaid, making this walk even more fairytale-like.
Copenhagen, with its blend of history and creativity, is a destination that promises to captivate every traveler. It is a perfect choice for those who come to visit Scandinavia for the first time. Whether you find yourself lost in the whimsical world of Tivoli Gardens, savoring the colorful sights of Nyhavn, or immersing yourself in the bohemian allure of Christiania, this enchanting city will leave an unforgettable mark on your soul.

There’s a particular kind of focus that lives in voiceover. Not just technical — emotional, too.
As an actor, I’ve found something grounding in the simplicity of sound: a way to stay close to character, even between larger productions. Whether for narration, commercials, or more character-driven work, I approach VO as an extension of acting, just pared down to its essentials.

I’m a New York City girl.
I grew up in the neighborhood of Washington Heights, the area of Manhattan north of Harlem.
On the street I lived, everyone knew everyone. Apartment doors were often left open so kids could run back and forth. If we were out late —which meant once the streetlights were on — we’d be told by an adult, any adult, it was time to go home.
Home for me was on the fifth floor of a tenement building. And our apartment stood out in that drab building because our windows were covered with climbing blue morning glory my father planted every spring.
Those flowers were a bright spot on an otherwise colorless city street.
It’s years since we were back, and this summer it was a trip down memory lane when my husband Billy and I visited “the City”.
Billy grew up in Greenwich Village. Long the home of artists, his father, the abstract expressionist painter Harold Anton, had among his contemporaries, Jackson Pollock, as well as the…

Let me start by saying, I'm a huge fan of the S-train network in Copenhagen, Denmark, and especially for the simple and direct communication the transit map of the network provides. The design of the existing map is clean and simple. But it still has in my opinion some flaws and are missing some vital details.
So I have tried to make my own revised S-train map for Copenhagen, based of course on the existing map of the network. With tweaks and improvement to make it easier to navigate as a user.
Just want to see the new map, jump straight to it here.

ISRAELS PLADS
Copenhagen, Denmark
Introduction
Israels Plads is an urban plaza situated in Copenhagen, Denmark. It was conceptualised by Sweco Architects and Cobe in 2007 when the Copenhagen municipality invited Danish architects to reconstruct Copenhagen’s largest public square, which had fallen into disrepair as a derelict parking lot. [1] This essay will analyse the aftermath of the project to determine how successful the architects were in terms of heritage integration, user experience, and inclusivity.
Copenhagen is the capital and most populous city of Denmark. It was previously a Viking fishing village, and became the capital in the early 15th century. Since the early 2000’s Copenhagen has seen some strong urban and cultural development, led by the Copenhagen Municipality, through investments in its institutions and infrastructure. Israels Plads is one such urban regeneration project.
According to Cobe, the idea of transforming Israels Plads was to celebrate the significance of the history of the square, and to revitalize it, by turning it into a “vibrant, diverse plaza for leisure and sport, used by all kinds of people.” [7] Right from the get-go, we see that the architects placed a lot of importance on heritage integration, user experience and inclusivity.
The new site consists of an underground car park, with two blocks of buildings (a retail park and a private educational institute) to the North-West and South-East, along with two large market halls (“Torvehallerne”, which opened in 2011 and quickly became very popular, currently housing numerous cafés) to the North-East. The Plads also provides a link to a massive park (“Ørstedsparken”) to the South-West (Fig 1), acting as a transition from the bustling city to the serene park. [7]
Figure 1 Israels Plads seen as an urban carpet (Cobe, 2014) Edited by author
Above the underground car park, the plaza acts as a multifunction space, housing a large playground, sports arena, skatepark, and areas for people-watching. At the centre of the square is an “egg-shaped area” (Fig 2), used by nearby schools as an extended recreational zone for all age groups. [2]
Figure 2: Landscaping Plan of the Site (Cobe, 2014) Edited by author
History
The space has historical significance dating back to the 13th century when Denmark built their stone wall fortifications and established a central plaza at this spot, where the city ended in a ring of protective ramparts. During the city’s extension in the late 19th century, with the demolition of the old city walls (that were now outdated defence mechanisms), the site became a vibrant market square. Israels Plads is placed on top of these historic ramparts (Fig 3).
Figure 3 Diagram of the city’s old fortifications, and Israels Plads’ location relative to the ramparts (Cobe, 2014)
According to Zerlang (2008), the square served as a starting point and meeting point for the forces of modern life [1], since its inception in the 1870s (Fig 4) and its renaming in 1968 as “Israels Plads”, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the “rescue of the Danish Jews”.[3]
Israels Plads was previously the home of Grønttorvet (1889–1958), a major market for fresh produce known for its special atmosphere (Fig 5). Due to the increase in traffic around the market and growing logistics needs, the market was relocated and the once-bustling square degenerated into an inner-city eyesore and occasional parking lot (Fig 6). [2]
Figure 4: The site being used as a market in 1889–1954
Figure 5: The Food Market, around 1990 (Copenhagen by Design, 2015)
“The plaza used to be empty, especially in the evening, and there were a lot of drug dealers” — Hans Peter Hagens (Architect of the Torvehallerne, adjacent to Israels Plads) [13]
Figure 6: The site’s usage as a parking lot in the 1950’s — 1990's
City Scale
The main reason for the decline of Israels Plads was the city and traffic planners’ inability and unwillingness to put city space and city life high on their agenda. Attempting to ensure the best conditions for car traffic, along with the mismanagement of the city-planning sector has led to multiple public squares such as this one being converted to dingy parking lots, teeming with crime and making the city unsafe, unsustainable and unhealthy. [4]
Jan Gehl, in his book “Cities for People”, criticises the Copenhagen municipality, for putting a low priority on public space, pedestrianism and the role of city space as a meeting place for urban dwellers. However, in recent decades, the government has realised its folly, and started reversing its erroneous moves by restructuring their street network, removing driving lanes and parking places in a deliberate process to create better and safer conditions for bicycle traffic. [4] The city of Copenhagen has a goal for its residents to “spend 20% more time in public spaces by 2025,” [7] and Copenhagen’s bicycles now save 90,000 tons of CO2 every year. Gehl notes that “[Copenhagen] has significantly improved conditions for life in city space in recent decades. Pedestrian traffic has grown, and the number of recreational optional activities has swelled.” [4] It is important to note that Gehl uses the term “optional” to describe activities that can only be done in good conditions, as opposed to “necessary” activities, such as going to school/work and grocery shopping, which have to be done regardless of the weather conditions. One by one the parking places in the city centre have been turned into squares that accommodate public life. [4]
Figure 7: The new and improved Israels Plads (Cobe, 2014)
Recent Developments
A change was triggered in the area of Israels Plads, due to the decision to erect the two market halls (Torvehallerne) on the site, evoking the “aura of the old vegetable market”. [2] The council’s brief for the reconstruction of Israels Plads demanded that the design concept should relate itself to the “history of the square, to the architecture of the surrounding houses, to the Ørstedspark at the southern end of the square and the Botanical Garden and the market halls at the northern end of the square”. [1]
The winning submission by Cobe and Sweco Architects envisaged a “flying carpet” spread across the entire square, where the cars would be “swept under the rug” with underground parking and organically shaped areas that are punched out of the surface to provide a variety of public recreational functions (Fig 7 and 8). [2]
Figure 8: The layers of Israels Plads, as envisioned by Sweco Architects and Cobe (Cobe, 2014)
User Experience
Zerlang (2008) declares that in the modern city, experiences are staged, and architects increasingly treat urban space with the eye of a scenographer. [1] Understanding that the consideration for the individual and their experiences presents a major challenge for modern urban planning, the question of “experiences” had a very high priority in the commission. The Council added a demand that the concept should consider the activities on the square, and also the pre-existing activities of the school children from the Zahles Skole (adjacent to Israels Plads), and the potential activities of the new-arranged square. [1]
The transformation of the public square focuses on its revitalisation as a living urban space [2]. Gehl (2010) urged urban planners and architects to reinforce pedestrianism as an integrated city policy to develop “lively, safe, sustainable and healthy” cities. He also ascertains that it is equally urgent to strengthen the social function of city space as a meeting place. [4]
Israels Plads provides a cohesive structure that offers “short walking distances, attractive public spaces, and a variation of urban functions”. These elements increase activity and the feeling of security in and around the space. [4]
Studies from inner-city shopping streets in Copenhagen show happenings, events and building sites where we can watch people perform, play music, etc. attract far more people to linger and watch than shops along building facades. Studies of benches and chairs in city space show correspondingly that seats with the best view of city life are used far more frequently than those that do not offer a view of other people. [4] The seating areas in Israels Plads are positioned so that people-watching is facilitated. The sloping sides of the sunken playing field can serve both as a barrier and as seating. [2] Wedge-shaped staircases at the western and eastern corners of the square offer a good view from an elevated position (Fig 9). [2]
Figure 9: Users seated on the wedge-shaped stairs, enjoying a sunny day (Cobe, 2014)
“The plaza has opened up to the historical landscape next door. The tree and water elements of the park are echoed on the plaza surface, and circles have been cut out to accentuate the big trees standing on the transition between city and park” (Fig 10) [7]
Figure 10: The cutouts on the plaza used to accentuate the trees. (Copenhagen Design News, 2020)
The cut-outs feature round bench formations underneath the trees, where people can observe the life unfolding on the plaza, a pre-requisite for Gehl’s ideal public space (Fig 11). The localised light zones of areas sheltered by trees also create an intimate setting for groups of people to gather and enjoy the night. The overheads and multiple sources of illumination, according to Schaack (2018), allow for visibility and facial recognition, which is crucial for users to trust their environment and the people using it. [3]
Figure 11: Round bench formations, ideal for people-watching (Copenhagen Design News, 2020)
Cobe’s founder, Dan Stubbergaard appreciates that Israels Plads has become a public meeting place and a playground for three different schools all year round. [7] It also helps that the design incorporates skateable aspects into the architecture of the space. Activities such as skateboarding, basketball and scootering are encouraged, which invites a lot more schoolchildren into the space. [11] Even the lighting is optimised for play. Four different lighting systems illustrate the complexity of the space at night. One of them illuminates the centre of the plaza to answer the need for visibility of sports users, basketball players and skateboarders. [3]
Figure 12: The public uses the Plads even in unfavourable weather conditions (Cobe, 2014)
Heritage Integration
“[The plaza] has a sculptural expression that refers to its historical past as part of the fortifications” [3] “Along the facades, a band of traditional Copenhagen pavement with granite slabs and Nordic cobblestones runs around the square (Fig 13), connecting the granite plate to its surroundings.” [8] These material choices are a throwback to traditional Danish building methods, and also match the colourful historical facades from the 18th century.
Figure 13: Nordic cobblestones and demarcation strips around Israels Plads (Copenhagen Design News, 2020)
The square itself often became the scene of political demonstrations in the 1880s [1] Similar to the 1880s, the square is still used for political demonstrations. In May 2019, the Revolutionary Antifascists group, organised a demonstration at the Israels Plads. [9] More recently, in October 2021, students of the University of Copenhagen assembled at the Plads to protest the University’s investment in Pro-Israeli companies that are involved in the demolition of Palestinian homes and building the Apartheid wall [10]. It is interesting to see how the Israels Plads’ usage has differed only very slightly from its original uses before the 1950s. Copenhagen also hosts WorldPride, the international festival celebrating the LGBTQ+ community, and one of the parades goes through the Israels Plads. [12]
Inclusivity
“This is where children play during recess, where friends meet for a beer after work, and where Copenhageners meet for flea markets (Fig 14) on Saturdays” [7]
Figure 14: The Flea Market that opens up on the Plads on Saturdays (Cobe, 2014)
An issue that I came across quite often when researching the inclusivity of such spaces, is the prevalence of anti-homeless architecture and exclusionary design, whether on purpose or a subconscious choice. A space such as this cannot be celebrated for its inclusivity, if it does not support ALL its citizens, including the homeless, individuals struggling with addiction, and the unemployed. Israels Plads has round benches with metal dividers (Fig 11), making them uncomfortable to sleep on, while the long tiered seating (Fig 9) lacks privacy and is open to the elements, which discourages anyone from taking refuge overnight. [15]
This goes against the policies of Jan Gehl’s “Humanist City” [4], pushing Copenhagen’s most vulnerable citizens out of the public space. Nina Hoegh (Director of Projekt Udenfor (Project Outside)) agrees, stating that catering urban design exclusively to the needs of the middle class in this way sends an implicit message about whom the city values. [15] Public space should be accessible and welcoming for all, without privileging one person or group over another. [16]
“Homelessness must be eradicated, but this process won’t happen overnight. Public places need to design for this reality, not ignore it” [16] Therefore I affirm that the architects of the Israels Plads have not been successful in their efforts to make the space inclusive.
Purpose Fulfilment
The architects have designed a method of directing cloudburst water into an artificial creek, which leads to a large water reserve in the adjacent park. However, their wish that the creek is an aesthetic and pleasant water feature during all other times did not come true, as the “creek” is almost always dry (Fig 15), and may be a hazard for a skateboarding student, or a person with a vision impairment. [7] The Danish Design Review also noted that the fountains and water channel at the park end are rarely running. [14]
Figure 15: The “Artifical Creek”, currently dry (Copenhagen by Design, 2015)
Despite its shortcomings, the plaza does serve as a new public space adding to the social and environment of Copenhagen, while fulfilling the still-existing demand for car parking in the city. The design of the space follows the policy of Copenhagen to be a sustainable and user-friendly city by connecting to the neighbouring park and food market, offering a recreational space with seating areas and sports facilities. [3] Israels Plads has accomplished its goal of being a multi-use space, seeing that it serves as a schoolyard during the daytime, a public basketball court and skate park during the afternoon, a “dining room” in the evening, and a flea market during the weekend. It is quite difficult to design a space where there is minimum clash between these activities, yet Cobe and Sweco Architects have managed to do it.
Figure 16: A Google Earth capture of the site by the author
Some of these new and old car-free squares seem deserted while others teem with life. The difference comes down to the fact that some squares have only been designed to “ferry” pedestrians across, while others seize the opportunity to provide an experience, so that people combine walking and staying in the area. Studies show that the latter type of square registers an activity level of between “10, 20, and sometimes 30 times higher than transit squares” [5] There is no point in having a sheer amount of space if it is not correctly designed, and this is why I believe Israels Plads has been so successful in attracting the populace of Copenhagen as a public space where children can play, adults can people-watch, and almost everyone can enjoy.

Overview
Schrödinger’s cat was a thought experiment proposed by Erwin Schrödinger in a discussion with Albert Einstein in an attempt to illustrate the insufficiencies of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. The experiment questioned the validity of superposition and posed the largely unsolved question of at which point a superposition collapses into one of its possible states.
Superposition — Young’s Double Split Experiment
Superposition plays an essential role in the Copenhagen interpretation and thus Schrödinger’s thought experiment. It is the ability of a quantum system to simultaneously exist in multiple states until observed. The idea is demonstrated by Thomas Young’s double-slit experiment, where a beam of light is aimed at a barrier with two small vertical slits. The light that has passed through the slits is measured on a photographic plate. When one of the vertical slits is covered, a single line of light is observed on the photographic plate on the side of the uncovered slit. If both are left uncovered, however, rather than two lines of light, there are many more on the photographic plate. In route to the photographic plate, each photon exists in a state of each of its possible trajectories, demonstrating a concept called interference, which is essentially the superposition of waves.
In an attempt to further analyze the trajectories of the photons, experiments have been conducted to track their paths. Doing this, however, seems to disrupt the superposition of the photons, creating what would be expected by classical physics on the photographic plate, two lines of light mirroring the slits in the preceding barrier. It appears that the superposition of a particle can not be directly measured; its effects (interference) can only be observed.
Schrödinger’s Cat
Schrödinger’s Cat is a thought experiment that was proposed by Erwin Schrödinger in a discussion with Albert Einstein to highlight the seemingly ridiculous nature of the concepts of superposition used in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. The Copenhagen interpretation briefly states that a quantum system remains in a state of superposition until directly observed by the outside world. When observed, the superposition collapses into one of its possible states. For example, when the photons in Young’s double-slit experiment were measured, they collapsed into one of their possible trajectories, creating two lines of light.
Schrödinger, attempting to disprove the practicality of superposition, proposed a hypothetical in which a larger system was dependent on the superposition of a quantum particle. Schrödinger suggested that if a cat were placed inside a sealed box with a radioactive particle and a flask of poison and the poison was only released if the particle decayed and released radiation, the mortality of the cat would be subject to the state of the radioactive particle. Because the Copenhagen interpretation states that the radioactive particle is in a position of both decayed and not decayed, the cat, by extension, will be in a position of both alive and dead until observed by the outside world. The goal was not to propose the practicality of simultaneously dead and alive cats, instead the thought experiment emphasized the unrealistic implications the Copenhagen interpretation had at a larger scale.
The thought experiment had brought to light a question that is still largely unsolved today: “At what point does a particle stop existing as a superposition and collapse into one of its possible states?” The Copenhagen interpretation had assumed this would happen when an observation of the superposition takes place.
Von Neumann Interpretation
In response to the flaws of the Copenhagen interpretation, John von Neumann proposed the idea that the radioactive particle is observed by the device that detects radiation which is subsequently observed by the controlled flask holding the poison. The point at which the superposition of the particle collapses is not significant. The only point at which the superposition must collapse is when there is a conscious observer. Even this interpretation, however, has been rejected by a thought experiment proposed by Eugene Wigner called Wigner’s friend. Other interpretations include the ensemble interpretation, relational interpretation, and transactional interpretation all with the common goal of identifying at which point a superposition collapses, a question posed by Erwin Schrödinger’s famous thought experiment: Schrödinger’s cat.

My perfect day in CPH starts in Vesterbro, my favorite neighborhood in the city. Formerly a blue-collar neighborhood, it’s known for its hipsters, dive bars, and murals, so I feel right at home, thinking of the Mission District in San Francisco, my second home I left behind.
The main drag, Istegade is grungy and chic in turns: Central Station where Istegade begins crawls with junkies and hookers. Early in the morning, that area is fogged with old cigarette smoke and the clouded eyes of unseeing street-walkers. The Danes are modestly boastful about this last bastion of filth in their practical little city, and the fact that they invented the concept of modern porn as we know it.
My morning begins with pastries. I lived in Paris for years, but I might go out on a limb and say that the Danes’ pastry and bread-making skills are on par if not slightly above the French in general. Near the end of Istegade is BRØD, where a sandy-haired young Viking stands behind the counter and gruffly hands over fresh-baked bread, steaming heft and wholesomeness in his likeness.
One of the things you must do to fully enjoy CPH is rent a bike. The bike roads are so well-paved, the city so level, and the air so crisp, it’ll make you wonder what you did to deserve this bliss. Ride down the suspended bike-only bridge by Fisketorvet mall, and head to the docks for a canal tour, preferably one where they give you warm wine, or gløgg. (I swear I’m not choosing all of these words based on the funky-looking Danish “ø,” which is called a Faroese, you nerds.)
During the tour of the Copenhagen canals, you will learn many things about this watery city, like how it was founded in 1167, about the illustrious reign of King Christian IV, and their near-constant naval humiliations. But the most impressive of all is the newly built power plant, Amager Bakke, which imports waste from neighboring countries to generate energy. The smoke produced from the plant is 95 percent water, with which they aim to recreate the freshness of a mountaintop near the plant’s chimneys where the world’s largest man-made ski slope starts. If that is not doing the MOST good, I don’t know what is.
Back on land, it’ll be time for lunch. Torvehallerne is a fresh food market that delights the senses of food-obsessed world travelers and Copenhageners. Definitely have the smørrebrød, which is dark rye bread covered in all good things like smoked salmon, roast beef, or shrimp, smothered in aioli, nuts, and dill. After that you could check out the Design Museum, one of the best of its kind. But the mother of Danish design and supreme engenderer of material covetousness is Illums Bolighus downtown, the most spectacular design and living store I’ve been inside.
By the time I’ve had my fill of looking at pretty things I can’t afford it’ll be around 3 or 4pm, when people get off work. Yes, you heard me right. It’s time for a drink. A Danish friend told me Denmark has the highest per-capita consumption of coffee, ice cream, and beer. I didn’t check these facts, but I believe him because he’s a doctor.
Whatever you choose to drink, make sure to have a good view of the street to watch the commuting Danes. Other than the fact that they are ridiculously good-looking, one thing struck me as particularly notable: the amount of blond-haired children in the street accompanied not only by their beautiful mothers, but invariably by their fathers as well. Truly, I had never seen a city where so many men were catering to their children. This is the first place I’ve ever been where having kids and taking care of them isn’t emasculating for men or akin to career suicide for women. It was almost as though toxic masculinity had been wiped out. Maternity and paternity leave is mandated by law, and not a miserly few weeks for the mother only, but a whole year, that’s fifty-two weeks of paid leave to be shared between the parents. The government takes good care of its citizens.
Coming from San Francisco and Seoul, where none of my career-driven girlfriends dare having children until they are settled and secure well into their mid-thirties, I suddenly had the creeping suspicion that the rest of the world had got it all wrong. The Danes had figured life out. Everyone was well-fed, a feeling of wholesome well-being permeated the city with the brisk salty air coming off the Baltic Sea.
This was the ideal socialist Utopia, or the closest thing I’d ever seen. The possible future of feminism and mankind invigorated me. But looking around, my heart sank. No one here looked like me. People of color were rare and far in between: I would never belong here. I would always be considered a tourist, or worse, a Thai masseuse.
The Danes are kind but insular people who are sometimes described as cold by expats. Their days and weekends are filled with family picnics and parties that outsiders aren’t invited to. What they have, their culture, their practical sensibilities and husbandry of their surroundings, their dedication to the good life represented by hygge are treasures that should be protected.
But CPH is where one of the worst housing crisis in Europe is taking place for students, newcomers, and immigrants. Denmark receives less refugees per capita than any other Western European country excepting the UK. It is a far cry from what Denmark’s neighbor, Sweden is doing. The future and health of a city can be judged based on their treatment of outsiders, people who aren’t from there who want to move there. And it struck me as sad that some nationalists might cite Denmark as a good example to close their borders to people in need.
When I am about to be depressed by my own thoughts, it’s time to head to Christiania. Christiania Freetown is the jewel of Copenhagen, a radical morsel of prime real estate that hippies took over in the 70s smack-dab in the middle of the city. Until quite recently they didn’t pay for electricity or taxes, operating under their own laws. Before sunset is the ideal time to go there to check out the architecture, which is a euphemism for the only place that sells weed in the open in Denmark. Sit on the outdoor benches or by the water with a beer in hand and feel that brotherly love seep back into you.
When it becomes too cold to sit outside, I would head back towards Vesterbro to Kødbyens, the meat-packing district filled with restaurants and nightclubs to continue the night until the sun comes up. As I creep back home in the morning, the streets are quiet and subdued, foggy and windy like no one lives in this sleepy town. There is none of that anxious energy that makes a big city spin, spin, spin. Bukowski’s saying, “Find what you love and let it kill you,” is not a phrase that goes down well with the practical Danes nor with the soporific comforts offered by hygge.
And I love CPH because it helps me imagine a different life where I don’t have to kill myself for my career, or tamp down every instinct until I make something out of myself. If only one could belong here.

Have you ever arrived in a city so tired from traveling, but somehow the energy of the place wakes you up? That’s exactly what happened when I landed in Copenhagen…
We got to Copenhagen on Friday morning after a ridiculously early 6 AM flight, and we were dead tired. We didn’t have any time to lose so we set out for the hostel. We took the train to Steel House, which was hands down the best hostel we’ve been to yet. It had everything — pool, gym, cinema, you name it. We dropped our bags and headed to the city. Upon arrival we stopped and listened to a singer on the streets, it was super cool to see him perform.
Locating the Streets and Gasoline Grill
Copenhagen has an atmosphere that makes you just want to walk around. We walked around the streets, dropped by Rosenborg Castle, and let the city reveal itself. Somewhere along the way, hunger caught up with us, and we went to Gasoline Grill, which serves famous burgers. The burger was just what we needed and it set the tone for the day.
The Old Irish Pub and Barkowski’s
We continued walking and ended up at this place called “The Old Irish Pub,” where they had a live band playing. The atmosphere was just right with a good energy. We sat back, listened to the music, and just absorbed the atmosphere. It was a mix of locals and tourists, and it felt like one of those pubs you find on a college campus.
We finally checked into the hostel at 3pm and freshened up to then head back out into town. This time we headed to Barkowski’s, a restaurant/bar that was full of people. We had heard that they heard pull tables but didn’t see them at first sight. After an urgent search we headed downstairs to the basement and found the pool tables and asked some locals if we could play them. They were excited to play “The Americans” and spoke great english. We ended up beating them in a best-of-5 series and it felt very good to win. We hung out for a little while longer and listened to the jazz/rock that was playing, then called it a night.
CopenHot and relaxing, and partying at Rumors
The next morning, we were ready for something entirely new. We went to CopenHot, where they have hot tubs right on the water. It was busy, but in the best way possible — people were just hangin’ out, relaxing. We even did the ice plunge for a bit. The cold was terrible but the instant jump back into the hot tub made up for it. The soft music in the background made all this feel ultra peaceful. It was just the reset we needed.
Then we were hungry and went to War Pigs to get BBQ. As someone who is from Texas, I can vouch that it was some of the best BBQ I had had. The mac and cheese was phenomenal and it paired just right with the pulled pork sandwich. It was the ideal way to finish off a relaxing morning, and I would eat in again in an instant if I could.
We napped briefly, then prepared for the evening. We headed to The Jane, a former library turned bar. The music was just what you’d expect if you were in a library listening to music. It was definitely a first for me and it almost makes you feel like you are in a library. It had books on the walls and the lighting was very dim. It was a very mellow vibe.
Though that changed pretty quickly… We then headed to a club called Rumors. It was all EDM and sing-along tracks here, and the atmosphere was on a whole different level. People were dancing in what looked like a pit.. The music was blasting, and we got to feel what its like to almost be at a concert in Denmark. We met some locals, danced and then called it a night to end our trip.
The Copenhagen Vibe
By the time we got back to the hostel, I had concluded that Copenhagen somehow felt like Amsterdam — the buildings, the bars, the surprises around every corner. There’s a sense of never having any idea what’s gonna happen next and what place you will end up in. Everywhere we went was somewhere completely different and somehow we had a great time everywhere we went. And honestly, the music in this city ended up shaping the whole experience. It was the soundtrack to it all, establishing mood and rendering each moment a little more memorable.
Thanks for reading! If you enjoyed this post, make sure to follow my account for more travel stories and insights. Stay tuned for next week’s adventure .

Welcome to the United Nations Career Journey podcast where we interview colleagues working for the United Nations all over the world. Our conversations explore their fascinating career paths, what career satisfaction means to them and how they keep learning and developing on the job. My name is Alessia and our conversation today is with Paul Anderton from the United Nations Development Programme in Copenhagen in Denmark.
Welcome to the Career Journey Podcast, Paul, thank you very much for joining us. And it’s a pleasure to have you as our guest speaker today. Would you like to introduce yourself?
Hello there Alessia. Greetings, everyone. Yes, certainly. Thanks so much for having me. My name is Paul Anderton. I’m originally from the United Kingdom, but I’ve lived and worked in 11 different countries in my life now, including the last three years here in Denmark in Copenhagen. I am an international servant, international civil servant with the UNDP. As you just mentioned, I work as an HR manager for the Leadership Development team in the Office of Human Resources, in the UNDP’s Talent Development Unit. That would do is as a starting point. So back to you, Alessia.
Yes, thank you, Paul. That’s really interesting that you lived in 11 different countries. And so how did you become interested in this field?
I think when I go back and look at the course of my life, something fairly major changed for me when I was nine years old, when I moved from a small village where I was living in England, a small village that had more sheep than than people actually, that was very homogeneous. And because of my father’s work, we moved to Brussels in Belgium, one of the most international cities in Europe. I went to an international school, and all of a sudden, I went from going to a small rural primary school to a big international school, where I was sitting next to a boy from Tanzania, and a girl from Venezuela, and a boy from Bangladesh and a girl from Japan. And that really had an impact on me at that young age, and really made me interested both in travelling the world and seeing other places, learning, made me intensely curious about the world. And also made me passionate about the feeling of connectedness, the feeling that all of these different people in all different cultures around the world, we are all interdependent, and that an organisation like the United Nations really has an important role to play. And eventually that will be something that I will be able to, to contribute to. So, I guess that kind of international perspective was something that was influencing me from quite a young age, which I maybe didn’t realize so much at the time. But when I look at the kind of the path that my life took, both in terms of the places I ended up working, which includes Japan, and Zambia, Mexico, Nepal, I feel very lucky, very grateful for the possibilities that opened up for me to, to go to these kinds of places have an international career. And, you know, try to make the most of that, including my time here at UNDP.
Wow, thank you, Paul. That’s a really interesting story. I also went to an international school in my life here in Rome, and I do completely understand you when you say that you were sitting next to someone from Japan, someone from Bangladesh, I also had that experience. And it definitely gave me a bigger perspective of things of my life as well. So what does a typical day or week look like for you in this job?
So yeah, so maybe I should talk a bit more about what my job actually is. So as the manager of the leadership development team at UNDP, we’re overseeing all of the internal learning and development opportunities for UNDP’s leaders at all levels, and people managers, and that covers quite a wide range of of activities and programmes that we’re doing - obviously, a lot of online content, but also organising things like retreats, meetings and get-togethers. I would say that the one thing when we talk about a typical week is there is no such thing. There’s constantly different things that are being worked on, different projects, different initiatives. We have a really substantial work portfolio that we work towards with all the different leadership groups within UNDP. That’s Resident Representatives, whether it’s team leaders in country offices, keeping all those going while at the same time, UNDP is never shy to say okay, here’s a priority that we now need to give to you, whether that might be a Women’s Leadership Programme, or something related, due to inclusion of people with disabilities, so that variety is fascinating. The other thing that I think is absolutely essential for doing the job that I do is the kind of the communication and delegation with my team. So I’d say that the anchors are, in this, pretty variable and changing work schedule, the anchors are the regular team meetings, and one-on-one meetings I have with my team meetings. We have a distributed team, so we have a couple of people working with us here in Copenhagen, others who are located in other time zones and other parts of the world. And so therefore, it’s really important for us to have regular check-ins, to get on the same page in terms of what the work priorities are, who is doing what, who’s accountable for what, and I very much enjoy that part of the role as well, the people management, the getting to know other people. I found that the United Nations and UNDP in particular is a fascinating workplace, the people who work here are really interesting, have all kinds of fascinating stories. And I find that the best way that that we can kind of come and work together is to share those components of ourselves with each other that we’re most passionate about. That really elevates the team as a whole, and gets us motivated, even when we might be overwhelmed with a certain project or feeling tired, because we do we do have a lot of responsibility and a lot to do.
Okay, thank you. Wow, that was very descriptive and very useful for our listeners. And so what specific tools have been useful for you to develop career wise?
So in terms of tools, I was thinking, it’s in my career, it’s probably been less about kind of technical training or specific certification, so to speak, and more about kind of mindset and approach. So I think that some of the things in my career as a whole that have really helped me get to the point I am today includes things like agility, so being able to move from one thing to another, having, I guess, the self confidence that if I’m trying something that’s new to me that I can kind of fall back on the core skill set that I’ve kind of built up over time to get me through that, as well as the network of colleagues and others who can help me either with information or tips, mentor me through certain things to get me somewhere else. And when I was thinking about the idea of a career journey, my career — I don’t usually think of it in those terms, because it hasn’t ever really been kind of mapped out or planned to any great degree. The basic philosophy has been on my approach has been to be open to the opportunities that have come my way trying to follow my passions, which as I mentioned, have been around travel or around being an international civil servant. Also about international development work, that’s what my master’s degree is in, and I spent several years working as a development project manager and humanitarian worker before shifting more to an HQ role at UNDP. And that’s kind of incorporated some of the other skills and I guess, the different job titles that I’ve had over the years, all of those things have contributed different bits of pieces into the professional that I currently am. So I mentioned working in humanitarian worker in Zambia, Uganda in the past, but over time, I’ve also been a teacher, the university lecturer I’ve even though the short term jobs that I’ve had, whether that’s volunteering, I’ve done quite a bit of volunteering my life particularly with with refugees with the Red Cross, an International Rescue Committee, but also part time jobs as you know, things like a driver, a librarian, even a movie projectionist back in the day… All of these things have, you know, added little components into both my kind of my bank of experiences and skills, and also the way that I go about my job. So I mentioned kind of agility and moving from, from one thing to the next thing. Curiosity is also something that has been really important for my career, because that has meant that I have looked to keep growing and taking on different challenges, expanding the repertoire of things that I can do or will go put my hand up to take on. And in our team, the Talent Development Team here at UNDP, we often talk about the growth mindset, the idea that we’re constantly growing, we’re constantly evolving, we’re all on a continuous learning journey, where it’s not the case that — okay, after school in university, that’s it, your learning is done and you put it away. That’s not the way the world works. It’s not the way that work itself works. So, so that curiosity, agility, the growth mindset to keep trying new things. And I think, also important has been a willingness to take a few risks along the way. I kind of mentioned growing up in a small village in England, when I was young, I was pretty shy, I was not that confident. And I wouldn’t have dreamed, actually, that I would have taken on as many different things as I have done over the course of my life, taking chances to go and study for a year in the USA, where I didn’t know anyone, taking a first job after university in in Taiwan, part of the world where I didn’t speak the language, I didn’t know anyone, I have no idea what to expect. But it was a part of this…this kind of growth experience, and, led in all kinds of interesting directions.
Wow, that was really inspiring. I feel very inspired by that. Especially follow your passion. I feel like nowadays, it’s getting very competitive now, when you are in the search for jobs, but I do agree, follow your passion, agility, take risks, everything you mentioned. It’s nice to hear it once in a while. I feel like some people tend to forget, because of a lot of pressure in this in this environment with the job searching and stuff, especially after the pandemic, when you graduate as a student.
And I have to say as well, I can kind… in looking back, you tend to look at the highlights. There were plenty of lowlights along the way and plenty of moments of ‘oh my god, what is my next job gonna be’ or ‘what happens next’. And particularly when I think about my UN career, I’ve had every variety of contract there is, including being a pro bono volunteer, part time consultant, full time consultant, temporary appointment. I eventually got to a fixed term appointment, that was then abolished as opposed to, so went back not to having a post. I’ve gone through a team relocation, so all of these things are also happening, as well as along the way moments of great uncertainty about what what is the right thing to do? And where, where should I be, where should I be moving? And I do kind of see, not not just my career, but for all of us, our lives are a little bit in… in chapters that are being written as we go. And when you kind of look back at some of the completed chapters, it’s only then you can kind of see how everything came together. And I do sense that the moment that kind of the uncertainty and the questions that particularly young people have about, okay, what is our future going to look like? What kind of jobs am I going to have? What do I think about far from my career? It’s getting more and more challenging. And I think about that, in particular for for my daughters who are eleven and nine, so they still have a ways to go in their own education, but say, in 15/20 years from now, what the job market so to speak might look like is really hard to see. The speed at which the types of jobs that people are doing, or the jobs that people have, they’re just changing so rapidly. And that I think takes me back a little bit to what I was saying about being agile, being willing to change, and trying to build up your self-confidence that actually no, I will, be able to ride these waves and get someway good. And of course it helps a great deal ifunderneath that, the work that you’re doing or the place that you’re working connects to what you’re most passionate about.
Yes, yes, exactly. I agree with you. Overall, everything does move pretty fast, especially the market right now. But we’ll see, I guess, c’est la vie.
I think taking time to kind of really analyze and understand that for yourself. One thing I see that sometimes trips people up is that they might have certain expectations about what they think the world of work should be, or they joined a particular organisation and they have a certain idea — this is exactly what is gonna happen when I get there — And then maybe that’s not quite the reality. So I think the more research you can do, or the more analysis or reflection you can do, both in terms of the work and the job that you’re going into but also in terms of yourself and what you need or what you want to have in your career, that’s really going to help so. So take some time for self-reflection for analysis, and it might be that you see certain jobs where you think okay, well the job looks good, but actually, I’m not sure I fit in that organisation or vice versa, that’s an organisation I want to work for. But is that what they want to be doing? It’s not straightforward at all. And yeah, it’s something that yeah, I myself, I’m still in the middle of. You know, I’m mid career, I’ve probably got 15/20 years to go until until I’d be able to retire. So I’m also surfing the wave.
Yeah, you’re right. I think self-reflection comes with any age. But it’s definitely something that one should do once in a while, you know, especially when it comes to work. And just, overall, how you’re feeling with your job and what you want to do next.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, so one more question, which I believe it’s very important. What role does networking play in your career?
This is an interesting one, because I was thinking back to especially when I first joined the UN, I think I had a vision of networking that is quite different from how I see it now. Because back then, I had quite a hard view of of people who I saw as ‘networkers’. I thought that they were being a bit mercenary, maybe in terms of okay, to network, I need to find the people who are going to help me move up in my career, the people who are going to give me backing or information that’s going to get me a promotion, or get me where I want to be. And that all felt a bit inauthentic. And I think, certainly there are some people who take that approach to networking. But the way that I understand networking now, and how I’d recommend other people who maybe think more like me about it, who maybe don’t feel comfortable with that more aggressive approach to networking, is that really, networking is a long term thing. It’s something where you’re looking to make connections with people. And for me, I feel most comfortable when it’s authentic human connections in the workplace. And I mentioned before being curious, I am constantly curious about my colleagues, in terms of how did they come to UNDP or whichever partner we might be working with, what drives them? What are they passionate about? What do we have in common? And that I think helps the the immediate working relationship. But it also gives you this network of people who, in the future, they might come to you with a question you might go to them with something you want to ask about, there might be just kind of shared information, or just an awareness of, oh, okay, I know that person who’s really good at X, Y, and Z. I’ve got this one thing where I need some help with X, Y, and Z, I’ll just check in with them. And it kind of goes in both directions. So I guess my second recommendation would be not to see networking as something that you have to do to progress in your career, so much as something that can actually be an enjoyable human part of the work experience. We spend so much of our daily life at work, and one of the things I most appreciate about working in the UN is the incredibly diverse and interesting workforce that we have. That’s something that’s both meaningful to me and I think that’s been important in the work that I do and what whatever comes next. And one last thing, because it’s kind of, slightly off to the side, in terms of, of networking. I’ve been quite an active user of LinkedIn. And that’s something where you’ve got some virtual networking at play, which obviously, is not the same thing as what I’ve just been talking about. So on LinkedIn, you’ll have connections to some of your teammates, or people that you work with, or people that you know pretty well, then there’ll be looser connections to maybe people who are in your organisation, but you don’t know, or people who are outside your organisation in other places. And then there’s also connections to sometimes really random group of people who you have no idea who they are. But in that virtual space, there’s a different type of networking going on. And for me, the way that I use LinkedIn is pretty much in three ways. So one is to, to kind of help show the work that I do and the work that my team does to give to kind of highlight what it is that we’ve actually been working on, which can also help me as well in terms of remembering what we’ve what we’ve done over the years. Also, I think LinkedIn is very good in terms of being a good advocate for UNDP itself and for the UN itself, because there’s plenty of posts from different parts of UNDP or the UN system, in terms of the the good work that we’re doing, and I think anyone who works in the UN system, it is part of what we should be doing — helping to support and promote the UN values, you know, the amazing work that we are doing. And then the last thing is also in terms of some of the people who are looking for work themselves. So I regularly reshare links to job vacancy announcements or interesting career opportunities within UNDP or elsewhere that I think that people will find value in. So those are kind of two different strands of networking. I hope that makes sense.
Yes Paul, it completely does. I believe that when I started this internship, I think that the networking has given me a bigger perspective in the way that I network with my colleagues to enjoy the relationship and to get to know them and to understand where they’re coming from, what their values and missions are. This has been really nice, and I don’t know Paul, if you have anything else to say?
So thank you so much Alessia for having invited me to take part and thank you to anyone who’s made it to the end of this this interview. I appreciate you listening!
Thank you so much for coming and thank you all for listening. We hope our conversations will inspire you to keep learning and advancing in your careers. And make sure to share this episode with any social platform you all have. We will see you all for the next time!

“Jonathan just tested positive for Covid here this morning.” My son Dan called me from Copenhagen with the bad news. And he called just minutes before I was to fly there for a long-anticipated visit to Copenhagen, to visit Dan and his family. I was devastated. I knew it would be crazy at age 87 to head off to Copenhagen when someone in the household there had Covid. I canceled.
I had been reading and talking about Denmark for weeks and I found myself continuing to do research and hold forth on Denmark. And now, dear readers, I want to share some of the amazing information that I have learned and to tell you why what is going on in Denmark matters to each of us. Even if we never go there.
Denmark has been ranked as the best place on earth to live and also the best of all countries in terms of quality of life. It has been named as the least corrupt country in the world and number one in terms of protecting the environment and gender equality. It has been ranked the 2nd happiest country on earth, (after Finland) for…

Here is my usual guide to Copenhagen for tourists who enjoy the culinary side of life and want to visit Copenhagen for the first time.
In general I tell Taxi to use taxa.dk +45 35353535 or use Donkey bikes with app or use the electric scooters.
Packing: Copenhagen is rainy and windy and chilly. Check weather forecast. Plenty swimming opportunities, so bring a towel and swimwear if you want to swim.
Inner city: This is the old town of Copenhagen. Think small streets, alleyways, and historic squares. The main (shopping) streets are Strøget and Købmagergade. Sights to see: Parliament (Christiansborg) and the Round Tower (Rundetårn). You will find two good wine bards here: Ved Stranden 10 and Den Vandrette as well as restaurant Musling.
Christianshavn: An old residential neighborhood full of canals and colorful houses. Sights to see: Cathedral of Copenhagen (Von Frue Kirke) and the Freetown Christiania. Try Rufino’s delicious pasta if you’re in the area or grab a beer at Barr in the evening sun. Restaurant 108 is also located here.
Vesterbro: The area is full of hip cafés, bars, galleries, music venues, and restaurants. The main streets are Istedgade and Sønder Boulevard. Sights to see: the meatpacking district (Kødbyen), where you can pick up Rosio Sanchez’s delicious food (ex-Noma) at Hija de Sanchez, enjoy coffee at Prolog or dine at Fiskebaren. Also, check out Rosio’s new opened place Sanchez on Istedgade.
Nørrebro: This area is often described as the most diverse part of Copenhagen. You’ll find vintage clothing stores, antique shops, café’s, and authentic Danish bodegas (bars). The most interesting streets are Jægersborggade, Stefansgade, Griffenfeldsgade, Guldbergsgade, Nørrebrogade, Ravnsborggade, and Blågårdsgade. Swing by Bæst for pizza if you’re near Guldbergsgade.
Østerbro: in an old bourgeois, residential neighborhood. Among other things, you’ll find Copenhagen’s largest park, Fælledparken, here; interesting streets: Østerbrogade, the stretch closest to The Lakes (Søerne) and Nordre Frihavnsgade. Sights to see: Kastellet (an old family fortress), Svanmøllen beach, and Juno Bakery.
Amager: Copenhagen airport is situated here. You can reach the inner city by metro in 17 minutes. Islands Brygge is worth a visit — and a swim! Sights to see: The wild landscape of Amager Fælled, Amager Strandpark (the beach), and Helgoland (a traditional sea bathhouse from 1913, that is open for everyone during the summer months).
Refshaleøen: This is the area of Copenhagen where a lot of top restaurants are based. Recently, the peninsula has been in constant development. Check out restaurant Amass, LA Banchina, and Lille bakery.

My interest to explore Copenhagen stemmed from the immaculate design culture that I had heard of . In the quest to explore the origin of hygge life we left for about week’s adventure to Copenhagen.
Fun Fact: The Danish Royal Family holds the title of the oldest monarchy. If Queen Elizabeth visits she will need to bow down to the Queen and King of Denmark.
2. Food & Drink: During my visit, the surprising find for me has been the refined food scene here. Unlike other cities, I did not go here with a focus on devouring food all day but I was pleasantly surprised by the offerings. It could be the influence of René Redzepi’s Noma, which is seen as one of the best restaurants in the world potentially attracting a lot of culinary talent here. Although, I could not get reservation at Noma these are some restaurants that left me wanting more:
Similarly for drinks some spots to check out are:
3. Fashion & Art: When I travel, I love to check out local stores that depict the local style. For sartorial trends street style was definitely trending in the city. Most of the stores I went to showcased unisex easy to wear style. Some stores that were interesting to check out are:
You cannot leave Copenhagen without checking out the best in class design stores. Some to check out are:
4. Must see: As mentioned, Copenhagen is a beautiful city. To understand its past and present I would recommend you to check out these spots, which span all over the city and gives you a good idea on what Copenhagen is all about.
Nyhavn: Street with beautiful colorful building. Great for an evening stroll.
Garden Royal: Close to Aamann’s great to catch a break here and check the rose garden.
Supekilen: For all the reasons listed above highly recommend to check this out. Although a bit away from city center.
Freetown Christiania: This is a free commune which operates as a local body without any governance from local government. It is an interesting oasis in the middle of the city , which is worth checking out.
Nyboder houses: Built in 1757, these houses have lasted several city fires and provides a little flavor of the past.
Church of Savior: This church gives a great aerial view of the city. Worth climbing up the 700 stairs to check out the cityscapes.
Design Museum of Denmark: This museum provides Danish sensibility and evolution from everywhere across fashion, architecture, furniture.
5. Tips & Tricks: These are some quick tips that I wanted to leave you with while planning your trip.

What a weekend. I just had the pleasure to explore Copenhagen in Denmark for a bit. I took lots of photos with my beloved Fujifilm X100V and the conversion lenses. In this little article, I will share some of my favorite shots & spots from this trip.
All the photos you’ll see, have been edited with my presets. If you’re interested, you can get them here: www.chrisperkles.at
We arrived at a Wednesday night in the capital of Denmark, and we stayed in the Huxley Hotel in the center of the city. The location of the hotel made it easy to get everywhere by foot.
We started the first beautiful sunny fresh march day at Nyhavn, since it was next to our Hotel. The good thing was that on a Thursday morning, it was not too busy, and we could find a good spot for breakfast close to the water and in the sun.
After having some good brunch, we walked towards Kastellet along the water shore. Spotting some nice architecture and beautiful views.
Kastellet is something special. For me, as an old Stronghold gamer, this was very pleasant to see, how the castle was shaped and still used today.
After the castle, we walked back towards the center and checked out the Frederiks Kirke and Schloss Amalienborg. There we enjoyed a parade from the oldschool military.
Next on our list was Schloss Rosenborg and the attached garden. Since it was March, the garden was not that pretty because nothing was blooming. But the small palace was impressive.
Feeling: Hungry. So let’s get some food. In the area of Schloss Rosenborg, we found a place called Brdr. Price. Food was delicious, service was great and the location very pretty. 10/10 recommend.
Back on energy, we headed towards the Botanical Garden, but we’ve been too late, it was already closed. So the replacement program was the Rundetarn, an observatory with a beautiful view over Copenhagen.
That was the closing of our first day here. We spent a nice evening having some dinner and relaxing.
New day, new luck. We started the day with a quick breakfast and then heading towards the botanical garden again. This time we were on time.
In the evening we walked through the city, checked out some stores and just had a good time.
After all, this was a very beautiful trip, with some great food and beautiful weather. I can recommend copenhagen to everyone, but consider, that town is expensive as hell. The food compared to Austria is at least 50% — 100% more expensive. If you have any questions, send me a message on Instagram or leave a comment here.

Alright. I have completely fallen in love with Copenhagen. If I were to do college again, I would study abroad here… in the summer ; ). It’s seriously such a magical place — the parks, the bike lanes, the zero noise pollution, the food, the “hygge”… I could go on. Copenhagen is considered one of the happiest cities in the world, + I can totally see why.
Pro Tip — Bike… everywhere. Literally, everywhere.
1] Mad + Kaffe: MUST. HAVE. BRUNCH. HERE. They serve brunch until 12:30 every day. Wow. I can’t believe a spot like this is not in Chicago yet. This has been voted “best brunch in Copenhagen.”
2] Wulff + Konstali: Another — MUST. HAVE. BRUNCH. HERE. They serve brunch until 3 PM [even better!]. Go to the one on Ameagerbro, so that you can go to the beach after!
3] Grod: We went here for takeaway dinner, but I wish I could have come for breakfast! Everything is porridge based… sounds weird but it’s SO GOOD.
For Next Time (Brunch) — Baryl, Social, Bowl Market, Cafe Det Vide Has, Moeller Kaffe + Kokken
Coffee — Coffee Collective, Original Coffee, Statement Coffee, Prolog Coffee Bar
Bakeries — Sankt Peders Bageri [cinnamon rolls on Wednesdays! ++ Copenhagen’s oldest bakery!], Leckerbaer, Isoteket, , Juno The Bakery, Lilli Bakery, Hart Bageri, Meyers Bageri, Bageriet Brod
Sweets — Nicecream, ISTID, Social Foods, Granny’s House [in Torvehallerne]
1] La Banchina: Hands down favorite spot in Copenhagen for a few reasons: the food is incredible [apps = bread + olive oil, olives, + almonds… + then the starter, fish, vegetable, + dessert change every day!], THEN after dinner: jump in the water… + then warm up by the fire + SAUNA. They are also open for breakfast, which is probably so dreamy too.
2] Organic Boho: We stumbled upon this place on our way to Christiana [the hippy town] + WOW, obsessed. Get the burger with tempeh, + THE LOVE PLATE [my fav]. They have tons of beautiful drinks too — juices, smoothies, + rainbow lattes ; ).
3] 42Raw: I love that so many spots in Copenhagen have easy “takeaway” options. We ordered takeaway to bring on the Go Boat: acai bowl, green bowl [“this almost tastes too healthy” — Isaac], salad of the day, + chocolate PB cup. The sweet potato fries looked bomb, too.
4] Neighbourhood: Organic pizza + cocktails… what more do you need? Oh, + TRUFFLE POPCORN. Make sure to get the burrata love pizza.
5] Sprod: You know a place is good when they don’t have an English menu. We ordered the chicken sandwich to split as a snack… + then instantly ordered another one. SO YUM.
6] District Tonkin: This place has the “best banh mi in Copenhagen” + it lived up to the hype . Chicken lemongrass banh mi + pho = winning combo.
7] Souls: This won the most sustainable restaurant in Copenhagen, AND best vegan restaurant — so definitely go. The warm potato salad was liiiiiife. ++ the summer lemonade.
8] Aamanns Deli: A trip to Copenhagen is not complete without trying a smorresbrod. There’s a few Aamanns, depending on the experience you want — I liked the deli because you can eat it in the restaurant, or easily choose takeaway + bring it to a park!
9] Kodbyens Fiskebar: MUSSELS : ) This was the fanciest restaurant that we went to [on our last night]. It’s in the Meat Packing District… we hopped around to a few places — staying at each place for an hour while ordering: drink + one item from the menu to share, what we call #AppyHour.
10] Smag: The BEST salads + sandwiches, oh my gosh. Go before a picnic!
For Next Time — Morganstedt, SimpleRaw, dop, Bollyfood, WEDOFOOD, Gro Spiseri, Ma Poule [duck sandwich is apparently amazing], Kaf, California Kitchen, Mahalle CPH, Plantepolsen, Barabba, Amass [$$$$], Kadea [$$$$], Noma ; ) [$$$$ — named the best restaurant in the WORLD]
Markets — Copenhagen out did themselves with all the markets here. Like, WOW. Trovehallerne is obviously a must… make sure to get Smag, GROD, a chocolate peanut butter brownie from Granny’s House. Other fabulous markets are The Bridge Street Kitchen, Reffen, Rebel Food, + Tivoli Food Hall.
1] Mikkeller + Friends: Apparently the best spot for beer in Copenhagen.
2] WarPigs: Go for the beer, stay for the MEAT. Omg, literally — the brisket was to diiiiie for. *Make a stop here during #AppyHour.
3] Noho: Funky cocktails + hip vibe. *Make a stop here during #AppyHour.
4] Grab Wine… Literally Anywhere: Drink in a park, on the streets, by the lake, etc. It’s open container law!
For Next Time — Sidecar, BRUS, Baghaven, Himmeriget, Lidoeb, Malbeck Vinbar
1] ALL. THE. PARKS: Faelledparken, Svanemoelle Beach, The Citadel, Frederiksberg Gardens (*probably my fav because you get a shot of the zoo in the park + can see the elephants!), Superkilen, King’s Garden, Botanical Gardens… + more. If I lived here, I would spend every day in a park. They are all so gorgeous + unique. You must visit them all!
2] Walk Down These Streets:
3] Go Boat: We chose this over the Canal Tour [if I had time, I’d do both!] — you rent a boat to drive… yourself… with no experience required! Aha. It’s right next to the Islands Brygge Harbour Bath, which you should definitely go to on a sunny day. *Book ahead of time!
4] Tivoli: Copenhagen’s second oldest amusement park, + right in the center of town. It’s definitely worth a stop.
5] Visit The Cemeteries: Sounds creepy, but this is also a must. Vestre Cemetery + Assistens Cemetery are incredibly beautiful.
6] Christiania: The hippie commune — the only place hash/weed is legal in Copenhagen. Super funky to walk through... most people built their homes themselves! Couple things to note: I wouldn’t go there at night, no photos are allowed, + no running.
7] Shop Vintage: Check out this guide for the flea markets!
8] Wellness: I wasn’t able to test any of these out, but I heard great things about: YO Studios, NOR Nordic Health House, CopenHot, Hot Yoga CPH.
We stayed at Hotel SP34— incredible free breakfast every day, in a great spot in town [a bike store is like two seconds away… or you can rent bikes at the hotel], + WINE HOUR EVERY DAY! Also, there are a few other hotels close by in the same collective, so you can go there for wine hour, too ; ). Check out Brochner Hotels. / *One thing I will say is the room we booked was TINY.
There are so many components within Copenhagen that I want to bring back to Chicago — particularly BIKE LANES. ++ how they do brunch… + all the parks. I’m in loooooove. Please visit!
What did I miss? Let me know!

Copenhagen, Denmark, has a unique and interesting transit system. When looking at it at first, most will just see the S-train network, that by any means is not the largest one in the world. But it’s a quite effective network. And when combined with the metro that got added to the Copenhagen transit network back in 2002 when the first 2 lines opened.
The S-train network has been running since 1934. It was the vision for the network, even before it was born that it should be 100% electrified. And it has been, from its start until today, it has only been running on electricity. This vision was part of some earlier work done by The Electrification Commission of 1926, that wanted to electrify many of the commuter rails in and around the suburbs of Copenhagen.
The first line opened the 3rd of April 1934, and ran from Klampenborg via Hellerup and Vanløse and terminated at Frederiksberg. This exact line is now defunct and does not exist in today's network. Along with a timetable…

I just got back from my two-week trip across most of Northern Europe. This is my third trip back to Europe. (My first was a summer abroad in Italy nearly 8 years ago and my second was another two-week trip in 2014 where we explored Dublin, London, Amsterdam, and Paris.) I daresay this was the best so far! Thom and I visited Stockholm, Copenhagen, Berlin, and again, Amsterdam this time around. In order to share our experience and to create a living record of its details, I’ve decided to write across a few posts on each city and its adventures. This first post serves to detail our overall travel plans, information on flights/places to stay, tips on light packing, and general advice for good travel. I should mention that I’m not an expert on any other these things but it’s worth sharing the little knowledge that I gained before, during, and after this trip.
To begin with, here are a few starting facts about our trip:
Let’s begin by discussing budget flights. Nine months before this vacation even happened I found some non-stop flights from Oakland to Stockholm for $600 a person. These flights kicked off the entire trip and made everything possible. I recall the very first time I ever flew to Europe. (Which was 8 years this summer!) It was to Genoa, Italy from Buffalo, NY. That flight had three stops (Buffalo to NYC, NYC to Frankfurt, and Frankfurt to Milan) and one train (Milan to Genoa) in order to get to my destination with a total of over 20+ hours at a hefty price of $1500. (Thanks Aer Lingus! 🖕) So to come across a flight that was only 10 hours and non-stop to my choice destination, it felt like fate...
Doesn’t that last sentence feel so inspiring? Statements and facts like those are the gold and shiny wrapper on the cheap bar of travel chocolate. Here’s the nitty-gritty of budget flying:
With some of the add-ons and extra taxes, our $600 tickets actually came to $711.30 a person. Our in-between flights from city to city were around $50 a person. (As compared to a train from Berlin to Amsterdam which was $120 a ticket.) In the end, you have to deal with the minor annoyances for that 💰deal.
Let’s move on to transportation.
Thom and I took public transit for the most part. (I’ll discuss the bicycling and Uber rides a bit later in some of my city posts.) For us, it’s a fun challenge learning a new city’s public transit. And unlike American public transportation, European public transportation is fast, convenient, and very, VERY reliable. Upon arriving at the Arlanda Airport, which is located just outside of Stockholm, we took the Arlanda Express Train that runs directly to the city center in just 20 minutes. (As compared to my 1.5 hour MUNI and BART trip to Oakland International Airport. 😑) Out of the four cities we visited, Berlin boasted the fastest and most reliable transportation (dat German innovation) with Amsterdam coming in at a close second. (Trams, trams everywhere!) All the trams, trains, and buses that we took were clean and clearly marked. My only complaint was the summer heat which was especially felt in the enclosed and non-air conditioned trains.
I plan to discuss each Airbnb in detail for each city post but in general our decision to use this service came from a few points:
Finally, let’s talk about packing. Much like my last Europe trip, I took a single backpack and personal bag with me. That was it! Now that this trip is over, I can say, quite proudly, that it was the best decision that I made for packing. After each city we visited, Thom and I both got a little better at packing our bags. It was a very efficient way to travel, IMO.
Here are some pros:
I admit that there are some cons involved with this kind of packing. While I can pack a mean bag, it doesn’t exclude the fact that the weight gets to you…no matter how light. If you’ve ever landed at an airport and took public transit into a city, the transfers mean a lot of walking between terminals and stations. The weight of the bag can cause a lot of stress on your neck and shoulders. Even this year, I packed a bag that weighed about 8 lbs total and after a while, say 20 minutes of walking, it can really push down on you. I should mention that my bag isn’t meant for hiking or true backpacking and therefore isn’t super ergonomic. I’m sure if I had chosen a small hiking backpack, my experience would be different. The bag that I took is just an everyday backpack for commuting which is why long walks with a lot of weight can easily become a small burden.
Backpacking can also force you to make some crucial decisions as to what you pack. One small error (should I bring a bathing suit?) and you’ll be forced to carry that item throughout the entire trip with much resentment. The last time we were in Europe, it rained for most of the trip. Thom brought an umbrella this year. He never needed it! 😂 🙃 Lessons learned.
A few surprising things that we did bring this year are:
I’ve only really traveled internationally in the summer months so packing has always been dictated by the warmer weather. I took mainly dresses with a single pair of jeans and shorts. A few shirts to mix it up and a hoodie with a jean jacket for cooler evenings/days. I took a pair of black flats since they’re so versatile and my Keds for comfort as I walked/biked everywhere. I kept toiletries to small sizes and bought anything else that might have run out.
Thom and I failed to exchange any currency prior to the trip. But I would recommend making that order with your bank if possible since ATMs abroad will charge you a fee for any withdrawals. Also, make the obligatory call to your bank letting them know that you are traveling abroad so that they don’t lock your card and account.
A kind co-worker provided us an extra SIM card and we had another already from past trips, so this year we both had data/service for our phones. Thankfully our SIM cards were both purchased in the Netherlands with Vodaphone. These cards worked in all the other countries we visited and we didn’t need to purchase new cards along the way.
Finally, I’ll add that we obtained Global Entry prior to the trip. It made entering the US very easy and fast when going through customs. If you are a frequent international flyer, consider getting Global Entry. Global Entry includes TSA PreCheck. So if you fly around the country frequently (which I do), it’s very convenient and handy for jumping those long security lines.
This post is a part of a series based on my recent two-week trip to Europe.

I took fairly easy train ride from Stockholm, through Malmo, and then over a gigantic bridge that spans the sea between Malmo and Copenhagen. I had no idea what to expect from Copenhagen, but somehow I knew I was going to enjoy my week in the home of Carlsberg. It turned out to be one of my favourite cities in Europe and the first time I stayed in a hostel with triple bunk beds.
Copenhagen was a fascinating city with an interesting mix of old and modern architecture in addition to many parks areas and canals. The bike lanes were also the best i’d used in Europe. I was able to skateboard on them anywhere I wanted in the city without having to go on the actual roads at all.
Apparently there was a study done about the Copenhagen bike lanes and the conclusion was that it was actually faster to use the bike lanes to bike to your destination than to drive within the city.
Copenhagen also had what I consider one of the best modern art museum that I visited in Europe, the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art.
Set a bit outside of the city on the coast, the building is at first unassuming by appearing to be a diminutive house, but when you enter it opens into a vast underground exhibit area.
In the surrounding grounds there was a pond with a small forest and various sculptures perched around some walking trails.
There were also some large open lawn areas with more sculptures and installations overlooking the sea. It was a beautiful place.
After being in the Copenhagen for a few days I could notice some contrasts between there and the Stockholm, most notably the liquor laws. Stockholm’s laws were more conservative than the redundant Canadian laws, forcing you to buy alcohol from specific government run liquor stores that close around 7 pm on weekdays, 3 pm on Saturdays and are completely closed on Sundays. Furthermore it was illegal to drink outside of establishments, and the latest almost all bars and clubs stay open till was 3 am. In contrast, in Copenhagen you can drink on the streets, buy alcohol from the corner store and party all night if you want to.
An interesting thing to note is the bottle deposit is so high on beers cans and bottles in Copenhagen that anytime I was sitting in a park enjoying a beer with some friends there would be at least five people coming up to you to ask for your empties, which was great because you never had to concern yourself with finding a garbage can to dispose of them. Win for the Danish.
During my week in Copenhagen I went to three music festivals. The best one was a free festival the city put on in the middle of a park called the King’s Garden that had a castle on a hill. Everybody was chilling on the grass drinking beers and enjoying one of the nicest days of the summer while music blared from a stage set up underneath the castle. I met some friendly people and ended up being invited over to somebody’s house for some after party drinks.
One of the most compelling aspects about Copenhagen was the existence of Freetown Christiania. Christiania is a place that exists in the city center of a Copenhagen, which is a self-proclaimed republic that stemmed from squatters living there since the 1970s. Christiania is it’s own world.
There were only about 800 official residents living there that have built themselves all kinds of strange houses and have even built their own schools to teach their children their own curriculum.
Street art was splashed everywhere all over the buildings and there were numerous small cafes and restaurants around that only accept cash.
The part about Christiania that most people come for though was the open selling and consumption of marijuana. There was a street called ‘pusher street’ that was lined with at least 20 stalls selling all kinds of hash, marijuana and edibles.
Here you can buy a joint, light it up, smoke it and nobody will bother you. It is fascinating that such a place existed right in the middle of one of the most modern cities in Europe. Still what happens in Christiania was technically illegal so the residents had established two rules for visitors. The first rule was no running, because if people are running the residents assume it’s a police raid and they will start to run away as well. I later met some Danish dude that told me if you are caught running in Christiania you will receive quite the beating. The second rule was no photos, which was unfortunate because there are some many cool art installations and works of street are littered around the self-proclaimed republic.
Still I was able to sneak a photo or two, but there was one instance where I took a photo of the entrance sign with a resident in the photo and he came up to me and made me delete the photo from my phone.
In the end for me Copenhagen was an ideal blend of south Europe and Scandinavia. It was a clean, organized, well thought out city that has a little bit of everything for everybody where you didn’t have to look over your shoulder to go drink a beer. I actually looked into immigrating there, but unfortunately I would have had to learn the Danish language, which, according to one of my Swedish friends, takes the Danish more time than any other group of children in the world to learn their native language.

The Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics Is Not Idealist in Nature,https://medium.com/paul-austin-murphys-essays-on-philosophy/the-copenhagen-interpretation-of-quantum-mechanics-is-not-idealist-in-nature-797779e86290,"Sign up

The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics — and even quantum mechanics generally — has been both loosely and strongly associated with the philosophical position of idealism (see here).
Of course, there are almost as many varieties of idealism (from subjective idealism to absolute idealism to pluralist idealism) as there are idealists. So this isn’t the place to run through all of them. In any case, the kind of idealism I have in mind will become clear in this essay itself.
So take as an example the following passage (written in 2005) from Harry Nielsen:
“ Almost unbelievably perhaps, [the academics who developed quantum mechanics] chose to interpret the strangeness of quantum behaviour by denying the existence of physical reality. And as a standard textbook interpretation of quantum mechanics, physicists have been taught for the last 80 years that physical reality therefore only exists as a result of the act of observation. This is the ‘Copenhagen interpretation’ of quantum mechanics, developed in the late 1920’s by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. To quote Heisenberg: ‘I believe that the existence of the classical ‘path’ can be pregnantly formulated as follows: The ‘path’ comes into existence only when we observe it’.”
The passage above doesn’t actually mention “idealism” — yet the general gist seems to be that the Copenhagen interpretation is idealist (or at least subjectivist). And it isn’t at all odd that this writer thought this way about this interpretation of quantum mechanics.
So it’s important to stress that the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics is not idealist. Or at least the Copenhagen interpretation itself can be interpreted as not being idealist. That said, it is difficult to explain why that’s so. Indeed not many physicists — or even philosophers — have fully clarified why that is so.
Finally, there are stronger arguments which assert that quantum mechanics — if not the Copenhagen interpretation itself — is entirely subjectivist in nature. Yet there are clear differences between subjectivism and idealism. Indeed, Harry Nielsen’s words above can be interpreted as only claiming that the Copenhagen interpretation is subjectivist, not idealist.
Various philosophers (such as Karl Popper) have also argued against those who claim that quantum mechanics is subjectivist , let alone idealist (see Popper here).
It is therefore convenient that there’s a short and simple passage (as quoted in Karl Popper’s The Logic of Scientific Discovery) from the Austrian physicist Arthur March (1891–1957) which perfectly clarifies this issue.
Firstly, Arthur March makes an explicit anti-idealist statement. (It’s not clear if that was his main intention — indeed, it probably wasn’t.) He wrote:
“Naturally nobody is so mad as to assert that a body ceases to exist the moment we turn our backs to it [].”
[March was referring to quantum bodies such as particles; not cups, trees or human beings.]
An idealist, on the other hand, would argue that
a body ceases to exist the moment we turn our backs to it.
And that’s because, to an idealist, “a body” — and everything else — only exists in the individual mind or in some kind of collective mind. Thus, it does indeed cease to exist when “we turn our backs to it”. (Unless, that is, it still exists in the mind of God — as with Bishop Berkeley immaterialism, in some other being’s mind or in a collective mind.)
Arthur March, on the other had, stated that it is “mad [] to assert” that idealist position. Yet March did preface that phrase with the following words:
“One may say perhaps without fear of being misunderstood [] that for the physicist a body has reality only in the instant in which he observes it.”
It’s worth noting the phrase “for the physicist”.
This isn’t an expression of a philosophical view or even of a layperson’s position. As a physicist, March was speaking entirely as a physicist.
So even though it may be problematic to stress observation alone, this is still the stress of a physicist qua physicist. And, almost by definition, a physicist is only concerned with the observations of — and experiments on — a (in March’s word) body.
Thus March, qua physicist, stated that the
“[body] does cease, in the moment, to be an object of inquiry for the physicist”.
Why is that?
It’s
“because there exists no possibility of saying anything about it which is based on experiment”.
March’s statement above is true by definition. That is, what comes before the experiment can’t actually be part of the experiment. Or if someone does “say[] anything about it”, then what he says can’t be based on the experiment, and is therefore not itself physics. Indeed, even the mathematical formalism and/or the wave function required for the experiment has nothing to “say” about any bodies before the experiment.
The wave function has just been mentioned.
Thus, the standard interpretation of the wave function is that — in itself — it has no physical interpretation. It is purely a mathematical function. A tool. Something physicists use to do things with. Of course, it can then be given a physical interpretation.
Take the Schrödinger equation.
This doesn’t tell us what the wave function is — other than in purely mathematical terms. The physical meaning of the equation — i.e., what entities, etc. are posited — is a product of the interpretation of quantum mechanics the physicist adopts.
And even when physicists do “guess” at the (as it were) before-observation, that too is only a use of the wave function; which, again, is a large abstract mathematical object made of smaller mathematical objects.
So, basically, Arthur March, qua physicist, wasn’t interested in what might have been the case before the experiment. And, presumably, he wasn’t that interested in what was the case — i.e., in the experimental area — after he took off his white coat and packed up his bags to go home. Alternatively, if he was interested in both the before and after of the experiment, then it was as a philosopher or a layperson, not as a physicist.
As hinted at in the introduction, it’s at least partly understandable that some people see the Copenhagen interpretation as being philosophically idealist in nature. In the passage in the introduction, for example, Harry Nielsen quoted Werner Heisenberg.
So I’ll help Nielson’s cause along by also quoting Heisenberg stating the following:
“[A]n ‘objective’ physics in this sense, i.e. a sharp division of the world into object and subject has indeed ceased to be possible.”
Such passages from Heisenberg and others have provided grist to the mill for various idealists, mystics, New Agers and whatnot. Yet even here (on my reading of idealism at least) an idealist simply can’t make any distinction at all between “object and subject”. (Of course, it’s possible that the word “object” can be defined in such as way that it squares with idealism.) That’s because (to an idealist) literally everything is in the individual’s (or experimenter’s) mind. (Either that, or everything is in a collective mind or in the mind of God.) In other words, there is simply no object in idealism — we only have a subject or subjects.

When people hear ‘Danish,’ they typically think of Danish pastry, a multilayered sweet pastry with various fillings like cheese or a berry sauce. Or they think of Danish cheese.
From the moment I landed in Copenhagen, locals and people from my program told me to try the numerous famous bakeries in the city. Of course, as a foodie, I couldn’t say no.
But what I didn’t realize was how central of a gathering place bakeries are for Copenhageners (is that what they call them?). Their fast-paced life accompanies grabbing a pastry and cappuccino on their way to the office, or as a casual meet-up spot for friends as they get off work around 3 or 4 pm.
When I look back via camera roll at the delicious, warm, and fluffy pastries I tried, it evokes more than longing to have the level of freshness and quality these pastries have at an affordable price. It sucks me right back into highs and lows during my study abroad, new friendships blossoming, and lessons learned.
Here are five moments (and pastries) I am happy to share from my study abroad experience in Copenhagen:
A week into my stay, I found myself wandering through the streets near Kongens Nytorv, the city center filled with people, shops, and the famous Nyhavn canal. I was walking home after a class excursion feeling hungry and exhausted.
I was still figuring out public transportation (bus or train?) and I had unsuccessfully made any plans with new friends.
The homesickness and loneliness were starting to sink in.
I stumbled upon the nearest coffee shop, Farumhus, which translates to “farmhouse.” I walked in and ordered the Kanelstang, a cinnamon Danish pastry but elegantly twisted in various ways, depending on the bakery.
The place was about to close, so the lady ringing me up offered me an extra pastry for free. her kindness was a small act but stirred a few tears for me, sprouting a tiny sense of belonging in this new country.
Biting into the Kanelstang felt like a warm hug as well, with the generous layers of cinnamon and the intricate swirls, perfect for ripping pieces as I sat on a bench and people-watched for the evening.
I’ve been to this bakery twice during my stay and both times were with new friends I had made. My Food and Identity professor recommended this bakery, located in the Meatpacking District, to our class after a field study in the area.
My friends and I sat outside the bakery in Enghave Plads: this utopian park area where families, friends, and children gathered to chat, play, and spend time together. How I long for areas like these in the US. It was a great area to break the ice over delicious treats and get to know each other more.
As an Indian, trying a cardamom bun was absolutely out of my comfort zone. But strangely it’s a popular pastry option in Copenhagen. But the lemon tart was gorgeous. A light and fluffy meringue, with the tart lemon flavor, dare I say — it’s almost better than a key lime pie (shocker! as a Floridian.)
I was well into my study abroad and just completed my second session. Life was good, I was finally getting used to navigating the area, and made some good friends and memories. But I was longing for one of my favorite moments of my stay: my partner visiting me.
I purposely avoided a few attractions and restaurants to try when he got here, which included Skt. Peders Bageri, which translates to St. Peter’s bakery. A cozy bakery that hails as one of the oldest in Copenhagen, they’re known for their Wednesday snails (cinnamon rolls) that I regretfully did not try. I know nothing about authentic Danish food, but this certainly felt what ‘authentic’ would be.
I tried their plain croissant which was indubitably the BEST croissant I’ve had in my life (I think about it often..) and had to snag a blueberry pastry (pictured) as I saw a worker carry it out fresh from the oven.
Even trying my partner’s picks of pastries, every single item here was divine, fresh, heartwarming, perfectly sweet, with golden flaky crusts. This certainly ranks as the best bakery I tried on this list.
When I was down to a week left in Copenhagen, my friend and I scrambled to try the missing bakeries like Juno (pictured left), famous for its cardamom bun. This was the only bakery I waited an hour in line for. Would I say it was worth it? Maybe, if they had more options available.
But Juno sticks to what they do best and people line up for it, fostering this humming excitement waiting in line as people socialize — standing, sitting at tables, across the street if there’s no room — it feels like a hidden pocket of hygge [hue-gah], the epitome of Danish comfort and coziness.
I really was on my croissant high, trying one in both places, searching for a crust so flaky a knife would scrap across beautifully, a hint of sweetness and saltiness, and the soft multitude of layers inside.
After a long day of souvenir shopping my friend and I sat at Original Coffee, located in the heart of the Strøget shopping district. It’s located on the top floor of Illum, a department store, and serves as an excellent place to look at the city and reflect on the city.
We thought back on everything we got to experience and do, what we learned, whether would we even come back to Copenhagen, and when? What about a different place to study abroad? It certainly was a wistful atmosphere as we enjoyed our last few days being abroad.
My last ‘Danish’ meal before I headed to the airport to fly home, Joe and the Juice is the only place on this list that has a location back in the US. Their pricey smoothies and juices, along with the default Danish pastries, are available on every other corner of Copenhagen. They’re delicious and healthy. It’s no surprise that they’re one of the top food chains in Denmark.
Yet, it had me feeling nostalgic. Before coming to Copenhagen, I had heard and seen this chain but passed it off as a pricey, overly healthy spot that wasn’t worth going to.
However, coming to Copenhagen shook up my perspective on things, and now I was willing to try the very same spot in its original country. Studying abroad pushed me to try foods, and seek out places I would never go to back home. In Orlando, I’m so used to going to the same few spots, complaining about nothing new to do, and sending myself in the loop of my weekly routines.
But when I was in this brand new city, I was wide-eyed, ready to explore, and curious about each corner, hidden gem shawarma spot, an interesting castle, or nature an hour’s ride away.
I just hope to carry this newfound excitement in exploration as I explore my city and reminisce about my summer studying abroad in Copenhagen.

The unique mix of one-man play and opera was in town. The always charismatic John Malkovich came with disturbing confessions, the sopranos Chen Reiss and Susanne Langbein sang beautiful opera arias, and the Vienna Philharmonic played Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Vivaldi to make sure to deliver an unforgettable experience.
The Story
The story is about Jack Unterweger, the serial killer, the writer; the unloved child.
He murdered prostitutes and was sentenced to life in prison. In prison, he started to write poems, plays, and short stories and eventually earned literary respect. Two Nobel laureates in literature (Günter Grass and Elfriede Jelinek) were campaigning for Unterweger’s release because they believed that he was the proof that even the most repulsive people can be converted through art. His biography called Purgatory became a bestseller. Convinced that he was a changed man, he got released on parole. While he was invited to talk shows and other events, he still strangled and murdered prostitutes in Vienna, Graz, Prague, and Los Angeles. The FBI caught him after two years, and after being sentenced again he killed himself in his cell.
This play is meant to be his second biography.

(a to-do list at the bottom)
A city that mostly moves to the rhythm of cycles. With 350km of bicycle tracks, it’s a city where legs and bicycles are synonymous. Silences and blank expressions can be easily mistaken for snobbery, while in fact being softness, simplicity, and kindness of the locals. The cinnamon swirls are sweet and the coffee is strong, old guys play chess in Wednesday evening clubs and old ladies bike by faster than both of us.
I was educated on what makes a city truly ‘emotionally intelligent’ by the architects of a smart city, and something they said that has become my rule to observe was that — a city is not defined by the buildings it has or makes, its energy is defined by the spaces “between” those buildings. Copenhagen is a city where urban development has been based on and around its nature and green cover- that’s really the true beauty of this place. They make it easy to carry luggage without using cars, to walk, bike to work or run back home through lakes and gardens without worrying about traffic or breaking rules. It is truly a sustainably intelligent city.
Areas in Copenhagen are spread out wide, and very self-sustained in terms of food, coffee, parks and culture. Someone living in Frederiksberg doesn’t need to come into Indre-by and someone in Christiania has no actual need to go into Vesterbro. While I loved the neighborhood local vibe of Norrebero and Frederiksberg, I did feel like my eventual place of stay around HC Andersons Boulevard. From airbnbs to eco-hotels, the average rate in Copenhagen doesn’t vary too much if you’re a last-minute nomad like me but I highly recommend at least 2 days in the hotel I stayed in (details at the bottom)
Eat & Drink- only my 2023 favorites, in no way exhaustive :)
Stay- my personal favorite is the Manon Les Suites Hotel — an eco hotel with the best of comfort meets conscious in a central location. If you prefer an Airbnb, check the ones around Norrebro and make sure you check step free access.
Getting Around- Rent an e-bike but not from a hotel.
Yoga - I’ll always check out yoga studios in every city as a personal rule and my favorite one here was ‘Rive Gauche’. The weekly pass makes it easier on the pocket than a one time pay.
Places to Run/Walk- The Lakes, Rosenborg Gardens, Frederiksberg Garden

Grundtvigs Church was erected in commemoration of the great Danish priest, poet, and reformer N.F.S. Grundtvig (1783–1882). This monumental church is referred to in modern terms as a gothic cathedral. Master builder and architect Peder Vilhelm Jensen Klint (1853–1930) died before the church was finished. The task was entrusted to his son architect and designer Kaare Klint (1888–1954), who completed the building of the church in 1940. Kaare Klint has also designed the chairs for the Grundtvigs Church — a chair made of beech wood with wickerwork seat — a Danish furniture design classic. Despite its massive size, the church seems to exude an atmosphere of calm contentment. Perhaps it is the appeal of the regular yellow brickwork forming the sole decoration of the church.

Conceived as an iconic building, which create awareness of cancer without stigmatizing the patients. Designed as a number of small houses combined into one, the center provides the space needed for a modern health facility, without losing the comforting scale of the individual. The houses are connected by raised roof shaped like a Japanese paper art origami, which gives the building a characteristic signature.

The close coexistence between private and communal spaces, often separated only by a thin door, makes this hall of residence quite unique. In fact, the dialogue between individuality and communality forms the very basis for the architecture and layout of Tietgenkollegiet.
Tietgenkollegiet was the result of an architecture competition organised by the Nordea Denmark Foundation with the intention of building a visionary version of the hall of residence of tomorrow. Lundgaard and Tranberg’s round building won the competition. On both the architectural and metaphorical fronts, it is all about inclusion, community and equality.
Rued Langgaards Vej 10–18, Ørestad North
Built for The Medical Association housing scheme and initially were known as Lægeforeningens Boliger. These well-built but relatively inexpensive houses for poor families were some of the first social housing in Copenhagen and were built on the initiative of doctor Emil Hornemann as an immediate and practical response to a cholera epidemic in Copenhagen in 1853.

Cirkelbroen
Cirkelbroen celebrates pedestrians. It reflects the daily life and intimacy that you find around the canal in the Christianshavn neighbourhood, its houseboats and sailing boats, the unique life on the ramparts. Copenhagen’s harbour was once a centre of maritime activity, and Cirkelbroen is a testimony to that history. While working on the bridge, I remembered the fishing boats I saw as a child in Iceland. In the harbour, the boats were often moored right next to each other, and it sometimes seemed that you could even cross the harbour just by walking from boat to boat.
Christianshavns Kanal, København K
The Kalvebod Waves
When addressing this infamously gloomy and desolated side of the harbor, the architects put their focus on two major design aspects: to create urban continuity and to locate the new structure on the sunny spots in the water.
Facing Southeast, the quay has fantastic sun conditions until the early afternoon, but to attract the public after working hours the architects needed to study the course of the shadows casted by the huge buildings along the promenade. The two new main piers are located in the shadow-free zones and programmed as active islands on the water. The project then re-connects those islands to the urban network and to makes them blend naturally into the city’s infrastructure. Two bridges link the tip of the main piers back to the old quay, creating two inner water-basins for watersport activities.
Superkilen
Superkilen is a park that supports diversity. It is a world exhibition of furniture and everyday objects from all over the world, including benches, lampposts, trash cans and plants — requisites that every contemporary park should include and that the future visitors of the park have helped to select. Superkilen reattributes motifs from garden history. In the garden, the translocation of an ideal, the reproduction of another place, such as a far off landscape, is a common theme through time. As the Chinese reference the mountain ranges with the miniature rocks, the Japanese the ocean with their rippled gravel, or how the Greek ruins are showcased as replicas in the English gardens. Superkilen is a contemporary, urban version of a universal garden.

Politikens Boghal
With two floors filled with books written in Danish and English, Politikens Boghal is fairly-often considered one of the top choices for book lovers in Copenhagen. The warm bookstore associated with Politiken, one of the largest newspapers in the country, has been welcoming locals and foreigners since 1915. On its selves, visitors can find old and new releases of everything from fiction and poetry to nature and hobby books. Moreover, special events such as concerts, speeches, and presentations take place regularly throughout the year attracting the city’s intellectual crowd.

Cinnober Bookstore
Cinnober has been standing in the heart of the city center for approximately 10 years. Its founders, Ulla Welinder and Morten Voigt, have a great passion for graphic design and illustration. Therefore, a big part of their book selection consists of magazines and books that showcase the best of design, architecture, and art. Make sure to stop by while exploring the area around the Round Tower and rummage through the bookstore’s collection of local artists’ prints and paper products. Visitors might even find a special souvenir to take back home.

My brother, who’s a volunteer, greeted me in pink sunglasses, with a big smile, and an “I haven’t slept yet”. It’s Saturday, 9.30 at Ungdomsøen. In the short distance, I heard an intense bass blasting into the greyscale sky.
We dropped my bag at the camping area. Spending time at major festivals throughout the summer made me notice how clean it was. Despite me arriving four days into the festival, no trash was lingering around, no broken pavilions, no lonely crying.
As I got a tour around the island, I started to understand why there seemed to be an invisible cloud of respect and love. No brands were screaming their logos into my face, no careless investors were occupied with my amount of money. When you build with a pure heart, you attract pure hearts and pure behaviour.
It’s 11 in the morning. At Astral we sat down for a moment. Platforms vibrating with the music were occupied by sleeping cuddles, stretching bodies and tired dancers. The ambience sound playing was in my head the sound of the universe. The projections on the walls allowed my imagination to be imagination, as I closed my eyes and landed on planet Kune.
Close to noon, I understood that time is irrelevant. 15 people were dancing to an after-hour groove at Space. The atmosphere was uplifted, yet exhausted. A magical mix. At Vessel, the sound was fast, edged and deep. Several people came to say hi, saying that they haven’t seen me all week. As I explained that I just arrived, I was greeted with hugs, smiles and “please enjoy”.
I sent my brother to sleep, agreeing to meet again at night. At the harbour, I asked about the food, as I started to feel hungry for lunch. There’s no third-party involved, all food was thought and created at and by the festival.
People arrived at the same destination for a bite. Some before finally going to bed, some for a wake-up meal. They all smiled at me.
I spent the daytime napping, walking around, talking to people. In Copenhagen, I am so used to introducing myself with my job, my place of living. My commercialised existence. Here, no one cared about my fancy title, yearly income or place of birth. I met Daniel from Romania, Ash from Australia, Olivia and Lukas from Denmark, Toni from Hungary, Anne from France. English was default, as the world united on a small island in the middle of Øresund.
As the night sat, a few hours of sleep had done wonders to the face of my dear brother. He and his girlfriend gave me a tour around the many tunnels before we grabbed dinner in the kitchen. Tomato soup and a Moroccan stew warmed me up as my body was thankful for a fresh and homemade meal made with love and appreciation for its ingredients.
A beer and a drink later, I found myself in front of the speakers at Space. The darker it got, the more magical it all seemed. The stage was sculptured in wood as visuals reflected, played and enhanced the artwork. I couldn’t stop looking, moving, smiling.
I have spent many years feeling awkward, feeling wrong, feeling like the one on the outside. As if I was born on the wrong side of the glass, peeking in on the many people moving their hips, choking alcohol and aggressive consumption culture. I spent the summer missing Copenhagen 10 years ago. Back when Saxons, KB18, Christiania, Ungdomshuset and pirate parties were dominating the underground with heavy drum N bass, dubstep, techno, jungle and everything between and outside. But there, in front of the Space speakers, I finally felt like I did 10 years ago, I felt like I was on the right side of the glass.
At Vessel, I arrived at a deep and evil sound. The screens reflected my inner stage, as I let go. Of whatever was on the mainland, whatever was in the world, whatever was on my worried mind. I no longer cared for time, schedules, work or hate. All I cared about was dancing with people who like me, gave up modern slavery for a moment, only to be slaves of the bass. And damn, that bass deserved my soul.
The night was a pendulum between Space, Vessel, Amphi, Astral and water views. I got lost several times, but it didn’t feel like getting lost. I noticed how the clean behaviour continued into the dark. Trash was being sorted, pocket ashtrays used, water drank. Once in a while, someone in a red Kune-shirt asked me if I was feeling all right, they were the safer space guards. The funny thing is, that a small island with young people and 24 hours music sounds like a recipe for chaos and uncontrolled madness — but never have I visited a festival where I felt safer. People knew what they were doing, and did it with respect. For each other, for Kune and for themselves.
As the sun peaked above the horizon, I started to feel my sore feet at Vessel. We sat down, a random group of people. We shared a moment. Thoughts and ideas were aired, and I understood, that this is the place where the ‘angry young people’ smile. Not because they party, but because they feel free to let dreams touch reality. I came down, feeling like I landed on a soft pillow of utopian hope.
Thank you, Kune. Your revolution is heartfelt, honest and kind. I’ll carry it with me until I’ll see you again next year.

By Kai Chen
I studied abroad in Copenhagen last semester through DIS Copenhagen. Copenhagen is gorgeous! The colorful buildings, the cozy cafes, and the endless green spaces all make for the perfect European vibe. As soon as I got off the plane, I knew I was in for an incredible adventure.
As someone who is passionate about foreign languages, I was stoked to dive headfirst into Danish culture and start learning the language. The Danes are all about hygge (coziness), and the language has fun words and phrases you won’t find anywhere else. Plus, the locals were super patient with my attempts to speak Danish and were always down to teach me new words, as is the case with pretty much everywhere else I’ve been to in Europe.
Taking economics classes in Copenhagen has been a unique and enriching experience. One key difference between these courses and those at Duke University is the practical approach to learning in Danish economics classes. Through field trips to France and Belgium, I saw firsthand how economic principles are applied in real-world contexts. Traveling to those countries as part of one of my economics classes gave me invaluable insights into different economic systems and policies and how they impact societies. This hands-on approach to learning economics allowed me to directly apply the knowledge I gained in class and see its real-world implications, a departure from my classes at Duke that did not typically involve field trips. Another notable distinction was the informal relationship with professors in Denmark, as I could address them by their first names, creating a more relaxed and approachable learning environment. This unique blend of practicality and informality in my economics class in Copenhagen has broadened my perspective on the subject and enriched my overall learning experience.
But the best part? Getting to travel all over Europe! Copenhagen is such a perfect home base for exploring other countries. I hopped on trains and planes to visit cities like Hamburg, Amsterdam, and Paris. It was amazing to see each culture’s differences through their architectures, and I love to explore those cultures through their nature, and oftentimes, museums as well.
Back in Denmark, I loved exploring all the cool neighborhoods of Copenhagen. From the hipster vibes of Nørrebro to the quaint streets of Christianshavn, there was always something new to see. And the food? Don’t even get me started. Danish pastries, smørrebrød, and hot dogs (yes, hot dogs) were some of my favorites.
And let’s not forget about the people! I made some of the coolest friends during my study abroad program from all over the world. We bonded over our love of travel, languages, and hygge, and we still keep in touch today.
Overall, my study abroad experience in Copenhagen was one for the books. I got to immerse myself in a new language and culture, travel Europe, and make lifelong friends. If you’re into languages and travel like me, I can’t recommend studying abroad enough!

In the beginning of March 2023 we met in Copenhagen for a 3-day WP4 workshop focused on the ongoing development of our PwY decision support tool (DST) that is a deliverable of the Working Package 4. During these days, members of the Swedish team from Södertörn University met with colleagues from Copenhagen University for hands-on activities meant to advance our project on selected aspects of the decision support tool.
Image: collective activity for identifying relevant stakeholder and methods.
During these three days, we revised findings from WP2 and WP3. Work package 2 focuses on the study of current challenges and opportunities planners and other professional face in Sweden, Netherlands and Denmark in relation to the involvement of youth in spatial planning. Work package 3 focuses on testing, exploring and piloting with different participatory methods and it seeks to understand if and how these allow youth to participate in meaningful ways. In this sense, WP4 and its deliverable, the decision support tool, brings all that research insight together in an integrated way.
Image: Sofia Lundmark facilitating an activity for the workshop.
The workshop was facilitated by our team collaborator Sofia Lundmark, Senior Lecturer at Media Technology Department at Södertörn University. Sofia use methods from design studies to facilitate the sessions and led us over key questions.
Our project team is a combination of collaborators with different scientific backgrounds and experiences who are connected by an interest in interdisciplinary approaches to sustainability and urban planning. This diversity allows us to borrow tools and perspectives from each other’s discipline, stay fresh and be creative. This is particularly important when developing and designing a tool meant for use in different national contexts and by different stakeholders.
But what is the Planning with Youth decision support tool and whom is it meant to support?
Decision support tools are a compilation of information and data organized in a systemic way meant to assist professionals with their day-to-day work. A DST does not give a final answer as such but gives access to needed information and data for the professional to consider and use in decision-making processes on a given matter.
Planning and urban governance is a field with many decisions support tools and systems. But very few are developed in the context of youth and children participatory processes. Our objective is to contribute with a new tool for planners and practitioners to use when needing to prepare and delivery participatory processes that are meaningful for children and young people.
The DST will provide planners and practitioners with key information about methods for involving children and young people in participatory planning. We envision for the PwY tool to become a useful instrument. For the Swedish context, this is particularly relevant considering that from 2021 and following the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child, planners are obliged by law to include children and youth in participatory spatial planning processes. You can read more about the Swedish context and its challenges in this article produced by members of our team.
Furthermore, even in countries that have not enforced the inclusion of youth in urban planning, this remains an ongoing and necessary challenge that aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Ultimately, we hope that by using the DST urban planners will get the support they need to create (with youth) cities that are more democratic, sustainable and accessible and reflect the needs and uses of the entire population.

Stay tuned for more on our upcoming decision support tool!

Copenhagen inspiration from one friend of a friend to another
I recently booked a weekend in Stockholm to visit some friends who’d moved there. To make the most of being in the area, I added a few days somewhere I heard people consistently rave about: Copenhagen.
▶️ Instagram Highlights️️▶ Copenhagen Google Map▶ Visit Copenhagen Official Website
I put up a call for tips on my Instagram right before going and received so many wonderful tips that I felt I should make a guide linking it all together. The result is a combination of the top things recommended, with a bit of Stubborn Travel curation and personal favourites. I hope it can help as a quick planning aid to this delightful city, home to the happiest people on Earth.
A huge thank you to the awesome travellers and locals who contributed, especially Amalie, Courtenay, James, Nina and Caitlin.

Welcome to the United Nations Career Journey Podcast, where we interview colleagues working for the United Nations all around the world. Our conversations explore their fascinating career paths, what career satisfaction means to them, and how they keep learning and developing on the job. My name is Petra, and today, our conversation is with Iina Paarma who works as a Chief of the Talent Development Unit at the UNDP’s Office of Human Resources based in Copenhagen, Denmark. Welcome to the Career Journey Podcast Iina, it’s good to see you. And thank you very much for joining us. It’s a pleasure to have you as our guest speaker on the podcast.
Hi, Petra. Thank you. It’s my pleasure to be here with you today.
Thank you again. And could you introduce yourself to our listeners?
Absolutely. So, my name is Iina Paarma. And as Petra said, I’m the Chief of the Talent Development Unit at UNDP. I’m also a proud mother of two children. And I grew up in Finland and sometime in my early teenage years, I started dreaming of an international career in international development.
Lovely, thank you very much. My first question that I want to ask about your career is how did you begin your career? It can be internships, or maybe first job, so what was the start of your career?
Well, during my studies, I did have a chance to do an internship in my home country’s representation office in Vienna, in Austria. And I also studied one term in Geneva, as an exchange student during my master’s studies. And another one actually in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. But after completing my master’s degrees, I actually landed a job in the private sector, and then actually another job in the private sector. But somewhere during those years, I did realize that the sort of the dream to be part of the UN, or the international community, had actually never really disappeared. And so, I started applying for jobs in different international organizations. This was already around the time when I was approaching 30. It took it took almost three years, but then late 2012, I got my first assignment with UNOPS, actually here in Copenhagen, and I spent a number of years in that agency. And then, in 2017, I joined UNDP, in New York City after having applied for a position that I found on UNDP Jobs site.
Thank you for this introduction, Iina. And how was the transition into getting into UNDP, after spending time in the private sector and also in another UN organization? And also, which specific tools have been useful for you for this transition, and during this transition?
Yeah, I mean, when I joined the UN, then in 2012, early 2013, that’s when I was coming from the private sector, and I joined UNOPS in Copenhagen. So that transition wasn’t actually that, you know, that big one. It was really a dream to come true. But in terms of specific tools that have been useful, I think, first of all, I’ve tried to do my job as well as I only can. And secondly, you know, I have hopped on every opportunity that was given to me. And early on in the UN, in UNOPS, I also had fantastic bosses who believed in me and took me to meetings, and, you know, let me job shadow them. And that has been incredibly powerful, and I am really, forever grateful for this. And it was a pivotal steppingstone for me to be able to be sort of, on-the-job mentored by my people manager early on in my UN days. Then in terms of tools in general, I mean, I learned incredibly much from interactions with others. So, in that sense, the transition to the UN wasn’t a difficult one, it was a fascinating one.
That’s very good to hear. And I think these points are can be very useful for someone who is trying to look for maybe inspiration or ways to do that step to get into the UN system, but also just career tips in general. So, thank you so much for, for sharing those. So, your role as the Chief of the Talent Development Unit, could you explain a little bit to our listeners what is it about, what are some of the tasks that are a part of your daily job?
Yeah. So, you know, UNDP, we’re a big organization, we are close to 20,000 people in 170 countries. So, this role is really to lead the Talent Development Unit that focuses on leadership development, people manager development, career experiences, capability development. So, we have the three sort of main components in the unit. And overall, we are catering for the talent needs of the whole organization. We are really looking at talent development and learning as something that happens in the flow of work. It’s, it’s not a one-off sort of exercise, it’s sort of part of our DNA as an organization. We believe that creating a learning organization is something that is embedded in every aspect of the organization. And UNDP puts a lot of effort in talent development, we see that as a catalyst for organizational performance, for sure. But also, people’s careers, their career development, and their professional development.
This is great, and working with learning and talents, that must be something very rewarding for you as well, to help the people to develop themselves. But I would like to ask you my next question, and that is, what do you like the most about your role? What aspects of your job of your current job bring you career satisfaction?
I think for me, I am a people person. So definitely teamwork and learning from others. And the fact that I do feel very privileged to have the opportunity to work with people from all over the world, it is extremely rewarding to constantly, you know, develop oneself as one hears about other people’s perspectives based on their backgrounds, you know, be it educational, or cultural, or other backgrounds. The UN is also a big part of my identity. So, so serving this greater purpose of the UN is something that brings me enormous satisfaction. So then when I think about the current role, our team is not in the frontlines of international development. But what brings us satisfaction is the fact that we can develop the ones who are closer to our beneficiaries. And we can see that directly translated into better results on the ground.
That sounds great. And I think this is something that is a big motivating factor for many people working at the UN. And you also mentioned that it was your dream, when you were younger, that, you know, you really wanted to work for the UN. So, it’s actually great that it’s now a part of your daily motivation and career satisfaction. On the other hand, what are some of the more challenging, perhaps, aspects of your job? Or something that you need to continuously work with? Could you just share some of those with our listeners?
Yeah, you know, I think in terms of challenges, this is a global organization that’s present in 170 countries like I mentioned, and this means that someone is always awake, and the work never stops. So, I would say, you know, UN colleagues in general are very committed, you know, hardworking people. So, it’s very easy to sort of get into that sort of ‘someone is always awake’ mode. So, I would say that what I’m trying to learn is to manage myself in such a way that I allow enough time to rest and recharge, so as to be the best version of myself in the workplace.
That’s very good to highlight because I think this topic is very important. And to highlight the need for, you know, strengthening your resilience and well-being is something very important. So, thank you for bringing that to the discussion. And that actually kind of leads to my next question. Sometimes our mental health can be challenged by big changes, challenging moments, and it can take a toll on how we feel about our careers. So my next question is, could you share a time in your career where you had some big changes in responsibilities of your role, and how did you approach it and what did you learn from it?
Yeah, I think, I think maybe the sort of critical juncture for me was when I joined UNDP, in 2017, and moved to New York, the new role was quite different from my previous role and UNDP, as an organization also worked in a very different way than my previous organization. So I think I learned to appreciate that it takes some time to grasp the new context and asking the right questions and understanding that, you know, one should not assume that what worked well in your previous role and organization is, is sort of directly applicable in the in the new content, or in the new context. I think the learnings maybe happened, sort of, in some kind of internal after-action review and reflection, also now in hindsight, realizing that UN, especially when it comes to relocations, those are not only your decisions, if you have family members who are joining you, and so, so certainly reflecting afterwards, the appreciation of the willingness of my family to join me and also looking back at not only those years, but also throughout my career in the UN, as someone who was raising children as well, I am having such gratitude and sort of humility. And understanding that those people around me, you know, grandparents and relatives and their immediate family members have certainly been enablers for me, and for that I am, I am very grateful.
That’s lovely, thank you so much for sharing that. And, yeah, I can totally imagine that these changes of relocating to a different country, different continent, changing your are a big milestone in everyone’s lifetime. And so sharing those learning outcomes might be very useful and good to hear, and I’m sure a lot of our listeners can relate to it as well. Talking about living abroad and having different international experiences, experiences from different career paths and career experiences, what are some of the best tips you have gathered throughout your career so far, when it comes to either creating a career that you like, creating a satisfying career, or just navigating a career in general?
Well, I think it’s important to follow your heart and your passion, when you enjoy what you do, it makes, it makes it all so much easier. And it shows also in the results you deliver, you know, when I grew up, the mentality was a little bit like, you know, job is a job, and then life happens outside of the job, and you should sort of play the same card, you know, study hard and get a job that you can have until you retire. And, you know, we all know, especially the young generations, that those days are over. So, I think maybe, you know, understanding that these type of career moves and career aspirations, they always come with a certain risk. You can’t have it all, you know, you should always in mind, you follow your passion, and understand that that’s not necessarily always the most sort of stable path. But if that’s what you truly want, you should go for it. And then I think in general, I mean, when it comes to sort of career tips, I’m not sure if I’m the best one to share any of those. Once someone much wiser than me told me that, you know, essentially, there are two ways to plan your career, either you go with the flow, or you have clear goals of the type of roles and profiles you’re aspiring for, and then, you know, you make a roadmap and follow that path. Honestly, I have personally been one of the sorts of go with the flow type of profiles. And, you know, that has worked for me. I have jumped on the opportunities that had been in front of me, and sometimes it’s been daunting, but I would say, you know, go for it. All jobs are extremely valuable. You learn things in whatever role you have, for however short time you would have that, you know, it teaches you about the role itself, but it also allows you to meet different people who might have different tips.
These are really great tips and advice and I’m sure the listeners will find it very helpful because I think it’s always good to be reminded of, you know, following the passion and having that as the guiding… guiding light of when you’re trying to navigate through the career so, so thank you very much for that. I’d like to ask you, where would you like to be career-wise in the next coming years? Or do you have any maybe aspirations as well? I know you just shared with us that you prefer to, you know, maybe go with the flow. But is there anything you’d like to achieve in the next coming years in terms of your career?
Oh, thanks for the question. You know, I love my current role. I‘ve been in this role for some 18 months. And I feel that I still have quite a lot to give in this current position. And then future will show what’s the what’s next in in store for me.
Well thank you very much, and I wish you all the best! I really enjoyed our conversation. And I found it very interesting and insightful. And yeah, I hope you had a good time as well.
Absolutely. My pleasure Petra, and keep up with the great job, great work that you’re doing here with the podcast.
Thank you very much! And thank you to all our listeners. We hope you enjoyed this episode and that our conversations will inspire you to keep learning and advancing in your careers. If you liked the episode, please share it with your friends and colleagues, and make sure to tune in for the next one.

Just about a year ago I moved into this incredibly small and beautiful country called Denmark all the way from India to pursue my PhD. I had dreamt about it for a long time and it was so surreal when I actually landed in Copenhagen. Noone back home understood why I chose this strange far away cold land when I could have been applying to top universities in the US; hustling away in pursuit of an empire I had no desire to build in the first place. To me, a safe, happy and a peaceful place would make moving my entire life to another country absolutely worth it. Copenhagen consistently ranked among the top three livable cities in the world while Denmark is popularly known for being one of the happiest countries across the entire world. I knew that as an expat the rules would be different; I wouldn’t share the same benefits that the Danes enjoy and perhaps, my opinions about the happiness index would be different from how the Danes perceive it. That is not say that the index is wrong because it is indeed the opinions of the Danish citizens that actually matter.
My priorities in life were always different. I didn’t care about owning a car and a house to display how successful I was in my social circle. To me, peace of mind, having just enough of what you need and want, and respect were above materialistic desires. That is not to say that money didn’t matter to me. I want to be wealthy in terms of experiences, good health, healthy relationships and money is just a part of wealth. As an overly anxious, introverted and sensitive person, I learnt from a very young age what my triggers were and how to cope with them and so I knew that working in an annoyingly bureaucratic corporate structure and culture was not for me. While I have financially successful friends I really respect and admire, I have no desire to talk the same language as them. I started working young and ensured that I would never have to borrow money from my parents anymore whether it was for my education or materialistic pursuits. If I couldn’t afford it, I wouldn’t buy it. I chose academia simply because at the time it gave me the freedom to think, read, and write the way I wanted and I was given due credit for it. I wanted to move away right after my Masters but my father was clear that unless I had a scholarship, it wouldn’t be worth it. And, that’s when it all began! A six year long journey post my Masters making peanuts but doing what I loved, saving just enough to finally take the leap. I had my eyes on Denmark for many reasons, the most important being safety and gender equality.
One year down and I wouldn’t call it perfect but I know it in my gut that I made the right choice. They ask, what was the biggest culture shock for you when you moved here? I laugh! Because India has given me far more cultural shocks than I expect to experience anywhere else. I have lived in different parts of India and navigated life across language and cultural barriers. We were united by the delicious food and our diversity itself! I am grateful for my journey from a tiny Indian town noone knows of to this beautiful city where I am living the life I always dreamt of. Life in India prepared me for life in a strange country I had absolutely no connection to. The struggles are not unfamiliar— a different language, the lack of a social circle, having to find an affordable living arrangement, getting familiar with the rules and regulations. Things that took me a while getting adjusted to was the right-hand traffic and the fact that there was barely any traffic :D Sure, the weather is rough and the winters are dark and the Danes are reserved (you know the stereotype), but every single day I am in awe of how this tiny little dot on the world map evolved into an architectural beauty, home to some of the largest MNCs and holding an impressive reputation of being politically progressive.
Danmark er virkelig et dejligt land! There was not a single day when a Dane refused to help a “confused” me trying to get used to the city. Often they would greet with a pleasant smile and would appreciate you trying to speak a little bit of broken Danish while making small talk. I deliberately chose to work with a Danish supervisor for two reasons — first I wanted to push myself to work with unfamiliar people (since Indians tend to flock to each other everywhere in the world; I am guilty of this too) and second, I had some serious toxic boss baggage from India that I knew would ease off in the flat heirarchical structure Scandanivian countries are famous for. Wait, I could call my seniors by their first names and they wouldn’t mind? And did you say they don’t call you after work hours (they never call you at all if you are lucky)? Also, you are not obligated to respond to their emails after 5 pm? Wait, did they ask for my opinion? Oh wait, the professors consider their PhD students “colleagues” and not slaves? And…whaaattt!! I am paid a living wage as a PhD student? To me, this was a dream! This is where I felt I could become a well-rounded person whose opinions were equally important and my gender didn’t decide how much I was paid.
I won’t lie I did have my own insecurities (thanks to our colonial past and the ensuing inferiority complex). I was in this land full of white people with beautiful blue/green eyes and blond hair, ones I had only seen on Television up until I moved to Denmark. Soon enough I realised we are bonded by similar desires and experiences that is only natural to the humankind and it is not the color of our skin but our openness to embracing the unknown that really mattered. Sure, I felt unseen many times in a conversation across a table that only white people could connect to (endless discussions over the origins of wine and cheese like we talk about chai and samosas) but this would be followed by a few empathetic people (or those afraid to be perceived as politically incorrect…kidding!) displaying a little bit of curiosity into my culture. I was suddenly representing India in these conversations; not my tiny hometown, not the cities that I lived in but the rich and diverse country that India is. I was educating people who had these preconceived biases against the Indians, some of which were quite ridiculous and rude to be frank (if you don’t eat red meat, you are religious; most of India is polluted, poor and filthy). Some of them had ill-informed opinions about Hinduism and the political situation in the country! On the other hand I was surprised by how India was perceived by Europeans in general. Many considered it to be the land of CEOs, shooting for the galaxies, full of lucrative investment opportunities, ofcourse Bollywood and interestingly home to the good “green stuff” (if you know what I mean ;)). Some applauded me for the bold choice to move to a cold country all the way from India while some struggled to grasp why any South Asian would want to move to this part of the world. I just enjoyed the ride! I am not one to get offended easily. It is only natural to have your prejudices but come to me with an open mind and I will answer all your questions. How you frame your words and the way you speak them tells me a bit about your upbringing and the conscious efforts you put into educating yourself to get rid of your biases often shaped by problematic western constructs. So hey! It has nothing to do with the color of your skin. You can be brown, white, black, straight, gay, queer and whatever you identify as and still be a vile person. In Denmark though, I have mostly met the nicest and most open minded people. They are not intrusive (which unfortunately we Indians could be most of the time), they are polite and respectful of other’s time and space, they call a spade a spade and they really do have a wonderful life outside of work (hygge anyone???). This is the place where I feel my own person, where nobody cares about my age, gender, marital status and whether or not I have kids. I am a far more evolved person than I was when I first moved here and I am doing things I never believed I would be able to do.
So that’s my first Medium post here, a short story of an Indian smalltowner in Denmark. Not sure if I would still call this the happiest place in the world but this sure is the happiest I have ever been :)

I remember well the last days before I left my Vilnius. Days, where I have been walking in the city, going to the places that I have always wanted to, but did not have time for it, spending time with my family and meeting with good old friends. Those days were great. However, the time flies fast. And even though I was quite excited to start a new life in a foreign country, I was also a bit worried. Who will be my new friends? When will Ifind a job? Will I like the studies? How will Copenhagen greet me? After a year of living here, I have found some answers.
Copenhagen greeted me with big white clouds and the hustle in the airport. The hustle of the people greeting their fellow travelers and the hustle of the people running for their planes. An airport is a place where people come and go. And I was one of the many arrived to Copenhagen. I remember that I was not at all impressed by Copenhagen in the first days. So many buildings so similar to each other, so few green spaces compressed between them and cyclists with their angry faces.
It is now, a year after living in Copenhagen, I understand that Copenhagen has so much to offer. Small details matter in this city and it feels like the community is trying to make it with a personal touch. Buildings in different neighborhoods do not look alike and there are very nice green spaces within the city. Only my perception of cyclists did not change.
Nevertheless, I came here to study Organizational Innovations and Entrepreneurship (OIE) — a masters program organized by Copenhagen Business School (CBS). The program offered quite an interesting path of studying, combining theoretical knowledge and practical classes with the most diverse class that I’ve been a part of in my life.
The beginning of the studies was quite interesting. We’ve had an introduction week, organized by previous OIE students, where we had a chance to visit some of the most prominent startup hubs and companies in Copenhagen, mingle together and get to know what awaits us in the future.
And the future was…
Studies at OIE program comprise of two different sets of subjects divided into 4 quarters throughout the first year. One subject will be practical (lectures which are happening in Studio) and the other one — theoretical. On the second year of education students are allowed to choose between exchange, electives, summer university or internship. Or it can be a mix of everything (up to 30 ECTS credits). After that — only master thesis and graduation, where everybody is happy :)
But let’s get back to the first year with compulsory subjects. As it was mentioned before there were 4 quarters with different focuses:
Furthermore, we have also had an elective course — study trip to Silicon Valley, where we have met 28 different companies throughout 2 weeks. You can read more about it in my previous stories on Medium (beginning, part 1, part 2).
As the courses implied, we have been working hard on different business ideas every quarter. I remember it like yesterday:
Q1. Developing an app for finding people/friends with similar interests
Q2. Developing a lip balm for winter sports enthuziasts
Q3. Developing a YouTube channel about local undiscovered places
Q4. Researching the “precariat” & changing spaces (in our case — CPH Village and containers made livable).
Plus we’ve had some of the theoretical classes related to the classical understanding of entrepreneurship, strategic management of innovations, the art of innovation (like design-driven innovation) and some other interesting activities combined together.
Last, but not least, CBS really tries hard to develop in us the entrepreneurial spirit, creating opportunities for the students to go further and make the ideas real. As part of our program, we have been also introduced to Copenhagen School of Entrepreneurship, whereas we, if there is any business idea, could try to get in and use the co-working spaces, advisors and other useful programs for free throughout the different stages of development.
Overall, the OIE program allows to develop the skills and abilities, necessary for becoming an entrepreneur or working with innovations within different fields. Plus, if you have a business idea — you can go for it. Nevertheless, the living costs in Copenhagen are not cheap and a big part of a Danish student life will be described in the next chapter.
Most of the students in Denmark are combining studies with student jobs. That’s a fact. Even though they are generously paid by the government scheme called SU, they are still working as part-time employees in different companies, starting from cafes and bars and ending with study-related jobs.
As my finances did not allow me to live here for two years without having an actual job, I started to look for the new opportunities in Copenhagen. Even though it took me some time (including exams and other activities) to find an actual first job (to be precise — 4 months), I had a great experience learning how the Danish job market operates.
Throughout the 4-month period I had 6 job interviews with different companies, where I had a chance to present myself and also get to know the other side of the table. In the end, I have landed a job at a local food chain, where I have been working as Operations Assistant, learning to deal with numbers, revenues, Excel and developing programs. Nevertheless, during the summer situation has changed and I have to find a new job, which I would like to learn from most, combining my previous experience with my skills and knowledge.
One lesson that I have learned throughout the year — try to be more unique in every aspect that goes throughout the job search adventure. And, the most important, show the companies what you can bring to the advertised position and show that you are a valuable person worth the salary that you will get while working there.
Pro tip: students from EU — if you have a part-time job, working min. 10–12 hours/week — apply for a student scholarship (SU) to be equal with Danish students. More info: www.su.dk
What is a student life without fun? The answer is easy — it is not a student life. People, with whom you are studying, can bring a lot of joy, happiness and adventures throughout the years that you will be studying together and, most probably, they will become the friends for life.
I had the honor to meet with people from different countries and cultures, with whom I had a lot of fun and great things done together. Copenhagen is a great city, where if you want to do something — you will find it. It offers a wide variety of events, places, bars, cafes, parks where you can hang out with your friends, meet even more people and learn about Danish traditions. And, the most important thing, not to be lonely, because sometimes that feeling of being such can come.
Last year I have visited many different places and hometowns of my friends — Bornholm, Aalborg, San Francisco, Asturias. I have also participated in many local traditional events and learned more about Danish culture and who are Danes. Funny enough, but while being in Denmark, I have learned a lot about Mexican culture :) I had a lovely Christmas-New Year’s Eve period, seeing the local traditions and participating in them, seeing how Danes can be welcoming and how cozy are their homes.
Pro tip: check out the Survival Guide in Denmark, it is a great guide to find almost everything you need before your arrival or during your stay.
The first year in Denmark was an amazing experience. The weather was great (4 months of sun in a row), the people are awesome, the studies and the job gave me lots of new skills and knowledge.
I believe that the next year will be even better, with more interesting discoveries, experiences and amazing people. Especially now, when everybody will be back in Copenhagen and will be ready to rock’n’roll.

Copenhagen, Denmark (population of 799,033 as of 2020)
Copenhagen aims to be the world’s first carbon-neutral capital city by 2025 (The CPH 2025 Climate Plan, Copenhagen — Urban Development). Politically, the city also intends to demonstrate how it is possible for big cities to combine growth, development, and an enhanced quality of life while reducing carbon emissions at the same time. This goal sets Copenhagen as a frontrunner in the international arena.
Copenhagen designed its Climate Plan Roadmap in three phases and set on the first phase of the net-zero journey in 2013 with the ultimate goal to become carbon neutral by 2025. The plan was developed in line with the emergence of new knowledge and technology, as continued innovation allowed to make carbon reduction strategies possible and at scale. At the same time, the CPH 2025 Climate Plan seeks to enhance the quality of life for Copenhageners using carbon neutrality goals to change behavior and stimulate innovation, job creation and investments.
By 2018, Copenhagen has successfully achieved a reduction of carbon emissions per capita by 57% while the city’s population grew by 22%. This reduction was mostly due to the green conversion of power-generation and district heating systems from coal to biomass and the erection of wind turbines.
Figures 5, 6: Copenhagen carbon emissions actual and projected, 2005–2025
According to Figure 6, while the 2018 progress has been remarkable, it will require significant additional efforts to reach the 2025 targets. This aggressive goal is based on the city’s climate plan’s four pillars: (1) Energy consumption, (2) Energy production, (3) Mobility with reduced emissions, and (4) City Administration initiatives.
Energy consumption. This pillar primarily focuses on achieving energy efficiency for district heating and transitioning from oil to renewable energy systems. City of Copenhagen collaborates with large building owners on efficient management of their properties by monitoring their energy consumption and optimizing building operations.
Energy production. Copenhagen is powered mostly by renewable energy with more than 50% of electricity supplied by wind and solar, and approximately 80% of all electricity coming from renewable energy sources including bioenergy and geothermal energy (“A record year: Wind and solar supplied more than half of Denmark’s electricity in 2020.” State of Green). The city has ambitious efforts to add at least 460MW from wind turbines by 2025.
Mobility covers two groups of transportation: road and maritime. The city plans to convert all its public busses, road and harbor busses, to renewable energy sources and run on electricity, biodiesel, bioethanol, biogas, natural gas-electric hybrids or hydrogen fuel cell busses. The city is looking to expand public transportation and promote the use of bicycles to travel around the city. In addition to achieving a reduction of CO2 emissions, this initiative will have the benefit of significantly less street noise and reduced local air pollution (“Copenhagen aims to become a carbon neutral capital/Sustainable Transit.” Green City Times).
City Administration. This category sets an example for the Administration to lead the way to reduce the city’s energy consumption, green procurement and transition of the city’s vehicles and infrastructure to operate on alternative fuels. This is important in stimulating public-private partnerships, cooperation with other municipalities and other organizations, and engaging the citizens in the green transformation.
Copenhagen is showing an impressive reduction in carbon emissions. Two specific projects the city is proud of are EnergyLab Nordhavn and seawater use for cooling (“This is how Copenhagen plans to go carbon neutral by 2025.” World Economic Forum). EnergyLab Nordhavn is located in Copenhagen’s waterfront city district North Harbor. The EnergyLab was launched in 2015 in close partnership between academia, industry, utilities, and local government to design a full-scale smart city energy lab with innovative solutions in the areas such as intelligent waste handling, low-temperature district heating, clean public transportation, and super cycle highways. This project is looking at the whole energy system as one, integrating heat, electricity, and transport and testing new solutions such as large batteries and EVs to reduce peak load on the grid, intelligent heating of buildings, and a heat pump and storage system to improve flexibility and optimize local district heating network (“Cities 100: Copenhagen’s new Nordhavn neighborhood is a center of innovation for small energy systems.” C40 Knowledge).
Copenhagen also uses seawater from the harbor for its cooling system with the potential to cut emissions by 70% and keep about 80,000 tons of carbon out of the city’s direct atmosphere. In addition to the climate and environmental benefits, it costs less, takes up less space and it makes no noise. It works by pumping seawater of about 6C, using this water for the district water supply and returning water at about 16C back to the harbor (“Seawater keeps Copenhagen buildings cool.” Climate Change Adaptation).
This is a case study for the main article, Urban Path to Net-Zero: Leading Strategies of the Most Energy-Efficient Cities.

This is a short summary of what I saw in the conference, what I liked and didn't like and what I think was most interesting or worth notice considering my personal preferences and needs.
It was my first international conference and also the biggest conference I've attended so far, so please take that into account when reading this.
The conference had a good amount of different topics, I was satisfied with the balance between topics related with soft and hard skills, although, some of the mandatory talks could be frustrating to some people due to the lack of technical points or a practical guides.
Talks presented by partners (sponsors) weren’t simply trying to sell their solution, but were tackling problems or showing general solutions that can benefit you or your company even if you don’t use the partner specific solution. It was great to see the power of Kafka, GraphQL and Erlang/Elixir.
I was happy to be able to catch up on some topics like AI and quantum computing, the talks in general were well presented, not too long or too short and relevant. I felt that some topics should have had less talks considering that talks on similar subject were already present as part of the mandatory talks (AI and machine learning for example). I believed that the topics could had been better distributed (maximum number of talks per topic). On another side I understand that some redundancy is built-in for the different days and for people that might not be able to attend certain talks due do conflicts with parallel sessions. I understand that it’s not an easy to solve problem, and even with these remarks the overall experience was incredibly positive.
On a personal note I really liked the talk from Saša Jurić about Erlang and Elixir, seeing what Erlang and Elixir can do really gave me the extra push needed to dive into it. The talk from Adam Tornhill ""Prioritizing Technical Debt as if Time and Money Matters"" gave me a new perspective and even actionable points (although not easy) to deal with the trade-off between improving existing code and adding new features. Finally I was surprised with the extreme digitization in China presented by Christina Boutrup, it gave great insights which I believe are not on the radar of standard western people.
I currently live in Switzerland and I have to say that the Danes seemed to me to be even more punctual and organized! No real issues with talks being late or running over time, the duration and number of breaks helping to keep your attention on each talk you attend. Registration and overall logistical organization was very good ( quality of the food and amount of options was great).
The area for partners was cool and well structured, good amount of swag and most partners were easy to interact and have a good conversation during the quick breaks between talks.
One point that I really didn’t like was the amount of talks that were not being recorded, I don’t have enough conference experience to know how much this is common practice but feeling forced to attend to certain talks that might, or not, be of interest just for fear of missing out isn’t a great feeling in my opinion.
I didn't know most of the speakers, but was satisfied with the quality of the talks. As celebrities go, it was cool to see Steve Wozniak in person!
Most of the talks contributed more or less in the same way and a lot of them helped me into catching up with the current state of the industry (at least in a high-level view).
I'm less scared about AI and I think the field still has to evolve a lot before an AI tries to destroy humanity, still I would bet that many people will have their jobs taken by AI based solutions, but it's difficult to say how fast this will happen even for specialists in the field.
China is really a place to pay attention to, we can learn from them, as they seem to be able to foster innovation despite being very restrictive on their market and ideas.
Machine learning is finding more efficient and precise methods to do things in ways that humans can't understand, so it’s something I think everyone should pay more attention to as the results so far are already impressive (and seem to be less dangerous than what we normally associate with AI apocalypse, although strongly related).
Elixir is really awesome and I need to start experimenting and learning asap.
There are different ways to handle the trade-off between adding new functionality and improving existing code, I have much to learn!
The new perspective from Adam Tornhill is something that I believe will have an immediate positive impact on my daily work as in any fast paced and competitive business it’s part of the day to day job to weight the benefits of improving existing code versus the many new features that business requires in the short and long term. This talk gave me a different perspective on how to look at the problem and directions on what needs to be considered on a more technical and practical stand for me to be able to keep the best balance between business value added and the long term evolution of our platforms, while also keeping our 24/5 high frequency trading system competitive.
As a possible mid/long term contribution I think I would like to partner with our big data and BI teams and see what I can do using machine learning to improve the overall business. I now, more than before, believe that machine learning can really help businesses to take big leaps forward in ways that we humans simply can’t predict.
I wish I have the time and opportunity to put some Elixir in action at Swissquote as I believe that the very nature of the business can benefit immensely from the platform features (Erlang/Elixir) that support high availability, fast recovery and the benefits of the actor based model (processes in Elixir). Perfect for my needs in the Forex business line!
Thank you for you attention.

GUEST ENTRY: Pleo’s Jeppe Rindom gives his opinion on Copenhagen’s current ability to attract the best of the best.
Hi! My name is Jeppe Rindom and I am CEO and co-founder of Pleo, a fintech startup that automates expense reporting.
In 2015, my former colleague from Tradeshift, Niccolo, and I founded Pleo in Copenhagen. We had and still have big and global ambitions but with the limited access to digital talent in Denmark, we wondered, right from the beginning, if we would ever be able to scale a global company without moving our base.
It is evident that digital graduates are produced at a much slower pace than what our fellow startups (and desperate ‘we-fear-disruption’ corporates) are screaming for. But hey, our country has pretty architecture, bikes, great food, and the happiest people in the world. So, as bold entrepreneurs we figured; ‘let’s not bring Pleo to the talent — Let’s bring the talent to Pleo!’
Fast forward 30 months, our organisation now counts +40 employees and more than half are non-Danes. What a great success one might conclude, but actually I would argue the opposite, because only in one single case did we, as a company, succeed in convincing an international candidate to relocate to Denmark. And in this specific case, the relocation was caused by a strong friendship to an existing employee.
We consider Pleo a fairly attractive workplace. We’ve been recognized with international prizes and have attracted substantial investments from venture capital firms. I believed so much in our ability to attract international talent that I naively wrote a blog post with the title ‘Let’s conquer the World, not each other!’, which was a shout to the Danish digital ecosystem to hire internationally instead of stealing talent locally. Yet, we’ve never been able do so. But Why?
The Danish ‘package’ is not competitive
As much as I am proud of the Danish welfare system as well as the Capital of Copenhagen, I have come to the conclusion that the Danish ‘package’ sounds much more compelling than it is.
A classic Danish startup package looks somewhat like this:
1) a non-competitive salary, which is really no news if you want to work in startups.
2) high taxation due to our welfare system. Here you might say ‘you get what you pay for’, but that’s actually not true. Most candidates we’ve tried to relocate have a 3 to 7 year perspective for staying in Denmark. They are at a stage in their lives, where access to free education, free healthcare etc. is of very little value.
3) a high cost of living. Being a foreigner without a place to stay in Copenhagen is really tough. Even if you’re willing to settle for just a room in a shared apartment, you will likely end up paying +€1K a month.
On point 1 and 3, Copenhagen is not much different from cities like London, Paris and Stockholm but on taxation, our offering is much worse. And that’s not only a shame, it’s a deal breaker.
So, how have we made it to first base?
I’ve always had mixed feelings when it comes to our ‘open’ (read: free for EU citizens) education system. Today, I praise myself lucky. It saved my a.. Big Time. When we were 1.5 year into the journey, we, as everybody else, couldn’t recruit Danish digital talent, and when our team turned 15 employees, I was still the only Dane. Looking around me, I realised that everyone else were here because of our good and open education system. Luckily for us, many had decided to stay after graduation and in hindsight, I should have done more to build relationships to schools and universities and would encourage any startup to do so.
Second, we right from the beginning had an international company culture. My co-founder is Italian so the Danish way was really never an option. It was of course an obvious thing for us, as our ambitions goes far beyond Danish borders, but our strong international company culture has also become a strong selling point when we hire. Today, Pleo has 14 different nationalities and we still have strong focus on maintaining a welcoming, family-like company culture.
Third, we have had a lot of media attention both inside and outside of Denmark. Today, it mostly relates to our business traction, but in the beginning we did serious efforts to create some buzz, both in terms of being present at conferences, startup events and constantly trying to get media coverage. That helped us tremendously — also in our recruiting.
Fourth, our foreign employees have been great at enabling their networks. Because of that, we today have a handful of engineers working remotely. And it has worked surprisingly well, not something I expected initially and that I believe is strong correlated to the fact that all remote workers were familiar with other Pleo folks (and vice versa) right from the beginning. So get your employees to enable their networks! Chances are that they already know a handful of relevant candidates.
We praise ourselves lucky to have made it to first base. But I fear that more challenges will come when targeting second base and growing our product organisation from 15 to 50 in the foreseeable future.
The bigger picture
We have to join forces on promoting Copenhagen as a European techhub. Organisations like CPHFTW and Copenhagen Capacity are doing a great job building, empowering, and promoting our tech community. But there’s a need for more ambassadors spreading great stories of the Danish tech ecosystem. We just hired a candidate who chose to move to Denmark before having a job. She decided to seek opportunities in Copenhagen (and relocate from Madrid) due to her positive perception of the Copenhagen startup scene. What a win!
We also need shared living at a reasonable price for foreign workers, who relocate to Denmark. Shared living initiatives such as LifeX have also proved to be social catalysts in the tech community. A place to meet like minded people outside of work. Being a foreigner and having social success in Denmark can be hard. Let’s admit it, Danes are pretty reserved when it comes to being inclusive of foreigners. Foreigners with a social headstart are more likely to stick around.
Lastly, I want to come back to our taxation. Our tax society has previously been creative, when facing the lack of talent. In the 90’s, we invented ‘expert taxation’ (in Danish: Forskerordningen), a favourable tax system for researchers and well paid employees recruited abroad. At that point in time, most of the Danish growth arrived from research-heavy organisations.
Today, our world is upside down. Big corporates face challenges maintaining growth and leadership positions and younger growth companies are contributing increasingly to the economic growth.
I strongly encourage Denmark to expand the ‘expert taxation’ agreement, so that tax incentives are created for medium-income but much-needed digital talent moving to Denmark.
Because there is no way we can scale our businesses without help from abroad. So let’s spread those great stories, let’s do our utmost to welcome foreign talent and let’s continue to push our politicians for more attractive framework conditions.
Jeppe

""Why Copenhagen?"" has been the common question when we told people we got married there. I am a Cambodian; my husband is English; and we live in Berlin. Wouldn't it make more sense to get married in Berlin, England, or Cambodia?
Yes, we did have a big fat wedding celebration in Cambodia. But more to that later. What I'm talking about is the legal/civil wedding where you sign a paper that legally binds you as husband and wife.
So… Yes, we live in Berlin. No, we don't speak very good German. This makes it hard because (1) we will then need an official translator at the wedding, (2) it would be tough throughout the whole application because of the limited German, (3) the paperwork is just too much. This article here could tell you more about everything you need to do to get married in Germany. One of the most ridiculous document you need to provide — in my opinion — is the Ehefähigkeitszeugnis aka Certificate of no impediment to marriage from your country of origin (and if I'm not mistaken, from all the countries you have lived at prior to Germany). Did I also mention certified copy of birth certificate? It's not easy business to get that for some countries.
And ""why not the UK then""? Which is actually a good question. UK is a bit simpler (probably because it's all in English so we could understand stuffs), but then we found out there is this requirement that ""In order to actually start the marriage process, you and your partner have to have been living in the UK for at least 7 days prior to notifying a designated registrar office of your plans to marry"". Read more from this article.
So yeah. Getting married in Germany seems hard. Getting married in the UK was also tricky. Thanks to the sponsored Google ads, we found out that a lot of expats in Europe goes to Denmark to get married. It looked like Copenhagen was the Vegas of Europe! No joke! Looking deeper, it was not like Vegas. There's no drive-through or laundry weddings. I know, disappointing right? But still, everyone claimed it was the best decision one could do if one of us are not German and not willing to go through the bureaucracy. So yeah, we decided to do Copenhagen.
There is literally this website that we found: https://gettingmarriedindenmark.com/ that provided a very clear step by step explanation of what to do. (FYI this is not a sponsored post or anything, I'm simply sharing information) They also provide the consultation service that helps you through with a fee. Honestly, the process is simple enough that you probably would not need the service, but we got it just for the peace of mind (and admit it — less stress for the bride).
So here is what we did.
Voila! Now you just need to turn up for the wedding!
We got married at Copenhagen city hall. Everything was straightforward and relaxing, and the whole ceremony was done in less than 10 minutes. We did not even have to bring any witnesses — they have those if we need. The people who performed the ceremony was nice and friendly, and we felt really comfortable. You can do vows too if you like. We didn't though. None of us really like to say emotional stuffs, so we skipped it. We simply said ""I do""and exchanged rings, and kissed. And oh, we signed the papers too.
It was just the two of us. So simple. So easy. Not a care in the world about guests, how we looked, or anything going wrong. We focused on getting married and did exactly JUST that.
As you could see, we dressed up a little though and had a photographer to capture the moment. You can skip all these and just rock up. I told the consultant agency what I was looking for, and they gave me some recommendations. However, there's plenty of photography, makeup, and flower services at different price points that you could go for if you google or check on instagram. They are pretty nice and friendly too, so just send them a text with your needs. Some people also opted for the fancier packages where you get married it at your own venue or a little off the bustling city center area.
None at all. We spent a bit of money but it was smooth and I recommend any expats living in Germany or Europe that struggles with the bureaucracy where they live to consider Copenhagen as their wedding destination. You can make it a little holiday and even invite people you care about to attend the ceremony.
Lots of love, from the newly Mrs ❤ Let me know if you have any questions or would like to know which photography and makeup service we used.

Alex Martin shares his love of history with people in Copenhagen, Denmark, through his job as a tour guide. This last Tuesday, April 5th, Martin led a food focused tour with a group of students from Semester at Sea.
Semester at Sea is a floating university where students from all over the world spend the semester taking classes on a ship, the MV World Odyssey. During the semester students get to travel to 10–13 different countries. While in country, they can travel independently or with field programs organized by Semester at Sea and tour companies from each country. Martin’s tour was with a group of journalism students.
Martin has been living in Copenhagen for 20 years. He started working as a tour guide because of his love for the city and his love for history. Because of his wide range of knowledge, he is able to lead tours related to a variety of topics. This tour focused on the food scene in Copenhagen, but just the day before Martin led another tour with Semester at Sea that focused on social movements with a group of political science students. Martin introduced the group of journalism students to the rich history of food in Denmark by telling them the story of rye bread, and its importance in the country. According to him, rye bread is a staple in most Nordic cultures because of its rich nutrients. The bread uses flour made from rye grain instead of wheat grain and includes a variety of seeds. Historically, people used to even put wood shavings in it to bulk up its nutritious value. Danish farmers used to use this bread as an edible plate and bring their leftovers to the fields for lunch, creating an open-faced sandwich called the smorgasbord. This practical and inexpensive dish was later adopted by bars who would serve it to clients in effort to get them to buy more drinks. The public really enjoyed these sandwiches and began to request specific flavors. The bars responded to this interest by making the smorgasbord a permanent item on the menu, and restaurants soon followed. Smorgasbord is now considered the national dish of Denmark and, although it has practical roots, it is presented as a delicate, elegant dish at many dining establishments.
After teaching the students about the history of rye bread and smorgasbord, Martin brought them to CPH Cooking Class to try and make the dish themselves. The group prepared three different variations of the dish. The first variation was vegetarian and consisted of buttered rye, boiled potatoes, mustard mayo, fried onions, and dill. The second was rye topped with chicken salad made of shredded chicken, mayo, green apple, green onion, and herbs. The last variation was fried fish and vegetables served on top of rye with lemon. Martin said the fish was a red spotted fish popular in Denmark because of its supply in the North Atlantic. The group was able to eat their creations with popular fruit juices while having time to ask Martin and the CPH Cooking Class staff questions before heading off to their next activity.
A short bus ride took Martin and his students to Reffen, a famous Copenhagen food market where the stands are made of recycled shipping containers. Martin explained that Denmark is one of the most sustainability focused countries in the world with a huge emphasis on recycling. Making food stands out of old shipping containers near the capitol’s shipping port is just one of the innovative Danish techniques that Martin taught about. He also pointed out a complex of student housing made from the recycled containers, a garbage incinerator that creates power for the city and has an artificial ski hill on top of it, a group of windmills near the coast, the importance of bikes in the city, and the use of recycled materials in Copenhagen’s hippie commune, Christiania. He gave the students free time to explore the food market, interview business owners, and taste more unique dishes. According to Martin, Reffen is a great place for aspiring chefs and business owners to enter Copenhagen’s already dense food industry.
For their last stop, Martin took the students to one of his personal favorite spots, Halls on the Plaza in the city center. This food market offers many take home options and is conveniently located downtown, making it a popular spot for Copenhagen residents on their way home from work. The plaza consists of two buildings constructed on top of an underground recycling complex. While it is expensive to rent a space at, the heavily trafficked area generates steady business making it another great place for people trying to enter the city’s food industry. Martin’s personal favorite things to buy at the plaza are fish cakes and chocolates.
Bellies full of Danish food and heads full of information, Martin took the group of students back to their ship. When asked if he likes his job he replied, “I get to learn new things every day, what’s not to like?”
Thank you to Kris Kodrich and Semester at Sea for facilitating this field class.

I would like to share my overall impressions about the flight to the Faroe Islands and why I chose this airline.
The company made its first flight on March 1988. Since then, much has changed, and the company has become larger. Now Atlantic Airways has 184 employees. The fleet consists of 3 planes and 2 helicopters, the aircrafts are relatively new, including the brand new Airbus A320NEO and Leonardo AW139 helicopters. The airplanes and helicopters are named after the outstanding artists of the Faroe Islands.
The decision to fly to the Faroe Islands came very spontaneously, and there was little to no time for deliberation and plans. However, at the same time, I was pleasantly surprised by the cost of tickets, even when buying a mere 10 days before the departure.
As an experienced tourist, I decided to register on the site and get a frequent flyer card, but something went wrong, and I was confronted with an error on the website. Looking ahead, I would say that this is the only minus that I can note. In any case, I was not upset, as the primary goal was to buy flight tickets, and this can be done without any registration.
Go to the airline’s website, and right on the main page, you can immediately see all direct destinations:
North
South
There is also an option — to see the calendar of low prices.
The process of buying tickets is quite simple, all prices on the website are in Danish kroner. Choosing a date, you can see prices for a few days back and forth, which will allow you to find the best option.
You can also buy tickets using mobile apps on iOS and Android devices.
You can use the app or web to Check-in online, and you don’t need to print out boarding passes, you can use them directly from the mobile app.
Before buying tickets, I recommend checking the information if you need a visa since the Faroe Islands have their own permission.
Information on countries whose residents need a visa can be found here.
If you still need a visa, the list of embassies can be found here.
The Faroe Islands are not part of the Schengen Area, and therefore you can’t get here using a Danish visa. You must apply directly for an Island visa.
After all the preparations had been completed, finally the long-awaited day of the departure had arrived. The route consisted of a stop off in Copenhagen then onto Vagar.
Check-in and baggage drop-off at the airport closes half an hour before a flight. If you have luggage, you can choose 2 options:
In the first case, the airport staff will help you arrange everything. Although if you decide to use the second option, you need to scan the boarding pass and select passengers with luggage, after which the machine prints a sticker that must be attached to the suitcase. After that, just a few meters away is the baggage drop-off point. If your baggage weighs more than 20 kg, it’s classified as heavy so you will need to attach a special tag to it, which you will find right next to the scanner.
Wave goodbye to your luggage and head to the gate for boarding. If you are departing from Copenhagen Airport, I would highly recommend you to arrive early, as there are a lot of shops and various cafes inside.
The gate was in a small remote wing of the terminal. Most of all, I was worried about company loyalty to hand luggage. The hand luggage restrictions are 55x40x25 cm and 8kg weight plus a laptop bag.
As I noticed, there were no questions from the airport staff regarding the size and quantity of hand luggage and boarding was speedy.
I flew on the brand new AIRBUS A320NEO, and my impressions were only the most positive, not only from the plane but also from what was happening inside.
I was almost the last person to board the plane, and this did not hinder me from putting my suitcase on the luggage rack. The shelves were not full, even despite the fact I was flying to a cold country, and people would need a lot of outerwear.
I think it’s not worth saying however that the seats were in excellent condition as the plane is still new. You are able to change the position of the chair and headrest.
I was surprised by the mobile device holder, as well as USB charging for each seat.
Atlantic Airways provides an app for passengers. The main functionality is
How to get the app? Connect to WIFI AtlanticAirFi and open airfi.aero in a browser.
Atlantic Review Magazine is published 4 times a year and has been available to airline users since 1990. On the airline’s website, you can find all the old publications since 2010. The journal tells about the sights, entertainment, and events on the islands, as well as historical information.
Oh, what a delicious sandwich, you can create songs about it ;)
A selection of free drinks provided on board: sweet soda, juices, and coffee or tea.
I especially recommend you to try tomato juice. I would even say that it is not juice, but a ready-made cocktail with spices, incredibly tasty for spicy lovers.
Food can be ordered in several ways:
You can order sandwiches or rolls as well as desserts and drinks, but if you travel in the morning, breakfast may be your choice too.
A feature of the menu was the opportunity to try craft beer, specially brewed in collaboration with the brewery and the airline.
Föroya Bjór fly WIT me
Atlantic Airways asked Föroya Bjór to brew beer specifically for passengers, and as a result, we got a fly WIT me. This is Belgian Witbier (Bière Blanche), and experts say that the best place to drink beer you can have at an altitude of 10,000 meters. Föroya Bjór is the oldest brewery in the Faroe Islands and was founded in 1888.
Okkara Hop in the Air
Another beer is Indian Pale Ale brewed together with Okkara, which has been brewing beer since 2010 and is very famous for its collaborations with other breweries.
If you are planning a trip to the Faroe Islands, this airline may surprise you.
Read my blog, and you will find a lot of useful information for traveling around Europe.

Healthy. Organic. Paleo restaurant
Inspired by our latest trip to Berlin and how much wifey and I enjoyed the #SexyGood healthy delicious Simply Keto restaurant/cafe in Berlin, Germany, I realised how much I had enjoyed a similar experience last August when we had gone to Copenhagen Denmark.
The entire #SexyGood + links to the 3 visits to Simply Keto can be captured here https://medium.com/@abhijitpradhan/the-launch-of-the-true-life-metric-95a305856195
We had done a short 5 day trip to this amazing city for the following reasons
After paying homage to the Coffee Collective at their roastery outlet in Godthabsvej/Freidricksburg, we came to the famed Torvehallerne, the hip and happening food hall ( there are 2 big halls ).
And while hunting for lunch options, my eyes settled on Palæo which I had read about earlier. Luckily, as one could pick up food from any kiosk and sit together in one place, I didn’t have to worry about wifey, who was frankly not too interested in the place ! ( It took her a trip to Berlin last month to finally nudge her !). She looked at the different food options, but her attention quickly wandered off and she came back with a multi cheese platter as her lunch !
I went to the counter and the person taking orders was friendly and helpful. The place was more a snack/fast food/smoothie kind of place. Apparently there was a “restauranty” style Paleo outlet somewhere else in the city, but she told me the food was essentially the same.
I ordered a salad which was heavy on keto bread, avocado, nuts, berries, etc.
She suggested I go for the Sweet Potato chips. I did. And my main course was a “grass fed” Hot dog with the sausage wrapped in an egg omelette.
I was in seventh heaven as one did not get such treats back home-especially the grass fed hot dog !
The other thing that struck me after reaching Copenhagen was the sheer quality of their produce. Especially the vegetables. I told wifey that I could happily give up meat for ever, if I get a constant supply of such awesome vegetables. This theme continued throughout the trip and even in the Michelin starred restaurants that we ate in and loved, the vegetables were like from another planet !! #Swoon
Torvehallerne became a very convenient lunch spot for us. It was next to the hub station, Norreport, so it was connected to all places in the city ( Metro, train, bus) and dinners were strategically chosen and booked by wifey to feed her chef soul, so basically I got a license to have most of my lunches at Palæo ! Yay ! Think I did at least 3 :)
My favourite dish was discovered when I ordered their burger. The same friendly order taker told me the bread used for the burger was not as heavy as their regular bread as it used more seeds than nuts. Cool !
I loved it. The meat was obviously grass fed beef and from the first bite I was transported to my school days where my dream meal was in one of the fast food burger joints ( Hardees, Dairy Queen etc.) and my favourite dish used to the burger ( specifically the Mushroom & Swiss burger in Hardees).
I ensured that I had the burger again in my next and last visit here !
This experience gave me hope that Sexy and Good can co-exist and my recent trip to Berlin and Simply Keto has only reinforced that hope !! Also, it was heartening to know that Michelin star chef Thomas Rode Andersen was behind the design of the menu ! #SexyGood in action !https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/mar/02/fast-food-restaurant-caveman-diet-copenhagen
I had turned “Paleo” way back in 2012 and in fact tried to use that approach while running marathons but it didn’t work as after 30 k of running, the system would just revolt and scream for quick carbs. Energy gels, potatoes. I was eating more and more unhealthy stuff just to fuel my runs !
It was only in 2016 where I discovered “Keto” which actually gives me hope of plugging that energy crash issue that I always faced on the longer runs.
Paleo can be seen as High Protein ( which I realised was not actually good for me) + Low Carb + Low Fat whereas Keto is High Fat + Moderate Protein ( a crucial tweak) and Low Carb
When ( and if ) your body adapts to the High fat and low carb component of Keto, it slowly starts prefering to burn fat as a fuel ( which is far cleaner) rather than the extremely dirty and volatile carbs as source of fuel. I know now that if I had managed this during my marathoning days, it would have made a world of difference ! I don’t do long runs anymore as it took me a very long time to get over a knee injury and I realised that my body thrives on high intense short bursts of activity rather than the prolonged abuse that I was subjecting it to + after the recent Paris + Berlin trip, I re-connected with “walking” as it probably activates health in my system better than any other activity ! Wow.
The above is a short recap of how I arrived at #SexyGood in terms of diet, nutrition and exercise.

When this Airbnb host in London decided to be an Airbnb guest in design-conscious Copenhagen, he found much to be inspired by in the galleries and museums. If you’re also looking for design/art inspiration, here are three spots you should include when visiting Copenhagen. (Although just being in the city itself seems to activate latent design genes…)
The SMK houses 700 years’ worth of Danish and Nordic art and sculpture with a clear demarcation between the original architecture built in 1896 and the stunning, light-filled modernist section built 100 years later. If you like a chronological context, you can work your way from the front and understand the big themes through the centuries with clever diversions into more obscure and ‘problematic’ branches every so often.
A short train trip north of Copenhagen takes you to another repository of modern art in a stunning waterside setting, housed in an architectural marvel.
Louisiana (named after the original owners three wives, all named Louise) is a day trip in itself. The permanent collection boasts works by Picasso, Klein, Arp, Moore, Warhol, Hockney, Giacometti and oodles more. The current exhibitions included a immersive retrospective of Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama, Lucien Freud and ‘Africa’, a hugely thoughtful and surprising treatise on architecture, art and culture from the continent today.
If Copenhagen can’t have a stunning museum of design, what hope is there for anywhere else? The museum has the lofty twin ambitions to both serve ‘as a source of inspiration for people active in industry’ while making ‘contemporary consumers both critically aware and discerning’.
This translates of course into a whole lot of #chairporn…
So, despite ostensibly taking a break from London, Airbnb and design, I find myself filled with a better understanding of how Danish design works. Now to bring some of that all important hygge to Kith & Kine.
Kith & Kine is a stylish two-bed property close to all the hip/tech action in Shoreditch, London. Come and stay and see how far we’ve got recreating some Danish hygge…

Two rooms in London via @Airbnb. Ridiculously close to the tech action. Has vinyl. Some bovine branding (but it all makes sense). Chief cowboy = @endaguinan

“Travel has been the fire that has shaped my current self, accumulating layers of complexity in my thinking, thoughts, and actions as a result of my journey’s successes and failures.” Gabriela Trofin-Tatár
My Erasmus University exchange in Odense, Denmark, during the spring semester of 2006 was an unforgettable chapter in my life. Immersed in the vibrant atmosphere of Tehnisk Kollegium, I discovered the power of collaborative learning through teamwork, an experience that would profoundly shape my educational journey.
Moreover, during the semester, I traveled both in Denmark and abroad, expanding my horizons and becoming more curious about my studies.
In the following sections, I invite you to read about events and places that had a positive impact on my love for Denmark and my cultural awareness during that time.

I am not often in Copenhagen. It is a one-hour drive from where I live. And I can get my shopping and entertainment needs covered closer to home. But I do go there occasionally. And when I do, I see reminders of our racist past everywhere.
I will start with a disclaimer. I am a white dude, who is soon approaching 40. I am a history buff. And I have always tried to fight racism where I can. But I am aware I can not fully escape my racist history.
Many Europeans acknowledge the blatant racism in the U.S. But they falsely believe that it is a uniquely American problem. It is not. The slave ships that brought these slaves to the U.S. sailed from our harbors.
Racism is a European invention. We had to invent it in order to justify our atrocities against people of color. And guess what. We think our invention was so smart, that we Europeans call the historic period where we shipped slaves and exploited our colonies “The Age of Enlightenment”.
Yes, racism is systemic. And trying to censor this truth in our classrooms will not make it untrue.

Based on a meeting in Copenhagen, one call to Australia, a number of tweets, Linkedin and Yammer posts, the word was spread and the first #ResponsiveOrg meetup in Copenhagen became reality Thursday 27. November 2014 — read about the preparation here ,
Eager to meet the people who signed up for #ResponsiveCoffee in Copenhagen on Meetup.com I got to the cafe about 30 minutes early…
tables where placed in a corner, and the coffee was just about to brew — we where ready to meet.
All interested and curious we gathered and the talking started by one to one introductions as people showed up, then the non existing agenda developed in this way:
6 men joined — Kenneth has listed ResponsiveOrg Copenhagen relevant tweets here — and here are the names of the 6 men at the first meetup
admitted - it looks a bit as a bunch of..
“..handsome, thoroughly clever, perfectly plump men in our prime” as Karlsson on the roof says
The conversation touched diversity and all agreed it is needed for future meetups. Also discussing the need for a meetup in english, which is obviously is an option if non Danish-speaking wants to join — please let us know at meetup.com or as a comment here.
I am not really sure, but I know that I have found likeminded people whom I want to share my experiences with, and I am sure they will share interesting angles on topics that relates to #futureofwork, #ResponsiveOrg, #worklikeanetwork — add the # you like, or tell the story as Matt Partovi
http://player.vimeo.com/103393370
One thing it instantly brougth was Kenneths scoop.it on Leadership a ressource of inspiration for future topics, and so much more.
And the all participants was featured in this tweet
Wanting to get into a series of meetups, the next meetup is planned as #ResponsiveMorning for the 14. January at 9:30 - you can signup via meetup.com
Do you want to give a 10 minute speak about a topic you care about? If so suggest a topic for the meetup, and suggest a topic anyway.
A big thanks to all of you showing up, and for those of you who showed interested but couldn’t find the time, come by in the future.
To all of you who liked, retweetet and shared the posts to make the noise — most appreciated!

August 4, Sabbatical Day 23
Sunday did not go at all like I had planned. I walk out of my apartment at 10:40am, planning to bike to church (that starts at 11am), only for rain drops to start falling. So I pivot to taking the train … only that adds to my travel time and makes me 10 minutes late to church. And I’m sleepy in my movie-theater seat in the back of the auditorium, fighting heavy eyelids. And if we’re being honest, I don’t get much out of the guest pastor speaking.
But I’ve still got the entire day, right? Only it’s pouring when I walk out of church, so I linger a little longer in the lobby, game-planning my day on my phone.
Church attendees are slowly making their way out (this church takes place in a hotel conference center). And one makes it’s way over to me. Glasses, ash-blonde air a little ruffled, lanky and crooked smile. No rain jacket.
“Were you at Hillsong?” He asks in heavily accented English.
“Yes, I’m visiting Copenhagen and every time I’ve come to the city before, I have come to church here.”
He proceeds to tell me that he just moved to Copenhagen last week from Bratislava, Slovakia. He’s staying in a hostel now, but wants to live by the beach. He tells me about the bike he bought from a guy a month ago (the guy just left it on the street for him to buy!), and how it was locked up on the street for the last month waiting for his return. I tell him about my journey to Copenhagen, my sabbatical.
Eventually I see the rain lightening up, and say my goodbyes. I walk off to the metro, planning on taking it to Norrebro to get this focaccia sandwich I dreamed about getting last visit. And just as I make it down the escalator, I hear an alarm going off.
“Evacuate immediately,” it says.
So everyone makes there way back up the elevator, crowing under the metro awning outside, because — mind you — it’s still raining. Sirens start in the distance, and a fire truck rounds the corner.
I make the call to try for the bus instead, since clearly this train station won’t be opening back up anytime soon. I walk back past the church, past the Slovak, and to a bus station a block away. The bus is 10 minutes late, but finally arrives. By this point, it’s nearing 2pm, and the sun has broken through — you’d hardly know it was so nasty 30 minutes ago.
I get my focaccia sandwich from Rondo, inhale it, and start walking back to my apartment to pick up my bike. I think I take a wrong turn somewhere along the way, because it’s taking longer than I anticipated. I’m cutting through Fælledparken, and start realizing — if I want to go visit Grundtvigs church, I need to do it now, since they close at 4 and are closed Monday. So once again, I backtrack to the bus station. And what do you know, the heavens open up midway. I wait under a tree for a couple minutes, waiting for it to lighten up, then make my way to the bus stop. The bus is late, which I’m starting to realize is a Copenhagen trend. I start seeing a bunch of people walking in the same direction with jerseys, and realize there’s a match on today. Do I want to go? I calculate the time it takes to get to the church, take a quick spin, then go back to my apartment to change, then go to the game. It’s a lot, so I decide against. This is all being thought through while I’m on the bus.
Eventually I get to the church … only to walk up and find that it’s closed due to water damage. And honestly, I’m more bummed about the hour of travel time round trip than the actual church being closed.
So I make my way back to my apartment, changing out of my church clothes and swapping my bag for coffee shop books and journals. There’s one right around the corner from my apartment that a guy from Hagen Espresso in London recommended. It’s pretty full for 4pm when I get there, so I snag a seat inside since there’s not a seat open outside to enjoy this gorgeous weather.
But right after my drink is delivered, one does open up, so I gather up my bag and cortado and relocate. I’m sitting outside for around 20 minutes before I see a young guy — who I think is not Danish — walk into the shop. He’s by himself, wearing a Cyprus cap, along with a green market tote bag.
He sits at the table to left of me, back to the street, while I’m facing the street, Mere Christianity in hand. I keep eying him — do I make conversation with this fellow traveler? After all, sometimes I’ve found some of my best travel moments behind starting a conversation. But how to start — do I ask him about Cyprus?
At this point, I pull out my phone that’s plugged into my power bank. And that’s my opening (or rather, his).
“Do you have a USB-C cable?” He asks, once again in accented English. “I have a power bank, I just need the cord.”
And this, reader, is where I thank God once again that I bought a power bank with several types of cords.
“No, but this has one in it. Here, you take it,” I insist. “Are you visiting Copenhagen?”
“Yes, I just arrived today.”
“Oh, and where are you from?”
“I’m from Ukraine, but I’m living in Italy now.”
“Oh, where in Italy?” I ask, thinking about my January trip there.
Outside of Florence, he tells me. “I’ve hitch-hiked here from Florence.”
Cue my jaw dropping.
“I first went to Berlin, where I stayed with some friends. Then hitchhiked here. I wanted an adventure, and I had things that I wanted to figure out for life. But now I think I know what I need to do next, so I’m going to just fly home. Plus hitchhiking is exhausting.”
The conversation that follows is not one that I could have predicted.
I find out more about his life — He lived in Italy from 2019 to February 2022, making money so he could come back to Ukraine flush with cash — rich in their eyes. This is when he says he thought his dream, ideal life would start. But he didn’t have to explain it too much — Russia invaded a month later. Eventually he got out of Ukraine (which he didn’t explain, but I know means avoided being conscripted). Back to Italy, working in services industry — a textile manufacturer, I think.
He said his life was comfortable, but he didn’t want to blink and life fly by. I asked him what his realization was, and he answered, “I need to leave Italy.” He has various gripes with Italy and Italians — lack of openness and diversity, lack of parks, lack of opportunities to connect with others. He also doesn’t know what to do work wise — he’s tried a lot of different things.
I couldn’t help but think at this point — “Oh buddy. You’re searching for a happy life, but that’s never going to satisfy.”
I ask him what brings him joy, and he says talking with people — at some points he struggles to find the words in English. He likes providing advice, or crisis management, as he says.
He asks about me, too. I tell him about my sabbatical, about processing life, what I want to do next.
“How satisfied are you with your life? Put a number on it.”
I tell him that while I love my life, of course there are things I’d love to be different. I’d love to be married, I’d love for experience physical healing. 75%, I say.
“That’s pretty high.”
We talk some about singleness — I say there are things I could not do if I was married. Like working with the youth kids that bring me so much joy. I probably could not do a trip like this if I was married. That’s when I’m surprised to find out he’s married (no ring). Just left his wife back in Italy to hitchhike for a bit.
I explain that in the south in the U.S., people get married younger. My sisters both married young.
“Do you feel pressure to? From your family?” He asks.
“Not really.” It’s more the pressure of my own timeline. But my parents don’t quite understand the different world I am dating in, and find themselves befuddled that being asked out is so non-existent for so many of my friends.
We shut the coffee shop down, and move to a bench next door. At some point, he has me follow him on Instagram so we can keep up with one another. How much, we’ll see. Near the end of our conversation, he asks me, “So what’s your plan from here?”
I clarify — “Do you mean for today, this trip, or my life?”
“For your life.”
Oof. How to answer this?
“Here’s the thing, I can make plans for my life, but ultimately, I could die tomorrow –“ He recoils a bit at this — “I mean, I hope not, but I know where I would be if I did. And here’s the thing, as great as all this is,” I wave my hand at the street in front of me, “Heaven is better. So I can make plans, my life is not my own. My life belongs to God. He has plans for me. One of the things I love about God is I can do x or y, but he’s going to use it regardless for my good and his glory.”
He’s watching me as I talk and I don’t know if I’ve entirely lost him. I feel the need for honesty not pontifications.
“Listen, is it easy to say that? Absolutely not. I want to be tight fisted with my life. I have to remind myself regular to let go, because I know his plan for me is so much better.”
He doesn’t respond to any of this, and that’s okay. I don’t need him to. The conversation peters out some from there — but before we part, I ask to take his picture and he acquiesces.
We stand — he’s VERY TALL — and bends at both the knees and the waist to give me a very awkward hug. “Don’t die tomorrow,” he tells me.
I smile at that, and tell him I’ll try not to.
I walk off in the direction of the grocery, reeling a bit. Did the last hour and a half just happen? I’ve never had a conversation with a stranger like that before.
I rewind through my day — the delays and redirects and ending up at Prolog Coffee outside at 4pm. It would be easy to look at my encounter with Bogdan (that’s his name) in a silo. But I can see the fingerprints streaking across the window of my day, and I can see how the fact that I ended up there was not happenstance. Who knows if any of that will stick with him, but it was as much for me as it was for him.
There’s this rewiring starting to happen inside of me on this trip.
Life with God is an adventure. I’ve said that before, but I’ve thought about it more in the large-scale sense. Adventure of career, dating, etc.
But now, now I’m starting to realize that every day is an adventure. To look at the margins — or lack of — and invite him in. Surprise me, God.

When I arrived in Copenhagen six years ago, after a particularly hard year in New York, I needed to regroup, re-think and reinvent myself. I was stressed out, exhausted and confused — everything you’d expect a New Yorker to be. My salvation came from the most unexpected source — a bicycle.
If in New York cycling was saved for hipsters, exercise fanatics and tourists at that time, in Copenhagen, it was (and is) the main mode of transportation. Bike roads run alongside car roads there, with dedicated traffic lights, and bicyclists are respected and given priority. In return, they obey strict rules and laws. The whole thing is very civilized. No yelling, no honking, no confusion.
After two weeks of taking overpriced buses like a tourist and gawking at masses of bicycles at intersections, I gave in and bought a used bike. Little did I know, my rusty two-wheeled companion was to become my best friend in Denmark’s cold capital and my best chance at finding happiness.

My old friend Kathrine invited us to stay with her a while at her new tiny house in Copenhagen. For our first night out, she looked at a number of options: There was a weird performance art piece by The Center for Militant Futurologi, drummers were needed for a climate change demonstration on two tallships sailing down whatever the big river in the middle of the city is called (I swear I can’t find this information anywhere), and a jam session was brewing in Freetown Christiania. Kathrine said her best bet was a metal show at a small bar called Lygtens Kro, with a headliner from Sweden (Gothenburg, naturally) who played in the style of the 1980s. “Power metal?” I asked, and her boyfriend said that sounded right to him. I became partly acquainted with the numerous highly-specific metal subgenres back in my nightclub days, and I do my best to keep up as the lexicon matures; but I’m never sure what names to use.
So we met at the Metro station, hit the bar, and got a round of Golden Ladies (a slightly-higher-priced form of Tuborg lager, analogous to ordering a Miller Genuine Draft instead of a Miller High Life). The opening band, I thought, was good but not great. They could use a new guitarist. Still, it was enjoyable enough, stoner rock with a vein of grunge in there that might have resulted more from a lack of rehearsal than an aesthetic choice. I figured this was what would be on the menu tonight. I couldn’t have been more wrong. After a short set break, during which I smoked a comically tiny joint outside, the headliners took the stage sans announcement and began to play. I happened to be near the door that was nearest the stage, headed straight in, and got myself an enviable position in the very front of the room to see and hear a band called Hypnos.
Holy shit, these boys could play. There was an Iron Maiden thing happening, sometimes escalating into Queensryche territory or putting its root down into Soundgarden. If you know those bands, then a certain kind of metal vocals are playing in your head now that speaks to a certain era of rock — “No one sings like you anymore,” as the late great Chris Cornell lamented — and you’re right on the money. This singer Linus Johansson was extra fun — a sensuous and playful front man with frizzy blond hair and a porno mustache, with a voice like Geoff Tate and moves like Robert Plant, graceful arms and serpentine torso, with penetrating eye contact at such close quarters. This bar didn’t even have a stage, so I was just standing right in front of these guys, able to really get into what the players were doing, and they were doing plenty. The lead guitarist, Pontus Isebring, was positively fucking rad, an inspired shredder in a paroxysm behind his veil of dark brown hair yet locked in tight with the rhythm section. To call them a rhythm section is to undersell them a bit, in fact: The younger-looking second guitarist Oskar Wersall often harmonized with solos and melodies note for note, leaving the chugging rhythmic floor to dead-serious bassist Anton Kallmin; and even that mustachioed and muttonchopped warrior was doing some pretty fancy shit when space opened up on the bottom end. Drummer Oskar Brindmark was a beast and a scientist, not a drop of sweat on his brow as he assembled and deconstructed patterns with breakneck speed. They were one sick five-piece metal outfit, my friends. This isn’t even my kind of music, particularly, but I know greatness when it’s blasting me in the face.
It wasn’t all about technical chops, either. Part of what made Hypnos so much fun to watch was that they were all having so much fun, enjoying one another’s company on stage in a way that lots of bands fail to do even in their honeymoon years. Anton and Oskar W. stepped in to share backup vocals on a single mic, eyes flashing and heads bobbing at one another. Linus couldn’t get enough of Pontus’ solos — every time the latter cut loose, the former sidled up real close and let his own fingers wiggle up and down his mic stand in a celebratory air guitar dance that brought to mind Bowie/Ronson in the Spiders From Mars years. I guess this singer isn’t even the original guy — he joined the band in 2017 — but having watched them play I can hardly imagine Hypnos without him. That this band remains so infatuated with the stage and with each other on their fifteenth year of performing says much about their special chemistry, and for an audience member it makes all the difference.
At the end of the set, Linus asked us to make sure and buy something at the merch table. “We don’t have any money!” he cheerfully informed us. Sadly, I hadn’t a dime to spare at that very broke point in my own independently-booked tour of Europe; so the best I could offer was my congratulations and this article. Hypnos seems to be on tour at all times, releasing music on The Sign Records that you can buy right now and generally doing the work of a rock and roll band in the prime of life. You should find an opportunity to see them play live, ideally in a small venue, and bring enough cash for the CD or the t-shirt or whatever. Folks like us are out here scraping by in 21st-century showbiz, even living metal gods from Sweden, and time shovels dirt over all of us soon enough. It’s up to the fans to keep the scene alive. As long as there are heads in the club, Hypnos is sure to keep them banging.

[Note from Massimo: This article by my friend Jim Baggott is a bit on the technical side. But if you care about our deep understanding of the world, or about the nature of science, or about the relationship between science and philosophy, enjoy.]
I read Massimo’s essay “Physicists don’t know what the world is like, at bottom” (29 May 2020, also here) with considerable interest. And no little frustration. In the epilogue of my new book Quantum Reality (published in the US in September) I close with a brief analysis of a survey of attitudes on the interpretation of quantum mechanics that was conducted among physicists in 2011. Massimo’s essay concerned a more recent (and more extensive) survey published in 2016, which I’d overlooked. Thankfully, in most respects both surveys produced similar results.
Massimo observed that, despite all the popular media attention given to fantastical interpretations which invoke the existence of multiple, parallel universes, the Copenhagen interpretation remains the most favored. (And I heaved a sigh of relief, as this was true also in 2011.)
But what I found even more fascinating is that the 2016 survey, conducted by Sujeevan Sivasundaram and Kristian Hvidtfelt Nielsen at Aarhus University in Denmark, included questions which allowed them to go beyond this simple statement of…

It’s Monday, the start of a new week. Nat and I are both working at our desks, which at this moment is a small wooden kitchen table in our Airbnb in Vesterbro. The sun is shining into the living room after a split second downpour — after less than two days here we’ve already come to understand this is totally normal. Not your typical tropical rainstorm, but a charismatic part of the city I’ve embraced rather quickly. Ask me again in a couple of weeks…
We arrived on Saturday evening. After meeting our Airbnb host, who was very friendly and helpful, we unpacked quickly into our home for the next 3 weeks and took advantage of the late-setting sun to wander around our neighborhood. Copenhagen hasn’t been short of hubbub since we landed: Saturday was the Pride Parade; Rapha Nocturne, a nighttime cycling race ironically hosted in London for the past 10 years, was set up a few blocks away; and IRONMAN had its triathlon all throughout the city yesterday. We made our way through the liveliness to explore what Vesterbro had to offer, with the not-too-distant goal of finding a place for dinner, too.
The main street was decorated with rainbow leaflets and cutouts from the Parade, but ultimately, pretty desert when compared with the West Village in New York in June. To be fair, Pride in Copenhagen is a full 5-day event including open-air concerts, Drag Night and After-Pride Chill Out… no need for post-Parade rowdiness, even if it is a Saturday night. We walked by a few cool-looking bars and restaurants... lots of starring on our Google Maps for future ventures… and got drawn to a place called Madklubben for dinner.
There was a huge line outside — a large group of ladies waiting to get seated — which, as my Dad always says, is always a good sign a place is worth trying (not the ladies, but the line…). We waited at the bar for a table and got served by two very suave, attractive Danish men, shaking their shakers in unison and making stoic yet flirtatious conversation with the single New Yorker sitting next to us. Nat got a beer.
Dinner was delicious, though the stools not too comfortable. Guess that’s what you get when you go to a “minimal spot for unfussy dining” (quote from Google).
Next stop: a drink! It was Saturday night after all. We tried a speakeasy called Duck & Cover but they had no space — not packed, just full. Another night, perhaps. Instead, we headed to CURFEW, which had the coolest signpost at the entrance. A horizontal cutout with a light shining through, projecting the bar’s name on the wall. And a spider, fairly large, dangled comfortably. We almost believed it was fake.
Is this day zero? I asked Nat, not wanting to give up our first day so soon.
Nat ordered one of CURFEW’s award-winning drinks — key ingredients: Tanqueray gin, tarragon and mango — and I went for a refreshing alcohol-free fizz. Big mistake. Nat likes to say I’m a cheap date because I don’t like to drink, but considering how delicious this Little Dragon was, my new theory is I take only the best.
The vibe was perfect. 1920s Prohibition style, matching music, bartenders in suspenders… Nat and I didn’t even talk, we just enjoyed the moment.
The next day, it’s really day one. Or day two… I haven’t decided yet. We rented bikes — the only way to travel in Copenhagen — and Nat mapped out a whole itinerary for us. Christiansborg Palace, Rundetaarn, Botanic Gardens… today, we’re tourists, not just digital nomads. We ate lunch at Torvehallerne and biked to Kastellet, a 17th-century fortress on a star-shaped island. It seemed like anywhere we biked, another beautiful palace, church or building was there, waiting for us. This city is just stunning.
www.instagram.com
The surprising thing is we’ve adjusted so quickly. 48 hours in, we feel like we know our neighborhood decently well; we’ve gone to and made friends at our first CrossFit class at Butcher’s Lab; we’ve cooked our first meal and slept the best couple of nights we’ve had in weeks. As this first work day comes to a close, I’ve finally settled on a name for my poetry project, Midnight Plume (you’ll notice the first sneak peek in this post). I’ll properly launch it this week. I hope you’ll follow along… it’s quite personal and something I’ve thought of doing for quite some time. I’m so excited to finally share it.
And while I’m not yet sure how this travel blog will take shape, this hereby concludes my first post. I’m sure I’ll include more places and spaces we’ve seen and loved, and I hope to dive more into the feelings and questions intrinsic to this adventure. Thanks for reading, and see you soon! ***

In the last two years running has occupied a great place in his life. All this time, I slowly, slowly walked the small steps to the next goal — to run a marathon.
Preparation began in the farthest February: I trained and participated in competitions that interested me. But he tried to plan his running calendar for 2019 so that the peak of training and running occurred in April and early May. And so it turned out: at this time I ran three half marathons (Poznan, Slavutych and Białystok), one run in Brovary 11 km and 30 km. in Kharkov. The latter was important before the marathon, as he had to show how my body would respond to heavy loads.
Although at first I wanted to stop at the Prague Marathon, but its start coincided with the Bialystok Half Marathon. The problem was that this year he decided to run the “Crowns of Polish Half Marathons” and the “Bialystok Half Marathon” was on the list of this series. After thinking about the month, he preferred the Bialystok Half Marathon over the Prague Marathon.
Two Scandinavian marathons in Stockholm and Copenhagen caught my attention. Having long wanted to visit Denmark, I stopped at the Copenhagen Marathon. He also started 40 times and had an interesting route.
You can register for the marathon on the marathon page: http://cphmarathon.com. There you had to fill in your details (name and name; country; contact details; if there was experience in marathons, approximate time for which you were going to run 42 km). You could also choose the size of a T-shirt. After paying the starting fee, the system automatically assigns a starting number. The marathon route was held in one circle by the central and surrounding streets of Copenhagen, passing by the main architectural monuments of the Danish capital.
Ancient packages can be banned on Friday, Saturday and Sunday before the marathon starts.
After paying for the starting number, getting acquainted with the route of the marathon, it is time to plan the trip itself, that is, buy airline tickets and book accommodation. I decided to fly to Copenhagen on Friday night to have a free Saturday and get to know the city a bit, visit the Sport Expo and pick up the starter pack in advance.
Arriving in Copenhagen on Friday evening, my route ran from the airport to my place of residence, and at the same time enjoyed a stroll in Copenhagen in the evening.
The main task of Saturday was to find the starting number, so I followed him in the morning. The extradition took place at the Sparta Hallen Sports Complex, which also hosted the Sport Expo, Kids Running. To get the desired starter pack, you need to have a passport and a certificate from the participant who came to the mail after registering for the marathon.
The first half of Saturday came with the launch pack and the Sport Expo. The latter is well organized: in addition to the usual sports goods and equipment, there was a lot of interesting information about various marathons in the world.
After the preparation for the marathon was over, it was time for a walk in the city, a little evening jog and rest before the marathon.
I decided to run the marathon only with water and isotonics without gels, so in the evening I bought them at a local supermarket.
Sunday morning was good weather. Especially in the morning when the sky above the city was overcast and everything was indicating possible rain. This could not but rejoice, because in the heat did not really want to run.
The starting town is spread out on the waterfront on the island of Bruges. Immediately it was possible to use the cameras, get the start numbers, change clothes. In the morning, the runners began to gather here, the closer they got to the start, the more and more they became. Someone dressed up, someone kneaded before the marathon, and someone admired the views of Copenhagen, which opened from the waterfront.
All marathon participants were divided into sectors according to their time of running the marathon. The marathon runner could choose his own time before the start, unlike the Polish races, where the participant must start in the group that he chose at registration. The starting numbers were all the same and not divided into sectors by color. And the runner himself before the start chose in which sector and for what time he wants to run.
The marathon started at 9:30. The participants gradually started to run one solid mass, which again was not very convenient at the beginning of the marathon. For myself, I chose place-holders for 4 hours 10 minutes and tried to hold on to them.
The first half of the marathon was easy enough, it ran comfortably. First, the route is almost flat, with only a few climbs. Secondly, it was overcast, starting to get clear by 12 noon.
He used the hydration points constantly as soon as he met them on his way. The first part of the marathon I tried to hold on to the placemakers. In 2 hours 2 minutes I overcame the first half of the track. The movement to the finish went well. The second part of the marathon started under a very beautiful arch, informing the runners that half the distance had been passed.
The next psychological boundary after the 21 km mark was 19 miles for me. Why this mark? Mainly due to the fact that I had already overcome the 30 km distance during the Easter run in Kharkiv and knew the approximate time of its passage and that I would not encounter any problems in overcoming this distance.
One of the main tests besides the 42 km mark itself, the physical and psychological strain was a 15-mile climb to the trestle. Psychology has played even more here. The experience gained during the same “Kharkiv Half Marathon” became relevant when you just ran down one hill and you were already waiting for a descent and a new one. Another such rise was not very much wanted to overcome on its way.
I overcame the second psychological mark of 19 miles in 3 hours and 10 minutes, which again is good — in Copenhagen I spent 1 minute longer than in Kharkiv. Running towards the finish line was in the planned rhythm. The distance was 4:10–4:20 because one hour would be enough to cover 7 miles of the route. Although these are all theoretical calculations that do not always coincide with what is happening in practice. The closer I was to the finish line, the more I met on the sidelines of the runners, whose parameters were brought back to normal, and the slower I started to run.
The last 7 miles could already be described as running from one hydration station to another, where you could drink a little water, isotonics, and some to eat a banana or orange. It was a little distracting from fatigue. For those 7 miles, I stuffed everything I had just encountered along the way: from the Danes’ pizza to redbull. At about 39–40 km I began to save power, although it was difficult to find them here, which would make the last dash that would have taken me over the finish line.
A preliminary detail about the runners was in store for a surprise: a minor row on the bridge. When he appeared on the horizon, in the main sense the thought was: “it does not fit, although it is small, but I do not want to draw”. the last test, after using the descent and the finish line.
There were fans on the side of the road, adding strength to the run. From this atmosphere and the thought that even a little more and you will see the cherished word “Finish”, the forces do not understand where they came from.
After 4 hours 48 minutes of running and overcoming 42 km of my feet, I was still brought to the coveted arch with the inscription “Finish”. There I was waiting for the restoration of strength with delicious fruits, hot chocolate, cola, pastries. And most importantly — it was possible to take a breath and already nowhere to escape.
My first marathon fully met all expectations. He presented wonderful emotions, both from the run itself and from the atmosphere that dominated it. It was extremely nice to run near the Embassy of Ukraine in Denmark, where there were Ukrainians. The hometown flag is especially inspiring in the second round, when you are already exhausted and looking for some positive things to move on. A very well thought out route along the main architectural monuments of Copenhagen, the whole route is accompanied by fierce support of residents and visitors of the city. After the finish, there are a lot of different flavors for everyone to recover, as well as massages and showers. The task for this marathon was first and foremost to run it without injury so that it would not be the last.
In the beginning, I wanted to run better and finish in the range of 4:10–4:20, but in the process it goes to the background and the bar is already reduced to 5 hours — the main thing that would be no injury.
The Copenhagen Marathon has taken management to a new level of development as a runner, so in the last northern year marathons will take their place in my two main calendars.

an artist, a brewery, a restaurant
I’ve spared you the gory details on most of my other museum visits, but I have to write a little about Olafur Eliasson’s installation Riverbed at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art (located about 30 minutes outside of Copenhagen by train) because Eliasson is one of my favorite artists. Earlier on my trip I saw his Turner color studies at the Tate Britain — painted perfect gradients of colors sourced from famous J.M.W Turner paintings onto donut-shaped canvasses. But before Riverbed, I’d never seen an installation by Eliasson. He makes a lot of different types of art, but his installations are what he’s best known for.
Riverbed is, on its face, very simple. You walk down a hallway with boardwalk flooring into a typical museum art gallery. White walls, well lit, etc. The floor in the gallery, however, has been transformed into a virtual riverbed, covered with smooth stones of various size. An actual trickle of water running through the whole thing, cascading down the steeper bits of rocks where there are stairs. And it’s not just a layer of gravel that’s been thrown down; the floor has significant topography, and seems to ignore the walls and doorways of the gallery space.
There’s no designated path through the landscape, you just kind of wander until reaching a reading room at the end, at which point you must turn around and exit the way you came in. It’s natural but very sparse, much like the photographs of Iceland Eliasson published in a new book also debuted at the exhibit. Perhaps more than anything, this exhibit made me really want to go to Iceland sometime.
It’s art that’s participatory and immersive; as a visitor you are part of it, and it’s all around you. It’s not confined behind proximity sensors or crowds of people; you literally get to walk all over it.
I also think the practice of creating simulated nature inside an art museum space is interesting. You can look at it as a sly middle finger to stuffy gallery spaces, or a statement that natural beauty deserves to be examined with the scrutiny that manmade art is. Or maybe it’s just meant to be a meditative spot. In an interview about the piece, Eliasson said “It’s about exposing yourself to time, to things taking time. The walking is time unfolded.”
Personally, I did find it to be meditative. It’s funny how just putting something inside a museum makes you pay more attention to it than you might otherwise. Writing about it now, after my trip is over, I still remember the feeling and sound of walking over the layer of rocks, and watching others do the same. Eliasson’s first exhibition at MoMA was titled Take Your Time, and you get the feeling that’s what he wants you to do here too.
Still, I get that it’s not for everybody. I heard somebody upon reaching the end say “That’s it?” Some of his installations deal more with doing impressive things with light, mirrors, color, and haze. I would love to see some of those too, but I thought Riverbed was pretty cool.
Also in the museum was a theater showing some of Eliasson’s films and, and one of my favorite parts, a “model room”. The model room is essentially a table covered with hacked-together bits of wire, 3D-printed plastic, foam core, and other materials. It’s rare to see an exhibit focus so much on process and intermediate products, and I love seeing that stuff. It reminds you that works don’t just get conjured out of nothing, and gives you a peek into what the tables at Eliasson’s large Berlin studio must look like.
I highly recommend exploring some of the stuff he’s done using “Your uncertain archive” on his website. Even if you’re not interested in Eliasson, it’s a really cool piece of web design.
OK. So I’m done gushing about an artist. Time to gush about something else. I have also spared you the gory details of food and beer I’ve had on my trip thus far, but this place also requires an exception to be made.
The first time I ever heard about Mikkeller, I was with friends at the excellent Northdown Tavern in Chicago. After a couple drinks, our probably drunk bartender leaned in and started speaking in a hushed tone. “Listen. You guys wanna try some really good shit?”
Of course we did. He brought out a fantastic beer by Evil Twin Brewing (Imperial Biscotti Break Natale — Pretty Please With A Cherry On Top, for all the beer nerds out there) and mentioned that the brewery was called Evil Twin because the guy was the twin brother of the guy who started Mikkeller. “Between the two of them,” he said, “they’re making some of the best beer in the world.” In my experience thus far, he’s right.
A couple days into my Copenhagen visit I remembered that Mikkeller was based in Copenhagen. While I couldn’t find any sort of brewery tour type of thing, they do have a few bars sprinkled around the city, and a new restaurant that specializes in smørrebrød– Danish open-faced sandwiches. I was sold.
The place is called Øl & Brød (pronounced oel og broed… yeah, good luck with that), aka “beer & bread”. The interior is very hip– extremely well decorated, with an almost comically meticulous table setting and Scandinavian rock played over the speaker at the host’s podium. In addition to having several taps of delicious beer from Mikkeller and others, they also have the most extensive Akvavit (a spiced Scandinavian liquor) list of any bar in Northern Europe. Didn’t get around to sampling any of that though.
I wanted to get a real Danish delicacy, so I went for the pickled herring sandwich which was topped with fennel, cabbage, apples, and onions in various states (pickled, grilled, raw) and aioli, piled on top of a slice of very dense, dark rye bread. I took the menu’s recommendation (it has beer pairings for everything they sell) and got a glass of Boon unblended lambic beer to go with it. You’ll hear more about lambics when I write about Belgium, but the way they’re brewed makes them tart or even sour, which was perfect for complimenting the pickled bits of the sandwich and cutting through the creamy/oily bits.
After the meal I walked next door to the Mikkeller bar, tried a few tasters of beer, and talked with a pilot from Phoenix, AZ who was stopping by on his day off. Beer nerddom, like any nerddom, is great for making quick connections while abroad.
Needless to say, if you’re ever in Copenhagen you need to give this place a look for lunch. It’s a little pricier than just going to a kebab place or something, but it’s still reasonable (for Denmark) and entirely worth it. One of the best meals of my trip. And if you’re not going to Copenhagen any time soon, keep an eye out for Evil Twin or Mikkeller beer at your local bar or liquor store. Be sure to read the labels; both breweries have excellent senses of humor.
Just as a reminder, I’m choosing to write about favorite spots and stories in each city I visited as opposed to major attractions which you can read about in any guidebook. Yes, I visited Christiania and the Nationalmuseet and the Little Mermaid statue and all that. If you want to hear more detail about my trip, just talk to me ☺

Two cities I have not visited--Copenhagen and Tokyo--and you've given me a beautiful glimpse of both. And, you've made me hungry. That onigiri looks and sounds wonderful. I think that fusion with smoked salmon would be delicious. Thank you for a wonderful article.

In November 1981, having lived in West Berlin for four months, I was given the unexpected privilege of having four days off from my job at the Hotel Schweizerhof. I was ready for an adventure and gave careful consideration regarding where I should spend the days.
Paris was too far away, a fourteen-hour train trip. It took very long to get anywhere in Western Europe from the walled-in city that was closer in distance to Poland than it was to West Germany. A co-worker told me it was possible to go to Copenhagen directly from East Berlin. Not only was it a much shorter trip than going through West Germany, but it was also significantly cheaper.
I didn’t need much time to think it over. I was going to spend my little vacation in Copenhagen.
I went through the always intimidating checkpoint at the Friedrichstrasse station in East Berlin and procured a transit visa. This was a rather routine affair and didn’t require the complicated application process for obtaining a tourist visa. I had not even considered spending my holiday in East Germany, the nearest country. Ironically, that’s what I would end up doing.
I was excited as the train pulled out of the East Berlin station and headed north toward the Baltic Sea. By the time we reached Warnemuende, the seaside town from where the ferry would cross to Denmark, darkness had already descended.
There were not many passengers heading for the ferry terminal, perhaps fifty or sixty, and all appeared to be Westerners. Of course, that is not surprising considering the fact that East Germans were generally prohibited from traveling to Western countries.
The train soon pulled out of the station and headed back to East Berlin. Meanwhile, I gathered with my fellow ferry passengers in the terminal. I immediately had the sense that something wasn’t quite right. I looked out on the dock and didn’t see a ferry.
My ears picked up someone speaking English and I gravitated to that voice. It belonged to a young South African, who I later learned was heading to Copenhagen to spend a semester at the university there. He was speaking with a Danish couple.
They told me the ferry was delayed because it couldn’t make the crossing safely in the stormy sea. I never even thought about weather conditions. In my mind, I pictured a serene sea and a calm, relaxing three-hour crossing. The news that the sea was not at all as I imagined made me worried. I am not a sea-faring person. I always prefer to have my traveling feet on solid ground, or at least on reliable tracks. I have given in to air travel as an unavoidable necessity.
The Danish couple made inquiries and then informed us that it was unlikely the ferry would be arriving that night.
My initial reaction was relief. I wouldn’t have to face a multi-hour ferry crossing on a stormy sea. Always the optimist, I assumed the storm would subside during the night and the next day the sea would be calm, and we would be able to make the crossing under a blue sky, basking in the autumn sunlight. Okay, I was waxing poetic in my mind and not being particularly realistic. I was shaping the adventure I wanted to have.
There wasn’t much we could do. I was realistic enough not to expect the East German terminal police to provide us with mattresses and blankets. People grabbed the few chairs that were around, but most of us had to make do with the hard floor.
Needless to say, it was not a restful sleep. In fact, I doubt that I dozed off for more than a few minutes.
We were stirred awake by a not very cheerful “Guten Morgen” (Good Morning) and informed that we had the opportunity of purchasing East German marks (currency) so that we could have breakfast if we wished. Of course that would be at the one-to-one ratio that East Germany maintained was the true value of their money, when in reality it was about six East marks for one West mark. But who would be foolish enough to argue with them? I was hungry and didn’t really mind.
I stayed close to Dennis the South African, and the Danish couple in order to get the latest information about when the ferry would be arriving. I looked outside and was disappointed that my fantasy image didn’t appear to be manifesting. The sea was gray and stormy.
The couple was not about to spend the whole day waiting for a ferry that may or may not come. They had an alternative plan. They informed Dennis and me that there was another ferry, a very reliable one, that sailed from Sassnitz, a town in the far eastern part of East Germany. This ferry, however, didn’t go to Denmark but rather to Sweden. It would then be fairly easy to cross over to Denmark.
The couple walked up to the terminal police and indicated their plan to travel to Sassnitz. Watching from a distance, I could see that the police did not like the idea, probably because we didn’t have tourist visas for traveling around East Germany. We all just had transit visas for the route we were on.
But the couple was not going to be dissuaded and somehow got permission to leave for Sassnitz. Dennis decided to join them. I elected to as well. I didn’t want to spend most of my four-day trip in a ferry terminal. I thought it would be an unexpected adventure to travel across the northern region of East Germany and end up a stone’s throw from Poland.
A few hours later, the four of us boarded a train for the journey east. I soon realized that train travel in East Germany is laboriously slow. The tracks were obviously not in great shape. But I really wasn’t in a hurry. I had nearly forgotten about my original destination and now embraced the unexpected change my journey had taken.
We were on a local train route and made innumerable stops at small, dilapidated stations. In between the stations was a very pleasant countryside, fields and farms with an occasional small lake.
I was aware that we were attracting attention from the other passengers. Many of them, living so far from the capital city, East Berlin, probably never heard English spoken and it was unlikely that they ever encountered Westerners.
I wondered if the East German passengers were looking at us with envy that we had so much more material wealth than they did. Or perhaps they were expressing disapproval of us as decadent capitalists. German facial expressions are difficult to interpret.
It was already late afternoon when we saw in the distance a beautiful old town with a soaring steeple. The November light cast a soft golden haze over it. For some reason, the train was not stopping there. My companions told me it was Stralsund, one of the historic Hanseatic towns on the Baltic Sea. They heard that it had a well-preserved medieval center. I made a mental note of it for a future journey.
At last, we arrived at our destination. Although we were close to Poland there was no border crossing nearby. Sassnitz was more like a village than a town. But it was from this out-of-the-way location, at the eastern extremity of East Germany that the reported reliable ferry would be departing for Sweden. We easily found the tiny terminal and there was in fact a ferry there.
My fellow travelers were excited and walked immediately to the ticket booth to purchase a ticket. I stood back and gave some thought to whether I would join them. I looked at the sea. While it was not as stormy as it had been at the other location, it nevertheless did not match my ideal of calmness. It would also be a much longer crossing than with the other ferry. For Sweden was quite far from East Germany. I only had two days left of my allotted time off. I would arrive in Denmark just in time to depart.
That might not have dissuaded me from continuing on with the others, however; what really convinced me not to go was the sea crossing. The prospect of a long, rough crossing on an unpredictable sea was not inviting. I thus bid farewell to my companions as they prepared to board the ship.
I walked to the little train station and purchased a ticket to East Berlin.
I seemed to be the only one boarding the night train to Berlin. I had the compartment all to myself. It was going to be a six-hour journey. I stretched out and rested but didn’t fall asleep. I was waiting for the conductor to come in and check my ticket. But no one came. I wondered if it was just me and the train engineer on the train. I heard no footsteps and no one boarded or disembarked from the train at each stop.
We arrived in East Berlin at half past four in the morning. I walked up to the entrance to the intimidating maze of mirrors and glass partitions that constituted the Kafkaesque passport control office that one needed to navigate in order to enter West Berlin. But it was closed.
It would open in one hour. I didn’t know where to wait. Not a single person was around. I didn’t want to simply stand there for an hour. So, I walked outside into the deathly still nighttime city center.
As I walked up dark, deserted Friedrichstrasse, I didn’t feel so much afraid, as I would have been on the streets of any American city at that hour. But I felt rather nervous because I was there illegally. I had no tourist visa and thus shouldn’t be strolling around the city. Fortunately, I encountered no uniformed agent. It was eerily silent. After walking back and forth along the street, I returned to the border crossing office.
At exactly half past five, the gate opened, the lights came on. I was the first and only customer. I promptly walked up to the glass partition and handed the agent my passport. He saw the transit visa issued three days earlier. He clearly was not pleased.
Still holding on to my passport, he walked away and spoke with other agents who were standing around with nothing to do. He returned and gestured me into an open area where I was soon surrounded by seven or eight border police agents. I was told to sit down on a chair that was in the middle of the area. The police gathered around me.
In normal circumstances, I would have been nervous finding myself in this situation. But I was exhausted, having hardly slept the last two nights, and so I was rather calm. I felt very American at that moment, thinking what are they going to do to an American citizen? Thank you red, white, and blue.
Then the questioning began. Fortunately, they spoke slowly and clearly so I could understand most but not all of what they were saying. I was having some difficulty responding in German and generously sprinkled my sentences with English words. I understood what the problem was. It was now my third day in the German Democratic Republic but I didn’t have a tourist visa. All I had was a transit visa issued three days before. They wanted to know exactly where I had been during all that time.
I managed to give them an account using increasingly more English words. They seemed to understand, or at least some of them did. While they noted that I spent the previous night on the train, they were perplexed about where I had been the night before. I proudly informed them that I spent it on the floor of the ferry terminal in Warnemuende.
This was apparently shocking for them to hear. I then added a bit cheekily that it wasn’t very comfortable accommodations.
That seemed to do the trick. They were not about to prompt another flare-up in the Cold War. I was allowed to re-enter West Berlin without any further delay.
I soon breathed the not particularly fresh air of freedom in West Berlin and headed back to my furnished room. I actually wasn’t disappointed that I never made it to Copenhagen. My unexpected adventure behind the Iron Curtain proved to be highly memorable.
My heartfelt thanks to Darren Weir for his editing suggestions and assistance with the photos.

Jebiga…
This is a pretty often word used by myself: Filip Malek, a 22 year old Software Development student, part time full stack web developer and a part homeless student from Croatia.
Let me give you a little back story and the reason of writing this article. It all started many, many, many years ago when I was a little angry, 6th grade rebellious kid who preferred running through forests playing airsoft, spending every single dime on surplus military equipment rather then spending time with his peers and doing all the usual shit that kids do at that age.
Why?
Its simple — I just couldn’t do what all the others did… It just didn’t make sense. I hated the idea of following trends and being just another fish in the sea following the usual everyday routines.
Why am I telling you all this?
Well, because going to the country you have never been to, with very limited financial resources, to a accommodation you have no clue is any good, without knowing anybody there that could help you out and if that isn’t good enough — flying for the first time in your life (if we ignore flying when I was 5 years old) — requires some serious guts, or craziness, or both…
The reason I opted for ‘Living in Copenhagen’ as the name of this article is because its just that — living, not studying.
There’s so much more to just studying in Copenhagen.
You don’t come here to study, you come here for a whole package. All the good things,bad things, headaches, relationships (both love and friendships)...
Studying in Denmark is very much different from, for example, studying in England or at the campus in the ‘states’. There you have a dorm room that you can live in as long as you study which is not really the case in Denmark. Of course there are dorms here but nobody is gonna find them for you and waiting lists for the bad ones are up to 12 months… It is completely up to you to find accommodation and even though you might get tips from school or others, it is still very, very hard.
You might be getting a hint on what I’m aiming with this article. No, it’s not the fact that finding a room/apartment in Copenhagen area is a living hell or that the weather is pretty sh**** or, in fact, that jobs you will do when you start off are pretty sh**** as well.
It’s just one man’s observation on the fact that life is HARD! And trying to start off in a country such as Denmark isn’t the easiest thing in the world and you won’t be padded on your back nor congratulated on every step of the way.
It is just a wake up call and a slap in the face from the life itself. You see, life is a tragedy, we can’t argue that. Ancient Greeks knew it way back when life was much simpler. Jordan Peterson wrote about it in his book “12 rules for life” — which I definitely recommend by the way! We just have to make sense of it all if we were to survive and live a meaningful life. To set of in a world at the age of 19 with circumstances that I had was a bold move and still, 3 years later, I am not comfortable enough to look at myself and say that there is no work left and let alone sit back and relax.
But I did actually kinda relax. I was living the life. Living super close to city center in my own place (I sublet a room with its own kitchen, toilet and separate entrance in a much bigger apartment), working was just 5 mins away and school barely 7, hitting the gym often and just being happy. I was super lucky to get that place. After being kicked out and having to crash at a friends sofa for a few days I got contacted by a lovely woman who offered me the room. That just doesn’t happen in Copenhagen. Usual practice is to send 10 messages a day to landlords looking for tenants and hope that after a few weeks you get invited for an open house. I knew that this doesn’t just happen and I treated it as such.I respected the rules and I decorated the place to my own taste. Bought a black board to note shit down (always wanted one), put Star Wars posters all around, old Copenhagen Tuborg commercial posters, Copenhagen Street Food memorabilia (used to work there for 2 years). Made a hygge corner (google it) with candles and stuff… It was a really nice place and I felt at home there.
Then life decided to happen…
On 1st of May there was a some plumbing work being done in my building so they cut off the water from 0700 to 1700. My upstairs neighbors did a small mistake that led me to being kicked out again… Don’t get me wrong, they are generally nice people. I don’t know them that much though. Small talk is considered awkward and you can really see a Dane not enjoying it if you don’t know him well, that is. So I didn’t talk to them. Except saying “Hello” when I saw them in the stairwell or “Tak” (danish for thank you) when they held the door for me or vice versa. All I knew is that they were a couple with two small kids. On 1st of May — when plumbers were plumbing away — their kid left the faucet open and around 1500 — when they connected the water back on — it started to flood everything… At least that’s what they told me. I am not blaming the kid (even though, technically it is his fault). He is just a kid after all. Maybe plumbers messed up when they turned the water on too early… I came home from work only to see my room being completely wet and water dripping form the ceiling. To be honest I wasn’t angry or anything. I just wanted to go to the gym. I even bough a Ultra White Monster and a Reese's bar. I waited until they shut down the water but didn’t want to wait for repair man to come so I told my landlord that I will be going to the gym. She was okay with that as there was little to nothing that I could do. Few days after insurance company came and said that I will have to move out along with all of my stuff until latest August. I was speechless, to way the least… By then, the damage should have been fixed.
This was 5th time that I was moving in almost 3 years of being in Denmark and I definitely wasn’t happy about it.
Then life showed its beautiful side and I stumbled upon a room 25 km from Copenhagen until my place gets fixed. My cousin met a Danish girl in Bulgaria on some kind of student event. Her parents have a house in Kokkedal (district somewhat close to Copenhagen) that they rent out to students and turns out that they had one room free just for me (rhyme is on purpose here :) ). I took it without too much thought. I am still extremely grateful to these wonderful people because without them, I am not sure what would have happened.
In the time of writing this article I am still living there. Three months have passed and repairs are only 50% done and I don’t know how long will it take them to finish but I at least hope to move back in once it is done.
I guess that at the end of the day this is life. Sometimes good things happen and sometimes bad things happen. You might get 10 bad things happen and then only one good thing or vice versa. Only logical thing to do is — and I quote great Jordan Peterson — to “Stand up straight with your shoulders back” and take it like a man.
Wining and complaining never helped anybody anyway…

Facing Copenhagen City Hall across the street, Tivoli is the second-oldest amusement park in the world. I hold a special affection for it, because two same-sex partners in one of my favorite pioneering Chinese LGBTQ novels, Beijing Story (later adapted into the well-known film Lan Yu), bought a house in the suburbs of Beijing and named it Tivoli, hoping it could be as dreamy as the amusement park since they couldn’t be openly together in the city.
Tivoli became not only a shelter for them but also a haven where they could express and nurture their love. Many years have passed, yet we still need and yearn for such a place in reality.
I couldn’t hold back my excitement and took a quick look at Tivoli in the cold wind before running to catch up with my friend into Copenhagen City Hall.
My friend, K, walked ahead, glancing back repeatedly to check the wedding veil pinned to her shoulder, fearing it might fall. Her wedding with another girl, J, was to be held at City Hall in just half an hour. Two Chinese girls, getting married in a foreign country far from home.
The quiet and solemn City Hall was carefully decorated, with rainbow flags hanging in mid-air, rainbow stickers on the…

By the time we got to Femøren metro stop the wind had picked up and the rain was lashing down. More inappropriate weather for a sea swim you couldn’t imagine. But it would take a bold — and rash — person to stand between me and a swimming adventure and so we pressed on, holding umbrellas horizontal, like shields in battle against the driving rain.
Half an hour previously, scurrying from the warmth of our cosy hotel to the metro station, we had had a tiff about umbrellas. Between us, you thought that one small black collapsible umbrella was not enough: it was raining, windy and miserable. You wanted me to shelter under the brolly beside you and and I didn’t want to pin myself to you to keep dry. I don’t care for umbrellas. I prefer getting wet and bedraggled to the fuss and bother of an umbrella. My protestations of “Look, I’m waterproof!” and “I’m not cold! I don’t mind getting a little wet!” didn’t convince you. It made you feel ungallant, you said.
“What if it’s really rainy when we get to the other end and there is a long walk?!” you wailed, persuading me to let you go and buy a second umbrella.
Thank goodness for the second umbrella, I had to concede. It was much worse by the time we got off the metro. A less determined expedition would have turned back. Instead, we pressed on. I was going to have my swim. We skirted through an industrial estate, crossed 4 lanes of traffic, and squelched our way across the sodden and marshy grass of a park because it seemed marginally quicker than the pathway. Anything to get out of the driving rain.
I’d seen pictures of Kastrup Sea Bath in glossy design and architecture magazines. It looked beautiful: an elegant curved wooden construction, warmed and weathered, at the end of a long jetty, where locals can swim, sunbathe and dive, sheltered from the elements.
On a day like today there were no swimmers, sunbathers, no hanger-outers. Not a soul. It looked beautifully desolate, forlorn, slightly spooky. The usually silvered wooden timbers were black and sodden with rain. The planks looked more like the snaggle-toothed weathered boards of a wrecked ship than a haven. There was nobody around. Had they all abandoned ship?
We walked out along the jetty to investigate more closely, I had a sense of foreboding. I hoped it might appear more inviting close up, but it felt just as bleak. Doors to changing rooms were locked, it felt like the world had left for the summer and well and truly locked up on the way out.
We decided, I decided, that a swim from the shore, from the beach, might be more prudent. We walked back along the jetty to the beach and found a large spartan changing room nearby and stripped off.
As we stood in our swimming gear on a cold autumn day, in the rain, in the middle of nowhere, slightly hysterical, miles from civilisation, a middle aged woman rode up noncholantly on a bike. Seemingly unphased by the vile weather, she leaned her bike against a wall, and walked along the jetty to the sea baths. The lifeguard had arrived! As we watched from the beach she wandered around the sea baths unlocking doors and settling in for a quiet day at the office. I felt more reassured by her arrival.
Back to the reason we’d come. We tiptoed into the water. Sand underfoot. Wincing. Cold. My feet hurt. Undeterred I waded in deeper, reasoning that being under the water would somehow would be warmer, because I’d be out of the wretched wind. You let the water dance across your thighs, and then turned back, not as convinced by the beauty of the cold as I was.
Emboldened by the presence of another human being who might be able to help if something went wrong (what would go wrong?!) I headed out from the shore. Breastsroke at first — to take in the view — and then front crawl. Out past the edge of the sand into an area of tall seaweed beds. I tasted the water — it was suprisingly unsalty. Is it the sea? Or a river to the sea?
Becoming bolder, I headed further out — swimming alongside the jetty, with little choppy waves to slap me as I went. Arriving soon at the haven of the wooden platform I was greeted by the lifeguard, a middle aged Danish woman, smoking a cigarette, wrapped up against the weather. As I treaded water, we smiled and said hello. “14.5C” she offered, unprompted, with a friendly smile. The international language of swimmers. Would she swim, I asked? Perhaps. How many people would swim today? About five to six.
Then I saw you wandering back along the jetty, in only your trunks, to join us.
And there we were, the three of us, chatting away: one fully clothed and bundled against the cold, one standing half naked in the wind, and one bobbing about in the water. On a swimming platform, out to sea, in the wind and rain. Oh Copenhagen. What better way to experience a place than to be right there, surrounded by it. Inside it.

The whole idea of moving from Brno to Copenhagen came to my mind sometime around November 2015. The main reason for me was that I had already completed the majority of design classes at my university in Brno and I was struggling with math and algorithm classes. I didn’t want to spend 2 more years studying calculus day and night and shifting my focus away from design. So I started researching schools around Europe. I looked for the ones focused mainly on design and suitable for me to continue my studies. From all the schools I looked at, I found the best fit in the Copenhagen School of Design and Technology, where I eventually applied. I had to wait until the 1st of July to see whether I am accepted or not. Luckily I passed the admission process and I could continue my studies in Denmark. It sounds quite effortless now but I was terrified at the time. I had just landed a great job heading the Edookit design team and I was also involved in a number of my own freelance projects. Yet I took advantage of the opportunity and with all the projects in mind I moved to the capital of Denmark.
After a few months of living here, I have to say it was a good decision. I managed to keep my work at Edookit as well as my work on private projects (such as this blog). Living in a completely different country and working for a company based in Brno taught me how to manage my time well. I have already detailed my time management routines in a previous article.
The city itself is undisputably stunning. Colourful buildings, huge parks and bikes everywhere. The history of Copenhagen is rich, yet the city maintains a modern feel. I am a big fan of the bike culture, I still cannot imagine a single day here without my double-wheeled friend. The year of 2016 was the first year in history when there were more bikes in this city than cars. Coming from Brno, where you can easily be killed when riding a bike, Copenhagen feels like heaven. Overall the bike infrastructure is very developed with futuristic bike bridges over canals and self-driven metro. All of this is supported by city train lines called S-trains which go up to 40 km/h from the city centre in each direction. I was using the B-line of the S-train often because I lived in a nearby suburb town of Taastrup.
I fell in love with this town and the house I have lived in and as I said to my landlord, it will always remain a great part of my life. Taastrup is a quite small town inhabited mostly by families and made beautiful by the pristine nature surrounding it. A lot of different opportunities for running, huge shopping centre called City 2 and a lot of Danish architecture. The main squares are full of traditional shops, which are maintained by people who spent their entire lives developing their skills. Quiet, inspirational and friendly — the best place for a creative person to live in.
Studying at KEA (Copenhagen School of Design and Technology) taught me a lot that I could immediately utilize in my actual work. The school puts emphasis on research as well as on pitching ideas. I also wrote an article about one of the projects we did as an assignment for a new museum in Copenhagen.
I knew that research is a crucial part of UX design and design in general but until I became involved in research at KEA, I think I hadn’t thought about it quite as deeply as I perhaps should have. Leaving my comfort zone, talking to users and consumers and creating new design processes are only a fraction of what I have learned here. I have had the opportunity to work on our school projects with many talented designers, who were already able to achieve so much in their lives and some of them are already members of teams working on projects with worldwide impact. I am thankful for getting to know them and being inspired by them to learn even more about design and continue working towards my goals.
I was lucky enough to get a place in a minor, semester-long program, which is focused in particular on digital product design. I wanted to get a place there badly, as this program could really help me understand the work I do even more and teach me a lot about designing experiences. After spending a semester focusing on research and theory of design, I am looking forward to coding and high fidelity design. And so I have to move again and leave Copenhagen. After Christmas spent in Slovakia with my family and friends, I will spend most of January in Brno at Edookit headquarters preparing my work for the next couple of months and then move to Amsterdam, starting the next chapter of my life.

Since I’m already at the end of my journey to Denmark, I figured I would talk about some of the most interesting places I visited in Denmark. I must admit that I didn’t venture very far from Copenhagen, but if you are only visiting for a week or two, most of what I’m going to present can be done.
It might be obvious, but we tend to forget that most people in Denmark live in this city area and by far. The second largest city, Aarhus, has only 1/6th of the population of Copenhagen. I won’t say I saw everything there is to see, but here is my personal must-do list:
This is the classic tourist place you find on all postal cards from Copenhagen. Still it’s a must see. Be sure to walk around the harbour and enjoy the seaside, the old houses and the beautiful boats. With some luck, you might even get a nice sunny day.
Near the old harbour across the pedestrian bridge, you can find this strange, but cool place called Papirøen. Inside the building you will find a LOT of different street-food for every taste. Wandering inside the building is a unique experience for the senses. Grab something to eat and take a seat in front of the canals.
From Papirøen, you can walk toward Christiania. This hippy community claims itself independent, but make no mistake it’s still part of Denmark and the laws still apply. However, they do have two rules you MUST respect:
- Don’t run (because that signals a police raid)
- Don’t take photos
It’s a nice place to grab a beer and, if you like that, smoke. Multiple stands openly sell all you will ever need.
To end the day, I suggest a GoBoat tour in the canals. You can rent those electric boats for one or two hours and wander around. They have a picnic table on them, so bring some food and alcohol to do a nice meal on the water. It’s one of the best experience you can have in Copenhagen and another way to see the city.
In the middle of the city, you will find the artificial lakes. It’s perfect for a morning walk or jog and you will find many Danes doing their work out there. They are not too big, but the scene with the old building is very beautiful.
Not very far from the lakes, you can find the Botanical garden. It’s a big and nice garden with at its center an old charming Greenhouse. The entrance is free so it’s totally worth the detour to observe some tropical and indigenous plants gathered over the many years of its existence.
Just beside the Botanical garden, you will find the King Garden. It’s not as pretty, but it’s worth a walk to see the flowers and the status. You can also visit the Rosenborg Castle. It’s usually full of tourists and quite expansive so I didn’t do it.
Biking is an important part of the modern Danish culture, so you will find plenty of very nice and well maintained cycling tracks. This is the itinerary I did:
The first part of this itinerary is the green belt that goes around Copenhagen, you will find a lot of old bunkers along this road with historical explanation (only in Danish though). After, you will get to the beautiful seaside and into a natural park. You can finish your journey in the charming fishing village of Dragør. You can back to Copenhagen by using the metro from the airport which is nearby.
Bike or take the train to this very nice location near Copenhagen. On the weekend, you will find many Danes there. The sandy beach is a nice spot for a picnic and you can walk a long time in the natural park of Dyrehavn after. You will see many many deer in this park, it’s what it’s famous for.
If you come to Copenhagen in the first week of June, you will be able to experience Distortion. During a couple of days, around 100 000 people invade the streets to dance and drink as much as they can. The event is described as: “A week of Emerging Dance Music and Orchestrated Chaos”. It’s a very special experience that you can’t find anywhere else in the world.
This city is located around 50km north of Copenhagen. It is easily accessible by train from Copenhagen Central Station. This is where the famous Kronborg Castle is located. If you are a fan of Hamlet this is the perfect spot. If you are like me and you don’t know what Hamlet is, this is still a nice castle to visit.
Just near the castle, you can also visit the underground Danish naval museum. Just for the architecture of the building it is worth a look. The exhibition by itself is quite short, but pleasant. The nearby library is also worth the detour. The mix of modern steel and glass with an old brick factory is uniquely beautiful.
From there, you can grab something to eat in the interior street food stands and take the direction of the small harbour. There, grab a beer in one of the bars or from the convenience store and enjoy the armada of sailing boats.
I finished the day by walking in the old city streets. The pedestrian only street is particularly beautiful even if it is not as long as the Copenhagen one. You can catch the train back to Copenhagen any time you want.
Bornholm is an island in the middle of the Baltic sea between Sweden and Germany. This is the farthest I went from Copenhagen. It takes around 3 hours to get to Rønne (the biggest city on the island) from Copenhagen. Take the bus 866 to Ystad, Sweden and from there take the ferry.
The bus service on the island is not too bad and works similarly to the mainland, but you cannot you use your Rejsekort. You can buy 10 zones tickets for 85 kroner cash from the driver and use the old-school stamper at the entrance of the bus. You can almost go everywhere on the island. My Airbnb was in Nexø which is well located in the southern part of the island.
From there, I decided to visit the small city of Svaneke which has won the price of the most beautiful city of Denmark. I was a bit sick at that time, so I took the bus, but I highly recommend renting a bike for the day. The country side is charming and is worth exploring.
This old harbour city is very well preserved and it’s nice to walk around the houses and shops. From there, the walk along the coastal line is also pleasant and beautiful. Bring some food for a perfect picnic on the relaxing sound of the waves.
From Nexø, it is also easy to visit Dueodde. Praised for its sand beaches, this is the perfect spot to relax and take a sun bath. If you are courageous enough, you can try a dip in the water, but it is very cold even in the middle of July. Visiting both Svaneke and Dueodde can be done in a day.
My other trip on the island was going to Hammerhus. This is a medieval castle ruin and one of the most important archeological site of Denmark. It is also very popular so I suggest going early. It is around 1h of bus from Nexø. From the ruins, you can walk along the coast to see some impressive cliffs. I then took the bus again to go back to Rønne. I didn’t find the city particularly interesting, but you can relax in a Café until you catch the ferry.
Denmark is not a big country, but you can visit a lot of nice places quite easily with public transport. The coast is very beautiful and worth taking the time to enjoy it. In the next and probably final blog post, I will talk about my internship experience at Pleo. See you soon!

This year we decided to visit more international events and since we heard that Copenhagen’s MeasureCamp organized by IIH Nordic is well-known for hosting many international guests and that the official language is always English, it was a no brainer.
Just after the landing in Copenhagen Airport we traveled into the city center by metro (the city is probably not that big, since it only has two metro lines more than Brno). The navigation looked exactly like a line-up of a heavy metal festival (just the fonts are a little less diverse).
When we got out of the underground the first thing that surprised us was the amount of bikes on every corner of the city centre and insanely heavy bike-traffic (probably a bit increased by the nice weather on Thursday). We were also surprised to see actual nudges preventing littering. But they were white — someone would call that “a typical Danish sloppiness”.
As we arrived on Thursday, we were looking towards meeting with the other attendees before the main event, so we asked the organizers if there is any Warm-up party. There was nothing officially planned, but the idea clicked and we arrived at the venue on Friday evening, helped a little with moving a couple of chairs and got beer-support and a tip, that drinking on an embankment after work is a popular Danish thing to do. We know how hard is to organize a perfect event, so we understood when the organizers themselves were not able to attend (we also hope that we didn’t cause too much trouble — Yeah, yeah, sorry, sorry), but at least it looks like we have founded a tradition for the next issues of Copenhagen’s Event.
Czechocalypse! We bet that the second country with most attendees at #mccphg19 was Czechia. Here they are: Tony, Marek, Marina (one ex-russian, ex-australian, currently-finnish exception), Leona, Milan, Martin, Tobiáš, Hana (Lukáš is missing, maybe he was stalking Simo somewhere).
In Czechia there’s a saying “drinking like a Dane” (= a lot), we guess that after this weekend there will probably arise a similar phrase in Denmark — “drinking like Czechs”. As we know that the best experience you can take from MeasureCamp is to present and at the same time that most attendees fear public speaking, we decided to donate a bottle of courage (nice mellow rum from Barbados) to all attendees so they may overcome this hurdle.
This new GTM feature had pretty good coverage by both Julian Juenemann and Simo Ahava. They were mentioning them in their presentations and discussing various aspects related to this forward-looking promising move of Google. This attempt to regain mutual trust in between marketing and IT departments (partially lost due to marketing collateral of Tag Management Systems stating that managing JavaScript tags can be done by circumventing slow and complex IT processes) by providing far better control allowing for increased security and supporting best development practices seems to click with the analytics community.
Simo also presented an open-source project of himself and David Vallejo to build, maintain and share reviewed templates and asked attendees to contribute.
The topic was mentioned in the morning session lead by Jeff Doctor and later again in presentation by Steen Rasmussen. Especially Hana is always excited if someone is about to speak for a more broader point of view considering all the consequences.
Especially the networking conversations emphasized what bad could be done with new powerful data tools, if we’ll use it without making some policies about it. With Steen it was more in the practical way related to analytics and social media, with Jeff it was more philosophical (❤) about knowledge without wisdom and turning statistics into a dangerous tool not reflecting relations among people.
Topics related to these discussions are also GDPR (legislation trying to catch-up with the technology trends) and a new “war” (as mentioned in the presentation by Alban Gerome) sometimes referred to as cat-and-mouse game between the browser vendors and marketing technology providers around cross-site scripting and inadequate data sharing. We already have the ITP series (1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2) from Apple/Safari and Mozilla/Firefox joining the effort as well, so we kind of hope that our industry will still exist after future revisions of such actions even if we, at least for now, are still able to find feasible workarounds (like the one against latest issue of ITP presented by Simo Ahava).
Usually, we enforce each other so all of us have a session, but this time, only Lukas and Hana made it through.
This “unconference” is really awesome! I love the everyone’s drive for data and web analyses. It’s not like science conferences, where everybody has to present their results to be more visible, for reference to their articles and scientific collaborations. Here, it is different — no reviewers and abstracts or choosing who is suitable enough to have a presentation. You can talk here on your own topics, in case you find it interesting for somebody. Just to share the knowledge and data tricks, no need to get anything back. The schedule board was magic — there was balance between spaces and sessions. Next time I would be proud to stick my own session card on the board as well.
As we probably overestimated the fear and the session board filled up pretty quickly in the morning, the rum was finally useful as an acceleration of the After Party, when we upgraded the game of beer-pong with it.
We were offered to play our favorite songs at the After Party. That wasn’t a wise decision, because since we arrived to our Airbnb, we switched local AppleTV into Czech and started to play two songs: Promiň (Sorry) and Dělám stojky (I do handstands). Those songs are from the bizarre category and we recycled the phrases in them again and again during our stay. We’re so sorry, that even other people had to listen to these. But to enjoy the stupidity, here’s a typically Danish sloppy translation into English, so you can suffer with us.
Does anyone know who is this creepy guy trying to take photos with everyone?

I didn’t grow up in Denmark so I’m a bit of a coward when it comes to biking in winter. The cobblestones around Copenhagen are tricky enough without adding ice or slushy snow into the mix. Happily, the city has fantastic public transport including a rail system that can get me anywhere I want to go, almost round the clock.
I live in Sydhaven on the edge of the city proper. A good selection of buses run nearby but I love the S-train so it’s worth the 10-minute walk.
At Sjælor station, I slap my rjesekort (travel card) against the blue check-in light on the platform and hope to hear a chirpy ka-ching. The uh-oh loser chime means insufficient funds but it isn’t a problem, public transport is cheap in Copenhagen and a few kroner go a long way.
The suburban-urban S-train is integrated with the city Metro and about half a million people use the system every day. The trains are frequent and usually clean, unless tagged by teens with cans of spray paint. If that conjures up subway nightmares, fear not — this isn’t New York and…

In 2018, Copenhagen’s new waste-to-energy plant will not only set the bar high for environmental performance but also for architectural integration into the landscape with the plant containing a variety of green and recreational spaces.
By Robert C. Brears*
The city’s waste-to-energy plant, Copenhill / Amager Bakke, is being constructed by Amager Resource Center which is owned by five Danish Municipalities. The plant, projected to open in the summer of 2018, will be equipped with two furnace lines and a joint turbine- and generator system. This replaces a 45-year-old plant that had four furnace lines. With the new furnaces, Copenhill will burn 2 x 35 tons of waste per hour. Overall, Copenhill will:
Grey+Green Infrastructure
In addition to the technological achievements of the plant, Copenhill will be architecturally integrated into the surrounding landscape with the inclusion of green and community spaces. Almost 3,000m² of the roof surface will be dedicated to the green landscape with planners creating ’10 places and 10 routes’. The places will contain a number of areas for visitors to look out from, take a break or work out in, while the routes will comprise a variety of walking and running routes that range from an inspirational hiking landscape to short-sprint and challenging training routes.
Along the perimeters of the building, there will be green areas for visitors to enjoy the view of the city. An artificial ski slope covering 600m², along with a ski centre providing equipment, ski passes, and clothing to the public, will provide extra recreational opportunities for the public to enjoy.
Finally, adventure-seekers will be able to climb the sides of the plant with the Danish Climbing Association involved in preparing a future climbing wall which will be one of the highest in the world at 80 meters.
The take-out
Infrastructure of the future will be a mix of grey+green enabling multiple benefits to accrue from one site.

Onstage at Lantern Theater Company January 11 through February 18, 2018, Copenhagen explores a pivotal moment in the relationship of Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, two scientists at the cutting edge of the development of quantum physics. The play explores the notion of being on the forefront of incredible discovery — and what your responsibility is to the world and to your loved ones once those discoveries are unleashed.
Quantum physics is a branch of science that examines the workings of the smallest parts of our world: the atomic and subatomic elements of nature. By the turn of the 20th century, scientists suspected that the classical laws of nature might not apply at the atomic level, and quantum physics sprang from the desire to learn more about what might govern the building blocks of all matter.
Newtonian physics was the dominant belief for two centuries, and a major tenet for that system is causality. According to classical physics, knowing the initial conditions for an event means that one could theoretically predict every event that would follow, thanks to the laws of motion and conservation of energy. Quantum physics shakes that belief to its core, embracing instead the idea that deterministic causality may be impossible at the atomic level.
According to the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum physics, formulated primarily by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, uncertainty is at the heart of the discipline. In his Uncertainty Principle, Heisenberg posited that it is impossible to know with certainty both the position and the momentum of an atomic element, like an electron. The more precisely you measure one factor, the less precisely you can hope to measure the other.
This is largely because of the Complementarity Principle, contributed by Bohr. This states that matter has properties of both particles and waves — which would have been impossible in Newtonian physics — and that both are necessary for a complete understanding of atomic elements. By accepting that both states are true, we can begin to understand the seemingly contradictory behavior of atomic and subatomic elements.
Another main tenet of the Copenhagen Interpretation is that the act of measuring or observing essentially changes the thing being observed. For example, sending a beam of light to find a particle means that a photon will collide with an electron, which tells that electron’s position. However, that collision knocks the electron off its path, meaning that its momentum and velocity are now different than they were before the scientist went looking for it. For quantum physicists who adhere to the Copenhagen Interpretation, this means there is an essential unknowability at the core of the science.
This is why some major physicists of the time, including Einstein and Schrodinger, rejected the Copenhagen Interpretation; rather than seeing the lack of knowledge as its own kind of knowledge, they saw it as giving up on finding out. Bohr and Heisenberg were standing against hundreds of years of classical physics, and against some of the leading minds of their field.
“Quantum provides us with a striking illustration of the fact that though we can fully understand a connection … we can only speak of it in images and parables. We must be clear that when it comes to atoms, language can be used only as in poetry. The poet, too, is not nearly so concerned with describing facts as with creating images and establishing mental connections.” — Niels Bohr
World War II was ramping up as the theory of quantum physics made room for practical application, and theoretical physicists began exploring the possibility of nuclear energy, with Bohr and Heisenberg at the forefront.
Nuclear fission is the splitting of an atom’s nucleus into two smaller pieces, as a result of either a reaction with free neutrons or radioactive decay. This releases tremendous energy, paving the way for both nuclear reactors that produce power and nuclear bombs that rain destruction. A chain reaction is necessary to sustain this energy release; each instance of fission releases neutrons, which can then go on to fission other nuclei in the material. The longer the chain, the more energy is released.
In order for the chain reaction to be self-sustaining, the fissile material must be at critical mass: the precise amount and shape needed to produce a self-sustaining chain reaction, which it can be controlled by density, mass, and other factors. This mass is determined in part by a diffusion calculation, which measures how the freed neutrons are distributed throughout the system. This equation helps discern how much of a particular isotope is required for the neutrons to fission in order to produce a self-sustaining chain reaction — and therefore how much would be necessary to build an atomic bomb.
In their visionary leap and embrace of uncertainty, Bohr and Heisenberg stood against hundreds of years of classical and deterministic physics, and some of the leading minds of their field. They also had a hand in fundamentally changing the direction of modern warfare, and the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.
Copenhagen is onstage at the Lantern January 11 through February 18, 2018. Visit our website for tickets and information.

Hopefully by now everybody recovered from the New Year’s Eve party and ready for the next weekend ahead us. Let me give you a short guide to the best bars in Copenhagen, based on my own experiences to make the choice easier.
1105 — You’ll find only the basic information about the 1105 on its website, but in fact, there is no need for more because its fame speaks for itself. 1105 has been around a while and was inspired by the London hotel bars. It was designed in the spirit of the Danish “hygge” and if you don’t mind, you can sit and socialize together with strangers. Many locals and non-locals as well simply consider it as the best in town, because of the vaste cocktail selection and the professional bartenders. https://www.facebook.com/1105cocktailbar
The barking dog — This is my personal favourite from the list, however, I’ve been there only once. Located in another party district of Copenhagen, Nørrebro, you can be sure that this place is full with party people on Friday/Saturday nights. This bar is smaller than the 1105, so if you arrive in couple or in a smaller group, it is almost sure that you have to share your table with others. The retro atmosphere evokes for me the ruin bars from Budapest and the cocktail menu is creatively edited, with a short story encolsed to the cocktails. http://www.thebarkingdog.dk
№64 — The concept of this cozy cocktailbar is that you have to pay 64 DKK (8,5 EUR) for a cocktail. This doesn’t affect the quality though. Don’t miss the delicious home-made ginger shots, which will warm you up in these cold months and not only because of the ginger, if you know what I mean. During the weekends, it’s a good idea to book a table in advance, because it might get very busy, but if you miss it, the good thing is that you don’t have to hunt the free tables, because at the entrance the staff will help you right away. http://www.no64.dk
Madam Chu’s — This bar is situated at the Gammel Strand, together with other trendy cocktail bars, what makes this outstanding though is its oriental style. After you draw the black curtain, you enter a whole new world. The cocktails are strong, and these ‘forbidden delights’ come with unusual ingredients such as dill and caramel or red pepper. Don’t forget, ‘anything is possible and everything is for sale’ here. http://madamchu.dk/home/
Taphouse — This one is an exception on the list, but such a great bar that I couldn’t leave it out. If you’re a huge fan of beers then this is your place to be. Before I moved to Copenhagen, I couldn’t really drink any other type than wheat beer, but since then I discovered a whole new world of IPA’s, brown ales and red ales. The Taphouse is situated in the very heart of Copenhagen and you can choose over 60 different types of beers, with real rarities and many seasonal offers. Don’t get scared of the prices, only 2 glasses of beers kick off the party and your good mood. http://taphouse.dk

This guide by Sondre Sommerfelt is a gift to all his fellow sailors onboard Christian Radich for the xVoyage, however it should guide any lost sole in Scandinavias most continental city.
www.entrepreneurship.one
The Guide is splitt into the inner city København K and 4 (5) main boroughs that surround it:
- Vesterbro and Nørrebro, working-class districts that has gentrified increasingly into a rich kids playground (but they’re still charming. )
- Nørreport , which is not its own borough, but feels like one.
- Amager, CPH own New Jersey.
- and Frederiksberg, aka Manhattan, which is actually its own city, inside the other city. Frederiksberg is not exactly a city-state either, as you’re still in Denmark, but even so, it’s just as strange as the Danes are comfortable about having it.
Østerbro: The slightly more refurbished district north (or is it east?) of the city and Søerne lake(s).
The Seminal restaurant Noma has opened again, so Copenhagen’s reputation as a culinary excellence endures without them and their foraged moss. Danish design is world renowned and its city development — kicking out the cars, redesigning its city for bikers and pedestrians, and thinking ahead, always asking, ‘what does our citizens need(?), before they know it themselves — is a trailblazer in modern urban planning.
Equally noteworthy is the city’s vibrant and varied nightlife: lax drinking laws (plus lax cannabis laws) combined with an emphasis on good design and epicurean innovation make for an embarrassment of great bars and lounges. If you know where to go, you can easily stay out until the sun comes up — which in the dead of winter is very late indeed.
Always have in the back of your mind the very traditional Danish bodega, or dive. At these establishments there’s no craft beers, only [cheap] Danish beers like Carlsberg and Tuborg, or the oldest ecological industrial beer in the world, Thy. But as with any good dive, you don’t go to these bodagas for the drinks. Drink Thy, smoke cigarettes, play dice, and generally unwind.
Very important Info:
Whatever you do, the party often ends at Kødbyen — the meat district — at Vesterbro or at some of the late night bodegas mentioned in this guide.
Most Importantly:
WHATEVER you do, the only thing you need to do visit in the city of Copenhagen is the dive bar Bobibar.
Tips for the summer:
Pumpehuse — Cultural hub and live venue in an old industrial area. Great garden, Byhaven, with free concerts all through the summer.
The kiosk ‘Khioskh’ has an insane amount of different types of beers. (Check out the basement). Pick out some fine samples, and sit on the lawn in front. For some reason, you’re not allowed to drink your purchased fancy-brew at their benches in-front of the kiosk, so you’re shown to the grass next to the benches like a dog, a brew dog.
On warm summer nights, sit under the trees at one of the bars by Søerne lake. Or rent a Swan-boat, bring loads of rosé and pedal around the lake like a boss.
Islands brygge: buy the cheapest red wine and a bottle of Spirte at the local grocery store, go to the pier, jump in the sea, get up, mix yourself a big glass of ‘Tino de Verano’. When the sun sets, everybody is here. You’ll make friends. We promise.
Plenty windy beaches, we choose Amager beach park
Buy an ice-cream cone with ‘det hele’, which means — literally — with everything.
WHATEVER you do, the only thing you need to do visit in the city of Copenhagen is the dive bar Bobibar.
The Urinal
The area around Larsbjørnsstrædet, Studiestræde and Sankt Peders stræde (also called Pisserenden (The Urinal) or The Latin Quarter) is filled with people & bicycles. As Latin quarters should, it has a relaxed atmosphere perfect for knocking back some beers in the sun (well, that’s a description that fits all of CPH — perfect for knocking back beers in the sun). You can always just sit on a doorstep or a trashed bike and drink your brew, instead of at the cafes. Or it used to be like this, but things are changing: the area has become increasingly touristy lately, and ‘nobody’ (read: the cool cats) ever goes here besides its ‘hood-rats’ and people that are lost. If you go further down the street you step into a sunny beach looking area with random youth clubs (Vestergade).
Anyway, there’s indeed a relaxed atmosphere and good salads and sandwiches on the Icelandic Kaffesalonen, (Sankt Peders stræde), or at Livingroom, located right at the intersection of Larsbjørnsstrædet and Studiestræde. Also worth checking out is the cafe and bar Din nye ven (Your New Friend) which is a sweet hangout. And the restaurant Brother has great New Nordic food.
When it comes to shopping, there’s a lot of 2nd Hand & Vintage joints in the streets mentioned above, and in Kompagnistræde / Læderstræde.
Kongens Have
The King’s Garden is perfect for knocking back beers, on the lawn, in the sun. Although this spot is very popular for both students, people from the provinces and drunken Swedes (or Norwegians), it’s indeed classy as King’s gardens should be.
Bo-Bi Bar.
Bo-Bi Bar, our favourite bar in CPH, it’s vintage in its exterior, interior and clientele. It’s probably one of the best dive bars in the world (that’s a fact), and has been like this since back when making dive bars was a popular pursuit, under the times of prohibition, although Denmark never had any prohibition. Dangerously tempting, even on school nights. During the day they play classical music, serve hardboiled eggs and have a ’no cellphone policy.’ Smoking is encouraged.
Byens kro
Just down the street from Bobibar is another slightly more refurbished den with slightly more refurbished people. Byens kro (‘The City’s Bodega’, its name none the less) is open and hour or two longer than Bobi, which is convenient if you’re still thirsty and sleepless late after midnight.
Pumpehuset
Cultural hub and live venue in an old industrial area. Great garden, Byhaven, with free concerts all through the summer.
La Fontaine aka Laffa
Jazz club with special beer offers on Fridays — 3 for 1 (or is it 3 for 2. We can’t remember). Popular hang out for both musicians and intellectuals, and probably also intellectual musicians, and musical intellectuals.
Jazzhouse
Best venue in CPH and they serve some mean cocktails. The music is more than ‘just’ jazz, if you like the music at Blå in Oslo or Cafe Oto in London, you’ll love it here.
Gasoline Grill
Named one of the best burgers in the world recently. It is located in an old gas station at Landegreven (close to Kongens Have). Be there early, they only make around 50 burgers a day and close when they are sold out…
Fars Dreng
Vine & food.
Ofelia Plads
Arty space by the harbour — installations, concerts, theatre, panthomime, contourtionism, who knows what arty people do? Go into the playhouse next door and get a glass of wine, bring it outside and chill.
Botanisk Have
Botanical garden. Go for a stroll. Bring wine. And a harp.
Café Dyrehaven
Café Dyrehaven (‘The Animal park’, named after a deer park North of Copenhagen) on Sønder Boulevard, perfect for both brunch and evening drinks (Closes at 1am). And as the Baudelairen name implies — probably the best place in town for people spotting. Try ‘kartoffelmad’, potato sandwich, or other contemporary interpretations of traditional (open) Danish sandwiches. (Yes, our American friends, its only one piece of bread and topping, no extra bread on top. Crazy!) Or just go for the brunch platter, always a treat. They also have decent and reasonably priced dinners.
Blomsten e.l.
Blomsten (The Flower) on Istedgade: beer, smokes, hipsters, dicey locals & jukebox in a healthy mix. This is an authentic Danish bodega: as real as it gets, and a must see. Closes at around 02:00.
To make a cultural walk out of it, why not go on a binge? When in Rome, set out on a Danish binge crawl of Vesterbro: From Skipper’s Bodega in Istedgade, walk up the street to McKluud, before ending at Blomsten. It’s three fine dens where they play Danish folk and sea shanties, populated with a bouquet of gentle Danes of all ages and sizes, new teeth or toothless. Classic and hypermodern at the same time, if that’s even possible? Yes it is. Denmark in a nut(s)shell.
Bang & Jensen: Food, bar, beer, cool elderly clientele, and, or first dates.
Brass Monkey
A Tiki bar & a cocktail hangout with a Twin Peaks-ish atmosphere.
Riesen bar in Ohlenschlægersgade
If you manage to spell the name of this street you’re probably too sober to go here, or you have a PHD in Danish linguistics. If you don’t, like most human beings, and you’re bold enough to dare to go down the primordial path, this is the most decadent bar in town: intimate, packed with pity or petty nihilists, charming and cute narcissists — and their nemeses. Or to translate from latin, this is where everybody goes to pick up someone or somebody. So, it’s a perfect spot for drinks after you’ve been through all the other bodegas mentioned above. It usually starts out as a tranquil place, but it can change its rating from Calvinist retreat to good old Roman debauchery in seconds. So beware! Closes at about 4am.
Guldregn Bodega.
A morning tavern and would be your last resort. At Guldregn aka The Golden Shower (Yes, that’s the name of this den.) Be aware, it’s been suffering from its own success (if you can call it that?) and therefore they’ve employed bouncers and mandatory wardrobe. However, worth a visit if you still hang out and about at Vesterbro in the morning mist. Free your mind and your body will follow.
Enghave Kaffe
A motorcycle garage themed coffee shop, with a no lap top rule, which means you talk with your fellow coffee drinkers. A regular morning stop.
Enghave Smørrebrø
The next-door neighbour of the above. Same theme, but instead of coffee its beer and smørrebrød (Danish open sandwiches). A great lunch spot.
Jagger Fast Food
Michelin chefs who made a burger bar to make better burgers than Burger King but in the same price range.
Riga
A small outdoor wine bar only open in the summertime. Owned by the people who also do a stressfully trendy festival on a beach North of CPH, ‘Musik i Lejet.’ located on the square, Litauns Plads, hence the name.
Beat
A big record shop /coffee shop
Bevi Bevi/Osteria 16/Mercato
The italian trio on vesterbro. Bevi Bevi is a nice ‘enoteca’, that is ‘pub for wine’ at good prices. They also have nice apertivo dishes to share. Located on the same street as Riesen bar (yes, on the street with the long impossible name). Osteria 16 is a small and cosy anti pasti place with a cheap fixed menu decided on the day. Located on Haderslevgade 16. Mercato is an italian grocery shop on Enghave Plads with fresh organic produce and italian specialities flown in from the famous Ortomercato market in Milan.
Spagettherria (owned by the same guys as Osteria and mercato)
Cantina with a fixed menu and open until 2. Turns into quite the party at night. Be careful not to trip over all the woodwood jackets and Soulland hoodies.
Mangia
‘OMG!’, said the guy from Napoli! Owned by the guys from Bevi Bevi -best new Italian place in town. Also turns into a party until 2 — be there on a Friday. Don’t drink Aperol Spritz. Its not 2015. Go for the negroni and pretend all is ‘bene!’
Tove Hallerne
Is not its name, but something the locals call it. The name is Westmarket, and is a cheap and not-as-good copy of Torve Hallerne. It got its name ‘Tove hallerne’ by the locals because the location used to be a bankrupt mall called Toves Galleri named after a famous Vesterbro author, Tove Ditlevsen.
Absalon
An old church that has been altered into a culture house by the people behind the Flying Tiger shops. Here you drink cheap coffee, sodas, beers, play Ping-Pong or board games, do yoga. In the evenings they have a folkekøkken-styled restaurant where you sit together with 200 people and share whatever food the chef decided to make. It’s very very cheap and the food is very good. Come early, because the neighbourhood fills it up fast.
Kiin Kiin Bao Bao
The Nørrebro michelin restaurant Kiin Kiins little brother who focus on steamed bao buns.
1+1
Best chinese takeaway in CPH, they focus on street food and not deep fried shit. Located on Enghave Vej
Brød
An awesome bakery located on Enghave Plads from the people behind Kihosk.
Shopping
Motorius
A shop on Enghave Vej that sells cool biker(ish) clothes and spare parts for your motorcycle.
Istedgade and its side streets are always a treat if you’re out shopping: coffee shops, small boutiques and record stores. The hippest store in the northern hemisphere, Kyoto, is a must to check out. Pick out your finest sailor outfit.
The street of Værnedamsvej is also worth snooping into. On weekends it’s the place to go for brunch and people-spotting. Check out the French-style cafe Granola or wine bar Falernum.
Khioskh
The kiosk ‘Khioskh’ is an attraction. It has an insane amount of different types of beers. (Check out the basement). Pick out some fine samples, and sit on the lawn in front. For some reason, you’re not allowed to drink your purchased brew at their benches in-front of the kiosk, so you’re shown to the grass next to the benches like a dog, a brew dog. (Which is okay in the summer, more of a hassle in the winter.) If it’s windy, or, when it’s windy, which it always is, Danes are totally fine with you seeking shelter on their doorstep with your beer, so you can always find a spot in the sun away from the wind.
Kødbyen
The Meat District has numerous places for the modern mammal; gourmands, flaneurs and mixology. If you get there early, check out the galleries and have Copenhagen’s best pizza at Mother.
Warpigs bbq and brewery. The flagship of the Mikkeller micro brewery empire
Hija De Sanches, the former sous chef at Noma who now
makes awesome tacos.
Mesteren og Lærlingen (Master and Apprentice) is the designated place to try out your latest dance moves.
Partying until 5–6: Jolene’s and Bakken ( just becareful of pickpockets at the last place! But always some Italian exchange students to pick up, so you win some and lose some.)
Enghave Parken
The only park in Vesterbro, similar to English private inner city garden squares, but open for everybody.
Torvehallerne — The food court. Two buildings, stroll through the first one with coffee from Coffee Collective and collect tasters from Denmark’s finest marzipan and chocolate brands, Anthon Berg and Summerbird. Eat healthy salads and amazing cakes. Head over to the second building for some sushi or tapas, or get fresh meat, fish, seafood, lobsters and vegetables to cook at home. Also, make sure to get some fine Danish cherry wine.
Slurp
But of course Copenhagen has its own superb Ramen joint, startet by a former sou(p)-chef at restaurant Noma. (Every food entrepreneur in this city has started their career at this holy shrine.) Now in his early 20’s we wonder at what age they start child labouring at this celebrated restaurant. Slurp means slurp, and that’s what’s what you supposedly do while eating ramen, according to Ramen-connoisseurs, which this little joint has plenty of. And they’ll tell you. Yes it’s a small place, and has no toilet. If you have to, they’ll direct you two blocks up the street to Torvhallerne Food Court’s underground public toilet.
Wood Wood Museum — outlet for the überhip Danish clothing brand Wood Wood. Sometimes you’ll get good deals here.
Kalaset — Swedish cafe & bistro at the corner of Vendersgade and Nansensgade. A place for brunch.
Mikropolis, good cocktails and local beer on tap.
Funch Vinstue — (in)famous bodega. Closes late, or early, depending on your circadian rhythm.
Møllegade
Møllegade is Copenhagen’s ‘book street’. Do some intellectual window-shopping at Møllegade Boghandel or at Ark books, they’ve great selections and the staff gives excellent advice. Support these non-profit volunteer-run bookstores by investing in a book or two. LiteraturHaus, the city’s own literature house of culture offers exhibitions, debates, art talks, film screenings, workshops, seminars, reads, concerts and performances. Bring your new books to the café [superkaffeforsyningen] (with brackets) for coffee. They also serve breakfast and lunch all day, and have outdoor seating.
kartoffelrækkerne
Danes loves potatoes, so it can’t come as a big surprise they’ve named a neighbourhood built on a former potato field, the Potato Rows, which in the prosaic English language doesn’t give justice to its amazing, impenetrable, portmanteau name, k.a.r.t.o.f.f.e.l.r.æ.k.k.e.r.n.e. Just like when tasting grandma’s potato pie, these sweet lakeside houses, surrounded by scenic parks and lakes, and only a short walk from the city centre, makes a quick and mindful shift from hip urban tension to lazy rustic life. Yummy!
Aamanns Deli
Modern take on the Danish open sandwich, smørrebrød, the eatery and deli is situated between Søerne Lake and the Botaincal Garden. Perfect for quick lunch and a stroll.
Blågardsgade
Plenty of cosy bars to hide out in the street of Blågardsgade. Most of this street is pedestrian, so in the summer the café tables are all over. Very continental indeed. Kate’s Joint has good and reasonable dinners, their menu depends on the chef; Indian, Arabic, Malaysian, African. They also have a wide selection of vegetarian and vegan options. Cafe N in Blågårdsgade has cheap but decent vegan and vegetarian food. Kimia, same street, go there on Fridays, it turns into quite the 90’s hiphop-hooray party. No drugs, only joints.
More coffee and booze in the nearby streets of Nørrebrogade and Ravnsborggade. Bevars in Ravnsborggade is a delightful café to sit and work, drink wine, eat antipasto, drink more wine, listen to live jazz, drink more wine. At the corner of Elmegade and Guldbergsgade there’s an eco-soup kitchen and cocktail bar (the cocktails are probably eco too).
On warm summer nights, sit under the trees at one of the bars by Søerne lake. Or rent a Swan-boat, bring loads of rosé and pedal around the lake like a boss. It’s good lunch offers at the cafees by the lake, too.
Props
When at Nørrebro, one has to pop by the Props bar at Blågårdsgade 5, the local den of iniquity and one of the finest establishments in town. Across the street lies Harbo, also a nice bar and café. And on the corner to the square Blågårds Plads you’ll find Blågårds Apotek. Worth checking out is the square St. Hans Torv. Don’t know if any of the cafes at this piazza are any good, but you can always sit on the benches with an ice cream from Paradis is.
Mayhem
A small user operated venue showcasing music of experimental and noisy kind. Located in the outer rim of Nørrebro on the boarder to Østerbro and an semi abandoned lot formerly used by the local government to house the street maintenance machines (we think). The vibe is very similar to the old Ungdomshuset, which was pretty (in)famous at least localy. It’s the venue that gave birth to the new punk wave that spawned Iceage and that gang. Bring cash, because it’s punk.
Diligencen
A good mix of local drunkards and arty people on their way home from vernissages. They served potatochips straight from the bag. Authentic as fuck.
Shopping
This area is a good shopping district. Specifically Elmegade, where there also is an Acne Outlet. (Every Scandinavian city with ambitions has an Acne Outlet). A little further into the barrio of Nørrebro, in the old Hell Angles quarter at Jagerborggade, you’ll find cute small shops to buy clothes, cactus, caramel, shoes, organic hair cuts (whatever that is?) and the restaurants Relæ and Manfred (New Nordic Michelin-sprinkled restaurants). Jægersborggade is also lovely at Christmas, where the shops and stalls sell Eblegløgg (Apple Glühwein) with calvados. Around the corner in Stefansgade you’ll find Denmark’s most famous micro-hipster-brewery Mikkeller. It’s bar is not super cosy, but the beer is good, just tell the very competent bartenders what your into and they’ll find you the perfect match.
For arty books, tote bags and pamphlets, check out ARK Independent book store in Møllergade 10, and Møllegades Boghandel in Møllegade 8.
Månefiskeren at Christiania is cordial on Sundays to sit on the benches and chill in the sun. In winter remember to drink Glühwein. At Christmas time there’s a hippie fair next door on weekends.
Christiania Jazzclub
Same entrance as where the Greenlanders sell their spiced up cigarettes, and under the local opera. Jazz sessions on weekends with everything from old rusty heroes to young and aspiring students from the Copenhagen Music academy. It’s a David Lynch’ atmosphere: Hip music fans, elderly couples in their best clothes out on a dance, local Christiania hippies.
Eiffel Bar, local corner bar by the canal. Ask for the Tour Effel. Or don’t.
Copenhagen street food on Papriøen. Obviously best in summer, but a nice walk along the canal and harbour on a good autumn & winter day as well. As the Danes are clever city planners, there’s a new walking bridge connecting the inner city at Nyhavn and Papirøen. Very practical, indeed.
If you’re going to Amager beach park, stop by Ingolfs coffee bar on the way, the only really good place for coffee at Amager. They have really nice brunch and dinner and it’s a very cute little place, like everything else in Copehagen.
Islands brygge
Go for a dip, or jump in the sea (or harbour) followed up with plenty of beers at the pier on a good spring or summers evening. When the sun sets, everybody is here. You’ll make friends. I promise.
Cafe Intime. Yup.
ART:
Check Kopenhagen.dk for openings and exhibits. We’d really recommend their ‘3 picks’ for the week’s best openings. And, there’s always (almost) free beers and wine! Start your Friday night with a few openings, and end up at a bodega for some cheap beers and strange Danish pool. Yes, they have their own form of pool game. W don’t understand the game, but it’s the efficient way to make friends with Danes.
Always check out what’s on at Nikolaj Kunsthall — a former church, now a contemporary art gallery, in the city centre nikolajkunsthal.dk
Louisiana Museum.
One of the world’s most prominent modern art museums. And a great site by the sea in a cute seaside village 30 min train ride north of Copenhagen. The train ride is cute too. (In the kiosk at the Nørreport or Østerport train station one can purchase combo train ticket to Humlebæk village and entrance to the museum).
SMK — National gallery of Denmark. Their permanent exhibition of classical Nordic and European art is always free, and the contemporary exhibitions are often good, though a little pricey. Check out their monthly SMK Fridays for free entrance, performances, dj’s, food trucks and a lot more.
Kunsthal Charlottenborg — One of the biggest and most beautiful exhibition spaces for contemporary art. It’s located in an old Dutch baroque palace, that earlier was a part of the historic Charlottenborg castle. This has been a gallery for contemporary art since 1883. They also have a great bookstore, many events, talks etc. And great parties. Remember to put on your best wig!

If something new is happening in architecture and design today, Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, is one of the leaders in this direction. This Scandinavian country has produced many designers who made a big influence and created an environment for innovation.
The main purpose of my “design trip” was to see the creations of architect Bjark Ingels and his office,Olafur Eliasson bridge, the building of Rem Koolhaas and to attend the 3daysofdesign festival. I always try to see and study the designs that I like in person and share my experience with my students.
Sketch by Tazo Arunashvili
I’ll start with Olafur Eliasson, a Danish artist who started his career in architecture. This bridge is an example of the synthesis of sculpture and design, and Ólafur himself is an example of how a person in the process of self-expression can move from one profession to another (for example, from architecture to art) and be nourished by both.
Sketches and photos by Tazo
“Yes Is More” — Bjarke Ingels with this phrase is a part of the logical chain, which was put in front of us by Miss van der Rohem from Bauhaus with the phrase “Less Is More”. Bjarke impressed me with his productivity, hedonistic vision of sustainability, hard work, innovation in the Danish identity and crazy ideas. It was my second time seeing his works, but to better understand his vision and work I bought his book and went to his office. His company “BIG” unites about 700 designers and architects.
As for the design festival, the main focus of “3Daysofdesign” was the design of household accessories: lamps, furniture, interior decorations, new materials, introducing the principles of sustainable design… In total, about 500 events were held within the festival. Clearly, it was impossible to attend all of them.
Personally, I am very impressed by the continued relevance of perennial design companies at the expense of innovation and quality. In this case, the increase in innovation is “soft”, not sharp, and the cause of it is in caring about the environment with maintaining high quality.
This year’s slogan was impressive — ”Dare to Dream”.
Due to my profession, industrial design and its relative — architecture, which I grew up with, I think that it is a very effective means of self-expression of the country and era, came into the center of my attention.
There is active production of on water offices, the utilization of the surface of the year has been in the plan for a long time. Buildings floating on the surface of the water is one of the old ideas, Bjarke also has some conceptual ideas about it. And in Copenhagen, on a small scale, but they have already started to implement it and sell the entire container (ready-made block). The student works were also interesting, namely the chairs made of a material similar to wine corks. These chairs move and will especially appeal to those who are restless while sitting. Although it looks weak visually, it is designed for 200 kilograms and is actually very durable.
Focusing design on smart devices and green design is relevant. Hardware engineers actively collaborate with designers and create amazing lamps with excellent aesthetics and ease of use.
A very memorable conference was with the Swedish company IKEA and its designers, none of whom were Swedish. Italian, Cypriot, Indian and Argentinian designers combined their own southern vision with Scandinavian principles in synthesis. Today’s world is open, it is not locked in one country and nationality. Innovations are the result of a large intellectual chain.
In the Swedish pavilion, we found a tent furnished with all white IKEA bedroom furniture. We approached this whiteness cautiously, and to our surprise, it was announced this is the conference place, all surrounded with white beds, sheets and carpets, and we could sit/lay and drink coffee on it while listening to speakers.
While we were relaxing on our beds and listening, the following question was asked: “Does the world need another lamp?” — here opinions were divided into two. Consumer world and such unprecedented production the world does not remember, but do we need another one? In my opinion, yes we do. We don’t need another lamp of the same kind, but a different one… This is a leap from 0 to 1. Man is the only creature on earth who is not satisfied with existence and tries to improve it. Therefore, yes, we need another lamp that will be more user centric and at the same time in harmony with ecology.
For Danes, the main thing is the person, not the form, that’s what “user centric design” really is. Here the formalism is outdated and has little connection with the human happiness index (Denmark ranks second after Finland in the happiness index). Each chair, trash can, bottle, building and even lamp is adjusted to human happiness without harming the environment, being aesthetic and it is setting an example for others.

Every city has its unique character, tastes of the food, breath of the wind, peoples faces, streets. Of course, at the moment globalization made a huge step to make different cities close to each other, especially big ones. But a curious traveler still can find and feel the soul of such city like Copenhagen.
The first evening you mostly feel a cold wind, messing up your hair, you are surprised how locals are not frozen to ice and can wear just light sweaters, cycling around on the simple bicycles. Later, looking for a place to eat, you are surprised once more with high prices in every cafe and restaurant, even if the place looks like the simplest kebab take away. Especially this is hard for vegetarians. Ashamed to admit, but the very first evening we ended up buying some vegetables and water in the local supermarket and sitting in the hotel room with a good view. That was actually good.
Looking for a hotel, which can also have a high price, it’s better to look for a location, rather than hotel regalia. Even the simple Cabinn Scandinavia gives you a nice and cozy place to relax after the whole day of walking around. Each morning I feel replenished with energy by staying in such a calm and quiet place. In the morning you can walk around a local pond with a family of swans living in it.
One of the next days, while I was at the conference, my wife found a great place to eat. There is no surprise, that it is an Asian place called Wok On. Usual take away or sit and eat place with different woks, as usual, you can make your work by selecting components. But everything there just makes you finally relax, eat with great pleasure, sit there how much time you want, observing seagulls fighting for the food outside. Even in the center of Copenhagen, the wind is strong enough to carry seagull right over the cafe table in the street. The chef keeps preparing new dishes right in front of you, fastly operating 3 woks. To complete the impression, the waitress will ask you how was the food, and you understand that she means it, the question goes right from the heart.
Of course, there are plenty of other restaurants in the city for any kind of taste, with different cuisines, with Michelin stars. But such a simple kind of place helps you to feel the life around you and just talk with ones who you love. We talked about Andersen museum, located close to city hall. This museum has live illustrations of Andersen fairy tales. Keep your heart and soul open while walking there. You will have a chance to dive into the Andersen world. You will walk by the place where he wrote his tales, pass by a little girl trying to warm up herself with matches, on the other side you will see naked king, seeing his dressed image in a mirror. Sometimes what you see there makes you shivering of fear. It gives you a good impression of how the world of those times looked like. Or should I say, how the world of Andersen’s mind looked like? You to decide.
When I was in the airplane on my way to Copenhagen, I found an article about local street food market, popular here. So the next day after arrival to went there to see and try what’s it like. The market is called Reffen and it works every day. In the mornings it will be almost empty, but later after 12 am more and more people park their bicycles near the market entry. Location is somewhat unexpected from the beginning, it’s part of the port, filled with used steel sea containers, which were re-worked into cafes, food trucks. The majority of cafes there are dedicated to the Mexican cuisine or street barbeque, some Asian places and just one or two places with famous local smorbreads. Smorbread is actually just a piece of bread with something atop of it. But the variety of different options of it, look and tastes surprises you. The other good option to try it — market called Foodhalken, very close to Norreport subway station.
We tried several dishes from food trucks and just sat for hours looking to the sea harbor. Actually, not just this. Reffen is also a place for extreme amusements, like banjo jumping from a crane! Every ten minutes crane lifts up a basket with instructor and jumper. When on the top, the crane will turn jib to keep the basket right above the sea and… loud scream will notify everyone that another thrill seeker felt from the height. One of them actually took a dip and get back with wet hair!
Close to the evening, we visited a workshop held in the local coffee roastery. Here I need to admit the Copenhagen has kind of a good taste to coffee, roasteries, and traditions in it. Man in Reffen Roastery described in tiny details process of the coffee roastery, showed us a machine for it and nicely answered all the questions. I can say that all the time I spent there was filled with love to coffee and this tradition. By the way, I was told that at that very moment bosses of roastery were in South America in the coffee plantation!
I need to say, that it’s not the one single place with a good coffee in this city. Copenhagen has a culture of the coffee roastery and brewery. One of the famous coffee beverages here is coffee Cortado, which might not be so famous in Eastern Europe for instance. More like cappuccino, but with less milk and more passion. Another tasty coffee can be also found in the already mentioned Foodhalken market. This place is not famous among tourists, local people also visit it a lot, we’ve seen several families with kids.
Speaking about locals, sometimes I got a feeling that even with all the European comfort and pleasure of living, life here is not something absolutely easy. Conferences small talks revealed to me high taxes here, especially taxes to buy a new car, which can triple the car price. One person exposed the opinion, that most of the locals use bicycles not because they care about the environment, they simply don’t have another choice.
As a big city, Copenhagen has own kind of nightlife. Or I would say — evening life. A lot of restaurants and coffee places are getting closed around 6–7 pm, except some chain cafes like Espresso House which can prepare a cup of Cortado even at 9pm. And people gather around pubs and bars, which are presented in a big variety of choices here. Walking in the evening streets gives you a view of the younger generation drinking and hanging out. If your choice is to jump into a small cozy basement pub, you might have a chance to observe the performance of an old jazz band with the even older audience sitting around with a beer. The music touches your heart, but still, you notice also a little touch of sadness. Which keeps growing in your mind while you see homeless people and other difficulties of locals who live in the old city with plenty of modern European issues.
Needless to say, a lot of locals are in fact from other countries. That’s pretty common for most parts of Europe nowadays, Denmark is not an exception. I talked to street juice seller, he asked me if I want ice in juice. Of course not, it already cold outside, you practically feel freezing breath of the arctic ocean. He agreed and told me that it’s much colder than in his native Poland.
Having so big diversity turns the city into a very adaptable organism. For instance, we checked several Thai food restaurants and no one had Tom Yum Soup. I asked why in one place, and the answer was — we have it, but the name is different. No one here would understand what is Tom Yum Soup, but most people would try Spicy Lemongrass Soup. Such details make you think more and more about globalization and merging of different culturies into something bigger. I don’t know is it good or bad, it is what it is. But as an outcome, we can find a very beautiful shop with stones, sculptures of Budha, figures of Indian gods and plenty of other stuff from Asia, which wakes up some sleeping inner strength of your soul. When I did a research on the internet for such things in Copenhagen — nothing. The city will lead you to a place which you actually want to find, even if you don’t know yet. The only thing you need to do — relax and try to hear it, to feel it.
There are other places for any kind of choices, which I cannot describe just in a couple of pages, but I will mention a couple of things which took my attention for a bit. There is a pipe shop for those who interesting in traditional smoking. It is more than 50 years old and is run by several generations of a single family. There are several lego shops, which a little bit different from each other. Of course, you will say, any city would have a lego shop. But this city is a place where lego was born, which makes it a good souvenir with a meaning.
Every city is unique, and Copenhagen is not an exception. It gives you feeling of something very historical, but with thoughtful modernization, something very old and battered, but also turning maybe a new page of its life book. They have little space but use it with a perfect sense. A cheap hotel room can be thought out to every little detail and you will feel like at home on a rainy day, warm inside. I think their houses and apartments are even better in this meaning, just visit any fo furniture and home stuff store to see it. No one other country has so nice and so many shops for home comfort. And Denmark also has something called hygge, which to my understanding is a mix of what I told. But I left it to you to find out.

While in Denmark I have decided on only working with one website, my blog site www.johnboyter.com which I can manage completely myself in GoDaddy Website Builder. I will not try to develop another website in WordPress and waste time and money on that. I realized my articles on the platform Medium had to be an extension to my blog and when my blog text is too long for social media, I just post them on my blog site and on Medium and sometimes on my LinkedIn Page/Newsletter “Digital Life Tales”. And I link the articles to Medium on my personal social media with a “Twitter size text” as an intro.
My first goal was to do something I could work on from anywhere and I could bring my content creation business with me just with my laptop, laptop bag and iPhone. Next goal is harder, which is to make some money from it. Affiliate marketing and finishing an ebook and generating income from that is certainly a long game and hard work. I am writing now in the Medium Partner Program and they paid me some money the other day. It wasn’t much. I am not a member yet of the Medium platform. I am trying to bootstrap it so I am paid by Medium and then I can pay them to be a member. Trying to limit the tools/apps I pay for monthly.
Over a year ago, while I was staying for three months during the pandemic in Aarhus, Denmark, I went for two nights to Copenhagen. I stayed at the Marriott Copenhagen and while there met with four old friends separately, all for coffee, walk and talk. There was a lockdown in Denmark at the time and all restaurants, bars and cafes were closed. Now staying at The Moxy Hotel, which is also part of the Marriott group. Here in Copenhagen, meeting with some friends from the arts world hoping to get into writing fiction on the platform Patreon. It’s totally different from blog writing and I’m not sure I will be able to switch back and forth between the two.

“The most satisfying and most basic art experience is looking — pure, unmediated observation and sensation.” — Roy Thurston
After nearly a decade, I am home for more than a few weeks at a time. Not permanently, but long enough to appreciate the effortless calmness found within the city. Per my tradition, I embark on daily walks through Copenhagen. And while the city changes tremendously by each time I visit, the sense of familiarity doesn’t.
To my luck, it is cherry blossom season, and I make sure to stop by H.C. Andersen’s tombstone at Assistens Kirkegård. Getting coffee along the harbor of Christianshavn and catching up with friends at the Red Square never fails to please me. The Hermitage hunting lodge, Skovtårnet, and Roskilde Cathedral are brief trips from downtown, yet far enough to experience the countryside. From the outdoor rooftop gym in the new neighborhood of Nordhavn to the completely unrecognizable Carlsberg byen. The list goes on. In short, this city is designed around public spaces, and it continues to be a city for its people. For the locals, for the visitors, and for those who stroll the streets in hopes of making sense of the beautiful capital that lay in front of us.
All images were made with a Fuji X-Pro2 camera, with either an adapted Voigtlander Nokton 35mm f/1.4, a native 18mm f/2, and/or a 56mm f/1.2 lens. Brief edits were made using homemade presets in Lightroom.

Wrapping up our Scandinavian tour (Norway, Sweden & now Denmark!) we continued to think the weather would be cool. I mean, we are so north that summer must be chill and enjoyable but boy were we wrong.
At the furthest point North we’ve been (in Tromsø) the weather was on average 32 degrees each day… I mean people would always go and swim in the arctic circle during the summer months but with this kind of heat, it is actually way more enjoyable!
Sweden was suffering from major forest fires out of the main cities while we were there as they haven’t had rain in weeks. Now in Denmark, the heat followed with a bit more intensity with 35–37 degree days as we were walking about.
Because of this, most of our touring happened later in the afternoon which was great as the sun doesn’t set until 10pm/11pm anyways. But also made drinking some great craft beer that much more enjoyable!
Mikkeller Brewery is one of Olivier’s favs and they are from Denmark. They have over 14 locations in the city and we enjoyed many afternoons on the patios or in the air conditioned space drinking a great IPAs and sour ales.
But the heat was probably the worst during our transit from Stockholm to Copenhagen. The air conditioning on the train was broken and with all those people sitting on the train.. with no air circulation… made it a very long ride. Kind of reminded us of that train ride we took in Morocco through the desert.
After a week in Copenhagen, some highlights could be the bikes, the buildings and enjoying all the Hygge — “ Hygge is as Danish as æbleskiver and it goes far in illuminating the Danish soul. In essence, hygge means creating a warm atmosphere and enjoying the good things in life with good people. The warm glow of candlelight is hygge. Cosying up with a loved one for a movie — that’s hygge, too. And there’s nothing more hygge than sitting around with friends and family, discussing the big and small things in life. Perhaps hygge explains why the Danes are some of the happiest people in the world.”
So in short… we spoiled ourselves with amazing food markets, great company and great scenery.
See more on our website www.alittledetour.ca🌏✈️👫
LEGO is kind of like IKEA in the sense that they own this place.. you can go on a LEGOLAND tour, and HQ Lego tour that lasts 2 days and you stay at the LEGOHOTEL — all for the small fee of $3,000!
“Freetown Christiania, also known as Christiania, is an intentional community and commune of about 850 to 1,000 residents, covering 84 acres in the borough of Christianshavn in Copenhagen.
Christiania has been a source of controversy since its creation in a squatted military area in 1971. Its cannabis trade was tolerated by authorities until 2004. Since then, relations between Christiania and Danish authorities have been strained. As of 2018 cannabis trade is on going and the danish police officers are in place and do not allow the use or trade of other drugs like cocaine and heroin.” — Wikipedia
That place was wicked. It’s a community that is separate from the Danish society, operates by their own rules. It’s the hippy social experiment pushed to it’s full extent. Walking around, and seeing the houses that people have built for themselves on this beautiful patch of land was super interesting. And as you can imagine, you get to meet quite a few colourful characters walking around this place!
When we left Denmark, we ran in to a few random obstacles. First off, the website wouldn’t let us reserve our ticket, so we had to go to the ticket office. The clerk accidentally booked our tickets for the wrong date, so we didn’t have assigned seats on the 6 hour train.
The train’s air conditioning was broken, Maeghan’s fan broke, and we had to jump from seat to seat as reserved passengers took priority of their spot.
Then we got to the water where Denmark and Germany meet… and our train.. boarded a ferry….. like it detached two carts, and drove onto the boat… we rode on a cruise for 45 min… and then drove off the boat… and were in Germany.
So now, we’re heading to Berlin!

I’m debating how much information to share about the genesis of this poem, as I want whoever is reading it to create their own truth and relate to it in their own way. So I’ll just say this: it was written following a powerful experience at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Humlabæk, Denmark.

It was 2018. Summer came and went. It was hot that year, although if I am honest, each year feels like it’s getting hotter and hotter. Our family didn’t have any concrete plans for traveling that year, but we knew we wanted a much-needed vacation.
I had this crazy idea of spending Halloween outside of the U.S. I love Halloween, and it’s not just about the scary stories, music, food, or ‘trick or treats’ escapades around the neighborhood. It’s about the change in colors and how I can smell autumn and the cool air somehow.
I knew spending Halloween outside of the U.S. wouldn’t be the same, and I didn’t want to deprive my then 5-year-old daughter (and me too, for that matter) of a good-old Halloween celebration. So we went to Copenhagen.
Our family spent our first day in Copenhagen at the Tivoli Gardens to celebrate Halloween. We decided to spring for the unlimited-ride tickets and eased our way into Tivoli slowly. We didn’t want to miss anything. There were pumpkins…

NOTE: This is an old post, that I never fully finished and that was never posted until now as some friends have asked for recommendations about Copenhagen and this was the simplest way. There is missing a day or two in Copenhagen and all of Æreøskobing, but it was my first travel blog attempt, and took me way longer than expected to get through the entire trip.
This last week I had the opportunity to travel to Denmark during the school holiday. And after submitting 12 assignments in just over a month, let me tell you, it was a much-needed and well-deserved escape from school.
I had exactly a week to travel in Denmark. I slept a total of 5 nights in Copenhagen and 2 in Æreøskobing. Although I didn’t only stay in Copenhagen when I was sleeping in Copenhagen. Here is what I did each day, with some fun facts I learned along the way.
Day 1 — Copenhagen
On this first day, I decided to explore the city of Copenhagen and all it had to offer. Because of my hectic school schedule and arriving in Denmark at 11 pm the night before, I took the morning very relaxed. I started with a chocolate brunch at the Peter Beier Chocolatier. I also took this opportunity to plan out my next few days in the Copenhagen region. I decided to buy the Copenhagen card which allowed me to get into many of the city’s attractions (and the attractions about an hour train ride out of the city) and go on any public transit and train for the 72h my card was valid. I, therefore, wanted to make the most of my money, so I carefully planned out my days. This was difficult because I was traveling in the offseason and so many of the attractions opened late and closed early.
I then went on to visit the National Museum of Denmark. It was a highly recommended museum and so I went to check it out. It was mostly a history museum starting in the pre-history era up to the modern-day. It was very interesting. One thing that fascinates me so much, especially in prehistoric times is that archeologists/scientists/historians/whoever works on this stuff are able to discover the things they do. First of all, the fact that they are digging in a place they think that maybe they can find something and then amongst the dirt they fin a piece of wood or whatever and then they know that it is part of a house dating back thousands of years! And then, when they analyze their discoveries they are able to make assumptions about the way people and animals lived. Let's take the skeleton of this animal (see picture). It went extinct in the 1600s but this specific one dates back to 8600BC. As you can see almost the complete skeleton was found. But not only that, the archeologists were able to determine that it dies running away from hunters into a river where it drowned. They also know, by the scarring on the bones, that before it does in the water, it was wounded by the arrows of the hunters… Like wow, just wow.
Other examples are archeologists being able to determine that a tumor on a women’s femur was not malignant and was not the cause of death or in another case, they were able to determine the last meal of a woman that died hundreds of years ago by analyzing the contents of her stomach. I’m just fascinated by what they are able to discover.
The exhibits in the museum were: Danish Prehistory, Peoples of the Earth, Danish Middle Ages and Renaissance, Join the Vikings, Ethnographical Treasures, Toys, Stories of Denmark 1660–2000, and Classical Egyptian and Near Eastern Antiquities. I was there for 3 hours and I did maybe 75% of the museum.
Next, I went on a canal tour of the city. This was probably one of the highlights of my time in Denmark. This was a one-hour guided tour of the city on the canal. The boat was very low to allow it to pass under all the tiny bridges. Some of the bridges were so low and narrow, that the boat barely fit through! We saw the old trade center and Danish stock exchange which was built to strengthen Denmark’s financial standing within Northern Europe. It has a spire that is shaped like 4 dragons’ tails twisted together. When it was built in the early 17th century by King Christian IV, they believed the dragons would protect the building from fires. And actually, through the many fires that have ravished Copenhagen through the centuries, this building has always survived…
We went through Nyhavn, the famous old ports of Copenhagen (but I’ll talk more about that later), and saw the mermaid statue which has become the emblem of Copenhagen and therefore has been decapitated twice and lost an arm but has always been fixed quickly. We then saw the Danish Naval base from afar where I learned that the Danish Navy is the oldest navy in the world, older even than the British navy. We went under countless bridges like the marble bridge that contains no marble, the circle bridge, and the famous bike bridge on which 18000 cyclists cross every day. We passed by many castles (Christianborg Castle, Rosenborg Castle, Amalienborg Palace, …) and other interesting buildings in Copenhagen (like the Danish museum of architecture designed by a Dutch architect, hahaha).
After the canal tour, I went to the Round Tower. This is a tower with a spiral ramp that allows visitors to see the city from 34.8m above the street level. Starting in 1637, it took 5 years of consecutive days of bricklaying(7 days a week) for this tower to be completed. Its original purpose was to accommodate an Observatory, the University Library, and the Trinity Church. This tower was built under the rule of King Christian IV and the observatory is still used to this day during the winter months. The tower actually has a hollow core and there is a plane of glass at 25m above ground where we can stand and look down below. This core was actually Denmark’s geographical zero point that was used to make the first accurate map in the 1760s. Near the top of the tower, there is a planetarium. It shows the current position of the planets with respect to the sun in the middle. Each planet can move so it is always showing the proper positioning of the planets on any given day.
And that is all the tourism I did on my first day. I think I am becoming more and more like my dad because I had to schedule a business meeting during my vacation so that is how I spent my evening. Fritid? Hva er det? (Free time? What is that?)
Day 2 — Castles!
On my second day in Denmark, I left Copenhagen bright and early to hop on a 40 minute train ride to Hillerød to get to Frederiksborg castle as soon as it opened. This castle was built for King Christian IV in 1620 and a lot of it had to be reconstructed in 1859 after a fire. In 1878, the castle was converted to the Museum of National History recounting the history of Denmark from 1500 to now.
One of the rooms had paintings in each corner of the ceiling. Each painting had a woman and representing one of the 4 corners of the world. Europe is the woman with the crown holding the church, Asia is the woman wearing a turban, America is the red indian woman, and Africa is the black woman with a tiger.
I then hopped on another train to the town of Helsingør to see Kronborg castle. There has been a castle overlooking the sound since the 1400s. It started with a simple fortification when Helsingør was considered the center of Denmark (at one point, Denmark had all of Norway, the south of Sweden and the North of Germany). The king at the time built a fortification at the entrance of the sound and imposed a tax that guaranteed safe passage to anyone wanting to bring merchandise to the rest of Europe. The tax was equivalent to 2000 euros today! If the ships tried to avoid it and go through another entrance near Sweden, they would be shot by canons because there was another fortification there that was under Danish rule as well. Once the tax was paid they could enter the sound and were protected from the pirates.
Then, in 1574 King Frederik II moved in and renovated the fortification into a beautiful castle for his wife, including a 62m long ballroom. This castle would host amazingly big parties. King Frederik II often invited or hired British actors and playmakers to these parties. These actors then went back home and talked about the castle with a young actor and playwright called Shakespear. He therefore based the Hamlet play in the Kronborg castle despite never having ever been himself!
In the basement of the castle, there is a statue of Denmark’s national hero, Holger the Dane. He is asleep and legend says that if Denmark were to be threatened he will wake up and grab his sword to protect the country.
This castle is has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage List since 2000 due to the rich history and the role it played in Danish and Swedish history. It is also a beautiful place to be, where you can see across the sound to Sweden.
Needing to transit to the neighboring cities took a lot of my time and it is therefore all I managed to do that day. I was hoping to make it to the Danish Museum of Science and Technology but such a big leap in time is not possible yet (joking aside, I wouldn’t have had time to make it to the museum and enjoy it before it closed). Before heading back to Copenhagen for the evening I walked around the town and sat down for a hot chocolate and a muffin on this very very windy day.
I then spent the evening in my hostel enjoying the vibe. There were 3 bars, a cinema, and an indoor soccer/handball gym where lots of people were having a good time so I joined the fun.
Day 3 — Roskilde and Copenhagen
Day 3 was a very busy day. I started the day off with Christianborg Castle. Christianborg is actually where a lot of the government functions still take place to this day. The prime minister of Denmark’s office is in that castle and a lot of the important meetings with other heads of state take place in that castle. I started the visit off with a tour of the ruins. The castle that stands today is actually the third castle that was built on the very spot. The previous 2 had burnt down due to an overheated fireplace. It is in one of the 2 first castles that the Great Wedding took place. This wedding was for the son of the king at the time. It lasted 3 months and cost hundreds of millions and is still to this day Denmark’s most expensive event. The king wanted a huge event to restore Denmark’s image after the wars but because of this war Denmark was already in great financial difficulty, so maybe it wasn’t the best idea to be throwing money away at a wedding.
An interesting fact about the castle as it stands today is that although it is still used, royalty never actually lived in it. It was started in 1907 and finished in 1928 and when it was finished the King and Queen decided they preferred staying at the Amalienborg Palace instead (which I visited on Day 4).
Of all the castles and palaces I have visited on my trip, this was by far the prettiest and most impressive. I did have to miss one castle sadly so I can’t speak for that one, but what was probably the most interesting thing about this castle is that it was still being used. In the Queen’s library the prime minister met with Obama, in the ballroom, events are held almost every year. You could really feel the royalty and the fanciness without it being old royalty.
After visiting the castle in Copenhagen, I took a 40-minute train to Roskilde to see the Viking Museum and the Roskilde Cathedral.
In the Viking Ship Museum, there was the reconstruction of the 5 ships that were found in the fjord. It is thought that the ships were purposefully sunk in as a way to barricade the entrance to the fjord and slow down any possible intruders. When they were found, that passage was drained so that all the remains could be uncovered and the boats reconstructed to the best of their abilities.
By studying the shapes of the ships it was determined that one of the ships was a warship and one was a merchandise ship. Another was probably a fishing boat and one a long ocean expedition boat. The last boat was the longest measuring 30m, and was probably the leading ship whenever they went on shorter expeditions because it was a sign of pride and power to have such a long ship. The type of wood the ships were made of indicates where they are from. If it were made of pine it was made in Norway whereas if it were made of oak it was from Denmark.
After the Viking Ship Museum, I continued onto the Roskilde Cathedral. This cathedral was very big and beautiful. It also is the cathedral where the tombs of many of the past kings are found. These tombs are laid out in many different rooms of the church. Some have elaborate statues and others are more simple.
Another really cool feature of the church is the clock. You can see it ring 4pm in the video. Every hour, Saint George kills the dragon which lets out a wail. Every quarter, Kirsten Kimer chimes her little bell. And Peter Døver strikes the hours.

After the cathedral, I walked around the lovely town of Roskilde before heading back to Copenhagen to continue my day.
The next stop was to yet another church, the Our Saviour’s Church. But this time, it was to climb the tower/spire all the way to the top. This spire was designed with the final hundred or so steps on the outside that get progressively narrower all the way to the top. The view was amazing but it was so high. If you look at the pictures, you’ll notice 2 things in particular. One, that the houses look like little replicas or models of the city and two that my face in the selfie displays absolute terror. At the top, when the wind would pick up the whole tower was shaking! I was terrified to drop my phone and just uncomfortable being at the complete top for too long. It was 90m high and required 400 steps to get there. This tower is also known as the Heavenly Ladder and was built in 1752.
My final activity of the day was the Tivoli Gardens. I don’t normally go to amusement parks when visiting a new country because there aren’t many things to learn or cultural benefits to going on rides, but every guidebook and recommendation I found said that I couldn’t go to Copenhagen without going to Tivoli. And when I entered I realized that this place was much more than just rides. There were replicas of famous buildings from around the world, and different areas to just take in all the things packed in this amusement park. It was first opened in 1843 and is the home of one of the oldest operational roller coasters. It is also Denmark’s most visited attraction. I therefore had no choice but to check it out. It was beautiful at night with all the lights lit up! I also couldn’t help myself and did do a ride (they were separate costs from the entrance, sort of like a fair where you pay per ride).
After nearly 30000 steps, two cities, and over 12 hours out and about, I was exhausted. I made it back to my hostel but couldn’t make it up to my room, so I took my free beer, and collapsed on the couch in the common area for a while before heading off to bed after a wonderful and very long day
It may have been my 26th country, Denmark was my first solo trip. Don’t get me wrong, I moved to Norway for school and worked in China alone but I always had a purpose other than tourism for making it to those places. This was the first time that I was a tourist exploring a new country on my own. So what did I learn?

More than a Club: From Camp Nou to Copenhagen.,https://jacobnaish.medium.com/more-than-a-club-from-camp-nou-to-copenhagen-4a099eaba02?source=user_profile---------12----------------------------,"Sign up

Well, almost. Its not quite Camp Nou to Copenhagen. We are almost Copenhagen: We’re the last stop on the S-Train out in Farum, the home of Right to Dream Park.
And, the ‘Més que un Club’ of FC Barcelona is not quite the ‘More than a Club’ of our own FC Nordsjælland. Or rather, our More than a Club is not quite theirs. Barca’s is a product of history that has produced an icon, which can’t be explained just by saying its a type of football organisation. The team that call Camp Nou home have strategically innovated to create a type of football experience that is a rite of passage for most football fans. They feel like they are more than a club to those of us that watch them. Its a ‘culture’.
Danish football on the other hand, is trying to find its own renewed culture right now. History is often seen as a necessary pre-requisite for credibility in footballing societies. Old clubs, old leagues. Heritage. Denmark has a little of that, but is invested now in trying to wriggle free from a slumber without the benefit of a long track record of success (either commercially or on the pitch, with some notable exceptions of course).
In all examples, we who are within the leadership of Danish clubs can do better if we want to beat the situation we find ourselves in. There are some fruits which hang extremely low in this regard. Our taking of them is a question of priority.
One of the first things you notice here when arriving from the British football culture (as I have, spending 15 years in two clubs there), is the difference in standards of service available to fans. Customer service appears to be less of a priority to the Danish market, and it seems to me to have become a self-fulfilling prophecy whereby no one expects it, so no one provides it, and therefore no one gets it, and thus again: no one expects it. There are variations for sure, but broadly if you’re coming here as a visitor and you’re used to the standards of customer service in New York or London, then Copenhagen will dissapoint. Just check out the comments in this Facebook group for expats here to see what I mean.
But when you talk to Danish people here, they broadly seem to agree that standards are improving in the service industries all the time. The recent emergence of companies like Joe and the Juice are changing the market. In Tony Robbins speak, they’ve strategically innovated, mainly just by recognising they are in the experience, not the smoothie business. By being first movers in improving the experience of customers, they create a need for a quality that others will try to emulate, and soon those that don’t catch-up, won’t survive. Just as has happened over the last 20 years in London.
That’s why, after in-depth research, mystery shopping, and staff and fan consultation, we launched ‘More than a Club’ at FC Nordsjælland: a 360 degree, 10/10 improvement in the way our people provide match-day experiences for our fans. 150 match day staff went through 2 hour interactive workshops. The incentive structure changed, and our Mission, Vision and Values were re-emphasised through story-telling, and role play.
Crucially, we started thinking about the experience we provide on a match-day from the fan’s perspective. We created user journeys — stories which we wrote in the first person as if we were fans — that encapsulated what it is to have a best in class experience entering the stadium, buying a soda, or meeting a player. With full buy-in from the Superliga team, our Head Coach, our chairman, and every member of senior leadership at the club, we are gradually changing the experience from 6/10 to 10/10, every time.
And it’s people-led. Our people make it happen and bring it to life. Given that we only lease our tenancy at Right to Dream Park, the improvements we can make to the physical space are limited. So we focus entirely on the men, women and young people that make the match experience happen: how they treat fans, how they treat each other, and how we make it more than a match (and by extension, ‘more than a club’).
We immediately saw marked improvements in the standards of customer service. Now its up to us all to be the change we want to see in our football stadium. By us doing this, we hope to change the market: to strategically innovate to provide a standard of service that the market will soon see as a necessity, rather than a ‘nice to have’.
We’ve learned here that other football clubs are not our competitors in the experience market. Instead, we are competing with Tivoli Gardens, with sailing, and with Legoland.
I’ll be blogging on the changes we are making here, and our aspirations and goals, and how we set about achieving them over the next few years.
Please post comments with your experiences, questions about what we are up to, or if you have any insight you think we can draw from.

This last few weeks in Copenhagen have been amazing for many reasons. The summer was hot and sunny, which is not common in Denmark, and I had a chance to really embrace hygge, the Danish coziness philosophy. But most of all, I was immersed at the culture of one of Europe's most relevant business schools, Copenhagen Business School. Students from all around the world go there for their summer program and I was very fortunate to be one of them.
Denmark is a well stablished trade society. The Danes don't have much land of their own, so they had to excel at doing business with other countries. If you want to have an idea of how important studying business is for them, bare in mind that Denmark has only 8 Universities and CBS is the only one dedicated exclusively to this line of study. And more than 20,000 students go there. For a 5,7 million inhabitants country, that's a lot of students. Despite being a very competitive field, business in seen by the Danes as a promising career path for youngsters.
The course I was taking there is called The Psychology of Decision Making — We Are Not Irrational, Are We? Yes, the names of the courses at CBS can be very long and creative. As the title says, one of the things that we learned is that yeah, we are not really rational. But we are not irrational either. We are actually quasi-rational, which means that we lack total rationality in making decisions, but there are still a logic behind the psychological processes behind it.
In life and in business, we are often faced with situations full of contradiction, inconsistency and ambiguity. Those problems can't be dealt with by traditional decision making strategies, that involve a previews search for information and a posterior action. That happens because ambiguous situations are too dynamic, and by the time the decision maker feels ready to act, the scenario is already completely different from when they started thinking about the solution. Instead, chaotic situations call for creative, innovative solutions. In fact, it is in high ambiguity contexts that the creative individual and firm will flourish.
The way to tackle this types of problems is by acting first, and searching for feedback from the system later. To do that, one has to embrace uncertainty, and learn how to deal with risk. There's a chance things might go wrong, but if you and your firm are ready to act quickly, it might be better to take the risk than to let your problems escalate.
I'’l be posting more about CBS, Decision Making, and Denmark. I am also preparing some live content to be presented to you, and a Portuguese version of this text will soon be up. I hope you enjoy it and that we can start a conversation on these topics. So please feel free to comment :)

I got off the Nicolas Winding Refn train at station Only God Forgives in 2013 because I wasn’t interested in the pseudo-intellectual circle jerk the Danish auteur tried to pass off as highbrow entertainment. As I sparingly followed his career afterward, I felt more and more assured about my decision. Don’t get me wrong, when I discovered Refn’s work in the late aughts, I was so fascinated by his distinctive storytelling style that I chose his filmography (up to Drive) as the subject of my dissertation. There was a time when the Neon World Rockstar™ actually told intriguing stories about ultraviolent people. Through his neon and blood-soaked visuals, he gave viewers food for thought instead of soulless protagonists whose biggest skill was staring into nothing with dead eyes.  His latest TV series on Netflix, Copenhagen Cowboy, drew me in because it was the first time (since 2005) Refn decided to return to his native roots he abandoned after gaining entry into Hollywood. To this day, his best work remains his rawest: The Pusher trilogy. Back then, he didn’t have the budget to mess around and had to get creative to hook viewers with minimalistic style and realistic characters entrapped in their toxic and dysfunctional…
