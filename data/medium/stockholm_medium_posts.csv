Deep down below the surface, the Swedish capital Stockholm offers up a cultural attraction that is truly unique. It’s known as the longest art gallery in the world and boasts 110 km of art across nearly 100 metro stations spread across the city.
Stockholm is built on an archipelago, with over fifty islands crisscrossed by bridges and waterways. The islands themselves are granite and gneiss, which often poke their forested heads out of the water showing their dark, shining cliff faces.
So when the city’s subterranean metro system was built in the second half of the 20th century, it necessitated the creation of stations deep underground with dark, cavernous walls — the so-called ‘cave stations’.
On a cold Friday evening at the end of a busy week of work travel, I found myself with a few hours to kill in the Swedish capital. So, armed with a digital guide and a sense of eager anticipation, I plotted a course through several metro stations on the Blue Line.
I’d been promised that each station’s art and theming was unique. I was told that every station is someone’s favourite station. What I found was that each station’s art usually relates to…

I visited the Swedish capital on the 23rd of May 2025, the weekend before my 37th birthday, and this piece was scheduled for the 1st of June 2025. However, due to some back-to-back travelling and personal drama (a dramatic choice of words), I decided not to interrupt your popcorn-munching while watching the third and messiest divorce of the leader of the free world. I know there are other things worth your attention now, like WW3, but bear with me; I will be brief.
I landed at Stockholm Arlanda Airport at around 23:00, after an uneventful 2-hour and 20-minute flight. From the airport, the easiest way to get to Stockholm is by train; the yellow Arlanda Express takes you to Stockholm C (the central station) in 18 minutes and runs around the clock. It is promoted all over the airport (big, yellow banners) as the fastest and most environmentally friendly way to get to Stockholm (truthful advertising). One adult ticket costs 340 SEK (around 32 EUR).
I arrived at Stockholm C at 23:30. After a 25-minute search for the metro (it’s not the city, it’s me) and a four-minute metro ride, I arrived at Gamla Stan, the medieval centre of Stockholm, where the boat-hotel where we were lodging was. This adventure would’ve been a ten-minute walk, and I don’t want to talk about it anymore.
On Saturday morning, we went for a walking tour of the city. My friend chose a local, born and bred Stockholmer as a guide. Agnes is friendly, a good storyteller, and obviously very passionate about her city. We walked past the Swedish Parliament, the square where Greta Thunberg was holding her ‘Fridays for Future’ protests, the Stockholm City Hall, where each year, on the 10th of December, the Nobel Prize banquet takes place with or without Bob Dylan, the Nobel Museum, the Stockholm Cathedral, and the red building that allegedly inspired all those bucolic Swedish red cabins with white trims. What I learned: the Swedes are very straightforward, almost on the nose when it comes to names (if something sounds as-if… it probably is), Sweden has nearly 10,000 lakes (I googled the number afterwards; I just remembered it was astronomical), it is the European country that has been the longest at peace — including Switzerland, not being involved in a major conflict for over 200 years, and that between the 19th and the 20th century, financial hardship and lack of religious freedom generated mass migration, with 1,3 millions Swedes leaving the country and settling in the Midwest of the United States, especially Minnesota (same climate, loads of lakes). The newly formed communities kept their traditions, hence giving us the Golden Girls’ Rose Nylund and Fargo. Thank you, Sweden! The guide explained the already legendary governmental liquor stores and the Swedes’ relationship (and bumpy history) with alcohol. The information was received without much surprise, but ‘free will’ was mentioned.
This list is not exhaustive — if you are curious for more, go see Agnes.
After the tour and a stroll through Södermalm (the ‘Hipsters Island’) we had some fabulous coffee (it is actually very difficult to find a lousy brew) with a cardamom bun (a close cousin of the more famous cinnamon bun), and we headed to the Nationalmuseum for some fine arts.
The gallery hosts a well-curated collection of Swedish and international art in their permanent collection, following a 500-year timeline. As my friend noticed, for a national gallery, it shows an impressive number of non-Swedish artists alongside national household names like Carl Larsson and the contemporary Ernst Billgren. While strictly speaking, only the former qualifies — in Sweden and abroad — as a household name, Ernst Billgren has been a fantastic discovery. A well-known figure in the Swedish contemporary art scene, Billgren is a born-and-based Stockholm artist. He rose to national fame in the 1980s. His works are currently exhibited at the museum in a solo exposition titled New Memories. From the 10th of April to the 28th of September 2025, the gallery shows Billgren’s 25 re-interpretations of classical paintings in the Nationalmuseum’s collection. The exhibition has a marine feeling to it, with the sea and ships being recurrent themes, and I am a sucker for anything that involves the sea. Plus, I find an image of a boat sailing in the interior of a Gothic Cathedral irresistibly attractive. Nevertheless (but clearly in the same registry), my favourite painting in the collection was Eugene Jansson’s Riddarfjärden, Stockholm, 1898, showing a night cityscape from across a body of water. It captures perfectly the mesmerising light of the Scandinavian summer nights.
Caveat: the museum closes at 17:00 on Saturdays, so plan ahead carefully. We did not, so 17:30 found us on the sidewalk, buying a Swedish newspaper (me) and tickets for a public transportation boat to an unknown island. If you do not like to plan ahead, don’t fret; the boat ride was great. However, you might want to ask questions and decide beforehand on which island to get off. If you wing it as it comes, you will end up hearing, ‘Go back; this is a private island, and you will freeze to death’ (very direct and practical people, I am telling you).
As I did not freeze to death and lived to see the mesmerising light of my second Swedish night, I had dinner at Blå dörren (‘the blue door’), a resto-pub in Södermalm, and the only place where the literary what-you-hear-is-what-you-get of the Swedes disappointed. Due to city regulations — the menu explains — the place does not have a blue door. What it does have is excellent elk meatballs, Swedish beer and Smördegsknyte — a pastry filled with salty cheese, covered in apricot sauce and paisley. The music is straight out of the Helsinki Playlist (Rod Stewart still does not want to talk about it).
Sunday morning, after another excellent coffee, we headed to what’s probably Stockholm’s most famous tourist attraction, the Vasa Museum (that huge, heavily adorned wooden boat that you keep seeing in your Instagram feed). The ship draws her moniker from an ample carving of the coat of arms of the House of Vasa (below), the royal dynasty that ruled Sweden from 1523 to 1654 and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from 1587 to 1668. Built in the 17th century to fight in the Polish-Lithuanian war, the Swedish warship sank on her maiden journey on the 10th of August 1628, after sailing for about 1,300 meters. History notes that what destabilised it was a gust of wind, as the ship was too tall. The Vasa was built to instil fear and respect in the enemies, with her 64 guns and countless colourful sculptures, many of them poking fun at the Polish (like the merman wearing a cardinal red hat, as Catholicism was the official religion in Poland, and the effigy of a Polish man fearfully crawling under a bed). Nowadays, the vessel is not inducing fear (provided you are not a 17th-century Polish soldier), but let one think that this is what happens when hubris and engineering fight and hubris wins. To Gustavus Adolphus’ credit (the Swedish king who commissioned the boat), hubris was exacerbated by hurry (at the time, Sweden was involved in — or recovering from — multiple conflicts), and engineering was precarious, at best. One of the wall texts of the museum explains that, at the time of the building, ship drawings were unheard of, and the ship master builder was working exclusively on expertise and dead reckoning. A tribunal inquest followed the sinking. No one was found guilty. After recovering the bronze cannons, the ship went into a 300-year forgetfulness.
The Vasa was recovered in 1961. The highly polluted (low in oxygen, preventing wood-attacking fungi and bacteria from surviving), low-salinity waters of the Stockholm harbour kept the wreck nearly intact. After undergoing a series of very elaborate conservation procedures, the Vasa was towed to her current location in 1988. The museum was officially opened in 1990. About three or four years later, I was learning to read in a small Romanian town from a comic book featuring a cute bear in a yellow and blue onesie who gained supernatural powers by eating a certain kind of honey. He had a bunch of friends, including a rabbit and a turtle, and was — of course — using those powers to fight the bad guys. His name was Bamse, the strongest bear in the world. ‘What does this have to do with a 17th-century shipwreck?’ you will correctly ask yourself. Well, Bamse and I parted ways when I turned 7 and went to school. We meet 30 years later, in the Vasa museum shop. It turns out he is Swedish (the onesie should have been a hint), and he is still a big thing out there, having his face on trams and a special edition of the comic book titled Bamse and Vasa the Ship (I did not buy a copy).
The Djurgården island, where the Vasa is, hosts a long list of museums; among them ABBA: The Museum. Book ahead if you want to visit this one; we did not, and we ended up having more coffee and buns in the museum’s cafe, with probably the most famous Swedes (if we are not counting IKEA’s Billy) playing in the background. A loss from which I can recover (unlike the Bamse comic book), as, to my mother’s chagrin, the Swedish Eurovision legend has never really floated my boat (see what I did there?). Even the ironic fondness that EU-bubble karaoke singers show for the band has eluded me.
As time was too short for the Photography Museum, we took a long stroll back to the city centre and went for the last lunch of the trip. Tacos! ‘We Swedes are obsessed with tacos. And with summer,’ was one of the things Agnes told us. While it is easy to understand (also, she explained that one) why they are obsessed with summer, the tacos part felt like a mystery worth of Scooby-Doo (bear with me, I just took a trip down the cartoon characters memory lane), so I started typing into Google ‘why are Swedes…’. The suggestions indicated that the taco dilemma was not very popular. The first one in the list of query suggestions was ‘Why are Swedes so hot.’ I guess some really are into the tall, blonde, blue-eyed, perfect-smile type. Go figure. Going back to my anthropological research: from its beginnings, in 1956, to the late 1980s-early 90s, Swedish television was governmentally-run and ad-free. In the early 90s, it was privatised, and when commercials became legal, the first ones instantly became legendary and urban folklore. ‘People in their 40s still quote Gillette and Libresse,’ a Swede told me. ‘One commercial was about having tacos on Fridays, and Swedes — used to do as we’re told — picked up on it, and then it just became a thing, alongside stuff like watching Disney on Christmas Eve and Ivanhoe on New Year’s Day,’ he continued. Having experienced this phenomenon first-hand in my own country, this makes sense. Who knows what culinary traditions the Romanians would’ve developed after the fall of the Iron Curtain if we only had been able to do as we were told (a biased and generalising joke based primarily on the writer’s shortcomings).
Right before taking the Arlanda Express to the airport, we had another round of Fika (a break involving a cup of coffee and a pastry)-more excellent coffee and sweets. Once arrived at the Arlanda I realised my flight was delayed, and I exercised my half-free-will with a Swedish lager.
In a nutshell, go to Stockholm. Pack a sleeping mask if you go during the summer, and warm clothes, even if you go during the summer.

For my flight from Bergen, Norway to Amsterdam, Netherlands, I flew with SAS Airlines and had a 6 hour layover at the Arlanda airport in Stockholm, Sweden. I had heard rumors of Stockholm’s easy breezy 20 minute express train (Arlanda Express) into the city center, and after much encouragement from Swedish locals I met whilst in Norway, I decided to take on the challenge of paring down Stockholm highlight lists I found online into something even more compact.
Knowing it would take approximately 1 hour to traverse from plane seat to the city center and another 2 hours to get from city center, through security, and to the gate (I like to be safe), I set out to explore as much of Stockholm as I could in 3 hours.
And so it goes…
Arlanda Express is easily navigable from the Arrivals gates, and it’s the fastest way into the city center (~20 minutes)
To take the Arlanda Express, directly proceed downstairs after exiting baggage claim and purchase tickets to the Stockholms Centralstation (Stockholm central station) at the platform. I like talking to humans, so went to the info desk where they sold me a round-trip ticket. It’s priced at 300 SEK for a round-trip young adult ticket (18–25 years old), and it’s the same as purchasing 2 single-ride tickets there and back (and same price as purchasing at the platform downstairs).
NOTE: When navigating back from the airport, be sure to check which terminal your flight departs from so that you can get off at the appropriate stop.
I found the architecture on this street quite interesting — a mixture of new and old world styles
On the day I was here, there was a Thai cultural celebration so there were an array of Thai food stalls and a stage for performances set up.
The Royal Swedish Opera House, known as the Kungliga Operan in the local language, was built in the Neo-Classical style.
On my way to Gamla Stan (the old town), I crossed the Strömbron bridge. On the way back, I took Norrbro bridge to take in a different view of the city.
If you have more time, you too could sail to Djügardeb (for the Vasa Museum & Gröna Land amusement park) or islands beyond. There are 14 islands on the surrounding archipelago, so there’s plenty to explore.
Clearly I didn’t have time, so I settled for this view.
Within the cobblestone roads and colorful buildings. of the old town Gamla Stan, there are many hidden gems — including the narrowest alleyway Mårten Trotzigs Gränd, and delicious snacks too (more on my favorites in the “Bites” section). This part of Stockholm was originally built in the 14th century, and the buildings that still exist today originate from the 18th and 19th century.
The Royal Palace is situated on the northeast side of Gamla Stan, and this is the official royal residence of the Swedish monarch. Although their names aren’t plastered across the tabloids in the states like the English monarch, from the postcards lining the streets in Gamla Stan, the Swedish royal family looks quite beautiful.
Because I had visited the Nobel Peace Center while I was in Oslo, Norway and thoroughly enjoyed that exhibit, I knew I wanted to visit the Nobel Museum whilst in Stockholm.
There’s an informative English-guided tour every hour at the quarter-hour mark, lasting approximately 30 minutes.
Fun facts about the Nobel Prize:
Similar to Oslo’s Nobel Peace Center, tickets here are 120 SEK for adults and 80 SEK for students.
I didn’t have time to go up close to Stockholm’s City Hall, much less to tour the courtyard/inside. Stockholm’s City Hall is especially significant because the annual Nobel Prize ceremony and subsequent banquet are held here every year on December 10th. I prioritized visiting the Nobel Museum over the venue this time.
Because hello, it’s Sweden 🇸🇪
Specifically, I’d like to go to the IKEA museum, which is actually in IKEA’s founding city (Älmhult, Sweden)
Food, in my opinion, is a gateway into a country’s culture. Obviously, I couldn’t very well leave Gamla Stan before having lunch and an afternoon fikka (the coffee culture is v strong here)
Apparently, Swedes love herring. So what did I eat? Herring of course. From a street cart. And it was bomb.
Imagine: buttered rye toast topped with fried herring, onions, and dill. I’m usually not a fan of half these items, but somehow this Swedish creation was delicious.
NOTE: There’s an option to try pickled herring (even more of a local favorite) instead of fried herring, but I was not so adventurous.
The Swedish love coffee enough that they have turned their word for coffee break “fika” into a verb. So it seemed only appropriate to grab a pastry and latte and relax…for a hot second…
No really, when I said hot second earlier I really meant hot. It was nearly 90 degrees when I was in Sweden, therefore a latte was not particularly pleasing. So I hopped next door for a cold ice cream cone… Fika, my way ✌🏼
Scandinavians seem to really like the Kit Kat, as both local manufacturers (Marabou and Cloetta) have created candy bar copy cats of the Chocolate wafer bar, albeit with a few extra flavors.
And there you have it y’all, my 3 hours in Stockholm, Sweden.
I’m curious to know, have you ever done a quick stopover in any city? Feel free to message me on Instagram @deannadarlingg!
Travel on, friends,
Deanna

A weekend in Sweden that felt less like visiting a new place and more like finding a piece of home.
“Travel far enough, you meet yourself.” — David Mitchell, Cloud Atlas
I didn’t go to Sweden expecting a life-changing experience. But standing on the train, surrounded by people with blonde hair and long legs, I had a strange feeling — one I’ve never really had while traveling.
For once, I think I might fit in.
It’s not that I feel like an outsider in Barcelona, but let’s be honest: I do stand out. At 5’10”, I’m used to towering over people in Spain, in the U.S., even in most places I’ve been. But in Sweden, I was just one of the many. Walking through Stockholm, it was the first time I didn’t feel like I had to shrink myself, like I didn’t have to be aware of how much space I took up.
Maybe that sounds dramatic, but if you’ve ever felt out of place, you know what I mean. Sweden wasn’t just another stop on my study abroad adventure — it was a place that felt familiar in a way I didn’t expect. A place that made me feel connected to a part of myself I’d never really thought about before.
But before I could romanticize it too much, I had to survive hostel life.
In my head, I booked a female-only dorm in my Stockholm hostel. In reality, I walked into a room of four men and me.
I’d love to say I was unfazed, that I confidently strolled in and claimed my bunk, but the truth is, I was nervous. It’s not that they weren’t nice — if anything, they seemed too nice, which somehow made me even more uneasy. I stayed in bed, waiting under my covers until they all left in the morning before I got up. So much for being a fearless traveler.
But if that first night was uncomfortable, the second was downright painful. Paige, my best friend from Florence, was supposed to meet me that morning, but instead, I woke up to a disaster of texts explaining how she forgot her passport, missed her first flight, booked another, then realized she booked it for March 14 instead of February 14. Poor girl. By the time she actually made it to Sweden, I had spent an entire day solo in a city I had never been to before.
And I loved it.
I spent the morning exactly how I wanted to — sitting in a cozy café with a book, watching the snow fall outside, taking my time.
Then I set out to explore Gamla Stan, Stockholm’s old town, and it felt like I had walked into a storybook. Narrow cobblestone streets, colorful buildings, charming shops — everywhere I looked, it was picture-perfect. But it wasn’t just about how it looked. There was a feeling in Stockholm, something I couldn’t quite explain. It felt calm. It felt familiar. It felt like a place I could live.
Maybe that was because of the people. I blended in, surrounded by people who looked like me, people who moved through the world the way I did. And every time someone spoke to me in Swedish, assuming I understood, I had to awkwardly smile and nod before admitting I had no idea what they were saying. I would have killed to respond, even just a few words, instead of immediately exposing myself as an imposter in the land of my ancestors.
Still, even without the language, there were other ways to connect. Standing in the cold for the changing of the guard at the Royal Palace, I watched the ceremony unfold with zero feeling in my toes, but completely absorbed in the tradition of it all. Then, stepping inside the palace itself, I felt an entirely different kind of connection — one rooted not in the present, but in history. I spent hours roaming the halls, reading every plaque, admiring every gorgeous room, tracing the lineage of Swedish royalty like I was piecing together a past I had never taken the time to learn.
And maybe that’s the best part of travel. Not just seeing new places, but finding new parts of yourself in them. I never thought I cared about my Swedish heritage beyond a fun fact, but suddenly, I wanted to know everything. Suddenly, I wanted to trace my roots.
And that’s how I know a place really meant something — when it makes me want to keep learning.
After spending far too much money at Zara (I know, I know, I can shop at Zara anywhere, but its SWEDEN), I ended the day at the Avicii Experience before Paige arrived.
Walking through the exhibit, I found myself completely absorbed — the music, the footage, the stories of his life. I already loved his music, but I had no idea how much he had shaped modern electronic sound, or how deeply he wrestled with the pressures of success and expectations. Or even that he had an interest in Buddhist teachings, something I’ve recently been exploring myself. It was a side of him I had never known before, making his work feel even more personal, even more profound.
It’s weird, the things that connect us. How you can listen to someone’s music your whole life and only later realize how much you actually have in common. His song “The Nights” will always be my favorite. Maybe because it’s the kind of song that makes you want to chase experiences, to say yes to things you never imagined yourself doing. It’s the song I hear in my mind every time I travel, the soundtrack to moments I want to remember forever. It’s even the song I edited my skydiving video to.
Of course, this moment of deep reflection ended with my phone dying, leaving me to wander Stockholm in the dark, hoping my Swedish instincts would kick in and guide me home. They did not. I eventually had to charge my phone at a hotel just to make it back.
By the time Paige arrived, she was exhausted, so we had a chill night, saving our energy for our very stressful plans the next day — a three-hour spa session.
I am not someone who relaxes easily, or at all, but for once, I let myself. I sat in a heated outdoor pool overlooking Stockholm, rocked back and forth in a chair designed to make you feel like a baby, and finally felt all the tension from travel disappear.
We continued our day on a boat, freezing to death on an archipelago cruise, warming our hands with mulled wine. It was the kind of cold that gets into your bones, the kind that makes you feel alive. And right as I thought I couldn’t handle it anymore, it started snowing.
It was one of those rare travel moments where you stop thinking about how cold you are, stop worrying about your walk home, stop analyzing what’s next. You just sit there, frozen, watching the snow fall on the water, knowing that this is a moment you’ll remember forever.
The weekend ended with a 6 AM RyanAir flight from hell, the kind of flight that makes you question if travel is ever worth it. But even through my exhaustion, all I could think about was how much I didn’t want to leave.
Sweden wasn’t just another trip. It wasn’t just a checklist of things to do. It was the first place I’ve been in Europe — outside of Barcelona — where I could actually see myself living.
Maybe it was the snow. Maybe it was the city. Maybe it was the feeling of blending in, for once.
Or maybe it was the realization that travel isn’t just about discovering new places.
Sometimes, it’s about discovering where you already belong.

Adapting to Life in Stockholm: Finding My Place in a New City,https://medium.com/@wangjunwei38/adapting-to-life-in-stockholm-finding-my-place-in-a-new-city-2ad895546ba1,"Sign up

When I first set foot in Stockholm, everything felt new and exciting. The weather was nice, nature was abundant, and the quiet peacefulness of the city was a stark contrast to the bustling streets I was used to back in Singapore. Beneath the surface excitement of being in a new place, however, I found myself facing a mix of emotions — there was excitement, of course, but also a fair amount of uncertainty and challenges.
For context, I am here in Stockholm as part of the NUS Overseas College (NOC) program, which is designed to expose us to internship and entrepreneurship experiences abroad while we take courses at partner universities. It’s an incredible opportunity, but it’s also been an experience that has challenged me in ways I didn’t anticipate — pushing me out of my comfort zone. Now that I have been here for 3 months, I’ve had time to reflect on these experiences.
Allow me to share some of my humble reflections and learnings — about living more independently (and interdependently) as well as exploring both the professional and physical worlds around me.
Coming to a new city without my family meant that I had to settle all the domestic chores and cooking on my own. While I cooked a little back home in Singapore, those were more for fancy cooking, not weekly sustenance. Here in Stockholm, with the significantly higher food prices, my NOC batch mates and I quickly realized that cooking most of our meals was a necessity, not an option. To be able to meal prep, while making sure you are getting enough nutrition is a whole different ball game. Learning to manage my nutrition, cooking efficiently, and budgeting my time for groceries and meal prep was something I had to pick up quickly in the first month. While I wouldn’t say I fully enjoy my own cooking yet, I’m working on it! My friends have also inspired me to try out different recipes to keep things interesting, which has added a bit of excitement to the routine.
Thankfully, I did not have to navigate all of this on my own. My NOC batch mates and seniors were right there with me, sharing in the experience. Beyond helping each other with the practicalities of daily life, we’ve built a network that has been incredibly supportive in navigating the professional world here as well. We often share information about tech and entrepreneurship events, upcoming hackathons, and professional opportunities. Each of us brings our own network, knowledge, and insights to the table, creating a combined support system that’s far more powerful than what any one of us could manage alone, and it’s something I’m deeply grateful for.
Aside from networking, there’s so much to learn from one another. No matter how skilled you are, there’s always someone with strengths in areas you’re still developing. Here, I’ve learned to sharpen my business acumen and networking skills simply by observing how my friends navigate these spaces. It’s been inspiring, and I’m grateful for the chance to grow alongside such talented peers, reminding me that learning can come as much from our peers as from formal experiences
Reflecting on all of this, it’s the power of interdependence that has stood out to me most. I first encountered this idea in a book called 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, where interdependence is described as the strength of a team surpassing the sum of individual strengths. These past three months have shown me exactly how valuable interdependence can be, especially in a new environment. It’s been a humbling reminder that independence is not the end-all-be-all — it’s often the connections we make and the support we share that truly help us thrive.
And of course, my intention in coming to NOC Stockholm was about more than just experiencing work in a local startup (My work is cool though maybe I will write about it in another post!). I wanted to dive into the entrepreneurial activities and atmosphere of the city, to learn by immersing myself in Stockholm’s dynamic ecosystem. Over the past few months, my batchmates and I have attended an array of events — from networking sessions hosted by Stockholm School of Economics and KTH to hackathons like the Gradient Descent LLM Hackathon, as well as company visits and pitches to venture capitalists. Each event has opened up new perspectives, provided valuable insights, and left me with so much to process every week. It feels as though there’s always something exciting going on, and each experience leaves an imprint.
These experiences have stretched us in unexpected ways, pushing us beyond the daily tasks of our internships and exposing us to the broader world of innovation and entrepreneurship. Through this journey, I’ve strengthened my ability to connect with others, navigate professional conversations, and approach new opportunities with confidence. The consistent exposure to industry professionals and diverse ideas has been invaluable in helping me develop both professionally and personally.
The hackathons and projects, in particular, have tested our limits, demanding not only technical creativity but also the resilience to tackle complex problems under pressure. I still vividly recall the night we stayed up until 7am, racing against time to complete a hackathon project, fueled by sheer determination and maybe a little too much caffeine. Each event has challenged us to think outside the box, to innovate, and to search for solutions to real-world challenges, often on tight timelines. We’ve poured countless hours into brainstorming, coding, refining pitches, and collaborating, and while we’ve sacrificed more than a few hours of sleep to make it all happen, I wouldn’t trade those experiences for anything.
Through these events, I’ve come to realize that true learning often comes from stepping out of your comfort zone and engaging with the unknown. While we may not bring every idea to fruition, the lessons learned from each experience are worth every bit of effort we invested. The late nights, the excitement of each pitch, and the satisfaction of collaborating with passionate individuals are experiences that have shaped me in profound ways. It’s not just about the projects themselves, but about developing the resilience, adaptability, and drive that will stay with me long after this program ends.
This was my first time in Europe, and I know for a fact it won’t be my last. From the mountain ranges to the history-rich buildings, everything felt fresh and exciting, filling me with a childlike joy that I rarely experience. One moment that sticks with me is the time I went up a mountain in Salzburg. Standing at the summit, I looked out at the surrounding cities and mountain ranges, and my worries seemed to melt away. It was a perspective shift — feeling like a tiny speck in the vastness of the world, realizing how small my day-to-day concerns truly are against such breathtaking beauty.
As a nature lover, these are the moments I live for, where I feel connected to something larger than myself. Being surrounded by such grandeur reminded me why I love being outdoors, immersed in landscapes that make me feel at peace.
As my friends often say, “When else will you be X years old and able to experience the beauty of Europe at a fraction of the cost of a flight from Singapore?” This really is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and it’s opened my eyes in so many ways — embracing spontaneity, appreciating the diversity of perspectives, and seeing the world with fresh wonder. Travelling through Europe has been about more than just sightseeing; it’s been a chance to rediscover a sense of awe and curiosity that reminds me to look at life with new eyes.
As I look back on the past few months, I realize how much the small, everyday responsibilities added up, especially on top of adapting to a new workplace and immersing myself in Stockholm’s unique culture. At first, I brushed off the cognitive load, thinking, “I’ve done more than this back in Singapore — this is nothing.” But soon enough, the weight of these seemingly minor tasks started to accumulate, leaving me feeling mentally drained, wondering where all my time had gone. (I’m a huge anime fan, yet I went a record-breaking two months without watching any anime at all!)
Adjusting to a new environment is hard work, and it’s not just the big challenges that take a toll — it’s the daily, unnoticed demands that quietly pile up. That is when I learned to make space for these “small” tasks and, more importantly, to be kinder to myself instead of expecting to handle everything effortlessly. I can’t, and that’s okay.
It’s a lesson in self-compassion and balance — one that I didn’t expect to be part of this journey but has become a key part of it. These experiences in Stockholm, both large and small, have taught me the importance of pacing myself, embracing support, and recognizing the power of both independence and interdependence in navigating life’s changes.

Historically rich, the dynamic Stockholm is the capital of Sweden. Founded in the 13th century, built over more than 14 islands connected by no less than 50-plus bridges, this fortified town is now an important trading center during the Hanseatic League and a critical player in the Great Northern War. The Industrial Revolution then managed to push this into even further growth, shaping the dynamic city we see today, where historical architecture meets modern design and sustainability.
Early one bright morning, I started my adventure, boarding the famous red tour bus with eagerness in my heart to see what Stockholm had in store for me. As we rolled down the cobblestone streets of Gamla Stan, its charming old town, the sun spilled gold upon the pastel-colored buildings and brought the history of the area to life. Each of these stops had a spell on me, with narrow alleys whispering stories of quaint cafes and shops that would call me to stop and smell the roses.
The bus then took us along the tranquil waters of the archipelago. I could perceive people sitting by the shores, fika-ing-a tradition of coffee and cake dear to the people. The chuckles and worldly gossips of families sitting in parks seemed to combine with unimaginably distant tunes of street musicians. It was as if Stockholm beckoned to me and filled my heart deep inside with a sense of acceptance.
Standing on top of the bus, the backdrops were truly striking: proud, ancient palaces stood among sleek, modern edifices, each monument telling its story. Lush greenery…

I hate long introductions and at the same time, I am very guilty of writing them. But not this time, as the title of this story says it all, so I will jump right away to the lists.
They say in Sweden that “Summer is the longest day of the year.” because it is nothing more than one long day. The rest of the days are kind of autumn-like and six to eight months are full-blown winter.
Winter with lots of snow, minus 20°C and only 5–6 hours of daylight. And not only is daylight sparse but its quality is also poor. The dishwater-grey sky makes you feel like you are in a never-ending thriller.
From the very first winter, I painfully learned that the absence of light can do strange things to you.
The “winter blues” or Seasonal Affective Disorder, was something I experienced every year. Lack of sunlight is thought to cause a drop…

After 13+ hours of traveling, we arrived early — arguably too early — on a Tuesday morning at Arlanda Airport. It was 8am, we were hours away from our Airbnb check-in, and a bit too early for all the lunch recommendations I spent hours searching for online.
We found a breakfast place that had just opened, and made the 10-minute walk with our luggage in tow.
My tastebuds immediately decided I’d order the buckwheat, blueberry, and mascarpone pancakes. The order arrived and the 3-tier flapjacks were smothered in blueberry sauce and the tangy, airy cream. As if that were not enough deliciousness, they were garnished with candied lemon peels and mint.
These did not disappoint.
It was my first time really trying mascarpone, and I would have given it a standing ovation. It added a lovely richness to the entire plate, and I scooped up all the toppings with my fork.
Because we still had time to spare, we visited the Kungsträdgården, a popular park in the city center. There was a gorgeous rectangular fountain with tall, vases around the perimeter filled with purple and orange flowers.

You know that moment when you glance at the clock, and it’s 11 PM, and you’re still hunched over your laptop?
Yeah, I didn’t think it would happen to me either!
I’d heard so many stories of burnout, tales of people overworking, but I thought, Not me. I love my job! I was managing exciting AI projects with brilliant teams, and every milestone felt exhilarating.
But suddenly, I found myself in the grips of what I can only describe as Stockholm Syndrome with Work.
It all started pretty innocently. I was leading a high-stakes AI project, and it was exciting. I was in charge of multiple teams, coordinating every detail, responsible for every success.
My team? Absolutely stellar. My manager? Supportive and genuinely invested in my growth.
The feedback? Glowing enough to light up a small city.
At first, I thought I was simply committed. My job was exciting, important, worth the extra hours. But, as anyone who’s fallen for Stockholm Syndrome with Work will tell you, it’s never obvious when it starts. It crept up on me until I couldn’t see where my work ended and I began.

When I visited Stockholm for the first time, I had low expectations for my trip. It’s not Paris with the Eiffel Tower and Louvre, Florence with its great art and delectable cuisine or Athens where visitors can see living history around every corner.
The most I knew about it, except for the fact I had a friend who lived there, was that it had a museum dedicated to a pop band and another museum dedicated to a ship that sank during its maiden voyage. With so much of the world for me to explore, Stockholm wasn’t on the top of my check list.
I underestimated Stockholm. and this is why you should move Stockholm to the top of your travel “to do” list too!
My husband and I decided to visit Stockholm to visit a friend from there who we met in the States several years before. Over the years we also met his brother, wife and children so by our first visit to Stockholm, we viewed them as our family.
We stayed in Gamla Stan, the old town. This is a beautiful cobblestone neighborhood on its own island. Stockholm is a city made up of many separate islands connected by bridges and ferries.
Stepping into Gamla Stan makes you feel like you took a step back in time. We stayed at a hotel called the Victory Hotel which is dedicated to Stockholm’s strong maritime heritage.
Our friend could not meet us until later in the evening on our first day so he directed us to a nearby restaurant that focused on Swedish cuisine. Although I watched some YouTube videos on the Stockholm food scene, I didn’t have high expectations for the city’s culinary offerings. Another mistake on my part.
This first meal was at a restaurant called Ardbeg Embassy. It felt very Nordic and like walking into someone’s home, so it was the perfect spot to start my Swedish adventure. We started with Toast Skagen, of course, which is essentially shrimp on toast. One bite and it was my new favorite appetizer. My husband had reindeer tenderloin and I had salmon with hollandaise sauce and potatoes. It all felt very Swedish and, after that meal, I decided I needed to dive into the city’s culinary scene more. In America, I can only get hollandaise sauce on top of poached eggs and in Sweden they put it on fish for dinner. When can I move?
Although some travel writers will disagree, when in Europe I always chose a hotel that offers breakfast in the morning. I love waking up to a breakfast buffet of fruit and charcuterie whenever I am in Europe. No matter which country I am visiting, I always know I am going to start my day with fruits, cheeses, meats, various juices, and, the best part, an automatic coffee machine which will make me a cappuccino, macchiato or espresso at the push of a button. I wish American hotels would jump on the European hotel breakfast bandwagon!
During day 2 in Stockholm, we decided to simply wander the city like tourists and then meet our friend later in the day to go to the ABBA Museum. The ABBA Museum was the one and only place that I did not want to miss. At the museum, I learned a lot about the band and its fascinating journey to stardom. We planned a low key day to save our energy for what we expected to be an epic night with our friends at a restaurant called Punk Royale.
Punk Royale — think Michelin quality fine dining but in a punk rock bar. My husband decided to go all in and showed up in an AC/DC shirt and black sunglasses. Since he has long hair, the outfit, which I thought was a gamble since this was a $300 per person restaurant, worked and he immediately received praise from the staff for showing up in costume.
The menu is a 20 course tasting menu and many courses were served with a different alcoholic beverage. The food is innovative and the atmosphere is lively and immersive. It was one of the most interesting and fabulous meals I have had.
After our wonderful meal at Punk Royale, we found ourselves at a “shot” bar called Shotluckan. I have never experienced anything like it, which appeared to be the trend for the evening. When a shot was served, it was an interactive experience. For our first shot, my husband and I found ourselves in a wedding ceremony with the bartender acting as the wedding officiant. Apparently, we even received a marriage license, which I promptly lost. For our second shot, we were instructed to put on ski goggles and compressed air was blown in our faces while we did the shot.
Needless to say, we lost the entire next day as we recovered from a Swedish night on the town. We used this development as an excuse to extend our stay one extra day. This city was so much better than I expected.
Because Stockholm is made up of many islands, ferries are part of the public transportation system. Once we recovered from our night on the town, we decided to try the ferry system to travel to an island called Fjäderholmarna for the day for a scenic ride through the archipelago and to have lunch. When we arrived on the island, I immediately felt like I was transported to seaside Maine with the forest meeting the sea and red wooden buildings dotting the coastline. We ate oysters and drank champagne and ordered more Toast Skagen while watching boaters enjoying the beautiful weather.
A visit to Stockholm would not be complete without enjoying Fika which is not a snack per sé, but a tradition of taking a break during the day to have a coffee with a baked good. The Swedes know how to make bakery items! The cinnamon rolls were delectable everywhere we went.
As our long weekend in Stockholm progressed, we became very comfortable using the public transportation system throughout the city. It was fairly easy and all done through an app on our phones. We did not have time to explore the art installations that can be found in many stations, but we intend to do that on our next visit. We never felt unsafe, but of course we remained cautious at all times.
When traveling to Stockholm, visitors should not miss the Vasa Museum. Before going to the museum, I could not understand why a museum that glorified a ship which immediately sank during its maiden voyage was a must do, but then we went. The Vasa is a preserved 17th-century warship with 98% of the original structure intact. It sank during its first voyage because it was simply too heavy to float. It was salvaged after over 300 years underwater fully preserved in the brackish water and offers a rare, time-capsule view into naval architecture and craftsmanship of the early 1600s.
My first trip to Stockholm was unexpectedly amazing and I am so glad we went. Stockholm rewards curiosity at every turn. It’s a place where history and innovation quietly collide. Venture beyond the expected, and you’ll find Stockholm is a layered and intriguing city just as I did!

Me and my wife were fortunate to became parents in 2019 with a baby girl. At the time we were living in California and I worked at Google as a Software Engineer. While enjoying free lunches at Google with collegues we talked about various topics. Sometimes about social problems, hobbies old Google stories from veteran Googlers and rarely technical topics. One day it was a story about Finland and how they send a box of things for new born babies and parents buy nothing but diapers during the first year. This has been a tradition in Finland for 75 years. He happened to read about this in a book called Nordic theory of everything.
As a new parent I was interested in reading this book and fascinated about the culture in nordic countries and their approach to life. Following this book I read a couple of more books like The Almost Nearly Perfect People, There’s no such thing as bad weather. Of course I read hundreds of Quoara posts and watched tens of youtube videos about nordic countries. I was convinced that the Nordics have a very interesting thing going on in their countries. I was intrigued by the childcare and the freedom kids were given in their childhood. Playing outside all day long, spending time in the forest, less home work and less ranking and competition. Occasionally I asked myself should we also move to one of these countries ? I felt that it would be an interesting thing to do but part of me was convinced that They have a great culture but it is probably great for the natives but not for the foreigners who move there. Would this really work out well for a brown kid, let alone her parents who were born and raised in a tropical country.
My life continued with reading here and there about the nordic culture but nothing serious happened. Then the pandemic hit and we were stuck in our newly bought house in California. Not having to spend a lot of time for commute, I finally got some time to think. Like so many other people who made life changing decisions during the pandemic, I thought this would be a good time to move to one of the Nordic countries. It is a bold thing to do but interesting. As a person who gets bored of things easily and person who likes excitement, this felt good.
On the other hand my wife was not very interested in this move. After struggling to save money for 5 years we finally bought our own home and lived there for only a couple of months. Everything was finally stable and she wanted to relax in our new home with our newborn. She is a person who can be satisfied with a very little. She is not a person who would think too much into the future. Sometime I envy her approach to life where her highest priority is to be happy with her family and live a calm peaceful life. While me reading a lot about macro social economic problems, Climate change and how they affect us and affect my child’s upbringing. May be this a good blend for a more sustainable longterm family life.
Somehow I managed to convince her that it was the right thing to do given it is important for Surali to spend her early days in the best environment. Also I convinced her it will be very interesting for her to find work in a nordic country where our salary difference will be a lot less than what we have now.
I boldly applied for a job within Google and requested for a transfer. My transfer was accepted and I was given an excellent relocation package to move to Sweden. We gave our house keys to the real estate agent, sold our car, said good bye to our close friends and left San Francisco. I am good at saying good bye to old places, either because I have less attachments to them or I am too much focus on the future and the next step. I did not regret it when I left my hometown Galle(2010), Sri Lanka(2011), Indiana (2015) or when we left USA to Sweden(2020). I am sure one day I will leave Sweden without much regret. Hard thing with the every move was leaving behind the friends and family. I still keep in touch with friends and family from each place.
Retired person picked up my car, bought it for 22,000$ and sold it for 12,000$ after 5 years of use. This was a mistake, I should have donated this car to our buddhist temple.
We arrived at SFO and the airport was almost empty and we had our flight to Europe and there were a couple of people in the flight and the crew had little to no work to do because the flight was empty. I doubt we would ever have a long haul flight like this.
In 2020 October (Fall in Sweden) we arrived in Arlanda airport and I was visiting Europe after many years (In 2009 I visited Amsterdam while I was studying in college). Arlanda airport is located middle of no where, it almost felt like landing in a forest. From the sky there weren’t any buildings visible, no perfectly created neighbourhoods lines visible from the sky, no roads spanning all possible directions, and we spotted a massive archipelago with thousands of islands.
We picked up our bags and prepared our documents ready to answer all the questions from the border control and continued to walk towards customs. If you travelled to the US you would know how the drill goes. We were pushing our carts with lots of bags and walking towards the exit and nobody asked a single question and a bunch of police officers gave us a slight smile (later I got to know that this is called Swedish look) and that was it. This is not because Sweden doesn’t have a border control but we flew through Netherlands and all the border check was done there and nothing was required at the Swedish border. But my thought was Hey, we are moving to Sweden for the first time, don’t you want to cross check us, check our papers, check our bags, what if we bring something harmful to the agriculture.
We have booked an apartment in the east of Stockholm (Östermalm) and my new manager at Google told me that this area is one of the nicest places in Stockholm, so I had lots of expectations. I expected to see perfectly manicured plants with lots of flowers by the streets, nicely cut grass everywhere and skyscrapers. But it wasn’t the case, to me it felt like an average neighbourhood in San Francisco but with lots of greenary. I noticed the huge park right in front of our hotel with a forest skyline. Now I know that in Sweden beauty kept at it’s natural state compared to the extreme human intervention in America. Östermalm has it’s own beauty with the water close by and forest and lots of walking paths. If I have the money, Östermalm would be one of my favourite areas I’d like to live. Now I get what my manager meant when he said it’s one of the best places in Sweden.
We moved to our apartment and it was a nice spacious apartment at the top floor and I noticed the high quality of construction inside the apartment compared to our old place in the US. Wooden floors, high-end kitchen equipments and the lovely view of Stockholm through the kitchen window. Same night I stepped out of the balcony and saw something I haven’t seen for a long time. I saw the man wearing a suite and waiting for the bus with bags full of groceries. This is not a common scene in America where people always drive for groceries and put them in the trunk and drive back home. This is one of the moments that I felt, oh my god, things are really different here and it is real. After seeing the grocery man I thought there must be a store close by and then I figured it is actually in the same building ground floor. How convenience is that ? You simply have to take the elevator down and you are at the store.
When I think about our move now, it was definitely a bold move, I should have done many things before moving here. I should have come for a short visit, but I couldn’t because it was in the middle of the COVID19 pandemic. I should have waited a few more years so I would save more with less taxes in the US, but then my kid wouldn’t have the great experience in Swedish preschool system. But all in all we are doing fine in Sweden now. Sometimes bold moves might bring you the greatest experiences in life. When we moved here we lived alone and barely knew anyone except one family whom we couldn’t meet for a couple of months due to pandemic rules. But what kept me going was not to over think and stay positive. I’m pretty sure lots of my friends and family questioned our decision to move to Sweden, but I still believe it gave us a different perspective to our life. It of course didn’t improve all aspects of our lives but it improved the things we value the most as a family.
Now after 3 years from our move I’m writing this article in my room in our apartment in Stockholm. We live 5km from the central Stockholm close to a small forest with 15km of bike/running paths. Since the move I have changed a lot as a person and I think I have a more balanced life than ever before. I no longer work for Google, a few weeks ago I joined a small startup with ten engineers.
After living in Sweden for 3 years, I think it is a good time to write about our experience here in the nordics. I will be writing more articles about Sweden and our life in the nordics.

Follow up with the part 1 about 10 things I love about Stockholm, here are five more things that I love about Stockholm:
As I arrived in Stockholm, carrying my luggage through the city’s bustling streets to my rental apartment, I couldn’t help but notice something remarkable — every time I approached a crosswalk, the cars would stop and the drivers would kindly wave me across. It was a small gesture, but it made a big impression on me.
As I settled into my apartment, I quickly realized that this was just the beginning of Stockholm’s pedestrian-friendly culture. The city’s well-designed streets and sidewalks made it easy and enjoyable to explore on foot, with plenty of green spaces and parks to relax in along the way.
But it wasn’t just walking that was a breeze in Stockholm — cycling was also a popular and efficient mode of transportation. The city’s network of bike lanes and paths were well-marked and separated from motorized traffic, making it safe and convenient to pedal my way around.
Exploring Stockholm’s inner city doesn’t require a car, thanks to the city’s efficient and convenient public transportation system. From buses to trams, trains, and the famous Stockholm Metro, there are plenty of options for getting around. During the summer months, ferries are also available to take you across the city’s waterways. With well-placed stations throughout the city and frequent services, navigating Stockholm is a breeze. The system is easy to use, with clear signage and ticket machines that accept both cash and card payments.
Plus, there’s even a mobile app called SL to help guide your travel, check schedules for different transportation options, and purchase tickets on-the-go. Say goodbye to traffic and hello to stress-free exploration in Stockholm with their convenient public transportation system.
You might be surprised to learn that one of the most convenient and innovative features of the country is its BankID system.
BankID is a digital identification system that allows Swedes to securely access a range of online services, from banking and government services to shopping and entertainment. You can use BankID to login your bank accounts, verify transaction, login Skatteverket (Swedish Tax Agency) to check your tax payment, login 1177.se (Swedish Health and Care) to book doctor appointment, login Pensionsmyndigheten (Pension Authority),…
In order to obtain a BankID, you must have a Swedish Personal Identity Number, be a customer of one of the banks that issue BankID. With BankID, I was able to quickly and securely authenticate my identity, without the need for clunky passwords or authentication codes. It made the process fast and hassle-free, and I never had to worry about my personal information being compromised.
Since I moved to Stockholm, I don’t use cash anymore. There are tons of benefits of that.
Firstly, I don’t need to carry around pockets full of coins and notes, worrying about losing or misplacing them.
Secondly, I also don’t need to worry about fraudster that use counterfeit money in the black market or worry about pickpocket.
Lastly, it is more convenient to control my personal finance with all the transactions are recorded in the bank account, categorise my activities so I don’t need to write down my transaction anymore.
Instead, I can pay using credit/debit card, or pay via my mobile using Apple pay, or I can may via Swish (mobile instant payment).
One of the most striking things about Stockholm, as a foreigner living here, is the locals’ fluency and friendliness in speaking English. From restaurant servers to shopkeepers, bus drivers, and security guards, nearly everyone seems to be bilingual. This ease of communication makes getting around and making connections in Stockholm an absolute breeze, and I always feel welcomed and at home here. I’ve had some truly delightful conversations with locals who were eager to practice their English skills and share their insights into Swedish culture and traditions. The friendly and fluent locals truly embody Sweden’s welcoming and inclusive spirit.
Of course, I still made an effort to learn some basic Swedish phrases and customs, out of respect for the country and its people. I appreciate how the city’s bilingualism has made my life in Stockholm stress-free and enjoyable.
I have travelled to several cities in the world, but in the end, Stockholm is and will be the city I would choose to settle long term. Whether you’re interested in history, culture, or simply enjoying the outdoors, this city has it all. With its efficient public transportation system and welcoming atmosphere, Stockholm is a perfect destination for travelers looking to explore Scandinavia? You’re sure to fall in love with Stockholm, just like I do.

Today wraps my last day in Stockholm, Sweden — The middle leg of my scandinavian holiday that I’m taking while on sabbatical. Stockholm has been great, with loads of museums, picturesque walks and today we had some snow!
I can’t help but compare Stockholm to Croydon in the UK. When we arrived at Stockholm Central station from the Airport we walked to outside Åhléns where we got the tram to the area that our hotel is based. If I replaced Åhléns with Allders then I’m basically talking about Croydon so it’s been hard to move away from that framing.
What’s also made it hard to not compare Stockholm to Croydon has been the people, who from my eight days of being here are just as rude, although not as loud as people from London (although Croydon being in London is something some will debate).
Compared to Copenhagen there’s a lot more cars and less bikes on the road in Stockholm but that’s a little more understandable due to how cold it gets here. Public transport wise it’s similar with the addition of the tram, the trains here I would say have better signage than those in Denmark with a screen showing the next 4 stops which was useful for when we headed out of the city centre.
Our first full day in Stockholm was on a Sunday so we stayed local as things were closing early and we had a lay in to sleep off getting up early to make our flight the day before. Luckily the Vasa Museum was right by our hotel so we had a wander over there and was blown away at the scale of both the ship and the craftmanship that was put into it.
On Monday we took a stroll around Stockholm’s old town (Gamla Stan) and found a really cool comic / gaming shop which had some cool D&D displays.
On Tuesday we went to Skansen which for me has been the highlight of my time in Stockholm. It’s an amazing open air museum and zoo which had a really cool mix of crafting workshops, gardens and animals. The enclosures in the zoo were massive so I was really happy to see the animals not being closed in like in some zoos, there was also a really fun monkey area you could walk through with them running around.
On Wednesday I dragged my other-half to Skogskyrkogården, a cemetry about 25 mins outside of Stockholm that was used for a picture in the liner notes (remember those) of Entombed’s Left Hand Path. Being a massive Death Metal fan I had to go see the cross there and get a picture.
On Thursday we had a boat tour of the Stockholm Archipelago booked so we went aboard and enjoyed a two and a half journey to Vaxholm and back while taking in the sites. It was around this time that the temperature dropped and I came to realise how my Barbour Ashby jacket works well for UK winters but nordic winters would require an extra layer so I decided to go buy a liner for the jacket which has proved worthwhile.
Friday saw a trip to the Toy Museum but I was a little disappointed in it. There were a few cool displays but there was nothing that really told the story of how toys changed over the years and more just collections of toys with similar properties (like cars, planes etc). I think they could have improved it by showing the evolution of toys from wooden to plastic to electronic and how the business behind toys changed too (like the 80s tie-in TV show boom).
Today (Saturday) it snowed so instead of going to see anything in particular we had a walk around some of the area in the snow as the UK doesn’t get snow in the same sense so the novelty was still there.

Ever since I relocated to Amsterdam, solo traveling has been one of my preferred activities. This enables me to have some personal time to ponder on life and also puts me in a vulnerable scenario that encourages me to explore the world alone while making new acquaintances in an unfamiliar city. Following the semester’s conclusion, I opted to travel to Stockholm, Sweden, and embark on a 3-day expedition.
Coming along with me is my Fuji film camera loaded with a Fuji 200 film roll, a non-fiction book, my journal with a cover featuring Amsterdam houses, a black pen and highlighters from MUJI, a carry-on containing a makeup bag, and overly-packed clothes (because it’s important to look stylish while traveling, don’t you agree?), and an open-minded attitude.
Naturally, my journey began with a mad dash to the bus station in order to catch the final bus to Schipol Airport for my early flight, as is typically the case. Rushing is never enjoyable, but ironically, I feel an added sense of excitement whenever I commence my travels in this manner.
To kill the waiting time before boarding on Boeing 737–800, I chose a perfect seat with a good view, put my headphone on with my travel playlist playing in the background, and waited for some interesting airport romance incidents to happen (this is part of the reason that I love flying alone). Luckily enough, early July is the peak season for all the (hot) Dutchies gathering in the airport, wearing those linen shirts, paired with shorts and light-coloured sneakers to get ready for their holidays in southern Europe.
After landing at Stockholm Arlanda Airport, the first thought that came up to my mind was, Wow! I’m in freaking Stockholm!! I’m so ready for this city!!
Without even realizing it, I found myself standing in front of Café Pascal, eager to indulge in my daily dose of caffeine and Swedish pastry as my first meal in Stockholm. Situated near Odenplan and Observatorielunden, the café offers a warm and inviting interior design, along with a stunning terrace. In addition to a wide selection of coffee, there are also plenty of sandwiches and Swedish pastries to choose from.
As Gamla Stan was introduced on the travel website, visitstockholm.com,
Gamla Stan, the Old Town in Swedish, is one of the largest and best-preserved medieval city centers in Europe, and one of the foremost attractions in Stockholm. This is where Stockholm was founded in 1252.
As I strolled through Gamla Stan, I couldn’t help but be captivated by the narrow winding cobblestone streets and charming houses, each with their unique character. I kept my film camera at the ready, eager to capture the beauty of this old town and the occasional glimpses of the harbour view that peeked out between the alleys. It was heartwarming to see elderly couples walking hand-in-hand down the street.
Amidst the steady influx of sightseers, the quaint streets and souvenir emporiums brimmed with activity. Yet, I derived solace from the tranquility and geniality of the medieval city center. Instead of hastening to snap up iconic photographs at tourist landmarks, I relish taking in the sights, sounds, and scents of the city’s breathtaking scenery. Additionally, I take pleasure in engaging in conversations with shop proprietors to glean more insights into the region’s rich history and vibrant local customs.
When I was dining at Fika & Wine, I inquired about the meaning of Fika culture from one of the baristas in Fika & Wine.
“Fika is one of those words that can be difficult to translate. Essentially, it means enjoying coffee, tea, wine, and Swedish sweets with nice company. The best part? You can have as many Fikas as you want in a day!” she said.
Fika is a Swedish tradition that encourages slowing down and savoring the moment. As a coffee enthusiast, I couldn’t resist embracing this wonderful culture.
During my visit to Stockholm, I made it a point to fully immerse myself in the Swedish lifestyle by partaking in the delightful tradition of Fika time twice a day. I was fortunate enough to discover a charming little spot in the Södermalm neighborhood called Drop Coffee Roasters, which quickly became my go-to destination for this delightful pastime. The ambiance was cozy and inviting, with an airy and bright interior that exuded warmth and comfort.
As for my Fika order, I opted for a cappuccino made with creamy oat milk, which was simply divine. The coffee was expertly brewed and had a rich and robust flavour that perfectly complemented the sweetness of the pastries. Speaking of which, I indulged in two of the most popular Fika treats, the classic Kanelbulle, which is a hall-of-fame pastry in Sweden, and the delectable Chokladbollar, a chocolatey treat that was simply irresistible.
Overall, my Fika experience at Drop Coffee Roasters was nothing short of exceptional. The baristas were friendly and willing to share their favorite cafes. I highly suggest this spot for visitors to Stockholm who desire to immerse themselves in authentic Fika culture while enjoying some of the best coffee and pastries in town.
Since returning from my trip to København in late April, journaling has become one of my favorite hygge rituals. Initially, I began journaling as a private outlet to express my thoughts and romanticize life amidst the intensity of my studies. However, it has since evolved into a unique way of documenting the little moments that occur during each trip.
During my stay in Stockholm, I made it a point to take a leisurely walk during the golden hour. Starting from Kungsträdgården, I would traverse the path that led me through the picturesque Skeppsholmsbron, and eventually arrive at Kastellholmen. Once there, I would find a cozy bench to sit on, gazing out at either the charming Gamla Stan and Södermalm or the enchanting Djurgården. The gentle breeze would caress my skin, evoking a myriad of emotions that would stir within me, bringing back fond memories of the past and inspiring hope for a bright future. It served as a wonderful reminder to appreciate and cherish the present moment.
“ … tomorrow will be the last day of this solo travel journey in Stockholm. I asked myself how was I feeling earlier today. To be completely honest, I’m not so sure and life has been quite choatic in the past few weeks. So, I would say it’s like a mix of all kinds of emotions, it’s difficult to articulate, but mostly relief …” as it was written in my journal.
This journey ended with the style of experiencing my very first airport romance while waiting for my flight back to Amsterdam. This unexpected romance occurred at the Stockholm Arlanda Airport and involved a charming Swede who was en route to Florence via Amsterdam and a Taiwanese girl who was headed back to Amsterdam.
It was the perfect finale for my solo travel journey in Stockholm.
As I reflect on my solo travel escapade in Stockholm, my heart swells with gratitude and a profound sense of fulfillment. This journey wasn’t merely a series of adventures, but a soul-enriching odyssey that allowed me to establish a profound connection with myself and the world around me.
Each and every second of my journey, starting from boarding that early morning flight to setting foot in the captivating Gamla Stan, left a deep imprint on my soul. The sheer pleasure of strolling through the winding cobblestone streets and capturing the city's exquisite charm with my faithful Fuji film camera was indescribable. However, it was the small yet significant conversations with the amiable locals and fellow voyagers that truly added a unique and meaningful touch to this unforgettable trip.
Discovering the Swedish Fika culture was a revelation. Slowing down, savoring coffee, pastries, and moments with lovely company — what a beautiful way to appreciate life’s simple pleasures! Drop Coffee Roasters became my haven, where the aroma of expertly brewed coffee mingled with the warmth of human connection. For a coffee lover like me, in particular, Fika time enriched this entire journey with an extra touch!!
While journaling during the golden hours became a cherished ritual. Pouring my thoughts onto paper, I found solace amidst life’s challenges. The picturesque spots in Stockholm became the backdrop for my reflections, reminding me to cherish the present and embrace the beauty of each moment.
And then, there was the unexpected airport romance — a serendipitous encounter that reminded me of the magic of travel. A charming Swede and a Taiwanese girl crossing paths in Stockholm — it was a heartwarming finale to my adventure, leaving me with a newfound appreciation for human connections that transcend borders.
As I bid farewell to Stockholm, I carry with me a treasure trove of memories, insights, and newfound friendships. This solo journey has reaffirmed my belief in the transformative power of travel — the way it opens our hearts and minds to the world’s diversity and beauty.
Now, back in Amsterdam, I’ll continue to cherish my Amsterdam house-covered journal, eager to document my reflections and plan future escapades.
Solo travel has become a soul-enriching way of life for me — one that fosters curiosity, self-discovery, and the courage to embrace the unknown. May we continue to explore this beautiful world with a spirit of wonder and compassion.
Until our paths cross again, dear Stockholm, I will hold you close in my heart. And as I eagerly await my next adventure, I’ll keep my mind and heart open to the wonders that lie ahead.

The first time I came to Stockholm, things weren’t going well. Back home I’d been following all the rules, but the expression “my life is passing me by” was talking about me. Pushed from the complacency of obedience, I bought a one-way ticket to Europe. I started in Germany but didn’t know what to do and felt like I was messing everything up, so I took the overnight train to Copenhagen, where I didn’t know what to do and felt like I was messing everything up, so I took the overnight train to Stockholm, where I walked to a couple hostels and found them all full.
“Didn’t you know you need to book ahead during this season?” the man asked me.
“No,” I could have answered. “Because I don’t know what to do and am messing everything up.”
Embarrassed and overwhelmed, I walked on into the cold light of an October dawn and found a little park. An old lady was walking her shivering dog. Puppy and I looked at each other in mirrored misery. Giving up, going away, I walked to the harbor and caught the overnight boat to Estonia.
The very next day an egg hatched and the travel bug that crawled out bit me so hard I must have bitten it back. From there my life took an unexpected path that felt better than anything before it, though it took some years to notice. Today that path has me back in Stockholm to lead another tour of the job I love. Every time I come back to this city (any city) I enjoy getting to know it better, but I never considered that park, held in my memory but lost to a long-ago lack of a map, much less a clue.
Until tonight, meandering home to the hotel, when I crossed a little park and felt the shock of recognition in the soft summer air. I sat on the bench where I rested my overloaded pack those many years ago, and marveled at all of it. An old lady was walking a dog. Puppy and I looked at each other with mirrored playful joy.
Travel has always taken me forward, in more ways than one, and I applaud the universe with great claps of gratitude. But travel is not an accomplishment. It’s just something you do if it’s right for you. I smile the insider smile with any of you who already know that.
Now, questions of privilege demand answers, the zeitgeist of our age. But I think a lot of people are too convinced by the burdensome “you can’t travel now, you have to work work work.” And it has to be said that human beings are good at staying within our comfort zones, to our own detriment.
Do you know anyone who needs a little push? Perhaps someone snug in the complacency of obedience, for whom the sound of that stamp landing in their passport will forever after echo as the starting pistol to run into a fuller experience of life? Is it you?
That pistol sounded for me, and looking back at it from that park bench, 16 years into my marathon, I am so glad it did. Nice to see you again, Stockholm.

I could see Stockholm’s famous city hall and tower across Riddarfjärden bay from my island of Gamla Stan. Completed in 1923, the complex is famous for hosting Sweden’s Nobel Prize banquet each year in December.
Tours were provided in English on the hour so I hiked across the Centralbron (central bridge) and joined a small group headed inside. The building was still the working hub of Stockholm municipal services so the only way to experience the interior was through the tour (pretty sure I’m not going to win a Nobel Prize any time soon).
We walked through the Blue Hall where the Nobel Prize banquet is held for 1,300 guests including that year’s winners, their invites (each winner gets 15), the Swedish Royal family and Sweden’s Prime Minister.
The Nobel Foundation awards prizes in the fields of Physics, Chemistry, Physiology/Medicine, Literature and, most famously, Peace as depicted below. Can you guess which figure represents which award?
I appreciated many of the Swedish historical details within the building but there were many I didn’t quite grasp. Unfortunately the tour moved quickly so I could only snap a few pics and plan on researching later.
I especially liked the Rådsalen where the city council worked. The architect back in the 1920s had planned for a formal ceiling but when he saw the exposed wooden beams during construction, he changed course and capped the chamber in a striking Viking theme:
The most impressive room was aptly named the Golden Hall. Eighteen million gilded tiles covered the walls and formed mosaics depicting Swedish history. There were plenty of Vikings, medieval characters and creatures from Nordic lore. It was interesting that secular and not religious themes were expressed.
The centerpiece was a massive mosaic covering the back wall dominated by a seated woman. She represented the city of Stockholm with the region’s midnight sun above her head and waters at her feet.
Stockholm is depicted at the center of the earth with the western world on one side and the eastern world on the other. You could see how 1920s Swedes idealized America complete with skyscrapers, the Statue of Liberty, the Stars and Stripes, Native Americans and the White Star Line:
The weather had improved dramatically from the blustery conditions yesterday so I took the opportunity to explore more of the city. Many Stockholmers evidently had the same idea and were out walking, ice skating and enjoying their traditional Fika.
Hiking back toward Gamla Stan, I passed Sweden’s Parliament building, the Riksdag, guarded by Egyptian lions. Traditionally-neutral Sweden is a member of the EU but chose against using the Euro. However, I probably won’t touch any Swedish kronor since this is basically a cashless society. You use your card everywhere, even for a coffee.
……….

Most Italians head to the stunning seaside for their summer vacations, but we were looking to add not shed layers, so we headed north to the land of cinnamon buns and paternity leave. Hej, Sweden!
In the weeks leading up to our trip, it appeared we might not get the cool breezes and leg-shaving respite that were so desired. Perhaps due to that #FakeNews climate change conspiracy, Sweden had its hottest July in at least 260 years. Wildfires were raging, stores sold out of fans (we had multiple Stockholmers tell us of the Great Fan Sell Out of 2018), and farmers struggled to feed their animals.
This seems especially unfair to people like the Swedes who are notoriously eco-conscious. Our Airbnb hosts said the country actually ran out of trash at one point and had to purchase foreign rubbish to continue heating homes.
Then, the day after we arrived, we were grateful to be shivering in a downpour and inhaling that fresh Nordic air of 65–75 F (18–24 C) throughout the week. So, putting aside worries about our planet for a moment, here are a few tips from our week-long Swedish vacay, should you pop over there one day or merely wish to have some mild distraction until your toothbrush vibrates at the two-minute mark.
Watch Welcome to Sweden, an unjustly cancelled TV series that features cross-cultural misunderstandings, family drama, expat shenanigans, and transatlantic love — gee, I wonder why we connected with it. Bonus: guest appearances by Amy Poehler, Aubrey Plaza and Will Ferrell.
On this trip, four years after watching the series and one day after re-watching it, we see one of the actors get off at our bus stop in Stockholm. I am starstruck and briefly consider shouting, “Birger! Welcome to Sweden!” But I can only squeeze Alberto’s arm and breathlessly say, “Oh my god, guarda, guarda,” and then Alberto’s eyes bulge, too. I turn into a paparazzo and take pictures of him as he walks away. Thank you, Claes Månsson, for being a literal one in a million Stockholm encounter.
I did some more digging after we got home and found that Swedish fathers indeed have the highest use of parental leave in the world and that in 1974 Sweden became “the first welfare democracy to introduce paid parental leave (föräldraledighet) to both parents. This law signals that fathers should take greater responsibility in caring for their young children, that children possess the right to have access to both their parents, and that fathers should facilitate mothers’ return to and involvement in paid work after having a child.” Read this Slate article to swoon (and bemoan your own country) some more: Americans Love Seeing Swedish Dads Out With Their Kids (ICYMI blog post: Motherhood from Italy to Taiwan
We stayed in an impeccably styled and clean Airbnb just south of the city center in Gamla Enskede and about a 10 minute walk to the subway. It’s located in a residential area across the street from a park and has some nice restaurants nearby with no English menus — which means you’re unlikely to be in a tourist trap but the very kind server will have to read everything off to you lest you spend 15 minutes in Google Translate before deciding you actually don’t want to eat there at all. #Awkward
We walked or took public transportation (subway, tram, bus, boat) everywhere. Public transit was very clean, reliable and convenient; a week pass is about 30 euros. It would have been cheaper and more ambitious of us to rent bikes, as recommended by many people, but the combination of rain, laziness and cinnamon buns was a deterrent.
We did three free Stockholm walking tours — Stockholm City, Gamla Stan (Old Town) and Stockholm Subway Art, and they were a great way to get acquainted with the city as well as learn more about Swedish history and culture. Tips are encouraged (in any currency) at the end of the tour.
Pro tip: Don’t withdraw any cash in the local Swedish Krona (SEK). Stockholm is on its way to going cash-free and some places will only accept cards anyway.
As mentioned above, Stockholm’s subway system is an art gallery in itself. You can go with a tour group (here’s the offical SL tour; we did a different one) to see a few of the hot spot stations and get a brief explanation, or you can go admire them on your own. Our tour guide suggested the following stations but 90+ of them have artwork, so you’re bound to run into a few even accidentally:
Blue line
Green line
Red line
Our guide said the art was commissioned as a way to lure apprehensive Swedes underground (post World War II) to use this new, potentially dangerous form of transportation. I later read on several sites that this underground exhibition was the result of a political and cultural movement in the late 1950s to make art more accessible to your average citizen and not just the Swedish elite. The official SL site notes the following motivations: beauty, safety, station identity/navigation, and vandalism reduction. Whatever the reasoning for bringing more art into the world…
It’s the same old story: a guy wanted to prove he had bigger balls than another guy — and then his hastily constructed warship sank on its maiden voyage; King Gustav just had to wave his mast in the air. Now, you and I can go gape at a massive 17th century ship that was underwater for 333 years.
Pro tip: Dress in layers. It seems sub-zero temps are necessary to preserve the artifact.
This was an interesting, well-designed photography museum and a perfect place to spend a rainy afternoon. It also has a nice cafe/restaurant upstairs with a great view of the city.
Since this royal castle from the 1600s is the king and queen’s permanent residence, they don’t grant you full access, making the interior visit shorter than expected, but it’s beautiful and the palace gardens and Chinese Pavilion are a peaceful place to amble around or have a picnic.
It was free, there were very few tourists, and the woman who founded it was doing things that a woman of her time was not supposed to do, because it interfered with duties like embroidery and shutting up. So obviously, I liked it. Or, as the museum put it, “Among women during the 1890s, Wilhelmina was quite alone in her pursuits, and she walked a fine line of what was considered appropriate for a woman of her station to devote her time to.” Cheers, Wilhelmina von Hallwyl.
Famous for being the venue of the Nobel Prize banquet plus for its grand ceremonial halls and artwork (the gold mosaic room was my favorite), the City Hall offers tours (mandatory) in several languages. It’s a popular place to get married and has a six-month waiting list; supposedly Swedes can choose between the short (two-minute) or long (four-minute) ceremony.
I was hoping to learn more about Nordic culture and history but the exhibits failed to engage us (or maybe we were coming down from a sugar high). Like, I couldn’t look at one more antique Swedish chair; I have been to IKEA five times this year already. It was interesting to learn about the Sami in Sweden, an indigenous people who have lived in the Arctic region for thousands of years.
It was our last day in Stockholm and we had limited time and attention spans left, but it’s a free museum so we popped in for an hour (only enough time to walk through the Vikings exhibit and a few others) and then ran to get one last cinnamon roll before the airport bus left.
If you’re an indoor cat who doesn’t like bugs or being wet, below are some “outdoorsy” activities we suggest. If you’re into fishing, camping, swimming, deep hiking or kayaking, we are useless to you. But, Sweden is not! They have the Right of Public Access (‘Allemansrätt’) which means you have “the right to walk, cycle, ride, ski and camp on any land with the exception of private gardens, near a dwelling house or land under cultivation.”
The medieval city center where Stockholm was founded in 1252 might be annoyingly crammed with tourists in the summer, but it’s a picturesque area to roam about.
This is a World Heritage Site cemetery where the designers wanted nature — majestic trees and rolling hills — to shine rather than the headstones. Going back to that theme of equality, it’s “impossible” to have giant burial monuments, like you’d see in Italy, for example. The legendary actress Greta Garbo is buried here; her tombstone is modest, but they gave her quite a respectful perimeter, not laying anyone to rest nearby.
Pro tip: There’s a free audio guide via your phone, so you don’t need to pay for a tour if you’re interested in its history.
Vaxholm is an archipelago town you can reach via boat from Stockholm — a nice, leisurely water ride that’s an attraction in itself. There’s the Vaxholm Castle/Fortress and the nearby Bogesunds Castle, but we didn’t tour either of them. It had quite a sleepy vibe when we were there, and we didn’t do anything except have a nice lunch at the waterfront Boulangerie Bageri & Café. The archipelago is made up of 30,000 islands, so have your pick.
This Stockholm city island is full of museums and sights, but it also has great nature areas and paths. Have a cinnamon bun and coffee on Helin’s terrace overlooking the water and then take a walk on the path leading east. Go to the garden behind Rosendal Palace and you might see dogs herding sheep along the water below. Adorbs.
Wear good shoes, and bring a bottle of wine and some snacks to watch the sunset on this rocky hilltop overlooking the water and city.
Another popular lookout point/path for your 360 photos, one Stockholm resident confirmed Monteliusvägen was one of his go-to date wooing spots.
A tranquil place for a stroll where you can peer at ducks and kayakers, near the end of this path you can grab a bite or drink at Solstugan, which has a nice deck with a view of the sea.
Look, I loved my time with you, Sweden, but I’m coming from THE Land of Food, and I never expected for you to delight me as much as the Italians do with their delicacies, so I’m not mad at you or anything. You did great with what you had and what I could stumble upon as a clueless tourist. Also, it’s my fault I don’t like salmon or herring. Phew, glad we got that out of the way.
That being said, here are a few traditional Swedish foods and places that did delight us. Plus, Swedish bars and restaurants don’t make you buy water like they do in Italy — yay for free, delicious tap water!
They say the Swedes invented cinnamon buns, so we thought it culturally sensitive that we eat 1–2 per day. They are a bit less dense and creamy than the ones in the U.S., no globs of frosting on top, and typically also contain cardamom in the dough. Our favorite buns were at Grand Cafe on the water in Blasieholmen and Café Kronan in Gamla Stan, but we weren’t disappointed with any of the other buns, except at a place a British tour guide recommended. Did Brexit bust your sense of taste too, bro?
We accompanied most of these buns with a cup of Swedish coffee, which was almost always delicious. Did you know Swedes are the second biggest coffee drinkers after the Finns?! We definitely perfected the art of the Swedish fika, a mandatory (for good life balance) coffee break accompanied by sweets like kanelbulle. Over the dark winter days when Nordic folk get so little light or warmth, one can easily understand why such a cozy, caffeinated tradition exists.
Kryp In Restaurant Prästgatan 17 (Gamla Stan)
Any loyal IKEA shopper knows that Swedish meatballs are a thing, but I don’t think I’ve ever actually eaten them there. In Stockholm, I only ate them once, and they were paired with the traditional lingonberries and mashed potatoes. My mom’s meatballs are better (she’s Italian American after all), but I was satisfied nevertheless.
“What?! Santa’s little helper?!” I exclaimed when Alberto said he was ordering the reindeer. “Yeah, he helps you survive the Nordic winter!”
I can’t remember the name (Swedish is hard, y’all), but we were also served a delicious “delicacy bread” prior to the meal, that included ingredients like potato, cardamom and syrup.
So, this first lunch was probably the most traditional, and after that, we felt some freedom to not eat “authentically Swedish” for the rest of the trip, aside from the daily buns of course.
We stumbled upon this place in the midst of a chilly rain shower and frantic Google Map search for dining options. The friendly server guided us into a cozy cave-like corner lit by candles and deep red walls. I later read in our host’s Lonely Planet Pocket Stockholm guidebook that it was a recommended spot. Score!
Our host also recommended Meatballs for the People as the best place in town for this traditional dish, but we couldn’t get a table. Or, if you don’t want to bother at all with being “authentic,” I present the following: “Swedish meatballs are actually based on a recipe King Charles XII brought home from Turkey in the early 18th century.”
Hej hej + tack very much, Sweden!

Stockholm, the vibrant capital of Sweden, is a city that offers more than just stunning architecture and picturesque waterfronts. For the food enthusiast, Stockholm is a haven of culinary delights waiting to be discovered. A culinary journey as varied as its seasons awaits you in Stockholm, where you can find everything from modern, inventive food to centuries-old, traditional meals.
Stockholm’s weather plays a significant role in shaping its culinary landscape. The city experiences four distinct seasons, each offering a unique bounty of ingredients that inspire chefs and home cooks alike.
Spring (Vår)
As winter recedes, Stockholm awakens with a burst of fresh flavors. Spring brings a sense of renewal, reflected in the dishes that grace tables across the city. Look for dishes featuring the tender, young shoots of asparagus, the first harvests of flavorful wild garlic, and the delicate sweetness of freshly sprouted peas. In restaurants and homes, you might find classics like ‘Vårkänslor’ (Spring Feelings), a dish celebrating the season with new potatoes, pickled herring, and sour cream.
Summer (Sommar)
Stockholm summers are a time of abundance, with long days that seem to stretch endlessly into twilight. This season brings a bounty of berries — lingonberries, blueberries, and the coveted wild strawberries. These berries find their way into jams, desserts, and savory dishes alike. Seafood shines in the summer, with crayfish parties (kräftskiva) a beloved tradition. Imagine tables filled with boiled crayfish, Västerbotten cheese pie, and crisp, fresh salads.
Autumn (Höst)
As the leaves turn golden and the air becomes crisp, Stockholm’s forests offer a treasure trove of mushrooms and game. Chanterelles, porcini, and the elusive ‘black gold’ of truffles make their way into hearty stews and creamy sauces. Autumn also marks the beginning of the apple and pear season, with orchards heavy with fruit. Indulge in warm apple pie topped with vanilla sauce or explore the savory side with pork dishes accompanied by tart apple compote.
Winter (Vinter)
Winter transforms Stockholm into a winter wonderland, with snow-covered streets and a cozy atmosphere. It’s a time for hearty, warming meals that fortify against the cold. Classic dishes like ‘Ärtsoppa med Pannkakor’ (Pea Soup with Pancakes) are a comforting staple, especially on Thursdays, a tradition dating back to the 15th century. Rich, meaty stews like ‘Köttbullar’ (Swedish meatballs) served with lingonberry sauce evoke cozy evenings by the fire.
While exploring Stockholm’s culinary landscape, one encounters a blend of tradition and innovation. The city has a deep-rooted respect for its culinary heritage, evident in dishes that have stood the test of time. Yet, Stockholm’s chefs are also at the forefront of culinary innovation, constantly pushing boundaries while maintaining a focus on local, seasonal ingredients.
Smörgåsbord: A quintessential Swedish dining experience, featuring a vast array of dishes from pickled herring to cured meats, cheeses, and savory pies.
Gravlax: This cured salmon dish, typically served with dill and mustard sauce, is a celebration of the city’s abundant seafood.
Surströmming: For the adventurous, this fermented herring is a pungent delicacy best experienced outdoors due to its potent aroma.
New Nordic Cuisine: Inspired by the principles of using local, sustainable ingredients, this movement has put Stockholm on the global culinary map. Restaurants like the renowned “Fäviken” and “Oaxen Krog” epitomize this ethos.
Foraging Culture: With access to pristine forests and coastline, foraging plays a significant role in Stockholm’s cuisine. Chefs and home cooks alike venture into the wild to gather ingredients like wild herbs, berries, and mushrooms, adding a fresh, earthy dimension to their dishes.
Exploring Stockholm’s cuisine goes beyond just tasting the food. It’s about immersing oneself in the culture that surrounds it. Visit local markets, such as Östermalms Saluhall or Söderhallarna, where vendors proudly display their fresh produce, meats, cheeses, and seafood. Engage with locals to learn about family recipes passed down through generations, or join in seasonal celebrations like Midsummer, where traditional foods are central to the festivities.
No exploration of Stockholm’s culture would be complete without experiencing ‘fika’. More than just a coffee break, fika is a cherished tradition of pausing, savoring a hot beverage (usually coffee or tea), and enjoying a sweet treat. Indulge in cinnamon buns (kanelbullar), cardamom-scented cakes, or almond tarts as you join Stockholmers in this daily ritual of relaxation and socializing.
In conclusion, Stockholm’s culinary scene is a tapestry woven with the threads of tradition, innovation, and the rich bounty of its seasons. Whether you’re savoring the tangy sweetness of lingonberries in summer or warming up with a steaming bowl of pea soup in winter, every bite tells a story of this beautiful city. So, pack your curiosity and appetite, and embark on a culinary journey through Stockholm — you’ll discover a world of flavors waiting to be explored.

On Stairs, Frescoes, and the Art of Rewriting
If you ever find yourself wandering the streets of Stockholm, do what I did — look up.
On a recent visit, I found myself standing before the stern, red-bricked silhouette of Stockholm’s City Hall. From the outside, it’s all weight and authority, but step inside and you’ll discover a world of meticulous design and unexpected artistry.
The Architect’s Obsession — Stairs Fit for a Queen
The story goes that Ragnar Östberg, the mastermind behind City Hall, was obsessed with getting every detail right. Not just the grand arches or the towering spire, but even the stairs.
He wanted the queen to descend them with absolute grace during the Nobel banquet.
So what did he do?
He had his wife walk up and down different prototypes of the staircase, again and again, until she was utterly sick of it.
All so that, on that one night, the queen (and every guest after her) would glide, not stumble.

Stockholm doesn’t try to compete with Europe’s biggest tech hubs on volume or visibility. It doesn’t need to. Underneath the surface, the city has built one of the continent’s most efficient and credible early-stage ecosystems, and one that’s already outperforming on density, deal quality, and network speed. But while early-stage momentum is real, there’s a catch: scale is harder. And the late-stage gap is starting to show.
Start with the fundamentals. Stockholm has around 2,500 startups. That may not sound impressive next to London’s 25,000 or Berlin’s 6,000, but raw numbers miss the point. With just 2.5 million people, Stockholm has one of the highest startup densities in Europe. Only London and Amsterdam are higher per capita. The city is tied with Berlin and well ahead of Paris, Zurich, Munich, and Madrid. This isn’t an ecosystem chasing scale for its own sake, but one that is focused on concentration, repeatability, and results. It also produces some of the most successful start-ups, as it ranks #2 in unicorns per capita in Europe (only behind Estonia)
It helps that the basics are sorted. Sweden has one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the EU at 20.6%. R&D incentives are real. The visa process, while imperfect, is smoother than in many neighboring countries. Founders can incorporate, hire, and launch without running into structural friction. That’s not true everywhere in Europe.
But regulation is only part of the story. What really makes Stockholm work is the network. The ecosystem is compact and layered. Founders, angels, VCs, private organizations (like Nordic Angels) and public-sector players operate in close proximity, quite literally. Relationships are short-range and high-frequency. Two intros are usually enough to reach anyone. It speeds everything up: hiring, fundraising, product feedback and decision-making.
Especially the angel community is functioning well. According to the recent Nordic Angels & BCG report I co-authored, Stockholm leads the region in both deal activity and investor depth. Nearly 600 active angels operate in the city, and many of them repeat founders or early operators from companies like Klarna, Spotify, and iZettle. That experience compounds. New teams benefit from old playbooks. Capital comes with context.
VC behavior reflects the broader market shift. Global dry powder is high, but deployment is cautious and conviction-driven. That suits Stockholm. The companies being built here tend to be leaner, more international, and capital-efficient. Local funds like Creandum, EQT Ventures, and Northzone are still writing early checks. And when the metrics are strong, international investors are showing up (like Accel, Sequioa, et. al.). The pipeline is healthy. The bar is high.
But not everything is working.
The late-stage environment hasn’t kept up. Series B and C rounds are regularly led by foreign investors (e.g., recently for Legora), often requiring founders to relocate teams, shift strategy, or change how they operate. When the capital isn’t local, neither is the upside. Value leaks. Talent disperses. Ecosystem effects weaken. Some of Stockholm’s most promising startups are scaling in other geographies. Not by choice, but by necessity. The ecosystem in Stockholm hasn’t quite caught up to this yet.
Capital is one challenge: Unlike in some neighboring countries, Sweden doesn’t have a strong state-backed co-investment model at the Series B and C level (but Sweden does have them in earlier stages). There’s no domestic equivalent to Finland’s Tesi or Denmark’s Vækstfonden. Those institutions actively anchor larger rounds and keep value creation local.
Senior talent is another challenge. While the city has no shortage of strong engineers and early hires, there’s a gap in commercial leadership. Experienced sales, product, and executive operators are in short supply and current stock option tax rules don’t help on retention either (the stock option tax rules are beneficial for early-stage startups, but less so for later stages). It’s workable, but it’s not competitive with ecosystems like London or Tallinn.
Diversity is still lagging. Female and underrepresented founders raise a small fraction of total capital (all-women teams represented 6.1% of all funding rounds in the Nordics in 2022 and 2023, but received only 1.2% of the total capital). It’s not unique to Stockholm, but it’s persistent. Progress is being made, but slowly. It’s an area where the city could and should lead but hasn’t yet. Diversity isn’t just social, it’s strategic. Stockholm risks missing out on market upside without more inclusive capital flows and accessing the full breadth of ideas.
And cost of living is creeping up. For junior hires, early-stage teams, or international founders trying to get started, Stockholm is no longer cheap. It hasn’t hit London levels, but it’s moving in that direction, and that friction is already starting to show.
Still, the early-stage engine is real. Stockholm’s ecosystem isn’t built on noise. It’s built on high-quality inputs: credible talent, disciplined capital, and a regulatory environment that mostly gets out of the way. Founders here are building with focus, and investors are backing with precision. That’s rare in any cycle, and especially in this one.
Stockholm’s AI startup scene is also starting to show depth. Early movers like Sana didn’t just secure funding and traction, but they helped define what AI-native startups can look like in B2B and infrastructure-heavy verticals. More importantly, they trained talent, validated use cases, and proved that it’s possible to build globally relevant AI companies out of Sweden. That groundwork is now fueling a second wave of startups, with emerging players like Legora (legal AI), Lovable (AI-powered app development platform), and others are coming to market with sharp focus and strong teams. The ecosystem’s early bets are compounding. What started with a few AI-first companies is evolving into a broader, more durable platform for applied AI innovation. Stockholm may not be chasing scale at any cost, but in AI, it’s starting to set the pace.
For investors, especially at the growth stage, this is a signal. Stockholm’s early-stage pipeline is functioning. But the gap in late-stage capital creates an opening. Companies that are raising follow-ons are often forced to look outside. That introduces pressure on geography, on strategy, and on exit dynamics. For funds willing to lean in earlier, build local relationships, and back high-quality teams before they cross borders, Stockholm is exactly where to be looking. For funds willing to underwrite scale on local terms, Stockholm might offer an arbitrage in talent, timing, and trust.
What’s missing isn’t ambition or ideas to create the next unicorns, but some infrastructure. And unless more of it develops, Stockholm risks exporting the very companies it helped create.

In the north part of Europe, surrounded by hills, endless forests, and a never-ending coastline lies the city of Stockholm, capital of Scandinavia. The whole of Scandinavia agreed on that name by the way. Technically we didn’t ask Norway, Finland and Denmark if it’s okay that we’re the capital, but we’re like 99% sure they’re okay with it.
I have lived here all my life. I love it here. It’s like being in San Francisco but with fewer unicorns and less sun. Since I'm recruiting people from all over the world and convincing them to move here I get a lot of questions about life here:
“Should I work there?”
“Can I fly to London over the day?”
“Will ABBA ever reunite?”
So here is my experience. I hope I can give an authentic look into what our cold, dark corner of the world has to offer.
My day begins when I wake up in my apartment on Kungshomen. Kungsholmen is one of the three main islands in Stockholm. From there I stroll along the water to work in the city center. It takes about 25 minutes. Unfortunately, the housing market here is a bit of a disaster, so unless you enjoy changing which apartment you sublet every month or have $350k to buy your own place you are stuck taking the bus or a train into the city center like a regular peasant.
Speaking of water, Stockholm is surrounded by it. Anywhere you go you will see water. The water is supposedly clean enough to drink. I have not tried it myself since I value my life, but there are YouTube videos of people doing it.
Nobody takes the car. Thanks to some of highest taxes in the world, cars are expensive, and besides, people here believe that if you drive to work you hate the environment and wish all animals a slow and painful death. Biking to work is a good choice. There are biking lanes everywhere. Apart from saving the planet and giving you daily exercise it also signals that you live inside of the city. Preferably get a colorful bike to maximize the attention as you ride down the city streets.
Your most important decision of the morning is where you stop to buy your café latte. I don’t drink it myself since I do paleo, but the way I understand it, it’s coffee flavored hot milk. If you work at a startup you can buy coffee at any place: both Il Café and Johan & Nyström are acceptable choices.
Our office is based in an area called city center. It’s named so because the people naming it were officially out of ideas. Nearby is the cultural house which was built as a tribute to Soviet communism.
I work out of a startup hub called “SUP46”. SUP is Swedish for “drink excessive amounts of alcohol” and 46 is the country code of Sweden. So the name literally translates to “get drunk in Sweden”. Something many people have taken to heart.
SUP46 is not just an office but also a community since it has an “event space”. During evenings, there is often free food and beer in the event space. Sometimes someone is talking in a microphone and showing powerpoint slides while you eat which can be distracting. But I’m sure people are working on fixing that.
There are a few other startup hubs, the most prominent being THINGS, which as the name implies, gives you free things.
Most people, yours truly included, work in an open office space. Your choice of clothes is important since people will be seeing you walking back and forth to the coffee machine. If you are male you should probably grow a beard.
Choice of laptop also says a lot about you.
Other companies at SUP46 are Fishbrain, which based on the name must be working on creating sentient fish and Sparta which I believe are organizing a live event where they re-enact Sparta the movie.
The most famous company in Stockholm is called Spotify. They play music and collect your personal data. It is also Europe’s most famous startup. If your CV contains the word Spotify it means you can get a job at any company at any level in Europe because you are now an expert in “digital”. There is also a company called Mojang. Nobody knows if it is an actual startup or if it’s just one guy that created a game called Minecraft and sold it to Microsoft for $2.5bn or a practical joke played by the guys behind King. Either way, we’re counting it as a unicorn.
Apart from Spotify and Mojang there are five other unicorns: Mysql, Skype, King.com, Klarna and Truecaller. Technically you could also count Russian auction site Avito.ru which was founded by two Swedes in Moscow. Before starting Avito the founders had started and sold the largest European auction site Tradera to Ebay. As part of the transaction the nice people at Ebay said “look guys, you are on your own now but don’t go start a new company or our lawyers will hunt you down” and they were like “oh but COME ON, we have to do SOMETHING, you guys are not in Russia so at least let us start a company there?”. Ebay went “lol, enjoy Soviet Russia you commies” and the rest is history. It is incidentally also the reason why Ebay’s employment agreements have changed the term “not start a competitor anywhere in the world except Russia” to “ not start a competitor anywhere in the known universe”.
The fact that Stockholm has seven unicorns while London, a city with ten times the population, only has twice the number of unicorns is basically Swedish socialism’s subtle way of giving the middle finger to the British labour party. Some people argue that Sweden has unicorns despite being socialistic not thanks to it, but I digress.
Stockholm is a special place. In the summer we swim in the warm water, in the winter we ice skate on it. We remain a thorn in the side of free market theorists by producing the highest number of unicorns per capita after San Francisco despite offering free schools and universal free healthcare.
We also love everything US and have one the biggest country subreddits to prove it. The most upvoted post last year was a picture of an Ukranian literature professor who looks like Swedish football hero Zlatan Ibrahimovich.
If you want to experience it for yourself several companies are hiring, including myself, that help with relocation. Or as ABBA said:
“If you change your mind, I’m the first in lineHoney I’m still freeTake a chance on me”
If you already work here, stop wasting your time reading this and do something productive like paying more taxes.
(Big thanks to the guys over at Padlet.com for inspiring me to write this. If you decide to work in SF you should probably work for them).

“Stockholmers call their city ‘beauty on water’. But despite the well-preserved historic core, Stockholm is no museum piece: it’s modern, dynamic and ever-evolving.” (Lonely Planet)
14 islands and 57 bridges. But what should I visit?
Before describing my 48-hour experience, let me introduce you to the history of this marvellous city by the hand of localhistories.org:
The great city of Stockholm began in the 13th century. At that time trade and commerce were increasing across Europe and many new towns were founded. In 1252 the regent of Sweden, Birger Jarl founded Stockholm. The new town grew rapidly. In 1289 it was described as the largest place in Sweden, although it would seem very small to us. By 1500 Stockholm was a flourishing town of about 6,000 people.
Then in 1520 came the Stockholm Bloodbath. The king of Denmark invaded Sweden in 1519. In 1520 he captured Stockholm and he had more than 80 Swedish nobles executed for heresy. However the Swede Gustav Vasa recaptured Stockholm in 1523.
During the 17th century Sweden was a great power in Europe. Stockholm grew rapidly and by the end of the century it had a population of around 50,000. Riddarhuset, The House of Nobility was built between 1641 and 1674.
However in 1710–1711 there was an outbreak of plague in Stockholm which killed many people. Yet Stockholm recovered and it flourished during the 18th century. Tullgarn Palace was built about 1720. The Royal Palace opened in 1754. The Obelisk was erected in 1799. Also in 1799 the statue of King Gustav III was sculpted.
In the late 19th century Sweden was transformed from an agricultural society to an industrial one. In 1850 Stockholm had a population of 93,000 and it continued to rise rapidly. By the beginning of the 20th century it had reached 300,000.
However in the mid 19th century Stockholm was an unhealthy place. There were no sewers or piped water supply. But all that changed. Stockholm gained gas light in 1853. In the 1860s a piped water supply was created. The National Museum was built in 1866. Stockholm Central Railway Station was built in 1871. Horse drawn trams began running in Stockholm in 1877. The first electric trams ran in 1901. Meanwhile Stockholm University was founded in 1877. The Swedish Army Museum opened in 1879. Skansen open air museum opened in 1891. The Biological Museum opened in 1893. Stockholm Music Museum was founded in 1899.
During the 20th century Stockholm continued to flourish. The Postal Museum opened in 1906 and the Nordic Museum was built in 1907. The Museum of National Antiquities opened in 1943. Meanwhile Parliament House was built in 1905 and City Hall was built in 1923. Stockholm escaped damage by bombing in the Second World War but in the mid 20th century a program began to modernise the city. Many old homes in Stockholm were demolished and replaced by new ones.
Today tourism is an important industry in Stockholm. The Museum of Dance opened in 1953. The Medieval Museum opened in 1986. A ship called The Vasa sank in 1628 but it was recovered in 1961 and is now on display in a museum. Today the population of Stockholm is 942,000.”

2. Checked-in at the budget Hotel Comfort Hotel Xpress Stockholm Central
3. Walked around Gamla Stan and had Swedish meatballs for dinner at Drottninggatan Street´s Pickwick Restaurang & Pub.
We did the Maths and booked the Stockholm Pass which included the main attractions we wanted to visit (1 Day Adult Pass: SEK 580.50)
There’s no better way to see the sights of Stockholm than with a free Hop On Hop Off bus, which we used to get us to the following places we chose to visit on Saturday taking advantage of the Stockholm Pass.
A way to quickly explore the three islands that compose the city center.
One of the biggest cultural treasures in Sweden — the warship Vasa that sank in 1628 on its maiden voyage from Stockholm.
Nordiska Museet (idea for next time)
Founded in 1891, Skansen is the world’s first open-air museum. Located on the island of Djurgården and close to the Vasa museum, Skansen offers a fascinating look into historical Swedish life. Recreates the life of the 19th century.
The palace dates back to the 18th century and is one of the most interesting historic buildings in Stockholm. The biggest royal palace in the world with 600 rooms. Changing of the guards take place daily at noon.
Get familiarised with the stunning scenery of Stockholm’s archipelago on a guided 3 hour boat tour. Experience the city from the water, learn about the history and be inspired by the beauty of Stockholm’s natural landscape.
Lovely cafes, restaurants, souvenir and antique shops.
Aifur Krog & Bar
We said yes to the Viking dining experience at this underground traditional live music restaurant. Candle-light warm atmosphere, big shared tables and exquisite Swedish specialities: mussels in a creamy sauce, baked salmon and venison steaks with veggies and potatoes.
Having traditional “Fika”, a Swedish coffee-break with fresh baked cakes and pastries at Vetekatten.
Sunday morning Market at Hötorget (Haymarket Square): fresh fruits and vegetables, new and second hand crafts and clothes.
Yes, again to see the rest of the city and learn some more of its history.
“Alfred Bernhard Nobel
21 October 1833
Stockholm, Sweden–Norway
Died 10 December 1896 (aged was a Swedish chemist, engineer, inventor, businessman, and philanthropist.
“Known for inventing dynamite, Nobel also owned Bofors, which he had redirected from its previous role as primarily an iron and steel producer to a major manufacturer of cannon and other armaments. Nobel held 355 different patents, dynamite being the most famous. After reading a premature obituary which condemned him for profiting from the sales of arms, he bequeathed his fortune to institute the Nobel Prizes.”
Estimates of ABBA’s total record sales are at least 400 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time.
Time to take off back home…

“Sweden is a country that has taken its culture and turned it into a brand.” – Bjorn Ulvaeus
I am exchange student with Geography background and I had always been fascinated by the unique culture and landscapes of Sweden. In January 2011, I arrived in Stockholm to begin a six-month adventure that would take me through the coldest winter days and the longest nights I had ever experienced.
At first, the darkness and the cold were a shock to my system. Coming from a tropical climate, the idea of walking to class in -20°C temperatures was daunting. But as I settled into my routine and began to explore the city, I found myself falling in love with the Swedish way of life.
One of the things that struck me the most about Swedish culture was the emphasis on sustainability and environmental stewardship. From the public transportation system to the recycling system in supermarkets, it was clear that sustainability was a top priority amongst the Swedes. As a Geography student, this was particularly inspiring, and I found myself incorporating these principles into my own daily life.
Another aspect of Swedish culture that I appreciated was the emphasis on work-life balance. Swedes take their time off seriously, and it’s not uncommon to see people taking a midday fika (coffee break) or leaving work early to spend time with family and friends. This was a refreshing change of pace from the workaholic culture that I was used to, and it allowed me to prioritize my own well-being and mental health.
Of course, as an exchange student, I also had my fair share of funny and memorable experiences. One of the highlights was celebrating Christmas with my Swedish host family, who introduced me to traditional Swedish delicacies like julbord (Christmas buffet) and glögg (mulled wine). I also had the opportunity to explore the city’s many museums, parks, and cafes, and to meet other exchange students from all over the world.
My six months in Stockholm were a transformative experience that allowed me to immerse myself in a unique culture and to learn from the people and landscapes of Sweden. From the coldest winter days to the warmest moments of connection, I will always cherish the memories and insights that I gained during my time here.

Sweden is famous for well-designed furniture, beautiful women and functional socialism. A sub-scale barren country which has somehow produced iconic global businesses like IKEA and H&M. As a tourist destination, I wasn’t sure what to expect, but assumed the place would be easy on the eye.
In early February, the sky is glum and the hours of daylight reduced, but the prettiness of Stockholm remains striking. It was cold, but not intolerable, hovering between -2 and 2 degrees Celsius. The thing to do in Stockholm in winter is drink coffee (fika in Swedish). The locals spend their days lazing in the warm, well designed Espresso House cafes. Think Starbucks with better furniture, a more nuanced color scheme and better coffee. You can’t escape them. “Why are there so many Espresso House cafes, is it a Swedish brand?” I asked the teenager behind the counter. “Yes, there are six of them on this street I think. Some Germans bought the company, and they are expanding into other Scandinavian countries, Germany and the Netherlands, it’s like another war plan” he responded, in a mocking German accent. Funny, but unlikely to be awarded Employee of the Month by his new paymasters.
If you go to Stockholm expecting to see wall-to-wall knock-out barely dressed Shield Maidens, you’ll be disappointed. Stockholm is a very multi-cultural place, filled with practically dressed typically dark haired women. The stereotypical well-tanned blue eyed, blonde, knee-buckling knock-out exists, but they are uncommon.
Stockholm is brimming with museums and galleries, exploring everything from Vikings and Sami culture to design and human rights. A highlight is the Vasa Museum in Galärvarvsvägen, visited by 1.4 million people each year. The Museum was purpose built around the Vasa, a 69 metre-long 17th century wooden ship. A 1,200 tonne war machine, with 64 cannons over two levels, ten sails and 120 tonnes of ballast. A brutal expression of Sweden’s desire to conquer new territories. “F&$k me” I muttered too loudly when I walked into the cavernous museum and saw the ship for the first time. An immense killing machine covered with hundreds of wooden sculptures. “How the hell did they build this back then?” I was thinking as I waited for my free guided tour to start.
The awe in which I held the 17th century ship builders was quickly diminished. The Vasa was a dud. The three year effort to build the ultimate war machine led to a twenty minute maiden voyage of 1.3km before it toppled in a light breeze. A colossal, embarrassing and undoubtedly expensive failure for the King.
The inquest following the sinking, brought to light that many people knew the ship was a dud, but it sailed anyway. The most shocking anecdote involved the captain overlooking the construction ordering thirty men to run back and forth along the deck in front of the Vice Admiral, when the ship was still in the port. The terrified Vice Admiral called a halt to the demonstration, as he thought the ship was going to sink. The ship was top heavy, badly proportioned and sat too high out of the water. Yet, no-one wanted to tell the King that the years of hard work and treasure had all gone to waste. Despite the loss of thirty lives, no-one was punished. The Dutch ship-builder had died during construction, and his widow who completed the project had already been paid. The King just wanted to forget about the debacle.
Swedish food is as basic as the Vasa is impressive. Meatballs and potatoes, plus a bit of fish and a few miniature prawns. Hearty food. Good for plundering, less so for the sedate modern lifestyle. Given the frigid winter and heavy diet, you’d expect the Swedes to be fatter.
The downside to travelling in Sweden is that it is frighteningly expensive. The Arlanda Express, a twenty minute train from the airport to the centre costs US$30. Take the cheaper forty minute bus ride with Flygbussarna and you are still shelling out US$13. Getting a basic meal below US$15 is tough, unless you want to eat hamburgers. I got charged US$3 for a glass of tap water when I ordered a steak.
But don’t let the jarring prices deter you. Stockholm is a must-see destination, even during the winter months.

by Sam Smith — Kiss House
Few things are cooler than tremendously hip Stockholm. Design centre and self-proclaimed capital of Scandinavia.
If cities were boyfriends (or girlfriends for that matter) then Stockholm is a keeper; successful, stylish, intelligent, fun yet super considerate. Marriage material for sure.
I recently spent the weekend here with my husband Ben and discovered that zipping about the city on two wheels like a local is the only way to get about. But I don’t mean on bicycles, I’m talking scooters, electric scooters.
Let’s be clear, we are both well into our 40’s but these are not for kids. Strictly over 18s only (ha!). Our kids had their own “mini-break” to Grandma’s house (happy face).
It is without a doubt the most fun I’ve had since turning adult and simply the BEST way to get the most out of a place. Admittedly, I need to work on my lefts and rights and remember that if you’re heading towards oncoming traffic, a bus is beeping at you and your husband is shouting at you, you’re probably on the wrong side of the road, but it was a great experience and I implore anyone to try it.
You may have seen pay as you go scooters popping up in various European cities. They first appeared in the US but Sweden is an early adopter and you can now find them in most Swedish cities. Never have London’s Boris (Santander) bikes seemed so dull. These are dockless so there’s no hunting around to locate / park, you literally jump on and off. A handy app finds them for you and signs you in and out with a simple scan.
Of course, it works well in Stockholm, with their spacious roads, pavements and seriously impressive route of cycle paths. Whizzing around at 20 kph, you see way more than you would on foot without missing a thing. There’s so much to love here. Where the old meets the new (and some interesting 70’s structures in between). There’s a lot of building work going on. The place is buzzing.
Effortless. Like it comes easy to them. But a city’s worth of cycle lanes takes a hell of a lot of planning and foresight. If we had the same in the UK I’d cycle (or scoot) everywhere and encourage my children to do the same — it’s just too dangerous, so we don’t!
We love Swedish design at Kiss House because so many of it’s values and principles align with ours. Known for its minimalism, simplicity and use of natural materials. The Swedish build quality, placing value on functionality as much as aesthetics with consideration to the environment, surely the cornerstones of all great modern design? They’ve long embraced ultra low energy builds. In fact, the two Professors responsible for developing the Passivhaus performance standard were a German physicist and a Swedish scientist.
Everything feels progressive here, considered. The air feels clean. It doesn’t surprise me that Stockholm is ranked one of the most eco-friendly cities in the world and Sweden one of the most sustainable countries.
Back in 2014, The Guardian reported on an innovative city funded high-rise project in the southern Swedish town of Växjö where two high-rises were built to the Passivhaus standard to help the country realise it’s goal of eliminating CO2 emissions by 2050. “Taking this route works very well for us as a municipality, since we want to become CO2 neutral, and homes account for 30% of energy use” explained Henrik Johansson, the city’s environmental coordinator. He added “even though the city has endured three extremely cold winters since the buildings went up, the apartments have not been cold”.
It’s the city’s most ambitious project but it’s no stranger to Passivhaus builds and even boasts a Passivhaus house style tennis complex built by former world no.1 player Stefan Edberg. Växjö’s city planners now face the dilemma of how to deal with the vast amounts of energy used by poorly insulated 1960’s and 70’s buildings, and how to make them more energy efficient or Passivhaus retrofit them. “Just another challenge to overcome” says Johansson (source: Elisabeth Braw: The Guardian).
The Swedes clearly know how to create great cities. Stockholm is a joy and is testament to their foresight and people centred design.
Whilst there zipping around, we had the benefit of recommendations from locals (because my husband is fortunate enough to spend time there for work). Below is our Top 10 things to See and Do.
2. Check out “The Future Starts Here” exhibition at Ark Des (in association with the V&A London) until 4th August 2019, a fascinating and thought-provoking exhibition about the world of tomorrow shaped by the designs and technologies emerging today.
3. Visit Fotografiska: A centre for contemporary photography housed in an old brick-built customs building
4. Check out Snösätra Graffiti Wall of Fame one of Europe’s largest graffiti exhibitions
5. Take a day cruise and experience the best parts of the beautiful Stockholm archipelago
6. Eat amazingly good Bengali Street Food at Gossip Shanti (be warned when the waiter says it’s hot, it’s HOT!)
7. Sample local cuisine in a Foodhall such as Östermalms Saluhall
8. Visit one of the city’s Roof Top bars such as Tak Stockholm
9. Mooch around cool independent boutiques and homeware stores, plus enjoy a stop-off in one of the eclectic cafes and bars in laidback Södermalm or SoFo
10. Stay in Downtown Camper by Scandic: A new first-class hotel with award winning design, rooftop bar, spa and rooftop pool as well as an excellent restaurant, Campfire.

“Life is always full of surprises”
For an Asian girl who never traveled to any European country before, the fact of moving from Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam) to Stockholm (Sweden) to live was never in my plan. However, life is always full of surprises, there are decisions we have to make, and some decisions are made for us. Moving to Stockholm has opened a brand new chapter of my life. Although I have been living here for just 11 months, there are so many things in Stockholm that I just fell in love with this city at first sight (and I’m sure you will).
After landing from the flight, I took the bus from Arlanda airport to Stockholm city. It took around 55 minutes from Arlanda airport to Stockholm City via Flygbuss with ticket price is 99 SEK (~10.3USD) for 1 round.
Firstly I was really impressed with how the city manages to preserve all the historical buildings. From churches to museums, government offices to schools, and even regular houses, Stockholm’s architecture is stunning
My friends told me that, in Stockholm, it’s very common to see houses which were built in 1900s (100 years old). These houses can survive such long time thanks to the high quality materials as well as careful maintenance. If you want to explore these building yourselves, Gamla Stan should be your must-go of Stockholm owing to its unique Swedish architecture.
My second impression was that I can drink the water from any tap in the city. My landlord proudly told me that “Stockholm has some of the purest water in the world in its taps. It has way better quality than bottled water, so yes, it’s completely safe to drink.”
At first, I did not dare to drink the water directly from the tap as it’s not common for Asian people to do so. However, seeing my landlord tried it himself, I also wanted to try. The result was a big surprise for me. I’d never tasted such fresh water before. I started searching for information about water in Stockholm and here was what I found:
“Every day Stockholm Vatten och Avfall produces 360,000 m³ of drinking water in the two water treatment works of Lovö and Norsborg, and distributes it to 1.5 million people in Stockholm.The water is retrieved in Lake Mälaren. To maintain a high quality of drinking water, measures are continuously taken to protect the source of water supply; Lake Mälaren as well as the reserve water source Bornsjön.”
Thanks to this work, we can save a lot of money on boiling water to make it drinkable. This also helps to reduce the number of plastic bottles consumed. Imagine that travellers don’t need to buy water bottles but can just simply fill the bottle with tap water. Bravo Stockholm!!!
Living in Stockholm, we don’t need to drive miles away to get into the wild because Stockholm is surrounded with a lot of lakes and green trees. There are almost 300 nature reserves around the greater Stockholm area, two national parks, one national city park and plenty of lakes that attract both wildlife and locals. Every suburb has numerous green areas, both small and large, and there are several green parks in the city. In other words, you’re just a short subway or bus ride away if you feel nature calling.
If you are lucky (like me), you might encounter some European hares happily enjoy their grass on your journey. Some of my friends live in the far north of Stockholm sometimes also see moose, deers, or even bears on the train to the inner city. There was a time, my boss nearly hit a moose while driving to Arlanda airport in a gloomy morning because the moose just suddenly jumped into the middle of the street (lucky him). So prepared yourself to meet some surprise friends on your way in Stockholm!
When it comes to air quality, there are many components to measure it including the level of pollutants like ammonia (NH3), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), … and the level of particulate matter (PM) like PM10, PM2.5. However, in this post, I won’t talk about scientific facts but how I feel when breathing the air in Stockholm.
I am living in a small apartment in southern Stockholm, around 12km from the city central so surrounding me are a lot of trees, flowers and lakes. Everyday, as long as I step out of the house, I always look up in the sky, take a really deep breath to get as much cool fresh air as possible to feed my lung. I never feel tired of doing that. Every breath I take, I can feel like the air in flowing in my body and it keeps refreshing my mind. I wish I could pack those air and ship it to my home country so that my family can enjoy it with me.
Fika is one of the most popular keywords you will hear when you are in Stockholm and it is a very traditional Swedish thing people do almost everyday. Fika basically means to meet up for a coffee and a piece of cake. Sweden enjoys a highly developed culture when it comes to baked goods, they are so in love with cake that they even have national days for some cakes.
Semla is two-layer bun made of wheat and cardamom, stuffed with almond paste under a cover of thick layered whipped cream. This is definitely the must-try item in your list when you are in Stockholm.
Every year on a Tuesday that lies on the seventh week before Easter, is where the so-called “Fat Tuesday” or “Semmeldagen” (the day of the Semla) falls.
Princess cake contains layers of light sponge cake, pastry cream, and a dome of whipped cream all covered by green marzipan and marzipan pink roses. You can find it in every bakery store with different variations, in round-shaped or in roll-shaped.
This is my most favourite cake ever! Kanelbullar is made with a perfectly soft and chewy cardamom dough, a buttery cinnamon-sugar filling, and twisted into cute little knots. Every year on October 4th, the Swedes celebrate Cinnamon Bun Day. All you need for a chilling afternoon is cup of coffee and a cinnamon roll. It is the ultimate symbol of Swedish home cooking and, as any Swede will tell you, the smell of newly baked cinnamon rolls is best smell in the world.
I usually warm the bun in microwave a little bit (30 seconds) to feel the smell of cinamon but you can try without heating it. Once you try it, you will love it forever!
— — — — — — — — — — — — —
Yay, there you go, the list of 5 things that made me fall in love with Stockholm. I really hope this list will inspire you to go to Stockholm one day. If you have been in Stockholm before or are living in Stockholm, please let me know what are your favourite things about this beautiful city.
Stay tuned for Part 2 of my top 10 things to love about Stockholm!

It all began with a single goal: to make Stockholm my new home. However, I quickly realized that the key to achieving this dream lay in securing a job in the Swedish capital. With limited funds and a burning desire to make my migration a reality without draining my savings, I embarked on a relentless quest.
For seven months, I tirelessly scoured professional platforms like LinkedIn, navigating through countless applications and attending numerous interviews. But amidst the rollercoaster ride of hope and disappointment, I confronted a difficult decision: should I risk quitting my current job to focus solely on this pursuit? The financial strain weighed heavily on my mind, urging caution when it came to advising others.
Yet, from the depths of my own experience, I discovered a valuable lesson that would shape my journey forever…
Embarking on my migration journey to Stockholm, finding a job became the crucial first step in realizing my dreams without depleting my savings. For seven long months, I tirelessly scoured platforms like LinkedIn, submitting countless applications and attending interviews. It was a challenging period, as I had taken the bold step of quitting my job to focus on this pursuit. Financial strain tested my resolve, making me hesitant to advise others to follow suit.
However, I learned a valuable lesson: once an offer arrives, swift action is vital. Initiating the notice period promptly and commencing the visa application process without delay can help secure a smoother transition, avoiding the prolonged financial hardships I faced. By sharing this experience, I hope to guide fellow migrants toward a more stable and successful path in their own endeavors.
Let us start with the time I started the interview process. As an iOS applications developer, the interview process consisted of IQ tests, coding tests, and several rounds of interviews related to my tech stack and my 10 years of experience in the industry. The interview process started at the end of December 2022, and I was offered a new opportunity to work with them in the first week of February 2023.
With the elation of securing a job offer, I eagerly signed the employment contract, understanding that this was the first step towards my new life in Stockholm. Little did I know that the journey ahead would require additional support. My new employer introduced me to a reputable visa processing agency, a third-party partner entrusted with navigating the intricate procedures involved in obtaining a visa. (Note: Specific names of the employer and third-party agency have been omitted for privacy reasons.)
The first thing they asked me to do was to fill out and sign a power of attorney form so that they could handle the application on my (and my wife’s) behalf. We also provided several pieces of information about us to the agency, such as passport data and marriage certificates. We were provided with two control numbers for me and my wife, which would help us keep track of the process on their website. You can check the status of your application using your control number here.
After waiting for about a month, I was informed by the agency that the Swedish Migration Agency had approved our application! The next process was to get the work permit card from the Embassy of Sweden. In order to obtain this, we needed to submit our biometrics to the Embassy. I swiftly booked flight tickets to New Delhi, where the Embassy of Sweden was located. You can find the details of the Embassy of Sweden in New Delhi here. The allotted time for submitting your biometrics is between 8:30 am & 10:30 am IST.
A few tips for your visit to the Embassy of Sweden:
Once inside, you will need to get a token and wait for your turn. The whole process took about 10 minutes for me and my wife. Afterward, we returned home and patiently waited for someone to reach out to us about the arrival of the permit cards.
Two weeks later, I received an email instructing me to collect the permit cards from the Embassy. The process for collecting the cards was between 11:00 am and 12:00 pm IST, and it was a swift affair, taking about 15 minutes.
As soon as I obtained my permit card, I informed my new employer, and they promptly booked my tickets to Stockholm. The next week, I found myself standing at the airport, clutching my boarding pass tightly. It was a moment of reflection on the incredible journey that led me here.
Part 1 of my migration tale had been a rollercoaster of perseverance and uncertainty, but it was just the beginning. Little did I know that the real adventure awaited me on Swedish soil. With a newfound job, a promising future, and dreams that seemed within reach, I stepped onto the plane with a mixture of excitement and apprehension.
The next chapter of my story, “Unlocking the Essentials,” would take you on a journey through the practicalities of settling in Sweden. From registering for a personal number to navigating the intricacies of the banking system and embarking on the quest for a place to call home, Part 2 reveals the essential steps that awaited me in building a life in this beautiful country.
Join me as we unlock the doors to a new chapter, where dreams become reality and Swedish adventures await. Stay tuned for “Unlocking the Essentials” in the next installment of my Sweden migration blog.

Celebrating the Unsung Heroes Behind Every Great Achievement
I visited Stockholm recently and couldn’t help noticing how much history fills the city.
I wandered through the Vasa Museum, then ended up at Stockholm’s City Hall, that red-brick landmark standing quietly over the water.
Inside, a guide led us through the halls where Nobel laureates have dined.
I stopped at the grand staircase, amazed by every curve and step. Ragnar Östberg, the architect behind it all, was known for obsessing over every detail, not for himself, but for the queen and her royal guests.
Östberg’s attention to detail was legendary.
He made his wife walk up and down different versions of the staircase until every step felt right. He wanted the queen, and every guest after her, to glide down without a stumble. But even as he worked for royalty, he never forgot the people who helped bring his vision to life.
His team — the builders, craftsmen, and artists — were honoured in a way that surprised me.
Instead of the mayor’s own bust above the office, you’ll find the faces of these collaborators, a daily reminder that nobody succeeds alone.

Here are some tips for you, Chris, for your trip to Stockholm.
Stay in Soder. Caffinate at Kaffe in the mornings and have a delicious swedish breakfast bun from across the road at Fabrique.
You will want to explore the shops around Soder, I think you will do some real damage here particularly Aplace, J.Lindberg, Gram, SnS and Cos.
To be converted to the cause of herring, you must lunch at Strommingsvagnen. It is a fish food truck which sounds like the sort of thing you should run from — unless you are in Sweden! I think we ate everything and it was all delicious. Rug up as you can only sit outside on benches.
For culture, I liked Fotografiska the photography museum not far from Soder.
For a fun day out, rent bikes and ride around Djurgården, the garden island of Stockholm’s archipelago and have lunch at Rosendahl’s Tradgard (closed Mondays). It is quite magical having a casually elegant meal in a glasshouse. All the meals are prepared with veggies and herbs harvested in the palace’s kitchen garden. A highlight.
Spend the afternoon at the contemporary art museum on the island.
Check out a gig guide if you can. We saw a great DJ play down somewhere near the water and it was awesome. Swedes know how to party.
That is all that I can remember for now. Enjoy and bring back more tips.

My generation were teenagers in the late 1970’s and thus passionate fans of Sweden since Abba dominated the Top of the Pops (God, how I hated the ghastly Dancing Queen since every girl in high school thought this syrupy pop tune was written specifically for her!) and Björn Borg dominated Centre Court at Wimbledon as the Men’s Champion until the trophy was wrested from him in 1981 in a five set marathon by the awful but brilliant American John McEnroe. As I grew older, I learnt to love Sweden’s amazing social tolerance and cosmopolitan culture, its democratic values, welfare state, its beautiful lakes, ancient cities and effervescent young women whom I met in my fave Hellenic beach resorts like Ayia Napa in Cyprus and Mykonos in the Greek Aegean.
However, in 2025, I have a special reason to love Sweden and it is definitely not the ugly furniture of Ikea my Gen-Z twins adore. The Swedish kroner has been the best anti-dollar FX hedge of 2025 and is up an incredible 17% in the last 6-months. As I expect the Trump Buckeroo to fall 20% before the Big Guy leaves the White house, I hope my Swedish kroner stash rises another 20% and offsets the already exorbitant cost of a Scandi holiday. Since I prefer the Med to the Baltics at any time of the year, why not revert back to the 1980’s watering holes in the Cyclades and meet nice Swedish people in the Scandinavian love shack rather than actually flying to Stockholm Gothenburg or Malmö.
Sweden is also one of the world’s most successful case studies in innovation and entrepreneurial capitalism, the reason Nasdaq’s Old World hub is in Stockholm. This $900 billion economy is one of my favourite countries to invest for the next 5-years as long as Putin does not invade Estonia and try to usurp King Charles XII’s role as the supreme war lord of the North with a blockade of the Baltics. After all, Putin is from St. Petersburg, a port founded by Tsar Pyotr Alexievich to fight the Swedish empire, the superpower of the North in the first decade of the 18th century.
This IT/green tech/export colossus is a goldmine for investors who love corruption free economies dedicated to innovation and talent, a natural for any refugee from Planet Dollar like moi!

Worrying about getting around? getting to and from the airport? want to check out the archipelago but do not want to join an expensive tour?
Public transport is great in Stockholm but it is not cheap. On average, a single ride costs SEK35. As visitor, you can buy a 7 days pass at SEK315 (there are other options if you are staying for only a day or 2, check here for information).
The best thing about this card is, you can actually go to and from the airport with it without paying extra if you do not mind a slightly longer (like 20 mins) commute!
If you go to the train station, they will tell you you need to purchase a SEK120 ticket to go through (which is true). However, we were lucky enough to encounter a staff who is nice enough to tell us the alternative that saved us SEK280/pax (2 more lunches!).
When you are at SkyCity in the airport, go out (and down) from the escalator, you will see a bus stop, get on bus 583 (you can check their schedule here) and ride to the last stop at Märsta station. At Märsta station, you will get on the train that go all the way to Stockholm City.
The bus ride is about 10–15 mins and the train ride is about 30–40mins.
Märsta station is the end of the train line, so you can’t really get it wrong.
(photo credit: Brorsson)
Apart from going to and from the airport, you can also go to (some part of) the Stockholm Archipelago with your Travelcard which easily saves you hundreds of SEK.
Stockholm is made up of 30,000 islands (subject to dispute :P), and it is a large part of Stockholm Swedes’ life to go to the Archipelago during summer/vacation. (To hide away and to not talk to anyone.)
If you want to do some island hopping, you can actually do it with the public ferry which is free with the card. Since I was there in autumn (and didn’t have time), I did not explore that. However, if you have any specific island in mind, you should check the website of waxholmsbolaget for more information.
It would be a pity to visit a city without seeing it from the water. If you do not have enough time to enjoy that, a short ride on the public ferry maybe a good way to do that. We took a short ride on the number 80. My only advice is don’t do it after dark. That’s what we did and we didn’t really see much.
Stockholm metro station is renown for its artistic decorations (you can see my Part 1 post for some picture and links to plan your trip ;)).
When we were in Stockholm, weather was not the best. With the card, we can easily hop on the train/metro/bus and kept ourselves from the rain.
You know what I think, a Travelcard is well worth it I will urge you to get it. You can get the card in the train station/convenient store in the airport.
Stockholm card is different from the Travelcard. It is a card that gives you free access/discount to paid museums, sights etc.. Different from visitor pass in many other cities, it does not include public transport (you need to buy a Travelcard) on top of that.
The card comes in 3 options, from SEK 595 (1 day) to SEK1295 (6 days). I ended up not getting it and not regretting it.
As mentioned in Part 1 of this post — most of the museums have free hours, if you plan accordingly, you can easily save a SEK200–300; as for transport (which is the most expensive items on their list), the only offer they have is the hop-on-hop-off for one day. The route is basically covered by public transport, and Stockholm is a pretty walkable city without the rain.
Another draw back about thePass is that you can only get your money’s worth if you plan very carefully. Sometimes, you may end up just seeing everything but paying attention to nothing, not to mention the interesting thing that you might see if you’re not in a rush.
Lastly, when I took a look at the items, a few of them are very similar (tour around similar places), which you probably would not need to do them all.
The Verdict
I do not think it is worth it to get the pass, unless you are dead set to see all the paid museums (potentially giving up on some of the awesome free museums) and is very strategic about that.
Stockholm is not cheap, but definitely not crazy expensive like people say. I did not have a lot of time to research for the trip, and started looking when I was flights/commute, and I still managed to make the whole trip rather affordable. Doing my research, I found these blogs/site super helpful, hope you can benefit from them too:
And remember, Google is always your best friends and ready to help :)
Have a good time in Stockholm. Follow me here or on instagram @eatwithsara for more posts about food and travel!

Here at All About Capital Cities we aim to give you an overview of all the 196 capital cities in the world.
Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, has a history that spans over 700 years. It was officially founded in 1252 by Birger Jarl, a Swedish statesman who sought to protect Sweden’s interior from sea invasions and to control trade along the Baltic Sea. Its strategic location on 14 islands where Lake Mälaren meets the Baltic made Stockholm ideal for both defense and commerce.
The city quickly became a vital trade center, especially during the Hanseatic League era in the late Middle Ages. German merchants and craftsmen played a major role in shaping its early economy and architecture. In the 16th century, under the reign of Gustav Vasa, Stockholm became the political and administrative capital of a newly unified Sweden, marking the start of the Swedish Empire.
During the 17th century, Stockholm flourished as Sweden emerged as a European great power. The city expanded significantly, with grand palaces and government buildings constructed to reflect its growing prestige. However, this golden age was followed by a period of decline in the 18th century after Sweden lost much of its territory.
The Industrial Revolution in the 19th century revitalized Stockholm, transforming it into a modern city with railways, factories, and growing suburbs. It continued to evolve through the 20th century, becoming a hub for innovation, culture, and diplomacy.
Today, Stockholm is known for its beautiful mix of medieval and modern architecture, its progressive social systems, and its role as a leading city in technology, sustainability, and Scandinavian culture.
Stockholm is famous for its stunning natural setting, rich history, and modern innovation. Spread across 14 islands connected by over 50 bridges, the city is often called the “Venice of the North.” Its blend of medieval charm and cutting-edge design makes it one of Europe’s most attractive capitals.
The city is also renowned for its well-preserved Old Town, Gamla Stan, where cobbled streets and colorful 17th-century buildings surround landmarks like the Royal Palace and Stockholm Cathedral. Stockholm is the cultural heart of Sweden, home to world-class museums such as the Vasa Museum, which houses a 17th-century warship, and the ABBA Museum, celebrating Sweden’s iconic pop group.
As the home of the Nobel Prize ceremonies, Stockholm is a global symbol of intellectual achievement and innovation. The city is also recognized for its sustainability and environmental efforts, often ranking among the world’s greenest cities.
In addition, Stockholm has a vibrant food scene, cutting-edge fashion, and a strong tech industry, earning it the nickname “Unicorn Factory” due to its high number of billion-dollar startups. With its mix of history, nature, and modern living, Stockholm stands out as a unique and influential European capital.

Take a stroll through the charming streets of Gamla Stan and visit the incredible Vasa Museum. Don’t forget to explore Djurgården, the lush green island, and indulge in the world of modern art at the Fotografiska Museumet. Get ready for an unforgettable adventure in this vibrant city!
Here are five top tips, from a true Stockholm native, on what to do in Stockholm! Want more tips from me? Feel free to leave a comment!
You should check out Gamla Stan when you visit Stockholm — it is a charming neighborhood with narrow streets and colorful buildings. This historic district is located on the island of Stadsholmen and is one of the best-preserved medieval city centers in Europe.
As you wander through its winding cobblestone streets, you’ll come across beautiful architecture, quaint cafes, and charming shops selling Swedish handicrafts. Gamla Stan is also home to several notable landmarks, including the Royal Palace, Stortorget (the main square), and the Stockholm Cathedral.
Don’t forget to explore the narrow alleyways and hidden courtyards, where you’ll find hidden gems and unique surprises. Whether you’re a history buff, an architecture lover, or simply looking for a picturesque setting, Gamla Stan is a must-visit destination in Stockholm.
Located in Stockholm, the Vasa Museum exhibits a well-preserved 17th-century warship. It is a fascinating destination for history enthusiasts and maritime lovers. Upon entering the museum, visitors are greeted by the majestic sight of the Vasa ship, which was salvaged from the depths of the Stockholm harbor after sinking on its maiden voyage in 1628.
The ship’s intricate carvings and ornate details are a testament to the craftsmanship of the era. As you explore the museum, you’ll learn about the ship’s ill-fated journey and the remarkable efforts made to recover and restore it. The Vasa Museum offers a unique glimpse into Sweden’s naval history and serves as a reminder of the country’s seafaring legacy.
Wandering through Djurgården, the green island, allows you to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and immerse yourself in nature’s tranquility. Djurgården is a true oasis in the heart of Stockholm, where you can stroll along lush green pathways and breathe in the fresh air.
The absence of cars on the island adds to its charm, making it the perfect place for a leisurely walk or bike ride. As you explore Djurgården, you’ll come across beautiful gardens, picturesque waterfronts, and even a charming little village. There are also several museums and attractions to visit, such as the Vasa Museum and the ABBA Museum.
Whether you’re a nature lover or a culture enthusiast, Djurgården offers something for everyone, making it a must-visit destination in Stockholm.
The Fotografiska Museumet is a great place to explore if you are interested in contemporary art and photography. Located in Stockholm, Sweden, the museum showcases a vast collection of stunning photographs from renowned photographers around the world.
With its sleek and modern design, the museum provides a perfect backdrop for the captivating artworks on display. From thought-provoking exhibitions to interactive installations, Fotografiska offers a unique and immersive experience for visitors of all ages.
Whether you are a photography enthusiast or simply appreciate the beauty of visual arts, the museum offers a diverse range of exhibitions that will leave you inspired and amazed. Don’t forget to stop by the museum’s gift shop, where you can find a variety of photography books, prints, and other unique souvenirs to commemorate your visit.

(disclaimer: this post is long overdue, as the trip happened in February. But better late than never!)
Me two months ago: Dear Santa Claus & birthday fairy lady, all I want for my birthday is to experience a white winter for my 30th before I head to Singapore. I’m talking a white winter, with glistening snow as far as the horizon stretches and air so crisp and cold that it takes your breath away. But not so debilitatingly cold that we won’t go outside… Sweden and Iceland, you say? Alright I’m in!
Turns out Stockholm and Iceland were the perfect retreats to get a refreshing dose of true winter before I move to a country with hot, hot, hot and hotter as seasons. The weather was a brisk 0 degrees C/32 degrees F, which was cold, but gave us beautiful flurries of snow every other day. In Sweden, we slowly acclimated to the cold and learned about the viking history of this Nordic country in museum after museum. Then in Iceland, we became outdoor adventurers, summiting glaciers and hiking ice caves. Even for warm-blooded Californians, these two northern spots were the ideal winter vacation.
Sweden highlights:
Iceland highlights (Part 2) is here.
Sweden runs so efficiently. The ARN airport has wifi, the express train that takes you to Central Station has wifi, and the busses run promptly every few minutes. Our Airbnb was in the adorable Old Town district, with narrow cobblestone streets that housed everything from tacky souvenir shops to quaint boutique stores that sold artisan chocolates and fancy wool textiles. It was right next to the riverwalk, where stately old buildings boasted their prowess along the water.
In true American form, we sought out the Swedish things we already knew and loved: Swedish fish, Swedish meatballs, Swedish pancakes, and Swedish massages. Our kind Airbnb host welcomed us with Swedish fish, so we immediately sought out #2: Swedish meatballs. We popped into an adorable cafe on the street corner and ordered meatballs, salmon and soup. The meatballs came in a rich cream sauce but had the appearance of Mexican mole. It was even better than all our Ikea meatball memories combined.
Warning: Swedish food is expensive. Icelandic food is even more expensive. Be prepared to drop $30 for breakfast and lunch and anywhere from $60–100 for dinner, especially if you order drinks. Thankfully (?) the SF restaurant scene has immunized me from sticker shock when I open menus anywhere in the world.
Swedish pancakes were reserved for breakfast the following day at Greasy Spoon (delicious), and it turns out Swedish pancakes are just… pancakes. But when topped with ricotta cheese and pistachios, you really don’t miss the “Swedish” at all. We also ordered eggs benedict and a salmon dish atop what can only be described as chunky potatoes.
And Swedish massages aren’t really a thing. Swedish massages were really invented by the Danish, but misattributed to the Swedish. So we scrapped that idea altogether and found a Thai massage place on Night 2. A warm Thai massage in freezing weather beats a massage in Thailand any day, even if we did pay $50 for an hour :X
Vasa Museum, 5 stars
This was one of the coolest museums I’ve ever been to. Upon entering, you’re greeted by a massive 70-meter ship (225 ft) that’s 95% of its original form. Back in 1621, Sweden was at war with Norway and the king had the ship built in two years. After just 10 minutes on the water, 1.5 km away from the shore, the Vasa ship tipped over and started to sink. She was too top-heavy and narrow in the middle to withstand a gust of wind. Of ~200 people on board, 30 died a tragic (seemingly unnecessary) death. It wasn’t until 333 years later that Sweden had the technological prowess to pull the ship up from the bottom of the ocean. The water was so cold that it was able to preserve the bones, and even the brains and shoes, of the some of the deceased aboard!
Nobel Prize Museum, 5 stars
Exhibit 1 of Swedes being incredibly nice and generous: the Nobel Prize museum was closing in 30 minutes, but the front desk man graciously allowed us in, as long as we promised not to tell anyone (he said with a wink). The museum offered an excellent crash course in all the Nobel prizes, including the Junglebook by Rudyard Kipling for literature, penicillin in medicine, and many other scientific concepts that went straight over my head.
I was frustrated by the US education system that failed to teach us about all these spectacular inventions, but also inspired to read all the Nobel-prize winning literature. Though I had read books by a few of the prize-winning authors (Beloved by Toni Morrison, Lord of the Flies by William Golding), I had barely scratched the surface of authors to read. The museum was also a crash course in learning about Alfred Nobel, a serial inventor, most known for his dynamite and explosive inventions. This was probably more world history I had retained than any class in school :X
Fotografiska Museum, 5 stars
The museum offered three powerful exhibits:
Royal Palace, 4 stars
“Royal” is a bit of a stretch to describe the Swedes’ Palace, but it is a lovely building, and aptly representative of the humble nature of the Swedes. Oddly enough, all the Swedish royalty pictured and ornately framed are brunettes, not at all like the blonde/blue-eyed people I had imagined. There are 3 main buildings — I recommend buying the ticket that gets you into all three. They’re worth checking out.
National Library of Sweden and Stockholm Public Library, 4 stars
Cause we’re #nerds. The bibliophiles in us couldn’t help but make a stop at *both* libraries. The Stockholm Public Library boasted a gorgeous rotunda on its top-level with thousands of books encircling us. As I browsed the shelves, my eyes immediately went to the Isabel Allende section where I saw the exact book I was reading on the trip: Inés of My Soul, but in Swedish. Talk about serendipity! Who needs John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale…
The National Library of Sweden had a slightly more interesting inventory. The library’s basement contained “Codex Gigas”, literally meaning “giant book”, or The Devil’s Bible. It’s the largest known medieval manuscript at 36x20x8.7 inches.
Nordic Museum, 3 stars
The exterior is stunning and looks more royal than the Royal Palace, with its turquoise sheen-ed roof atop sturdy concrete walls and multi-panel glass windows. Statues of imposing men riding horses guard the building to create a sense of awe when you enter the museum. And did I mention free entrance from 1–5pm? Apparently this is the happenin’ place on weekday afternoons with the older Swedes (aka senior citizens..), who comprised 80% of the visitors. And I don’t blame them. The atrium alone provided the most beautiful luncheon backdrop.
Eat in the museum cafe! I ordered the traditional meat and cabbage lasagna-esque dish (no noodles), and Jenn and Jenn got the salmon and mushroom soup. Keep in mind that we all grew up eating family-style, so we had the benefit of getting to try three different entrees at every meal. Plus the cafe provides all-you-can-eat bread, coffee and tea.
The rotating exhibits included Fashion through the Ages and A Nordic History, both of which were an enlightening glimpse into Nordic history through a fun, interactive lens. One exhibit provided paper for us to draw our 2050 fashion predictions and weave a giant tapestry with colorful threads that evoked different emotions.
Sodermalm Square and King’s Garden, 5 stars:
This was a beautiful garden and city center in the middle of Stockholm. There was a giant performance venue plus an ice skating rink decked out in twinkling lights, where parents and their kids swirled around unsteadily and didn’t mind taking a tumble. A small food stand served hot chocolate and even had fireplaces to roast marshmallows. If you could sit long enough in the cold, you could watch the ice sheets float down the river passing by magnificent buildings like the Grand Opera House and International Riviera Grand Hotel. It felt like Christmas in February.
Skansen “Museum”, 2 stars
The world’s oldest outdoor museum is a fascinating microcosm of Sweden. The founder brought or modeled buildings of all trades to Skansen to showcase the different industries, including glassblowing, carpentry, and other crafts. These craftsmen and women were smart and apparently decided to stay home from the cold because most of the shops were closed the day we went. There were outdoor venues, like an ice skating rink, and restaurants that were open, but we skipped. Luckily, the animals were still open for business, and we got to see wolverines (not Hugh Jackman, but honeybadger-like animals), bison, snow wolves, bobcats/lynx, and reindeer! The 2-star rating is a bit harsh, but it was pretty darn cold to spend all day at an outdoor park.
Gondolen Bar, 4 stars
Go for the views, stay for the drinks. We arrived a bit late (30 min before closing so we only had beer and wine offerings available. No matter, I immensely enjoyed my IPA.) We also were able to admire the great views from Katarinahissen, the 12-story elevator that takes you to an outdoor balcony for stunning views of the city.
Sturehof restaurant, 4 stars
Seafood lovers: go here. Again, it was expensive, but worth the price tag. We ordered a seafood platter with shrimp of all sizes, plus crab and Canadian lobster. The shrimp were incredibly tasty. The toast skagen, which is what they’re known for, is mayonnaise-y shrimp on top of toast — a bit overrated in my opinion. However, their scallop appetizer (yes, scallop singular, not plural) was to die for, but will set you back $17.
Grand Escalier, 4 stars
We tried to head to the Spy Bar, which loomed surreptitiously outside the Sturehof restaurant, but we eventually gave up trying to get in. We luckily walked inside the “galeria” (mall) right next to the restaurant and stumbled upon the Grand Escalier bar, which came highly recommended from a friend. Deeee-licious cocktails.
Östermalm Food Hall, 4 stars
I had already had moose medallions, so I was in a meat kick, looking to sample the primest cuts of Sweden’s finest. As we walked around the stalls that offered meats, seafood, pastries, and other goods, we asked a nice gentleman what the most popular meats were. He offered a sampling of their various meat cuts. We had the moose hind, moose salami, and reindeer heart and shoulder. Each had varying levels of smokiness and were all delicious.
When we attempted to pay, the man (Wes) refused and said it was his treat. And the sampling wasn’t just a piece of meat per animal, there were probably ten slices of each meat! Such. Nice. People. For a light lunch, we had their famous cheese quiche and cardamom cinnamon bun with a light hot chocolate. They really love their cardamom in Sweden. Perhaps cardamom is a natural happiness pill??
Slingerbulten restaurant: yummy restaurant. Order the moose medallions.
Da Peppe: If you want a break from Swedish restaurant, check out this very authentic Italian joint in the Old District. They were kind enough to provide free dessert plus a sufficiently embarrassing Italian rendition of “Happy Birthday.”

Stockholm ranks high on many queer people’s favourite cities list — and it’s plain to see why. This waterfront city is a hub of fashion, music, food, nature and progressive queer culture. Let me guide you to my Stockholm.
As soon as you arrive, whether it’s at Arlanda or Skavsta airport, you will be met by the views many associate with Sweden; green pine forests, yellow fields and blue lakes, with red little houses dotted all around. As you approach the city (grab Arlanda Express for the smoothest journey) the houses, as well as the vast open waters, grow in size, revealing the unique character of this capital city. Stockholm is where domestic lakes meet the Baltic sea, and whilst this is the centre of the tech, music and fashion innovation that Sweden is well known for, the city also celebrates nature, tradition — and LGBTQ rights. Let’s dive in.
Stockholm is built on 17 islands and as a visitor you simply must make the most out of this unique feature. My first tip, therefore, is: find your sea legs.
There is nothing quite like island hopping in the archipelago. Get on a traditional archipelago boat — or it’s high-speed equivalent – and take it out to Waxholm, Möja, Finnhamn, Utö or any one of the other gorgeous little stops along the way. Here you will be able to stop for a bite to eat, have a dip in the sea, and explore the Swedish forestry. Thanks to Allemansrätten, the Right of Public Access, you are free to roam the land (with only a few exceptions). If bigger boats are your thing you could get a ferry from Slussen, taking you to Finland or Estonia for the day.

Take time to soak in the waterfront in Stockholm. Whether it’s a walk on Djurgården, a stroll along the picturesque Södermälarstrand, or a panoramic tour along Fjällgatan (where my girlfriend asked me to marry her on New Year’s Eve!), I find it is impossible to get enough of the the Stockholm waterfront views. You can count on many a #selfie moment here.
What’s more, on a warm summer’s evening you will find theatre performances in Rålamshovsparken, high profile gigs at theme park Gröna Lund, romantic picnics at Skinnarviksberget, burgers and boules Boule & Berså at Danviksbro, national sing-along at open air museum Skansen and beer gardens filled with Swedes enjoying a well-earned “AW”, after-work. Following a long, dark winter Sweden embraces summer like few others.
Regardless of whether you are visiting in summer or winter, make sure you indulge in a dip. In the warmer months Stockholm’s many beaches fill up with local holiday makers, and during the rest of year (but also in summer) the many bathhouses create a relaxing oasis. Check out well-renowned Sturebadet, situated in the city centre, or Japanese sanctuary Yasuragi, located in the forests outside Nacka, to experience perfect relaxation. For an added twist and a truly Swedish experience, head out to Hellasgården for a dip in the sea — don’t worry, they cut a hole in the ice for you in the winter.
Stockholm is due to co-host EuroPride together with Gothenburg in 2018 and the city celebrates a huge Pride party every summer — but I have found it to be just as welcoming to queer people all year round.
Strolling through the streets of Stockholm I am always struck by rainbow flags, non-conformative design, boundary pushing initiatives and out gay people just being themselves. Last I was over I just happened upon a small yet mainstream jewellery shop proudly advertising rainbow marriage – that’s just one example. Swedes generally don’t even blink at the thought of same sex couples and when the Pride parade comes to town, the streets fill with people celebrating equality.
Worth noting is that the lesbian scene in Sweden is political; outspokenly feminist and trans inclusive. With lots of lesbian artists and initiatives increasingly gaining recognition across Sweden, the scene is growing particular in the Swedish capital — check out artists such as Silvana Imam, Beatrice Eli and Kakan Hermansson and you get the idea.
And whilst holding hands with my girlfriend (now fiancee!) has never caused me any grief regardless of the time of day, it is at night that the gay scene really comes alive…
Stockholm nightlife thrives particularly between May and August, when the sun doesn’t set and the summer rays stretch on into the early hours. Honestly, it’s magical.
One of the most popular establishments during this time of year (and again, one of my faves) is Mälarpaviljongen, a chic waterfront bar and restaurant buzzing with LGBT clientele, DJs, and staff. Worth noting is that the venue works with LGBT charity Regnbågsfonden and employs LGBT refugees.
Trädgården is another summer club hugely popular with the queer community. Set under the bridges near the waterfront by Eriksdalsbandet, this club invites some of the biggest acts and DJs and it is definitely one to visit. Make sure you go early, though, as queues can be long.
There are lots of club nights aimed specifically at a lesbian/bi clientele. Look out for Moxy, Bitter Pills, Hotellgänget, Club Wish (for the kinky) and keep a keen eye on Gunn Lundemo Events — this Stockholm-based DJ regularly does clubs around the world but she often also plays on home turf and her latest project with the L Word’s Daniela Sea looks seriously cool. Speaking of new, SPACE Stockholm is a recent initiative by lesbian icon and longtime Stockholm DJ Pamela, promising house music and underground decadence.
Many of the gay clubs in Stockholm attract a mixed clientele and “queer” is the buzzword here, as exemplified by the brilliant-looking Klubb Hångel, playing retro tunes and serving a no-attitude-pure-joy kind of vibe.
DATE is a club night run by underground music superstars Ji Nilsson and Julia Spada and whereas it isn’t advertised as queer, it’s a night I’d personally always try to make.
Mainstream gay clubs, where I might expect to see more men than women, include King Kong, Wonk and party boat Patricia. Bar/restaurant/club Marie Laveau, which is mixed and has a very cool vibe, puts on a queer party, Club Laveau, every Friday.
Queer friendly but not explicitly gay clubs include Debaser, Berns and Södra Teatern - but then again you will struggle to find somewhere that isn’t welcoming in Stockholm. For the latest queer events, see Visit Sweden LGBT as well as the Facebook timeline of JagVillGåPåQueerFest — the information is in Swedish but it gives a good idea of new upcoming nights. You might also want to check out Facebook’s list of gay bars here.
Say Swedish music and one band will come to mind regardless of where in the world you are. And now, finally, we have a museum dedicated to their greatness! Whether you are a huge fan or not, the ABBA museum is a Stockholm must as it lets you step back in time and rediscover pop history. Record your own song, perform in your own music video and (my favourite) learn about the music history that followed on from these super trooper dancing queens. Go, go, go!
Music thrives in Stockholm and the list of hits created here, thanks to producers such as Denniz Pop, Max Martin, RedOne, Nijs and Ji Nilsson, is endless. Spot some of the stars, including Zara Larsson, First Aid Kit and The Cardigans, live in Stockholm this summer — and do consider heading over for Popaganda, Stockholm’s coolest pop festival held early September at outdoor swimming bath Eriksdalsbadet. Years and Years and FKA Twigs were incredible last year.
Fans of modern art head to Moderna Museet or Liljevalchs, where each spring their exhibition Vårsalongen showcases the latest artists and pieces for a small entry fee. Fotografiska, the photography museum, is another must as they never fail to put on incredible and thought-provoking exhibitions, often by queer artists.
It is no secret that Swedes love IKEA as much as the rest of the world, but there is more to Swedish interior design than that. On a trip to Stockholm make sure you check out the Svenskt Tenn and Svensk hemslöjd in the city centre and discover the origins of Scandi hygge.
Stockholm Fashion Week takes place twice a year but this city breathes fashion 24/7. Home to brands such as ACNE, Stutterheim, Dagmar, Whyred, Swedish Hasbeens, Anna Holtblad, Filippa K, Hope, Nudie, Happy Socks, COS, Polarn O. Pyret as well as high street hits Weekday, Monki and of course, H&M, Stockholm makes for great shopping, especially as many of these big names actively challenge both hetero and gender norms. “Normkritik”, norm criticism is an important concept in Sweden, not least in fashion.
For high street fashion head to Drottninggatan and the city centre area between tube stops T-centralen, Hötorget and Östermalmstorg. Whilst you will find specialised (and very good!) H&M stores on almost every corner, Monki and Weekday are other Swedish-owned high street brands well worth checking out. Department store Åhléns has a good fashion department with many Swedish designers and Nordiska Kompaniet, a five minute walk from there, is excellent for your high end shopping. MOOD department store around the corner serves up a cool hipster vibe (with incredible toilets) and Biblioteksgatan, Sturegallerian and Sturegatan is where you find your luxury shopping. Do pop into Efva Attling jewellery shop on Biblioteksgatan — Efva is without a doubt one of Sweden’s biggest lesbian icons.
On Södermalm I would recommend a stroll along Åsögatan where you can discover smaller boutiques by Swedish designer stars such as Acne and Stutterheim but also nip into the shop and studio of Caroline Hjerpe, an up and coming jewellery maker with a great Instagram following. Her work has been spotted both on pop star Tove Lo and Sweden’s biggest vlogger Clara Henry (who, btw is openly bisexual and well worth checking out — YouTube here) and for good reason. If you’re lucky her adorable little dog will come say hi, too.
For vintage fashion check out Beyond Retro and Myrorna, the latter is essentially our version of Oxfam but with huge fashionista status.
There is more to Scandi cooking than meatballs and the capital of Scandinavia is well known for its culinary flair. Regardless of your budget, you can eat very, very well in Stockholm and here are a few of my favourite eateries.
Urban Deli — serving local, organic, proper classic Swedish food in a relaxed atmosphere. They have several locations but the Nytorget one is my favourite — possibly because it co-functions as a food shop and also happens to be a big queer hot spot.
Paradiest — a combined organic food store and food court where local produce is at the heart of the operation.
Green Queen — Mälarpaviljonen’s green little sister. This restaurant/deli focuses on “clean” eating, serving up delicious rainbow salads, juices and raw snacks.
Nalle o Kroppkakan — for something very Swedish and rather different, head to this restaurant near Telefonplan. They serve traditional Swedish “kroppkakor”, robust potato dumplings with different fillings. Served with lingonberries and a cold beer, it hardly gets more Swedish than this.
Vigårda — gourmet burgers at budget cost. With an ever changing menu and at least one mean veggie burger at a time this small scale burger chain is the bomb.com. (I will say that mainstream burger chain Max isn’t bad either — they do not one but six veggie options.)
Södra Teatern/Mosebacke — with one of the best views of the city, this classic Södermalm establishment serves Swedish tapas, small courses making the vegetable the star of the show (worry not, you may add meat or fish if you so wish).
A Swedish must is the tradition of fika, meaning coffee or tea with a small snack (preferably a cinnamon roll if you ask me). Your fika options are endless but these are some of my favourites:
The classic fika: Vetekatten
The posh fika: Wienerkonditoriet
The healthy, soulful fika: Koloni
The LGBT tourist fika: Chokladkoppen (ideal for an Old Town sightseeing stop)
The hipster fika: Vurma
The political, vegan fika: Femtopia
The raw fika: STHLM RAW
The Instagram worthy fika: Pom & Flora
The mainstream fika: Wayne’s
And on that sweet note, it is time to round this guide up. Do leave your favourite Stockholm tips in the comments below and hit me up on social media if you have any questions about queer life in Stockholm.
Last but not least… the practicalities.
The main inner city areas to bear in mind are Södermalm/SoFo (for a relaxed and very cool hipster vibe), Östermalm (high end shopping and first class food), gorgeous old town area Gamla Stan (the cobbled streets see you literally step back in time – make sure you visit the castle), down to earth Kungsholmen and green museum island Djurgården.
When I visit I try to walk as much as possible, just because it means I get to see more of the city, but getting around via public transport is easy. The Oyster-like SL card gives you access to the tube, bus, tram and boat — all of which feel safe and clean. Many of the tube stations are decorated with lovely bits of art and a recent addition is that the escalators are lit up by rainbow lights. You can plan your journeys here.
SAS, British Airways, RyanAir and Norwegian all fly non-stop to Stockholm from London. If you fly into Arlanda I would recommend going via Arlanda Express, Flybussarna coach or Taxi 020 — beware of individual taxi drivers trying to grab your attention at the rank and instrad pick the big taxi names, asking for a fixed price.
Stockholm Pride is taking place 31 July — 6 August 2017. See you there?

This was written by me and my spouse, Yoav Luft.
This summer we didn’t want to use planes, busses, or trains, due to the Corona. So we decided to go on a bike trip in the Stockholm archipelago.
We planned 5 days of biking and one additional day to rest on our final destination. We booked everything through an agency called ResGladh, that we’ve found through Sweden By Bike. We could have rented through ResGladh the bikes, but we wanted to keep them, so we purchased two bikes with 8 gear at Decathlon.
We received a map from Sweden By Bike with official bike paths, and prepared our riding plan according to recommendations from them and different attractions (like museums) from Google Maps. In the maps below, each square is 5 km. When planning our route, we wrote down when we will have access to restaurants and supermarkets.
We took two instant rice bags with us and some sandwiches and fruits for the first day, as well as energy bars, nuts, knäckebröd and tahini for the entire trip. We also took two bottles of water, 1 litre each.
We had one backpack of 35 litres, and one bike bag of 40 litres. We switched them during the trip according to our physical condition.
We took a ferry from Stockholm to Väsbystrand, Ljusterö with the bikes. On Summers and weekends queues start early, there is limited space for bicycles (11 on bigger ferries) and its first arrived, first served. We arrived some 45 minutes ahead of time and there was already a queue. We sailed for 2.5 hours.
Before the trip we were sure we’re going to cycle on pastoral gravel paths, so the first day was a bit shocking — although we used official maps for cycling, pretty quickly we’ve found ourselves cycling in a road for cars, without dedicated bike lane, nor shoulders. I haven’t been training recently because of the Corona, and Yoav hasn’t cycled since childhood, so cycling next to car driving 70 kmh wasn’t ideal for us. Luckily all the drivers were very careful, and waited behind us if another car was coming from the other direction.
We ate lunch after crossing from Ljusterö to the main land. We crossed on a floating road, this ferry doesn’t cost money and there’s no visible personnel on it, so it was a bit weird because we didn’t know exactly what to do, so we just went on board together with the cars, and then got off on the other side.. it arrives every 20 minutes. We ate lunch on the other side in the all ubiquitous Swedish “pizza-kebab"".
We continued cycling and stopped at Wira Bruk, a 17th century forge and weapons smithy. It’s a free open museum that we enjoyed, and we also filled our water bottles there and used the toilet. There’s also a coffee place there that we haven’t tried.
We started cycling at 11:30 and arrived at our B&B at 4:30. The owners recommended go bathing at Underskug, but we were exhausted and even missed the supermarket which closed at 18:00. So we went to eat yummy middle-eastern food at Cafè Bergshamra & Pizzeria.
In the morning we ate breakfast with Margaretha and Bosse from Carlberg B&B, chatted with their other guests, and started our longest day of the trip. In Bergshamara there was a bike lane, and next to Karl-Ols we took the side road and finally cycled in the woods on a gravel path. We then continued through Grovstanäs, which is really beautiful. We paused there for a short break by the water. We also got lost there a bit and it added 1–2 km to our original plan.
We paused for lunch at Spillersboda, were there is a café by the water, and we also filled water there, used the toilet, and purchased soap and some cans at the small supermarket there. At all the places we stayed there were towels, but none had soap or shampoo.
We continued then north and had a coffee break at Rådmansö Bakery Shop. The way from Nänninge to Björköören was again pretty intense with the cars of many people coming back to Stockholm on the last weekend of the last vacation week of August. We started to cycle in route (1) that’s marked in azure in the above map, but were stopped by a family arguing that it’s a private way that is blocked. So we switched to 2 and ended the day at STF (Svenska Turistföreningen) Kapellskär hostel in Riddersholm. There is a kiosk there with some microwave dishes, but we cooked some of the food we’ve had with us. At that point we were very sour. Our thighs muscles as well as butts hurt from cycling for two days and we decided to take it easy the next day — planning based on satellite images rather than only the map, and walking uphill instead of paddling.
We’ve decided to go through (4), (5) and (6) in the Södersvik map above. There’s a cycling path parallel to E18 that is unfortunately not marked in the map. It wasn’t very inspirational, but it was safe and easy. Around Insjövägen we got on to the official path again, which was very beautiful. From there it was very fast and nice to get to Norrtälje, and we arrived at noon, which was nice because we had time to enjoy the town.
We stayed in Berglings B&B, which was really nice. We ate at Looi sushi and Ed’s burger, and walked to the pier. In the morning we got ourselves more comfortable bike chairs at Cykelservice i Norrtälje. We also got knee elastic band for Yoav. Yes, we still suffered from the second day’s effort. We had a discussion whether we should come back home or even get a ferry to the final destination with the bikes and then get buses between the places we were supposed to stay for the nights until then. But we decided to give it another chance — and it was worth it, because the fourth day was the most beautiful.
It wasn’t supposed to be Mälby. It was supposed to be Wik B&B in Soderby-Karl, but a few days before the trip something happened and they cancelled all the reservations.
ResGladh found us a place further north, and we thought it’s going to be very tiring, but the road was really nice and quick, and there were four wonderful pauses on the way.
The first break we took was at a church in Roslags-Bro, which was pretty and re-charging.
The second is marked with (1) on the map was a really nice public bathing area with grass, sand and beautiful lake. There were a few people there except for us and it was also nice to see them because we rarely saw people on the paths in this trip.
The one marked with (2) was a coffee place we really enjoyed and also a cool store where I got lovely earrings and neckless, which made me feel much better :D.
The last leg of this day, marked with (3), was a big and nice surprise, cycling along a beautiful artificial canal.
And then we got to our night destination — Livsuniversitetet. This is a special place that we appreciated, and we were almost alone here, similarly to the situation on the second night. Lena Kristina helped us to settle down and then gave us a ride to ICA. She told us a little about this place and about herself — a pioneer psychologist who’d researched and developed methodologies around breathing. They have different retreats for groups of adults and youth. The farm is very cozy with a large kitchen and yoga room, and many secret fun corners.
In the evening we went to Ortala bathing park, which was amazingly beautiful with crystal clear water which were also too cold for us to get in.
Finally we were on our last cycling day. Feeling refreshed and excited about the rest day we planned to spend on Arholma, we started our way south-east.
We stopped at Barnens Ö for a short break, and then at Simpäs. We took the ferry in the afternoon after eating a delicious Thai lunch at the pier.
In Arholma there’s a small supermarket and a couple of restaurants that require reservation. We stayed at another STF hostel that was wonderful (and with lots of fun stuff for kids).
The best decision in preparing this trip was to take a resting day in Arholma. We toured the island, booked an hour at the sauna (private, including the water next to it), and had a really nice dinner at Arholma Dansbana. There weren’t many animals on the island, except for cows and tiny frogs. We were surprised to find a cold war bunker on the island that is now a museum with tours. The day after we hiked in the forest in the north, which was full with blueberries and linden berries, and then took a ferry back in the afternoon, a 4.5 hours trip directly to Stockholm.

There are three amazing things about Stockholm: its history, people, and cuisine. It is the capital of Sweden, a Scandinavian nation with centuries of heritage and thousands of coastal islands and inland lakes. Connected by more than 50 bridges and built on 14 islands, Stockholm houses 2.3 million people in its metropolitan area. It was settled during the Stone Age and was founded as a city in 1252. When I got the chance to visit, fueled with excitement and curiosity, I ventured on without knowing what was waiting for me.
My first stop, the Stockholm City Hall, is the building of the Municipal Council for the city. Famous for its grand ceremonial halls and unique pieces of art, City Hall is most well-known for hosting the Nobel Prize banquet each year. The guided tour is a must, and be sure to check out the Blue Hall (which is actually red), the Prince’s Gallery (with the mural pointed by Sweden’s Prince Eugen), and the Golden Hall (which is decorated with over 18 million mosaic pieces of glass and gold).
My next destination, the Royal Palace, was equally mesmerizing. The tremendous palace, built in the 1700s and painted pastel brown and yellow on the outside, holds more than 1,400 rooms. Even without a guided tour, the Palace still offers an irresistible chance for a taste of royal life. Two unique features of the palace which differentiate it from other grand palaces in Europe are the exhibition dedicated to royalty’s ceremonial outfits and a chamber furnished in 70s styles. Both share insight into the life and duties of the modern royal family.
One good thing about sightseeing in Stockholm is that a lot of the famous architecture and historical sights reside near one another within the city. Coming out from the backdoor of the Royal Palace, I was directly facing Gamla Stan, the medieval old town. Ochre-colored houses sit close to one another while busy restaurants, cafes, boutiques, and souvenir shops occupy the aged, cobblestone streets.
Just as I ventured into Gamla Stan, jet lag suddenly hit me. Unable to keep my eyes open and my body properly functioning, I needed a good, strong coffee americano to continue my journey. And that was when the “accident” took place.
“Can you pass me my wallet in the bag?”
“Yeah, sure. Just one second. But wait…where is my bag?”
“What do you mean, ‘where is your bag?’ You put it right under the table.”
“It’s not there anymore…”
After resting a bit in a small café in Gamla Stan, while going through the photos I had taken throughout the day, my mom and I noticed that our bag, which I had left under the table, had disappeared. Yep, that’s right, I lost the entire backpack on the first day of travelling. Deprived of wallets, travel documents, sunscreen, sunglasses, and basically everything needed for travelling, we were left with the one credit card that I had kept in my pocket.
Though upset at the situation, I was nevertheless surprised and comforted by the warmth of the locals. After hearing about what happened, the owner of the café ran out to comfort my mom and communicate with the local police. As I was running around the medieval alleys, circulating back and forth between fountains, statues, and small churches, looking into trash cans to see if our travel documents were at least thrown out, two shop owners sitting along the streets joined my search and started digging through the trash cans as well. However, our effort was futile in the end.
Frustrated and tired, we wandered aimlessly from Gamla Stan to the city’s central port. It was already around 6 PM, but the sunshine showed no trace of dimming, and it cast a golden tint over the entire cityscape. With an average height of five stories and a unified yellow-orange color theme, the buildings, which were mostly constructed in the 17th century, resembled each other in architectural style. Between the buildings, cobblestone paths ran across the city plane while locals immersed themselves in thoughts and conversations alongside the river.
Suddenly, upon spotting a group of people dressed in suits and gowns congregating in front of a tour boat, we decided to find out what was happening. One of the crew members explained that this was a weekly cruise tour that served fresh shrimp and seafood platters but also required a reservation at least one month in advance. Disappointed and ready to leave, we were once again surprised by “fate.” Another crew member who overheard our conversation called us back and told us that one couple had canceled their reservation last-minute due to an emergency, and that we could hop on if we wanted. Without a second of hesitation, my mom and I advanced.
After boarding the ship, we were welcomed by an ivory tablecloth, crystal wine glasses, and a sweet floral aroma in the air. The waiters soon seated us along the window and displayed the menu, which included shrimp scampi, salmon, and champagne. It was around 8 PM when the cruise sailed out of the port and started roaming gracefully through the islands during golden hours. Surrounded by fresh seafood, sunset, and nature, the lost bag was already out of my mind. From the reflective river, to the cottages hidden in nature, to the modern luxury apartments, everything seemed like an impressionist painting under the violet-blue infused sky.
Ever since I came back, I have been wondering what was so mesmerizing about Stockholm. What made me want to revisit again and again, even after my little “accident”? The answer is clear to me now, as I am recalling the memories and images in my mind: it’s the infinite possibilities one can encounter in this magical city.

Everyone will tell you eating out in Stockholm is expensive, but is quite manageable if think more about how locals eat. After exploring some great free activities, this part of the post will be more focused on the affordable eats :) :
As a foodie, I did not go all the way kebab and sandwich (like I did when I first traveled in Europe 10 years ago). You can also see my reviews about restaurant (actually, pretty affordable, even feel cheap from my Hong Kong perspective) and eating tradition (fika ❤) in my other post here with a map of restaurants that I ate at.
Lunch is the main meal where locals would eat out, and for a good amount of them, it is the main meal for them (eat more at lunch, and skip dinner… this reminds me of my parents). All-you-can-eat are actually not an uncommon option for them and available around the city and decent price (from SEK100 to mid SEK range if you’re eating during the lunch time; some places have discount for early diners).
We went to two all-you-can-eat and one of them we just love! (The other is very good for value, too).
As mentioned in Part 1 of this post, I found this place a heaven on earth! It has also come top in most of the (English) reviews. This is the first buffet where I could taste the difference in each dish and within each dish, each ingredient!
My brother and I are both picky eater, and it is the only place where we love everything (my brother hates pickle and I dislike beetroot in general, but we enjoyed them there). They do have some interesting combination of spices that I would not have thought about but turned out well.
My personal favourites are the lasagna (they made me break my low carb diet a bit), the curry and their BUTTER (I mean margarine).
Apart from great food, you can also enjoy a great view of the city from Hermans, they are pretty popular, so good luck in finding a good table.
After a day being a vegetarian, we went back to our meat lover mode. We went to another highly rated all-you-can-eat that specialized in grilled meat for lunch. Everyday, they will have 3 mains (on our day, it was beef, lamb meat loaf and fish). with a salad selection.
Taste wise I’d say it is not as flavourful as Hermans. However, you can taste the meat (it is not a rare thing here in HK where you can’t taste what you eat). I like all the 3 mains, but like the fish the most. Among everything there, my favourite is the grilled carrot and the mushroom sauce.
I read that the food is prepared from a charcoal grill. I honestly couldn’t tell, but then, they definitely deliver a good meaty, hearty lunch in the CBD at a low price.
For more options (especially if you wouldn’t mind Asian), you can take a look at this and this.
If a sit down lunch is a bit out of budget or simply out of time, you are lucky. Stockholm is a great place for street food with a lot of good roadside grills, food stand and food trucks offering American, Mexican, Middle Eastern food and more.
If you’re determined to look for the food truck, I will definitely recommend you to follow this article and download the apps. We did not do it, and have wasted like an hour’s time to search for truck that are not out on the day.
After one hours’ walking we decided to go for the stand. Our original pick was Nystekt Stromming; however it moved (damn you Google) and we did not know the new location was actually very close… (like across the bridge kind of close). Just walking across the bridge to the old town and you’re there.
Instead of walking across the bridge, we walked to the metro and went to Ostermalms Korvspecialist.
Although not our first choice, this small hot dog stand where chef eats did not disappoint. It has a generous amount of freshly grilled and tasty sausage, but the best part is the bread.
Unlike your regular hot dog, the bread wrap the sausage like a pocket. It makes it easier to eat and also easier to eat both bread and sausages together. The baguette is rightly toasted, very crispy on the outside and still soft on the inside (however much that’s left for the inside).
Another thing that I like about them is their sauerkraut does not taste too strong and would not overpower their sausage.
One hotdog is around SEK50–70, and is enough to feed one adult of reasonable appetite. The staff is quite friendly and I would recommend you to ask for recommendation.
Apart from the fried herring burger, some other fast food that I planned to eat but missed this time are kebab, kebab pizza and falafel. I will be back for you guys (waving)!
This one I can only contribute a little bit, as I did the research but didn’t try that our myself.
There are 2 types of food halls in the world — expensive one and affordable ones. If you go to a food court not because of price but the variety or experience, you could go for more upscale food hall like Östermalms Saluhall.
It might be a good idea if you are planning to buy some fresh food to cook at home.
For the rest of us who are looking for cheap in food halls, the following comes up in my research (in order of popularity):
Ok, if you are really on a budget, picnic is a great idea when the weather allows it.
There are plenty of beautiful green area and parks in Stockholm and you can leisurely enjoy your food in a park. Go for a cheaper supermarket and some of them, like urban deli, also have hot food for sale (if you don’t have anywhere to cook).
Essentially, afterwork is like happy hour, except that some bar would have a small (free) buffet of food. Check out the bars on your way!
For every city, there is definitely places that are affordable if you search for it. Generally, Middle Eastern food (check out my post on my Turkish dinner!), and Asian (which I did not take) would be cheaper. Bar maybe a good options, too. I had 1/2 kg of reasonably good mussels at around SEK165. Also, not to forget you always have your beloved IKEA as an option (although it’s a bit out of the way… who cares with the free shuttle?).
One thing I notice is that, do not follow Tripadvisor (and Yelp!) as most of the reviewers are from a few countries (unless you are their fellow country people), and most of the time, the price tag and review is skewed. I skipped all the results from Tripadvisor.
Another interesting find is Facebook does make decent recommendations! I actually discovered 2 of the places I like through them!
On to the next and last part of this series: how to get around Stockholm cheap (apart from walking and swimming).
Feeling full just from reading? You can also go back to the first part to take a look at all the free activities :)
Just to let you know, I relied on the following posts to gather idea on food :) :

Björn Ståhl, Founding Partner, Uncommon Stockholm said: “We will focus on brands that people in the real world are glad exist. These brands are uncommon and they can make a difference like never before. I’ve admired what Nils, Lucy and Natalie have been building at Uncommon for some time and we can’t wait to continue their impact and partner together in Stockholm.”
Natalie Graeme, Co-founder at Uncommon Creative Studio added: “Björn, Mia and Max have the perfect balance — they each bring a unique quality and their collective experience is impressive. They see the world the same way we do and match our ambition at Uncommon. We’re thrilled to welcome them into the fold and couldn’t think of better partners to venture into Stockholm with.”
Six years in, the studio continues to make awarded and stand-out work winning its first Grand Prix at this year’s Cannes Lions for its groundbreaking campaign with British Airways.
Notably work also includes creating the most recognised mental health initiative in the UK with ITV, to creating a globally infamous free suit hire initiative for H&M — The One Second Suit, to help young men find work, to redefining what the Nike Jordan brand means today launching during the 23’ NBA All-Star Weekend through the eyes of an aspiring female baller.
The studio has always believed in creativity — applying its founding principles of building brands that matter — acts rather than advertising. The studio has built successfully portfolios across experience, CX, design and production — with Uncommon producing its first feature documentary with renowned director Andrew Dominik for Nick Cave and Warren Ellis’ ‘This Much I Know To Be True’ premiering at Berlinale and SXSW and achieved critical acclaim including The Guardian’s Film of the Week as well as being listed in NME’s top films of the year. Its second feature ‘In Camera’ is in the running for Best First Feature at the upcoming annual BFI London Film Festival.
Though the Studio was set up with a clear point of view and purpose, it also wanted to explore a new business model. Rather than just working for clients, if the studio saw a concept that deserved to exist, it would back it. So far the studio has launched the world’s first fully compostable coffee capsule Halo Coffee, a sexual wellness brand SEX BRAND launching with the UK’s most sustainable condom and most recently Communion — a new money saving app on a mission to unlock the freedom associated with the act of saving.
Uncommon also invested in the purpose-driven accelerator Unrest — to support diverse and sustainable businesses. Since its launch two years ago, it has helped 47 startups, raising £7.2M with a total valuation of £110M.

Accounts & Recounts of my thoughts during my stay here in Stockholm, Sweden.

( This piece started in February, finished in June.)
Day 34. It has been more than a month since the experiential heat in the Lion City.
I don’t quite miss home yet, but it’s long enough for me to see stark differences between both cities and culture.
Facial features. Architecture. Museums. Weather. Snow. Winter.
2. Transportation
Metro. Subway. T-bana. Pendeltåg. Train. Escalator. Reliable. Not reliable. like SMRT? And not everyone has a car.
3. Working culture
Fika means put down your stuff and gather for Coffee Break. Phone-usage is a no-no, Socialising is encouraged.Lunch is Lunch. Work is Work. Party is Party. Work-Life Balance. And we take out our shoes when we are in office.
4. Social norms
More reserved. Strangers rarely say Hi. Yet seemed nice after the ‘ice has been broken’. Cashiers are the friendliest.
5. Standard of Living
Singapore is expensive. Deal with it. Stockholm is expensive too (including student hostels). In fact one of the most expensive in Scandinavia/Europe. High taxation. High expenditure on food, drinks, party. Then again, their wages are high as well.
I have met a couple of Singaporeans who got married and settled/is settling in here at Stockholm. Their stories are pretty amazing.
The city is beautiful, Swedes/locals lead less stressful lives, welfare and happiness are never taken for granted.
Perhaps Singapore can learn more from them.If I do have some form of political/social power, I will attempt to change some things back home. Change, is the only constant.

Stockholm, basically a town that is built across little islands at the spot where the fresh waters connect with the salty waters, is, in a way, soaked to the bone with olden tales. That starts from those brave Viking settlers going on, through to big posh palaces plus tales about brave actions at critical times; the Swedish main town gives you that grabbing feel for times of old. Instead of plainly peeking around at sites — why not set out on an immersive day of delight taking one the various history-based days out that Stockholm has available. With many things to select, where should one begin, you could be asking? But don’t stress about this at all! I kinda made this brief rundown of great historical picks found inside Stockholm that, in a way, promises super good times will be had! Let’s ready that travel kit, step on way-back ride machines, let’s get the facts popping coming directly outta those really superb aged settings this grand locale stores carefully! Find the untold experiences of Stockholm simply visit Stockholm’s historical insights just for fun.
So a top choice whilst coming to check the cool times long ago stored in Stockholm definitely asks one see the Vasa boat gallery spot, too! That impressive building protects bits associated to Vasa which stayed surprisingly sound for getting the facts regarding that battleship sinking really fast since making her initial trip going back during 1628. What is rad pertaining that boat could possibly not even revolve ‘round great scales, let’s imagine skilled carvers instead that outstanding piece concerning conserving works after its rescue efforts occurred! Try sensing yourself taking time backwards plus sensing, too, specifically what took ground by taking warships reaching day break for awful occasions took possession. Seeing vast details becomes heart tugging. Certain group programs highlight key bits like politic schemes King Gustavus pushed forward since they also check ship design actions occurring as factors created wreckages plus sunken depths arose also. Give yourself space with watching special booths and rooms particularly renovated cottages or fun playing installations. By really saving change be wise looking at packages visiting all areas offered alongside some guided Vasa Museum tour.
“In every way gaspingly gorgeous! Okay I might have seen news around this one, I just never pictured real views arriving live this! Those specialists presenting, I believe spoke super intelligently and seriously produced vessel memories alive now that felt actually pretty awesome that date! High fives going their means for good experiences!” — Sarah M., History Lover
I tell you those advisors guiding through it basically pour over solid background with interesting tiny tidbits going directly adding charm once drawing images considering existences sailing by sea while onboard ships constructed throughout these days old. I kinda have this sneaky feeling you begin falling breathless as quality happens then also think humbled in knowing tragic ending of some naval thing meeting oceans however having sailed a mile basically; try sinking deeper alongside oceans heritage that instant. Next watch details like they concern themselves uponVasa shipbuilding legacy, hopefully increasing brains inside.
Just that little by slowly disappearing alongside the cuteness found scattered around this town named Gamla Stan basically an area Stockholm says the earliest chapters of lives occur across all these streets is possibly interesting when thinking of the things discovered in all those cool walks during a time of sunshine filled play that takes days really! Paths of rock go spinning close all sides amongst structure of long-lasting nature and paints looking lively inside shades combining that old style mustard yellow alongside reddish exteriors everywhere! That point probably makes something feel beginning directly now across where tales speak around marketers living long ago beside monarchs plotting also not overlooking turns concerning the events inside days of country of Sweden that is her homeland there, specifically now. Person leading usually starts slowly bringing everyone close while discovering alleys almost secretive inside some part, going with gardens unseen generally alongside some gateways never spotted solo now. I’m very very likely that a feeling passes where all footstep has knowledge on this land when that moment arises strolling beside that grand Royal build plus market center Stortorget then possibly not skipping this grand gallery place linked to a guy called Nobel, definitely! Try thinking of crazy trading happenings going wayyy down here across that district as carriages horse guided echoes resounded, hearing quietly all communications hidden. Dig close on past occurrences using this fantastic one to choose alongside me: ahistoric walking tour.
It is cool cause just above what sights pop at eye glance level this place beats full life basically; something seems alive inside that district while moments tick right across history’s grand clock that feels nice and something that might be needed across someone thinking where adventure waits generally; watch some very very cool settings when considering that journey. Know a wide array via a Gamla Stan sites then get shown across paths found created as a pattern thanks a guru showing those points! Basically give yourselves freedoms traveling far time where every uncovered bit plus gripping accounts show themselves out the earliest areas forming spots in capital of Sweden..
In order for a shift for what Stockholm stores by days from long previous: consider watching Sodermalm something pretty awesome discovered toward land reaching off through southern spots past that territory called Gamla. The setting has gradually transformed spanning times right from district reaching at laborers where right now hip elements shoot into show at boutiques created through owners individually or restaurant innovators! This time probably should work seeing together its past history and cool happenings occurring at current that everyone would go through. Next watch the place speak the story beside spots tourists watch plus take that route athidden gems of Stockholm and more.
FeatureBrief Talk Over Here:Times Older!Look out closely how previous times got formed alongside that location known also how events got switched spanning each age for information really?Cooler WaysSeriously taste all feeling known while there really that communities existing art besides some occasions at night having wild nature maybe?Artwork Design!View things that combine little tiny shelters built vintage style versus a few building towers or fun sketches seen through street roads you probably should understand!.Tastes!Really eat meals together those ones known plus various international type you’ve spotted!.
Then walk down avenues at places having good skyline views whilst tales about those big influencers appearing at that area begin sounding now! Maybe just maybe you’ll begin passing some very boho alleys known really also known toward the “SoFo”. Now after hard job hours became stories: one regarding transformation where today the site stores culture those two things make one say one thing “strength”. View way existences have expression inhistoric Sodermalm charm: what richness is being created upon her soil.!
I bet going off that loudness that forms the town and try taking trips going smoothly onboard moving river vessels is a brilliant way how someone visits”Drottningholm,” something awesome that world watches through a protection association!. This impressive place appears really like that district”Versailles” through parts throughout Stockholm that protects the king, as a normal event. View wide space insides but wander down to sweet outside spots whilst something big concerning heritage plays there. A few times those presenting moments bring up happenings belonging at crown persons around that location-parties seen here? Think super persons making places exist, as artwork and something adorning her style! See it there maybe alongside: Swedish royalty and you can do more..
Regardless if people grasp parts regarding royal persons around that spot or others liking forms formed inside spots plus a spot silent arriving by, land with those Palaces offer you moments remembered really! Next take moments guiding yourself where insights start becoming real upon palace grounds Stockholm since moments begin arriving over ground where events play regularly really really..
After reviewing these picks above; comes time we watch place making local residents feel Stockholm is “theirs” (sort off, kinda)? This thing there becomes a place they watch as local authority area still also a piece holding values throughout ground: how prizes that person “Nobel” gets will get honors in days occurring here at a moment year for year. Through showing moment tours occurring here? Through these times begin people watching space appearing huge or art-full or something appearing metallic too- scenes created through all through area as the mother territory stands, known as Sweden! Be open learning things in area- but look how area stands out as strong from plans throughout the long era since then too!!! For spots known building big from history try booking: Stockholm historic buildings ahead and maybe go now.
Making those memories here feels maybe nice through one thing: see those booking occurring containing spot climbing to great levels, too probably. Look up all round location where beautiful events might just knock feet from floor when something plays up there as one watches!
Now those people who begin that part (those tourists) in soil that keeps culture- then the colors looking so attractive becomes super in area they enter really then that moment really forms really awesome sensation. So after times getting big meanings next feelings form right on then next someone getting tours together feels maybe okay through seeingswedish national heritage really!?.

I take the blue line, change to the green one in T-Centralen, and go down in Slussen. I glance through the windows of the galleries while walking through Hornsgatan. I was planning to watch the sunset from the viewpoint at Skinnarviksparken but the weather is not on my side and by the time I get there, dark clouds fill the horizon. I sit down on a bench to watch the snowflakes descend.
At five twenty, I go down and walk along the empty sidewalk next to the water. At some point, it stops snowing and I decide to continue my stroll to Gamla Stan, the old city in the center of Stockholm. The view of the Kungsholmen shore is gorgeous. It has been about a year and a half since the last time I passed through here. One gets too caught up in the routine and life goes by fast.
I continue walking to Rådhuset to take the blue line back home. By the time I am halfway, the dense dark clouds completely erase the lights of the Södermalm district. I can barely see the tower of the Stadhuset next to me. A blizzard covers the city on a white veil. My footprints don’t last more than a few seconds and I stop several times to clean the ice from my glasses.
I finally make it to the blue line and I am back in the warmth of my room a few minutes later. The snowstorm continues outside as if it was to last forever. I sit down in front of my desk and find refuge in the pages of my journal.
I like to write. I have been compiling journals for fifteen years. I write to put my thoughts into words and bring structure and clarity to my mind. I write to immortalize my memories, my beliefs, my stories. We are storytellers after all. We need stories to communicate, to give meaning to the world, and to make sense of our existence.
I leaf through the soft ivory paper of my journal and realize how the last months have been embedded into just a few pages. In contrast, when I go further back to my time as a traveler, several pages are needed to capture a single day of wander: the things I do, the places I visit, the colorful streets, and the different tastes and aromas of a new city, and the conversations I have with the people I meet. Paragraphs pile up and my hand write deteriorates as I rush to capture these experiences before they are altered or, even worse, forgotten by my fragile memory.
I look through the window as the ephemeral snow particles dance to the sound of the wind. I don’t want my days to go by helpless, at the mercy of the wind of life. I fear the moment I wake up and realize that decades have passed and I am still the same person.
I think about Memoirs of Hadrian, a novel by the Belgian writer Margarita Yourcenar. On his deathbed, Hadrian writes a letter to Marcus Aurelius, his future successor. The text recounts the wisdom the Roman Emperor has accumulated throughout different episodes of his life. Particularly, Hadrian declares that there are three ways to learn about human existence: through our own experience, through the experiences of others, and through books.
As a travel enthusiast, I cannot help but relate Margarita’s words to traveling.
By traveling, we leave behind our comfort and dive into the unknown. We expose ourselves to different environments and diverge from our beliefs, values, and prejudices. By traveling, we interact with the people we meet. We engage in conversations and dive into their stories. We learn to see the world through their eyes and add their experience to our own. By reading, we travel to different narratives. We learn from the stories of those who lived in distant times. We are entrusted with their stories to make them our own.
And yet all these perspectives remain incomplete. We see the world from the narrow lenses created by the conditioning our environment has provided. Even books carry the prejudices of the pen. Nevertheless, a rich life is born out of the combination of these incomplete stories.
Life is about feeding our stories through new experiences, rich conversations, and good books that change our narratives. To lead a life that cannot be reduced to just a few pages.

Stockholm, Sweden….A few weeks ago I hopped aboard a plane and headed to Sweden for the weekend. The truth is that Sweden has never been high on my wish list radar, as a destination, so I just have been skipping it year after year. However, living in Poland, Sweden has a huge advantage as a holiday destination. It is located so close to my homeland that it is easy to visit. I only need to cross the Baltic Sea and I’m there. The plane tickets to Sweden are usually bloody cheap … if only the weather there could be better.
Weather is always a strange thing. Every time I visit the Polish coast and look North, it seems that Sweden has better weather, as there are usually no clouds on the horizon. But the reality is far different. The weather in Sweden is cold and windy most of the year, except in summer. I didn’t want the Scandinavian weather to deceive me as I booked my ticket. I hoped that the sun would have mercy on me and would appear in Sweden during my stay. Sure enough, the weather had its way! I left sunny Poland and landed in quite a cloudy Sweden. During my stay, the sun tried to defeat the clouds but failed. My consolation was that it did not rain.
My motto is “like the places to which you travel and appreciate that you can visit them, no matter what”. Seems to me, as a traveller, that we should want to go everywhere and find something interesting anywhere. Consequently, I always try to see the best in each country I visit. Before going to Scandinavia my number one wish, while there was to experience the fjords! But that’s in Norway. Thinking which Scandinavian city would be my number one choice, I had a feeling it would be Stockholm. Now, after returning home, I can confirm 100%, that to me, Stockholm is absolutely the number one city in Scandinavia.
Nordic cities in my opinion are hit or miss. You love or hate them. They don’t have many landmarks, are very expensive and at first glance, they look just boring. Nordic cities such as Oslo, Helsinki, Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Reykjavík share one thing in common. They are coastal cities. I usually love cities bordering on a body of water, as a relationship with water adds a whole new dimension to city life … and Stockholm has lots of water!
People say that Stockholm is the Venice of the North. The city is spread out over 14 islands, that are connected by 57 bridges, with an eye towards my beloved Baltic Sea to the East. There’s something incredibly soothing about almost always having water in sight and that makes Stockholm a nice destination to explore on foot. It is pleasant to stroll when you are never more than a stone’s throw away from the water. There’s so much water everywhere that sometimes it seems like there’s more water than land. Hence, it may seem that there are more boats than cars, in the city. They are moored to the shore and sway on the gentle waves.
But such a picturesque location has also cons. A few times I found it slightly annoying to not be able to get somewhere, located just a few meters away from me, just because there was no bridge exactly where I needed it, and I had to walk around a channel, that made the way much longer.
All in all, I think that water is what makes Stockholm charming. It makes the air feel fresher and clearer. Waterworks for Stockholm especially when the day gives way to the evening. Sunset in Stockholm is a magical time. It is so nice to be near the water when the sun is setting and see Stockholm in its magic hour.
The second thing that struck me the most about the city was the colour. Everywhere, from the gems of the Old Town to more modern architecture, colour seems to be present on every surface. I think that the colours are Stockholm’s heaviest weapon against gloomy and cloudy weather. There is no logic or scheme to the colours of buildings, as they would have never been treated as a wholeness, but as individuals.
It’s more expensive than Paris and London, but it’s not as expensive as people expect. I spent most of my money on food. I’m glad that I had a hotel breakfast at the price of my room because going out for a meal more often than once a day would have ruined my budget.
The silence in Stockholm really hits you when you arrive. The cars seem to move in a silent mode and there is almost a hushed feeling everywhere.
Sweden’s capital city is a 700-year-old European city. It attracts many visitors each year looking to experience Sweden’s largest city, however, there were fewer tourists than I expected. Thanks to that Stockholm has a very relaxed feel. There are not many people on the streets and sometimes it seemed to me, that I had Stockholm, just to myself.
The city has an atmosphere that is very calm compared to other European capitals. Perhaps it is the people living here. Most Swedes seem patient and quiet. Maybe it’s because there are so many open spaces and of course water. Maybe it is because of the history felt in the air. Or maybe because the buildings are so colourful and in some way, they force you to stop and stare at them. Maybe it’s all of this put together…..

I just got back from my two-week trip across most of Northern Europe. This is my third trip back to Europe. (My first was a summer abroad in Italy nearly 8 years ago and my second was another two-week trip in 2014 where we explored Dublin, London, Amsterdam, and Paris.) I daresay this was the best so far! Thom and I visited Stockholm, Copenhagen, Berlin, and again, Amsterdam this time around. In order to share our experience and to create a living record of its details, I’ve decided to write across a few posts on each city and its adventures. This first post serves to detail our overall travel plans, information on flights/places to stay, tips on light packing, and general advice for good travel. I should mention that I’m not an expert on any other these things but it’s worth sharing the little knowledge that I gained before, during, and after this trip.
To begin with, here are a few starting facts about our trip:
Let’s begin by discussing budget flights. Nine months before this vacation even happened I found some non-stop flights from Oakland to Stockholm for $600 a person. These flights kicked off the entire trip and made everything possible. I recall the very first time I ever flew to Europe. (Which was 8 years this summer!) It was to Genoa, Italy from Buffalo, NY. That flight had three stops (Buffalo to NYC, NYC to Frankfurt, and Frankfurt to Milan) and one train (Milan to Genoa) in order to get to my destination with a total of over 20+ hours at a hefty price of $1500. (Thanks Aer Lingus! 🖕) So to come across a flight that was only 10 hours and non-stop to my choice destination, it felt like fate...
Doesn’t that last sentence feel so inspiring? Statements and facts like those are the gold and shiny wrapper on the cheap bar of travel chocolate. Here’s the nitty-gritty of budget flying:
With some of the add-ons and extra taxes, our $600 tickets actually came to $711.30 a person. Our in-between flights from city to city were around $50 a person. (As compared to a train from Berlin to Amsterdam which was $120 a ticket.) In the end, you have to deal with the minor annoyances for that 💰deal.
Let’s move on to transportation.
Thom and I took public transit for the most part. (I’ll discuss the bicycling and Uber rides a bit later in some of my city posts.) For us, it’s a fun challenge learning a new city’s public transit. And unlike American public transportation, European public transportation is fast, convenient, and very, VERY reliable. Upon arriving at the Arlanda Airport, which is located just outside of Stockholm, we took the Arlanda Express Train that runs directly to the city center in just 20 minutes. (As compared to my 1.5 hour MUNI and BART trip to Oakland International Airport. 😑) Out of the four cities we visited, Berlin boasted the fastest and most reliable transportation (dat German innovation) with Amsterdam coming in at a close second. (Trams, trams everywhere!) All the trams, trains, and buses that we took were clean and clearly marked. My only complaint was the summer heat which was especially felt in the enclosed and non-air conditioned trains.
I plan to discuss each Airbnb in detail for each city post but in general our decision to use this service came from a few points:
Finally, let’s talk about packing. Much like my last Europe trip, I took a single backpack and personal bag with me. That was it! Now that this trip is over, I can say, quite proudly, that it was the best decision that I made for packing. After each city we visited, Thom and I both got a little better at packing our bags. It was a very efficient way to travel, IMO.
Here are some pros:
I admit that there are some cons involved with this kind of packing. While I can pack a mean bag, it doesn’t exclude the fact that the weight gets to you…no matter how light. If you’ve ever landed at an airport and took public transit into a city, the transfers mean a lot of walking between terminals and stations. The weight of the bag can cause a lot of stress on your neck and shoulders. Even this year, I packed a bag that weighed about 8 lbs total and after a while, say 20 minutes of walking, it can really push down on you. I should mention that my bag isn’t meant for hiking or true backpacking and therefore isn’t super ergonomic. I’m sure if I had chosen a small hiking backpack, my experience would be different. The bag that I took is just an everyday backpack for commuting which is why long walks with a lot of weight can easily become a small burden.
Backpacking can also force you to make some crucial decisions as to what you pack. One small error (should I bring a bathing suit?) and you’ll be forced to carry that item throughout the entire trip with much resentment. The last time we were in Europe, it rained for most of the trip. Thom brought an umbrella this year. He never needed it! 😂 🙃 Lessons learned.
A few surprising things that we did bring this year are:
I’ve only really traveled internationally in the summer months so packing has always been dictated by the warmer weather. I took mainly dresses with a single pair of jeans and shorts. A few shirts to mix it up and a hoodie with a jean jacket for cooler evenings/days. I took a pair of black flats since they’re so versatile and my Keds for comfort as I walked/biked everywhere. I kept toiletries to small sizes and bought anything else that might have run out.
Thom and I failed to exchange any currency prior to the trip. But I would recommend making that order with your bank if possible since ATMs abroad will charge you a fee for any withdrawals. Also, make the obligatory call to your bank letting them know that you are traveling abroad so that they don’t lock your card and account.
A kind co-worker provided us an extra SIM card and we had another already from past trips, so this year we both had data/service for our phones. Thankfully our SIM cards were both purchased in the Netherlands with Vodaphone. These cards worked in all the other countries we visited and we didn’t need to purchase new cards along the way.
Finally, I’ll add that we obtained Global Entry prior to the trip. It made entering the US very easy and fast when going through customs. If you are a frequent international flyer, consider getting Global Entry. Global Entry includes TSA PreCheck. So if you fly around the country frequently (which I do), it’s very convenient and handy for jumping those long security lines.
This post is a part of a series based on my recent two-week trip to Europe.

3C for describing Stockholm: cold, cool, culture. Its historical background, architecture, fashion, style, traditional foods, and of course ABBA, all make it so cool! It can be also called ‘North Venice’ because of the 14 islands.
We went to Stockholm by Flixbus departed from Copenhagen. It was night and long ride, besides I spent the night awake because of my flu and I really terrified about the journey. The road was empty without lightning… Also, our bus was moving fast. Uh, terrifying…
We started the city tour with Riddarholmen Church which has a thousand years of history.
We sat on the benches around the church, watching Stockholm architecture.
We watched the iconic Södermalm view. Like a postcard…
Gamla Stan: best for the time traveling…
Narrow streets, yellow colors, cinnamon smells… It makes me feel like I am in a different zone.
Me and my friend exploring the city by walking, climbing hills and from the beginning of the city tour, we constantly arguing about which city is better… Copenhagen or Stockholm? We are counting the pros and cons. However, it is an inconclusive debate. After wandering around the Gamla Stan’s old streets, another debate… Does it look like Florence? Then, we are sitting on a bench watching the Baltic Sea, talking about how can we do more efficient things, and be successful in our aims. I guess, this is Stockholm energy. Not syndrome… but this city has effects on people.
I ticked eating Swedish Meatballs in Sweden and going to Ikea in Sweden off on the bucket list. It was the first time I’ve eaten meatballs with sweet lingonberry jam (it was great). I also had Kladdkaka, Kanelbulle and irrelevantly, fortune cookies. All of them were delicious…
We passed through the Øresund Bridge which is so impressive, like diving into the middle of the sea. We are surrounded by only blue: sea and sky. Furthermore thanks to our Flixbus Driver, he was playing the Swedish Eurovision song: Loreen — Tatto. It was pretty unforgettable for me since I listened to this song hundreds of times and never thought I would be listening to this in the main country. (I know the photo is not very good, but I recorded videos and enjoyed the moment.)
Overall
Stockholm is so suitable for a student budget. I was expecting extreme prices, but I was wrong. Especially the souvenirs’ and Ikea’s food prices were acceptable. I want to visit Stockholm again with a rich budget and at that time I must stay at least 3 nights, attend to Stockholm Ghost Walk and Historical Tour, go to the Skansen Open Air Museum and ABBA Museum, appreciate subway art, go to Birka the Viking city, having Fika in a warm, cozy place with enjoying the Northern snow.
Regards, Ozlem.

To be honest, I wasn’t too pleased when I saw the temperature in Stockholm was going to be -5 degrees celsius. But I’m not one to turn down an opportunity to experience different cultures and meet new people. The view from the plane window pretty much confirmed that I was in for a cold couple of days. Sweden from the sky was pretty much blanketed in snow, with forests, motorways and buildings adding speckles of colour to the pure white landscape. Stockholm’s temperature was as expected — FREEZING — but admiring the beautiful architecture as we walked to the office made me temporarily forget this fact.
One of the great things about using Slack at Manifest is how it renders borders immaterial. It’s not perfect and working in different time zones does present its challenges, but being able to meet up with a colleague in a different country and pick-up where you left off on Slack is a great plus.
We like to believe everything is better in Sweden, and while that’s mostly true (I say mostly because the weather ain’t better) I have to say, the coffee machine at our Stockholm office is straight out of Star Trek. To hell with cafetieres and capsules, this baby uses an iPad touchscreen to brew you some of the best tasting Americanos I’ve ever had. We need to figure out a way to set one up in London too. It might even make me do a tea round….once or twice.
Our short time in Stockholm was spent darting from meeting to meeting. We had a couple of new business meetings interspersed with meeting existing clients. I’ve got to say, the half day we spent with Houdini was probably the most inspired I’ve been in my five years at Manifest. It’s not often you sit in a room where everyone is extremely passionate about what they do and where they want their company to go. I’m proud to be working with such a visionary brand, and you can bet you’ll hear a lot more from them in the coming months.
I cannot write a blog about Sweden without mentioning delicious Swedish meatballs and aquavit. Aquavit (literal meaning: water of life) is an important part of Scandinavian drinking culture. We were treated to a Swedish folk song by Anna and Josefine before downing a shot of the drink. Much to the surprise of the Swedes, Alex and myself did not seem at all perturbed by the 37% ABV beverage. We both have strong constitutions, and attempting to drink us under the table is never wise.
After meetings were done, I had the opportunity to explore more of Stockholm over the weekend- it’s truly a stunning city, one I hope to be visiting often… during warmer months.
Manifest has offices in Stockholm, London and New York and we’re recruiting. So, if you fancy joining our international family check out our careers page.

I belong in a gang of 4. Four colleagues, friends and something more than that. Anna, the 1/4 of our gang, spent (and she still has a month there) this semester in Stockholm, Sweden, as an Erasmus student.So the rest of us decided to visit her, have some fun all together in Stockholm and discover this Scandinavian city.
I have tons of stories to tell you about that trip, so I’m gonna keep it simple and write about the most important stuff in bulletpoints and also post along some photos we shot so that I give you a better understanding of what was going on.
A typical limo you see in Stockholm

Finally, I have to say that it was an awesome trip overall! Of course this was special for my and my mates, because we were all together, but I bet you’re gonna love this city no matter what!

I’m a US expat living in Stockholm since 2018. Originally lived in central Stockholm, now living in the burbs. A co-worker once asked me for tips on what to do when they were coming over for a visit. I typed up something, and later another and another person asked, each time I pulled up the old doc, and maybe made some additions. On the most recent instance of this, I realized I could probably just publish this for anyone to find.
If I had to narrow it down to 3 easy things, I’d do Moderna Museet (free), Fotografiska (~$20), and a walk through Gamla Stan.
Quick list of things to do:
Museums:
Sightseeing:
Restaurants:Swedish food
Really good sushi
Mexican
Steak
Choose Uber over cabs when in the city (seriously might be faster to take a scooter though 🙃). If you must use a cab only use these companies: Taxi Stockholm 150000, Taxi Kurir, Sverigetaxi. Most of the others will rip you off (my wife got charged $50 for a 8min ride). For getting from the airport, the Arlanda Express is a direct train to central stockholm, that only takes 18 minutes; you can buy the tickets online or at the airport, and you get a big discount for buying them as a group. A cab to/from would be ~30-40min depending on traffic.

Designing with AI: Reflections from a Night with Miro’s CEO in Stockholm,https://medium.com/@ajithachellam/designing-with-ai-reflections-from-a-night-with-miros-ceo-in-stockholm-c5e94f35b368,"Sign up

On Tuesday, 24th of June I attended an intimate fireside chat in Stockholm with Miro CEO Andrey Khusid, alongside Armin Catovic (Head of AI at Aloi and Vice Chair at Stockholm AI) and Elena Verna, Head of Growth at Lovable. Andre spoke about creativity, product leadership, and what it means to build with purpose in the age of AI. This blog is my attempt to capture that moment: for myself, for other designers navigating similar questions, and for anyone trying to make sense of where we’re all headed next.
“It’s a dance. A dance between humans and AI.”
I liked how Andrey used the word dance and not collaborators. It blew my mind when Andrey introduced the new AI features of Miro and introduced this concept of Canvas as a prompt.
“Some of us think in text. Some think in tables. Some in images. Some in handwriting. AI can translate between all these formats.”
It made me reflect on my own process. How often do I get stuck on one way of seeing things — one visual, one narrative, one iteration. This new dance invites us to explore the edges, to try “what if” scenarios we might not have considered. That’s not just productivity. That’s power. It’s not about outsourcing creativity. It’s about augmenting our intuition with speed, synthesis, and scale. And maybe, just maybe, creating space for more meaningful work.
This night wasn’t just about Miro. It was about the larger wave of transformation pulsing through the city, and one of the clearest signals of that was from Lovable. It was exciting to hear from Elena Verna about how Lovable as an entire company is AI-first, not just the product, but the tooling, workflows, culture, and even mindset.
They recently ran a weekend hackathon where anyone could use Lovable’s tools to build with three major LLMs. More than 2.5 million people created something just in a weekend. It was a strong message to startup founders to scale to the top. And simply, people are looking for a simple and easy product when it comes to digital experiences. Lovable is simple and people love it.
And perhaps that’s what makes Stockholm special right now: it’s not just building tools; it’s building momentum. Hmm, what a great time to be here at the center of tech innovation!
When I was working on the book Catch the Feeling, we discussed a lot about ‘sameness’. With AI-generated content, there is a general play of sameness in designs, products and content that is out. With this thought in mind, we had a question from the room,
What happens when everyone uses the same tools, the same AI models, the same prompts? Will we all just end up building the same thing?
Andrey replied,
“What makes the difference, is human empathy, point of view, and taste.”
It can accelerate your process, suggest alternatives, and synthesize patterns, but if you don’t show up with a strong perspective, it’ll just give you more of what everyone else is getting. In a world of infinite output, originality comes from the courage to have a point of view. Being human!
My friend Jaydatta is doing his Master's Thesis about decision making in Swedish startups. We were having a brief discussion about his findings and how actors and factors influence a major decision in a product. Later in the evening, MIRO CEO touched on his decision-making and leadership style.
“I was scared of adding complexity. I didn’t want to overwhelm the user.”
His vision in 2011 was to build the first browser-based whiteboard, and he kept the product as simple as possible. Andre shared how his leadership style had shifted over the years.
From top-down decision-making in the early days, to bottom-up ownership where teams shaped features based on user needs. He held back a key feature, not because they couldn’t build it, but because he believed simplicity was more important. But when the pandemic hit and MIRO was used heavily, he made a drastic shift, focusing on synchronous collaboration.
And now, as Miro matures again, they’re returning to a model where teams can own and shape their areas. But what stays constant, Andre said, is the need for a strong product vision, otherwise, you end up with 25 products inside one. This was a really powerful insight.
There was a question about what are the emerging skills and the right mindset to survive in a transitioning face in tech.
“The companies that thrive will be full of T-shaped people. Those who go deep in one craft, but also know how to connect the dots across disciplines and prompt machines to get the job done.”
That means being a designer who understands marketing. An engineer who thinks in UX. A PM who can sketch a landing page, run a prompt, and launch it in hours. And increasingly, these people won’t be full-time hires. They’ll be fractional experts, brought in for short bursts of high-impact work.
Lovable is already ahead of this curve. With under 50 full-time roles and revenue approaching $100 million, they’re proving what’s possible when AI augments the builders and everyone is trusted to own more.
Andre even predicted something that caught the room off guard: “Compensation will look different. In a few years, the same job title could pay 5x more to the person who brings exponential impact.”
Not because of tenure. But because they know how to leverage tools, think across domains, and ship value fast. The more impact you create in the company, the more compensation!
With big giants in the picture, someone asked a question,
“What if OpenAI builds your product tomorrow and destroys your business?”
Andre simply smiled and said something that brought a lot of hope and smiles in the room.
“We’re not building because we think OpenAI won’t do it. We’re building because we love what we do.”
A truth that often gets lost in metrics, frameworks, and the pressure to always be future-proof. It reminded me that the joy of creation doesn’t disappear just because the landscape changes.
“We might all be a little f**ked,” Andre joked, “but we’re in it together. And we’re still building.” And that, to me, is what this night in Stockholm was about.
Hope it inspired you too, dear reader. Connect with me on LinkedIn to follow my journey.

After many years of choosing busy beach destinations for our summer holidays, this year we decided to embrace the ‘coolcation’ trend and look for an alternative holiday focusing on cooler climates, scenic landscapes, and opportunities for relaxation and mental wellness. If you are also seeking this kind of holiday, then Stockholm should top your bucket list.
Stockholm, the capital of Sweden is a city that beautifully blends innovation, with its rich historical charm. The summer season truly accentuates its allure with extended daylight hours, festivities, nightlife and a bustling ambiance.
We visited Stockholm in June and were fortunate enough to experience some fantastic weather. We chose to stay at the Grand Hôtel, strategically positioned along the waterfront, providing views of both the Royal Palace and Gamla Stan. It served as an excellent base for us to explore all the city’s attractions, the highlights of which are listed below.
What impressed us the most, coming from a Mediterranean country, was the Scandinavian phenomenon of long days. The sun stays up until late into the evening, creating a sense of endless daylight and extending the feeling of a truly prolonged holiday.

The Incredible story of the Vasa and the lessons it teaches us,https://siddharth-ram.medium.com/the-incredible-story-of-the-vasa-and-the-lessons-it-teaches-us-9d7070d5d328,"Sign up

On 10th August, 1628, the Swedish navy launched the maiden voyage of the Vasa .The Vasa was part of the military expansion and an expression of Swedish naval power: It was explicitly built at the order of the King of Sweden Gustavus Adolphus, and was richly decorated to show off Swedish might and wealth. No expense was spared. One of the rooms was made to look like the royal palace. There were numerous Roman statues on board, — King Adolphus was sending a message that ‘hey, Sweden is the modern Roman empire’. Upon completion, it was one of the most powerful armed vessels in the world.
August 10 was a calm day, perfect for a launch, with a light breeze from the southwest. It passed the Royal palace, and the gun ports were opened for a Royal salute. When doing so, a gust of wind -nothing crazy — filled its sails and it heeled to the port. It passed some bluffs to the south (Södermalm, for those familiar with the geography). A little later, at Tegelviken, a stronger gust caused it to again heel to the port side — and went past the point beyond which the ship could right itself. The gun ports were open because 1300 meters past its launch, the Vasa sank, and about 30 people died (it included women and children as well, since it was a ceremonial trip around the harbor). It took all of 5 minutes to sink, and a major reason was the lower gun ports were open and water poured in as it heeled. But more on this later.
The Vasa lay on the bottom of the Stockholm harbor for 333 years, before it was successfully raised and the Vasa museum captures its stunning story of mismanagement, in a fashion eerily similar to mismanagement as seen in some modern software companies. I was lucky enough to have a tour through this museum while on a work trip to Stockholm. I would visit Stockholm again just to go back to the museum (though Stockholm has so much to see and do)
The Vasa’s story serves as a powerful metaphor for modern software companies, particularly in how organizational dynamics can lead to technical disaster. Just as Vasa’s builders continued with a fundamentally flawed design due to royal pressure, software teams sometimes proceed with architectures or technical decisions they know are problematic due to executive mandates or market pressures. The tragic part of Vasa’s story is that it was known that it was unlikely to survive its launch. In 1628, the captain arranged for the Vice Admiral to demonstrate its stability. 30 men ran back and forth across the upper deck, and the ship started to roll. The Admiral stopped the test because he was afraid the ship would capsize in the harbor. Does this sound familiar to anyone?
Consider how often we see software projects that are “too big to fail” — platforms or products that have had so much investment and executive attention that stopping to address fundamental issues becomes politically impossible. Like the Vasa’s gun ports being open for a royal salute (a political requirement) directly contributing to its sinking, we often see technical compromises made for business optics that ultimately undermine the product’s stability.
The parallel extends to modern engineering organizations where technical experts — much like the shipbuilders of the Vasa — might recognize fundamental flaws but feel unable to effectively raise these concerns up the chain of command. In both cases, the culture of deference to authority and the pressure to deliver can override technical wisdom. Today’s “royal demands” might come in the form of arbitrary deadlines, feature requirements that compromise system stability, or architectural decisions made to align with executive presentations rather than engineering realities. There is a tendency to ‘drift to failure’ in organizations that show up only when it blows up in their faces.
Most tellingly, just as the Vasa’s builders had proven experience with smaller ships but ran into trouble when scaling up to a larger, more complex vessel, software companies often face challenges when scaling from successful smaller systems to more complex platforms. The same principles that worked at a smaller scale can become catastrophic liabilities when applied without adaptation to larger, more complex systems.
This is a standard practice in product development (my writeup on it can be read here). Well, certainly at every place where I had influence over the process. It is entertaining to turn the 5 Why’s framework on the Vasa to get to root cause: King Adolphus was furious, of course, and the loss of his statement piece, and the loss of the many cannons that were on the Vasa (2 gun decks that can be seen in the photo above — it had 64 cannons). There was a royal inquiry, and no one was found guilty — it would be foolhardy — deadly — to point the finger at the king, who was responsible for the tragedy.
So what would the 5 Why’s for the Vasa look like?
The ship capsized and sank about 1,300 meters into its maiden voyage in Stockholm harbor on August 10, 1628. A light gust of wind caused it to heel (tilt) severely to port. Water rushed through the open gun ports, which were only 1.2 meters above the waterline, flooding the ship and causing it to sink within minutes.
The Vasa was dangerously unstable due to its top-heavy design. The ship carried 64 heavy bronze cannons, mostly on the upper gun deck. More critically, the ship’s ballast (72 tonnes) was insufficient to counterbalance the weight of the upper structure, guns, and heavy decorative sculptures. Stability tests before launch showed the ship was dangerously unstable — it heeled severely when just 30 men ran from side to side.
Despite shipbuilder Jakobsson noting the stability problems during construction, and despite a stability test where the ship dangerously heeled, no significant changes were made. Admiral Fleming, who oversaw the test, feared reporting the full extent of the problems to the king. The shipbuilders and naval officers knew of the issues but proceeded with the launch anyway.
In Swedish society under King Adolphus, challenging royal authority was unthinkable. (Note: This is of course not particular to Swedish culture). The king had personally ordered multiple changes during construction, including the second gun deck and additional heavy bronze cannons. He was deeply involved in the design, viewing the Vasa as a symbol of Swedish naval power. No one, including the shipwright, dared question the kings demands.
Sweden in the 1620s operated under absolute monarchy where the king’s word was literally law. King Adolphus had transformed Sweden into a major military power, leading successful campaigns in the Thirty Years’ War. The hierarchical culture of 17th-century Sweden, combined with the king’s reputation as a militant leader, created an environment where professional expertise was subordinate to royal authority. There was no cultural framework for “speaking truth to power” — the concept itself would have been alien to most 17th-century Swedes.
The fundamental issue was a cultural environment that prioritized deference to authority over technical expertise and safety concerns. This cultural dynamic made it impossible for technical experts to effectively challenge decisions that compromised the ship’s safety, even when they recognized the dangers.
The tragic irony is that Adolphus, despite his direct involvement in the ship’s design changes, never saw the Vasa — he was away on campaign in Poland when it sank. The culture of absolute deference to royal authority operated even in his absence, preventing necessary corrections to a fatally flawed design.
Well, that is the Vasa. And we have many modern day examples. I’d love to hear about your experiences!

Stockholm. A city I had heard of since childhood.
I associated its name with major international agreements, particularly the Stockholm Declaration of 1972 — the very first large-scale world conference to make the environment as a major global issue. It marked the beginning of international environmental governance and laid the foundation for what would later become the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This conference shaped the world’s approach to sustainability and climate action, yet I never imagined that one day, I would walk its very streets where such historic discussions took place.
Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would experience this city firsthand. It still feels surreal that I am here.
What struck me the most when I arrived was the contrast — the weather, the atmosphere, the way of life. Coming from Indonesia, where temperatures soar to 35°C with high humidity, adjusting to Stockholm’s crisp air and freezing winters was a challenge. Even in summer, I find myself trembling while Swedes enjoy the sunshine in shorts and tank tops. The shift from tropical heat to below-zero temperatures was an entirely new physical adjustments and rhythm of life.
But despite the cold, I fell in love with this city. There is a sense of calm, an unspoken rhythm that blends modernity with nature. Stockholm moves at its own pace — not too fast, not too slow.
And then, there’s Fika — the Swedish tradition of taking a break over coffee and pastries. At first, I thought it was just a casual coffee break, but I soon realized it’s much more than that. It’s a moment of pause, of connection, of simply being present. In a world that constantly pushes us to be productive, Fika is a reminder that it’s okay to slow down. This ties into something else I admire about Sweden — their emphasis on work-life balance. Here, taking a break is not seen as laziness but as an essential part of life. People respect their time off, and there is an understanding that rest is just as important as work.
The other thing that fascinated me was the language. The moment I heard Swedes casually chatting in their melodic Swedish, I felt a strange excitement. It was unfamiliar yet intriguing.
But, beyond the language, what truly inspires me about Sweden is its commitment to sustainability. Swedes don’t just talk about being environmentally friendly; they integrate it into their daily lives. Recycling, efficient public transport, and waste reduction are not just trends but ingrained habits. It’s no surprise that the world’s first environmental conference was held in Stockholm in 1972, leading to the establishment of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).
One of the biggest realizations I had was about landfills. My perspective on landfills was shaped by what I had seen in Indonesia, where waste management remains a major challenge. Landfills there often emit a strong odor, appear overwhelming, and lack proper handling. But here, it feels different — the landfill doesn’t smell as strong, the area is well-managed, and waste is systematically processed.
I also learned a lot about organic waste. If we truly want to combat climate change, organic waste should never end up in landfills. Food waste releases methane, a greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide. This realization made me see how small actions — like composting or waste sorting — suddenly felt much more significant.
Living in Stockholm has made me reflect on many things. It has challenged my habits, reshaped my mindset, and broadened my perspective. I’ve learned to embrace silence and to enjoy solitude without feeling lonely. I’ve come to appreciate the power of simplicity — how less can be more and how slowing down can actually bring more meaning.
Nonetheless, this is just the beginning of my journey in Stockholm.
— Fingers crossed for what the future has in store! ❤

Report of the Go Global Mission to Stockholm (25 - 28 October 2017)
As an entrepreneur, it is important to broaden your perspectives and keep an eye out on the world, even more so in this digital world we live and work in every day. Hence, I was very excited to join the Go Global Mission to Stockholm, an organization of startups.be and Jong VOKA Oost-Vlaanderen.
Sweden has been an inspiration for me ever since I became involved with technology and startups. The country has an impressive track record: after Silicon Valley, Sweden has the highest number of unicorns per head of population in the world. Iconic companies like Skype (sold to Microsoft), King (the maker of Candy Crush, IPO), Mojang (the company behind Minecraft, sold to Microsoft) and Spotify (you know Spotify), have all been founded in this Nordic country.
How is this possible? What are the reasons behind Sweden’s overwhelming success? Is this story future proof? 3 days in the country’s lovely capital Stockholm would provide all the answers.
A 2 hour flight from Brussels led us to Bromma, a cozy airport about 20 minutes from downtown Stockholm. Hard to imagine this is the main entrance to a European capital where so much value has been created over the past decade.
First stop on our trip was the Stockholm Fintech Hub, a huge co-working space located conveniently above Stockholm’s central train station. Besides the fancy decoration, I noticed a couple of interesting things here:
Off to a good start!
Our visit to Invest Stockholm gave us a lot of insights on the success of Stockholm. The seeds of the Swedish tech boom were planted in the 90s, when the government subsidized the required infrastructure for the digital age.
First, every household in Sweden was granted a personal computer. Every successful tech entrepreneur of today grew up with a PC! Digital natives avant la lettre.
Second, almost every household in Sweden has fiber internet access. Hard to imagine in Belgium, where to this day the public and private sector are still arguing who is going to make the required investments.
It is clear that government initiatives in the nineties have laid the foundations for the incredible success of the past decade.
The impact of these exits cannot be underestimated. As often happens with successful entrepreneurs, they do not rest on their laurels. After selling Skype, Niklas Zennström went on to found Atomico, now one of the most famous venture capital firms in Europe. Same goes for the founders of King with their fund Sweet Capital.
As a result, there is plenty of capital available to invest in promising startups that might become the unicorns of the coming decade. Success often creates even more success. The future of the Swedish tech ecosystem seems bright.
Some (fun) facts about Sweden:
Day 2 started with the highlight of our trip: a visit to Spotify. The music streaming service has over 50 million paying subscribers and is valued at 16 Bio USD in the private markets. Even though it is still making a loss, it is reportedly preparing its long-awaited IPO for somewhere mid 2018.
Spotify is one of those iconic tech companies of this age. The company, led by the enigmatic founder Daniel Ek, has proven to be an exceptional innovator on multiple levels:
1) Business model innovation: in the wake of illegal P2P networks like Napster and Kazaa, Spotify sought to find a legitimate way to revolutionize the music industry.
2) Technical innovation: the secret sauce to Spotify’s early success was the incredibly fast loading of songs. This was an engineering challenge of enormous size and difficulty. The majority of people at Spotify are still deep tech engineers working to make sure load times stay at this amazing level, even at such a huge scale.
3) Organizational innovation: much has been written and said about Spotify’s organizational model. The concepts of autonomous teams (grouped in squads, tribes & alliances), the agile way of working, the flat organization, … have been widely documented and copied by other tech startups. Many attribute the success of Spotify to this special culture of continuous experimentation and improvement, cultivated by the founders from day 1.
It will be very interesting to see what happens to this culture when Spotify goes public. Not making a profit yet, investor pressure might force it to tighten reigns and start cutting costs.
Later, we paid a visit to Detectify, whose founder notoriously hacked Google and got access to a huge amount of customer data. He received a bounty of 10.000 USD and went on to start a successful company in ethical hacking.
I arrived at the hotel at around 10 pm. Having some energy left in the tank, I put on my running shoes. I really enjoy jogging in big cities. Since there is always something new to discover, you hardly notice you are running after a while.
I ran to the Gamla Stan island where I accidentally bumped into the changing of the guards routine at the royal palace. Quite hilarious and way over the top if you ask me!
This run wasn’t only for sightseeing, though. Last week, I decided I am going to run my first marathon in 2018! There you go, the word is out, no coming back to it now. I couldn’t really miss the second training on my schedule, right…
Day 3 started at Klarna, another Swedish unicorn, active in online payment processing. A couple of years ago, it also received a banking license. We got a presentation about the major branding exercise this company had undertaken earlier this year. The result was fascinating: from a dull banking brand to an extravagant colorful identity. Klarna wants to be a bank focused on the consumer’s experience, not on its own payments product. It definitely stands out in its sector with this bold and brave move I can only applaud.
Next stop was the Goodbye Kansas Gaming Studio. Stockholm has an enormous amount of talented gaming engineers, resulting in big hits like Minecraft, Candy Crush Saga, Angry Birds 2 and a host of other console and PC titles. We were told the long dark nights might have something to do with this.
Final stop was at EQT Ventures, one of the top tier venture firms in the Nordics. EQT Ventures is owned by Sweden’s wealthiest family, the Wallenbergs. Over the past century (!), the Wallenbergs have accumulated an enormous portfolio of global industrial players, including Electrolux, Atlas Copco, ABB, SEB, SKF, … to name a few. Add Volvo, Scania and IKEA to the Sweden’s list and you get a sense of how many successful international corporations this country produces. Same goes for its music industry: ABBA, Roxette, Ace of Base, Europe … and more recently Avicii, Robyn, Swedish House Mafia. Due to the small internal market, anyone aspiring a big entrepreneurial or artistic career just has to move abroad as soon as possible.
EQT Ventures is the venture capital firm of the Wallenberg conglomerate. Besides funding (with its 565 Mio EUR investment vehicle), it also offers active guidance to its entrepreneurs (growth, engineering, marketing,…).
EQT Ventures invests in scale-ups that have reached product market fit and about 100k MRR. It sweet spot investment size is between 8 and 10 Million EUR.
EQT gave us a demo of their internal data processing tool called Motherbrain. This platform gathers all publicly available data on technology companies (e.g. Crunchbase, Pitchbook data,..) and enriches them by adding trends in social media activity, number of followers, press coverage, … EQT believes this gives them a competitive advantage in discovering promising startups earlier and getting into deals faster.
4 startups had the opportunity to present their company:
The trip ended with a nice dinner in the city center of Sweden’s lovely capital.
My key takeaways from this Go Global Mission to Stockholm:
Looking forward to getting back into the action at Hyperlane on Monday, fully energized and inspired by 3 awesome days.

This is not just a political reckoning. It is a personal one.
I come from survivors — not only of the Holocaust itself, but of the moral disorientation it left behind. My father escaped Nazi Germany on the last Kindertransport to London. He later carried messages between generals after landing on Normandy Beach, speaking the languages of both the oppressed and the empire. My grandfather survived by finding refuge in Sweden. My lineage is braided with escape, resilience, and silence.
And now, I speak to honor them. To wrest history from the hands of fear.
To advocate for a universalist, justice-rooted Judaism in today’s climate is to invite pushback — from within our communities. These pushbacks do not always come from cruelty. They often come from heartbreak. They come from those who believe they are defending Jewish life, when in fact they may be protecting Jewish trauma from healing and perpetuating animosity worldwide.
To walk into this conversation, we must understand the language of fear — not to be manipulated by it, but to meet it with truth.
Here are five of the most common arguments used to reject a Judaism of shared humanity and prophetic conscience. Then we will reconstruct the machinery of propaganda as it is deployed, in order to disarm it with truth. Then a short and printable “pocket guide” to help us return to our core teachings.
They are not caricatures. They are cries. And if we are to become the choosing ones — not merely the chosen — we must listen with clarity, respond with compassion, and never forget: Again and again and again, Never Again must mean never for anyone...for everyone.
Let us begin where our ancestors survived — but refuse to end there.
Understanding the counterarguments made by fear-based ethnocentric voices — particularly those within Jewish communities that resist universalist interpretations — is essential for both refining your own position and preparing for meaningful dialogue.
Here are five of the most common arguments used by fear-based ethnocentrists to dismiss or dismantle the kind of covenantal, universalist Judaism I advocate:
1. The “Survival First” Argument
Claim: Before we can worry about others, we must secure the survival of the Jewish people. We are always one catastrophe away from annihilation.
Key Points:
Response:
This argument exploits trauma to justify ongoing preemptive dominance. It conflates existential threats with political criticism and flattens time, as if Pharaoh, Hitler, and any current dissenter are interchangeable. It demands eternal victimhood even when Jews wield state or institutional power.
2. The “Particularism is Not a Sin” Argument
Claim: Every nation puts itself first — why should Jews be held to a higher moral standard?
Key Points:
Response:
This argument deliberately ignores that Jewish ethics — rooted in Torah, prophets, and rabbinic tradition — do demand more. It erases the prophetic voice of justice. It also neglects the fact that being a light to the nations (Isaiah 49:6) is not optional in Judaism — it’s core.
3. The “You Don’t Understand Realpolitik” Argument
Claim: Your argument is philosophically interesting but politically dangerous. The world is not a yeshiva or a seminar. We must protect ourselves with strength, not sermons.
Key Points:
Response:
This response uses cynicism to neutralize ethics. It assumes power and moral courage are mutually exclusive. In reality, prophetic leadership has always been a countercultural phenomenon. Moses, Isaiah, and Heschel all spoke into power from a place of moral clarity, not political comfort.
4. The “We Tried Peace, It Didn’t Work” Argument
Claim: We gave land for peace. We made offers. We withdrew. And what did it get us? Rockets. Stabbings. Terror. You’re asking us to endanger our children.
Key Points:
Response:
This is trauma talking — but selectively. It collapses decades of failed diplomacy, settler expansion, and blockade into a single defensive narrative. While security is valid, it cannot be divorced from justice — and justice requires that we confront the history we created, not just the history done to us.
5. The “Self-Hating Jew” Accusation
Claim: Jews who criticize Israel or prioritize universal ethics over Jewish solidarity are internalizing antisemitic narratives. You’re aiding our enemies.
Key Points:
Response:
This is emotional blackmail disguised as community protection. It conflates dissent with betrayal. In truth, ethical critique is an ancient Jewish tradition — from Abraham arguing with God to Jeremiah lamenting corruption in Jerusalem. To speak truth to Jewish power is not betrayal; it is fidelity.
If one were trying to design a manipulative, propagandistic narrative in support of a fear-based ethnocentric worldview, one would need to activate collective trauma, moral inversion, and identity loyalty. The goal is not truth, but emotional certainty, enemy construction, and justified power.
Here are 10 potent narrative devices — some are outright lies, some half-truths, and all are repeated enough to feel self-evident.
They may sound familiar.
1. “We are the eternal victim.”
No one has suffered like us. No one ever will. We are history’s permanent target.
2. “They all want to kill us — again.”
Scratch any critic, and you’ll find a hidden antisemite.
3. “Survival justifies anything.”
If we don’t do this, we won’t exist tomorrow. That’s just how it is.
4. “Our power is only defensive.”
When we act, it’s because we were provoked. When we strike, it’s because we had no choice.
5. “There are no civilians among them.”
They are all complicit — every man, woman, and child. They elected terrorists. They cheer death.
6. “We already tried peace. They spat in our face.”
We offered everything. They gave us rockets. What more proof do you need?
7. “Anyone who criticizes us wants us destroyed.”
You say ‘human rights,’ but you mean ‘our extinction.’
8. “We are the West’s last line of defense.”
Support us, or terrorism wins. We are your moral outpost.
9. “We speak for all Jews.”
If you oppose us, you’re not one of us. You’re self-hating or brainwashed.
10. “History has absolved us.”
After what was done to us, we’ve earned the right to do whatever is necessary.
Repetition and Ritual
These ideas are not just said. They’re:
The Manipulation Goal:
Make it emotionally intolerable — even existentially traitorous — for someone to:
In case you want to have a conscious way to reject manipulation here’s a pocket-sized pamphlet — concise, powerful, and portable — designed to interrupt propaganda in real time and rekindle moral clarity when fear-based ethnocentric messaging is heard. Copy and print it and put it anywhere you want to remain a thinking and feeling human being, grounded in Judaism's highest teachings.
Spotting Propaganda. Reclaiming Conscience.
WHEN YOU HEAR:
“We’re the eternal victim.”
ASK YOURSELF: Is this invoking history to justify current harm?
“They all want to kill us.”
REMEMBER: Fear paints everyone an enemy. But fear is not truth.
“Survival justifies anything.”
TRUTH: Freedom without ethics is just a new kind of Pharaoh.
“They don’t value life like we do.”
DANGER: That’s dehumanization. The oldest lie used to justify violence.
“We tried peace. They gave us terror.”
PAUSE: Did we try peace — or control disguised as peace?
“Everyone’s a terrorist over there.”
FACT: Blanket blame is genocide’s gateway.
“Critics are antisemitic.”
NO. Ethics ≠ hate. Dissent ≠ betrayal.
“We’re defending civilization.”
WATCH OUT: That’s colonial language. That’s empire talking.
“We speak for all Jews.”
YOU KNOW: No one speaks for all of us. Judaism is not a monolith. Never was.
“History has absolved us.”
NEVER. No past horror gives license to inflict one.
INSTEAD, REMEMBER:
“We were slaves in Egypt…” Not to become Pharaohs, but to never be one.
“You shall not oppress the stranger…” Not once — but 36 times. That’s covenant.
“We are not free until all are free.” That’s Judaism at its best. That’s how you know.
Carry this not as a weapon, but as an anchor. So when fear speaks, you remember:
“Justice, justice shall you pursue.”
(Even when it costs. Especially when it costs.)

This is my 28-day journey of living a temporary life in Helsinki, Tallinn, Stockholm, and Copenhagen.
🇸🇪 August 4, 2019
It’s very lucky to have a friend who lives in Stockholm. Jimmie was one of my classmates when I was in San Francisco. He is a writer and a freelance journalist. After leaving San Francisco, I’ve kept in touch with him on Facebook. And luckily I had a chance to visit Stockholm and saw him again.
Thanks to Jimmie, I could visit a beautiful island, Vaxholm in Sweden. It is not far from Stockholm, but it is not easy to get there by public transportation. We went outside of Stockholm by car, arrived at a town with a small dock, and waited for a public ship that moves cars from islands to islands. Because there are no bridges between islands in some places, so the ship plays a role as a bridge. We got on a ship, crossed a bay and got to Vaxholm.
Vaxholm looks like a small town in the countryside. It was a military fortress in the 16th century like Suomenlinna in Finland, but now it is one of the tourist attractions for hiking, camping, or just relaxing. We stopped by a small cafe and had Swedish Fika(coffee) and cinnamon rolls. They tasted really good. We looked around the island by driving and walking.
Vaxholm, this is the place that I have been looking for!! A calm and peaceful place. There are some stores for convenience but not many. There are some people, but it was not crowded. I can go hiking, sailing, fishing, swimming or camping. Or I can just take a walk along the coast. It’s the best place to relax. I wanted to stay more, but I should go back to Stockholm for tomorrow’s new adventure. I just left my heart in Vaxholm.
The more I stay, the more I like Sweden, maybe more than Tallinn. Sorry, Tallinn.

At first glance, it looked just like any suburban street in Sweden. The houses were similar; compact but well-designed with sharp corners and adorned with perfectly manicured lawns. The sidewalks did not have a crack in them and the cars parked next to it were modestly luxurious; not flashy Ferraris but rather fully accessorized Audis.
As we rounded a corner, we came into a small outdoor shopping complex akin to an American strip mall but without the decadent vibes. There were a multitude of real estate agencies, including Skandia Mäklarna, showing off the latest hot properties on the market with pools and staggeringly high prices on the corner of the posters.
The local branch of Handelsbanken was closed but its ATM seemed to be functioning, although nobody lined up because cash is essentially extinct as far as Swedes are concerned. A hip brunch spot — the type where you overpay for a cortado, complain about it but continue going to be seen — was also already closed but we noted it for our next breakfast.
On the other end of the complex was a small independent supermarket called Spisa with…

Thinking about traveling to Stockholm? Here’s the only guide you’ll need to avoid the notorious taxi scams that have tripped up even seasoned travelers.
I’d like to say I’m a savvy traveler, with 35 years of globetrotting experience under my belt.
I know the usual tricks — check prices online, avoid unsolicited “cheap” rides, stick to the designated taxi zones, and confirm the fare in advance.
I had done my homework, read all the guides, and felt confident about getting around Stockholm safely.
But what should’ve been a routine taxi ride quickly turned into a high-stakes lesson in navigating travel scams.
The moment I stepped into that “official” taxi queue, I had no idea I was about to become the latest victim of a meticulously organized setup.
I’m sharing my story to help you avoid the same trap and keep your Stockholm adventure as memorable as mine should have been.

Stockholm is arguably one of the world’s most beautiful capitals. It is built on 14 islands around medieval city center and is located where the freshwater Lake Mälaren flows out into the Baltic Sea. Stockholm is the most populous city in the Scandinavia, with 2.2 million people living in the metropolitan area. Running in Stockholm is a treat, given the water, unique geography, and well laid out pedestrian and recreational paths. The Stockholm Marathon is claimed to have one of the most beautiful marathon routes in the world.
The best running routes in Stockholm are defined by scenic paths along the waterfront, across bridges to the islands, and some lovely green spaces. We also have some routes that combine some of the main Stockholm sights with some pleasant parks and urban highlights. Stockholm has an excellent public transportation system consisting of bus, tram, local train (pendeltåg) and subway (tunnelbana; look for a T-sign).
One of the defining elements of running in Stockholm is its latitude. In summer, running late at night is a particular treat due to 18+hours of daylight. In winter, Stockholm makes up for short days in part by providing good lighting along most of its paths. Despite its northern location, Stockholm has relatively mild weather compared to other locations at similar latitude, or even farther south — receiving more sunshine per year than Paris or London, but also precipitation on about half the days through the year. It can snow from November to April, and winter running will likely involve snow or ice so bring your Yak-Traks. Summers are mild but rarely warm. You’ll almost always need an extra later for morning runs, even in July.

5.5-mile loop. Accessible any point in downtown. MAP
This route covers some of the main sights of the city, with lots of folks out walking and running. Much of the route is along the water and over bridges to two islands. Start your run at Gustav Adolfs square, next to the Royal Opera House. Head to Gamla Stan (Old Town) and pass Riksdagshuset where the Swedish Parliament is situated, as well as, the Royal Palace — His Majesty The King’s official residence. Enjoy the views of the idyllic Gamla Stan while you run south towards Södermalm island. Head west along the waterfront all the way to Långholmen, which is a former prison island, and currently one of Stockholm’s green oases. Cross the bridge to Kungsholmen island and head back east. You will pass another main sight, Stadthus (City Hall), which is also the venue of the annual Nobel Prize banquet. Complete the loop at Gustav Adolfs square.
7.2-mile loop. Access: several subways or buses to Slussen stop. MAP
Södermalm, or Söder as locals call it, is an island in south Stockholm. The vibe in Södermalm is relaxed and trendy, and it was selected as the coolest neighborhood in Europe by Vogue magazine in 2014. Running a loop around the island is a treat. Start your run at Södermalm market square which is easily accessible by public transportation (Slussen stop). Head west and enjoy views in Montelusvägen — a walking path looking over the waterfront to Kungsholmen. Continue further west and climb to Skinnarviksberget, a hill offering another breathtaking view over the city. Run to waterfront and make a loop around the island. Probably the most scenic parts of the loop are a path from Tantolunden in the west to Eriksdalsbadet in the south, and northeast area of the island when you run along the waterfront with Gamla Stan on your right.
5.2-mile loop. Start: Djurgårdsbron Bridge. Access: Bus 76 from downtown. MAP
Djurgården is a green and idyllic island close to central Stockholm, offering a beautiful setting for running. Its official name Kungliga Djurgården means Royal Game Park and it is one of the most popular recreation areas of the city. Start your run at Djurgårdsbron bridge and head east along the canal all the way to Lilla Sjötullsbron bridge. Cross the bridge to south and enter Djurgården island where you will pass scenic green areas and several historical buildings and monuments, the Vasa museum, art galleries, and the popular amusement park Gröna Lund. In the interior of the island is Royal Djurgården, which has gravel, more forested paths that can be a nice add-on.
8.1-mile loop. Access: bus 515 MAP
Hagaparken — a lovely green park about 5km north of the city — is a popular running destination any time of year. The park offers several scenic running paths. The best option is to make a loop along around Brunnsviken lake. Hagaparken is Sweden’s purest version of an ‘English park’, and the surrounding area contains three royal palaces. Probably the most famous building is Haga Palace where Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden, and her husband, Prince Daniel, Duke of Västergötland, moved shortly after their wedding in 2010.
5.6-mile loop. Access: any bus, tram or subway to Central Station MAP
Kungsholmen is a residential island where also the most prominent building of the Stockholm skyline and the venue of the annual Nobel Prize banquet, City Hall, is located. It is also another great running location. A good option to start your run is near Central Station. Head south and you will see Gamla Stan on the other side of waterfront. After passing the City Hall, continue west along the waterfront. Other highlights are a beautiful park called Rålambshovsparken and the inner city beach Smedsuddsbadet on the south side of the island, and Hornsbergs Strand on the north side. Most of the run is along the water.
Hellasgården is a nice recreation area offering several running trails in the woods and along the Källtorpssjön lake. It is located about 20 minutes by bus from downtown Stockholm — take bus 401 from Slussen to the Hellasgården stop in Älta. There are also excellent refreshment possibilities after your run, or options for a sauna or enjoying a sandy beach. See our 5.1 mile route here. Some of the trails have lights but note that in winter season, some of the trails are kept clean from snow while others are used for skiing, thus not suitable for running. See additional information here.
Stockholm has a wide selection of hotels in the downtown area and all of our iconic routes are located within a few mile radius. To have a fast access to the Stockholm Highlights loop, Djurgården and Södermalm routes, look for hotels in Östermalm and Gamla Stan areas. If you want to stay closer to Hagaparken route, then the Vasastan is a good option. It is still very close to Central loop and Södermalm routes, but a bit further from Djurgården. In addition to big international chains see also the following options:
Radisson Blu. Chain of well equipped hotels. Several locations in downtown.
Scandic. Another chain, several locations in downtown.
Nordic Light Hotel. A nice hotel with great location.
Runner’s Store is the biggest running specialty store in Sweden. Located downtown.
Löplabbet is another running specialty store with knowledgeable staff.
XXL. Price-driven big box retailer which has disrupted Scandinavian sporting goods retailers recently. One location in downtown on Hamngatan, another in Bromma airport.
Asics Flagship Store located in downtown on Hamngatan
Run With Me Stockholm offers a variety of private guided running tours covering main sights and attractions of the city. Has free group runs, too.
Stockholm Running Tours is another group combining sightseeing and running.
Nike+ Run Club offers several group runs to runners of all speeds.
Hash House Harriers is a Stockholm chapter of this globally spread “Drinking club with a running problem”. Meets every Wednesday night and every second Saturday afternoon for running, beer and fun.
Stockholm Frontrunners is running and walking group for LGBTQ people and their friends. Meets every Tuesday for group runs.
Stockholm Marathon is the main marathon race in the city, taking place annually late May or early June. Consists of two loops around the city and the finishing line is located on track of the Olympic Stadium.
Stockholm Half Marathon. September. This race has been in its current form since 2007 but its roots date to the 1920's.
Midnattsloppet. August. The “midnight run”, is a 10k race which has been run in Stockholm since 1982. As the name suggests, around 20,000 runners hit the streets of the city after the sunset. The same event is organized annually also in Malmö, Göteborg and Helsinki.
Women’s Health Half Marathon is the biggest half marathon exclusively for women in Europe. Offers also a possibility to run as a pair and split the distance with your friend. Website available only in Swedish — to learn more in English, contact whhm@marathon.se

Who do so many employees fall in love with their companies and practices, even the most terrible ones?
If you’re not familiar with Stockholm Syndrome then you’ve either never been held captive by an agile cell of fervent evangelists, wielding a full set of colourful whiteboard markers, in the company boardroom, you’ve never encountered a technical problem so difficult that you considered bailing out doing a PMP¹ course instead, or perhaps you’ve never had the financial pressure to keep a job you absolutely hate.
And, fellow player in the Grand Game of Software Engineering, even if you did, I have total faith that you wouldn’t give in to your captors.
You see, it’s survival of the fittest out there on the board — meaning it’s those that are technically competent, don’t have a strange love of garments woven from man made fibres, and those who know that management means having an irreversible frontal lobotomy (with a laminated certificate to prove it) and inevitable crossing to the other side of the board that will survive.
We all encounter those that have been summarily brainwashed every now and again in the Grand Game. Whether they’re seen to be repeatedly donning company merch unnecessarily², whether they spend their time organising (i.e. micromanaging) others unnecessarily, or just won’t have a word spoken against…

Stockholm syndrome is often defined as when a hostage develops an empathetic psychological connection with their captor. The reason this happens (as clearly, the hostage is the victim) is that the hostage subconsciously figures out, as seems reasonable, that if they are nice to their captors, they will receive better treatment in exchange. And that’s true.
An easy reference to this is the trope of the “Uncle Tom” in African American slave life during American slavery. During American slavery, certain slaves were mentally trained that if they accepted their slavery, and willingly worked with their master, they would receive better treatment in exchange. And said slaves bought into this, and cooperated in exchange for said better treatment. The African American community now refers to such slaves as “Uncle Toms”.
I propose that the process by which Stockholm syndrome sets in subconsciously, is a tool that ministers of faith use consciously to trick those in their congregation into becoming ardent followers of their own supposed volition.
I’ll explain. When a person enters a church community, they are usually doing it simply for the community at first. A community is a small society. And the smaller the society, the more socialist the society. This is why socialism works well in small countries. The…

My trip started from Turku to Stockholm via the Viking Glory, which is a cruise ferry that runs between Turku-Åland and Islands-Stockholm. Before arriving in Stockholm, I strongly recommend buying a Go City Pass (Stockholm Pass). It includes 50+ attractions, ranging from Museums, Skansen, and Boat tours. You can buy a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5-day pass from SEK 824 (71 €) to SEK 1,899 (162 €) — depending on the validity period. Once you bought the pass, download the Go City app, and you can show the QR code to attractions that are included in the pass to explore the city.
The Go City Pass includes: (More on the official Website) 📱
…
⚠️Not all the attractions are open all year round, for example, the Drottningholm Palace was closed from December 11th — December 30th, 2023, so you may not be able to get in if you go there during the Christmas Season. Same for the Stockholm Winter Tour by Boat, of course, it is only available during the winter season, but there is another boat tour available at other times of the year as well. (I highly recommended the Winter Boat Tour 🛥️)
💰Compile attractions that can be accessed free by the pass in two or three days to save money.
Note that the Go City Pass does not include public transportation unlike the Oslo Pass, so please remember to buy Travelcards if you want to explore the city without limitations. (You can get a discount if you are over 65 years of age, a student holding a Swedish student ID, or if you are under 20 years of age😊). The Travelcards are available on the smartphone app “SL-Journey Planner Ticket” and you can get on the tram, subway, bus, or commuter train within the validity period. 🚌
When you hop on a bus, you need to show the code to the driver, and you need the code for the subway (Marked as Ⓣ) as well. However, for the tram, you can just simply hop on and off!
I would say the subway and the tram are the most common transportation that I used during my stay.

By MATT PUSATERI
Five years ago, my brother sent me a link to a YouTube video. “This is awesome,” he texted. When I clicked it, I was baffled: it was a clip of a song-and-dance number on a football field from Fox’s series Glee (2009–15).
I didn’t get it: why he loved it, or why he was sharing it with me. After all, this was my brother — a first-born, take-charge, cut-the-bullshit engineer, and he really, really wanted me to see a clip from Glee? Maybe, I thought, he accidently pasted the wrong link?
What I didn't appreciate back then was that he was living at home with two teenage girls. He was outnumbered three-to-one by women. His view of the world, pop culture, and entertainment was distorted day after day to the point where he didn’t realize what had happened. He was a victim of Parental Stockholm Syndrome.
Classic Stockholm Syndrome refers to “a psychological phenomenon in which hostages express empathy and sympathy and have positive feelings toward their captors, sometimes to the point of defending and identifying with the captors.” It was inspired by a Stockholm bank robbery in 1973, during which hostages inside the bank gradually came to defend the criminals who took them hostage.
Parental Stockholm Syndrome is the same thing, except instead of being victims of a bank robbery held at gunpoint, it applies to parents held captive to shows like Glee as well as TV channels like Disney Junior and PBS Kids.
This is a real condition. I know, because I suffer from Parental Stockholm Syndrome.
I've actually said these things in the past year:
If I didn't live with two little girls — ages seven and five — I wouldn't be able to distinguish Periwinkle, a brave Winter fairy, from Rosetta, a plucky gardening fairy with a classic Southern accent. I also wouldn't have strong feelings about the sharp decline in the writing of Dora the Explorer (2000- ) after season two. And I never would have walked around the gym humming to myself the national anthem of Enchancia.
You can resist, but it’s inevitable. When you become a parent, you don’t just bring children into your world; they pull you into theirs.
Try as I might to get them to love things I love — DC Comics, Chicago-style pizza, Texas Hold’em, and North Carolina basketball — they want me to sit with them and enjoy the things they love: Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood (2012- ), Pinkalicious, and almost any movie about mermaids.
I might fight it, clinging to the adult world I left nearly eight years ago, struggling to maintain the illusion that I'm not captive to the passions and imaginations of two little girls. Or I can sit back, let go, and allow myself to tear up when Rapunzel is finally reunited with her parents at the top of the castle.

So, I realise as I write this that my last blog post was about an ECR event at the University of Stirling, arranged by the British Society of Gerontology’s Emerging Researcher’s in Ageing group (ERA). Ironic then, that I am writing this blog post in a former prison in Stockholm, on an ERA Writing Retreat at Långholmen!
The writing retreat, which I’ll write up in a separate post, was scheduled for Wednesday to Friday, so my brain quickly went into planning a research trip around it. Who might I be able to speak to at museums or universities in Stockholm about my research and practice at the Fitzwilliam Museum? And what might I learn about Nordic practice? I did some desk-top research, wrote some emails, and before I knew it, I had conjured up a plan for a research trip! And again, I was visiting a place I hadn’t been to before, so this was exciting…
Arriving on Saturday afternoon, I was able to spend the weekend strolling around the city (which was freezing!), being a tourist in a new city. I took an archipelago boat tour on Sunday morning, followed up by a visit to the Vasa Museet — the museum that I was told was one not to be missed! It was here that I was reminded that I am now unable to visit a museum without stepping into research mode…
The museum is vast — with many floors, and a lack of clear navigation route. Whilst the ship itself (if you’re interested in the story, you can read more on the museum’s website) is impressive, I felt immediately overwhelmed, not knowing where to start, or where to go. I found myself looking for somewhere to sit!
I saw a station where you could collect a map (which was available in numerous different languages), as well as clicking on a QR code to access a FREE audio guide. A map on the wall showed the location of all the stories in the audio guide, which was helpful (although they were not shown on the paper map which you carried with you). I looked around me, and found a theatre style set of wooden steps, where I could sit, look at the ship, and listen to the audio…
The audio was quite interesting, but then I quickly became frustrated by the imitation waves that were added in for effect. Time to move on!
There were lifts, but often with a group of people already waiting, so I chose to use the stairs. I found it quite confusing to navigate my way around, and it was too dark to read the map, so I stopped trying!
The museum is very interactive, with a wide variety of displays, ways to engage, and a LOT of information. I realised I was finding the displays a bit overwhelming, and so decided to focus on the ship itself — actually, as I write this, it’s probably how I usually navigate a museum. Focus on the object of interest!
This was the start of my trip, before I even intended to be focused on research. I’ll add further blogs to this series (links to be added, as I write them):

This is not your romantic cruise! But a beer-soaked “The Love Boat” episode ala Viking style version with hard liquor and long parties.
We decided one weekend to celebrate family birthdays on the ferry trip from Helsinki-Åland-Stockholm. Two good, highly competitive lines, Viking Line and Tallink Silja, the Tallink Silja Viking Line connects Sweden’s capital with Finlands.
We took the Silja Line Promenade for 1–4 persons plus breakfast and grande buffets for each person during the trip. The promenade room is located in the middle and offers a view of the boat’s hallway.
In my honest opinion, Tallink Silja is more upscale and Viking Line is the less expensive one but also a popular one. The Helsinki to Stockholm cruise or vice-versa has a 2-nights and 3-day cruise and is one of the popular ferry trips.
For Finnish people, having a ferry ride from Helsinki to Stockholm is just as common as having a train ride between cities. One of the most popular routes between Sweden and Finland is the Stockholm-Helsinki ferry.

This article originally appeared on Confessions of a Boy Toy
Stockholm is a truly magical city. This spring, we traveled to Sweden’s capital to experience the fairy tale magic for ourselves. From getting lost through the cobblestone streets of charming Gamla Stan (Old Town) or boutique-hopping in the city’s super-hip SoFo neighborhood, Stockholm has enchanting surprises at every turn.
Here are some incredible places you’ll be delighted to stumble upon shall you find yourself in Stockholm.
The clothes and furniture at Grandpa embodies everything we love about the SoFo district: Casual, super-cool and contemporary, despite its name. Grandpa focuses on highlighting Scandinavian fashion and furniture designers with a reputation for making things that are eco-friendly and sustainable, with materials sourced locally, organically or through fair trade.
Another quintessential SoFo shop, Coctail is like a Pedro Almodovar movie that’s come to life. No wonder it’s so popular with film location scouts. While most of Stockholm is still enamored with minimalism, this tiny shop aims for “maximalism” — everything here is just the most, from the luchador masks, the Dia de Los Muertos figurines, the Frida Kahlo mugs, and other colorful, authentic trinkets shipped from Mexican street vendors.
Located in Gamla Stan since 1864, E.Torndahl is a tiny, family-owned boutique featuring the work of local Scandinavian designers and artists. Here, you’ll find fascinating gifts in the form of jewelry, wallets, metallic hair-trimmers shaped like exotic birds, coasters with a bearded man illustration, a portable phone charger shaped like a river rock, and more.
Photography lovers should spend an afternoon — especially if it’s raining — perusing Fotografiska, a for-profit center for modern photography. This place is not afraid to exhibit controversial and provocative photos, so make sure to wear your open-minded goggles. During our visit, we saw work by African artists Samuel Fosso and Rotimi Fani-Kayode, as well as a special exhibition on French fashion photographer Bettina Rheims.
There’s no inch of Stockholm that’s not drenched in history and culture, even down in the subway. The city’s public transit system is said to be the world’s longest art exhibit, with 90 percent of the subway stations decorated with sculptures, mosaics, paintings and public installations by over 150 artists. Some of the most eye-grabbing subway art can be found at the following stations: Kungsträdgården, T-Centralen, Rådhuset, Solna Centrum and Tensta.
If you find yourself in Gamla Stan around noon, check out the changing of the guard at the Royal Palace. It takes place at 12:15 p.m. daily during the summer and on weekends year-round. The Royal Palace itself is a sight to see. You can take a tour of the inside and check out five museums, including the royal treasury, home to the crown jewels, an armory with knights’ gear and the royal stable with coronation carriages and intricate coaches.
Are you a fan of Game of Thrones or Harry Potter or Star Trek or E.T. or Marvel superheroes or Buffy the Vampire Slayer or all of the above? You’re bound to find a book, graphic novel, or other gift for all your geek-related obsessions at this sci-fi mecca in Gamla Stan. Let’s just say this shop has everything you could ever possibly need to decipher every reference in Stranger Things.
If it’s sunny out, this lively terrace at the top of Sodrateatern, an iconic theater in the heart of Stockholm, has to be on your to-do list. And if the weather is not cooperating, Sodrateatern offers plenty of indoor festivities as well, including jazz-fueled dinners that turn into full-blown dance parties.
If you’re traveling to Stockholm during the summer, from early April to late September, make sure to catch the sunset at the hyper-scenic Mälarpaviljongen. This high-spirited, straight-friendly restaurant and outdoor bar is located on the waterfront barges along the Riddarfjärden bay. You can even arrive by boat after a day out on the bay to cap off your cruising adventures.
A gay-owned coffee shop painted mustard-yellow in the heart of Gamla Stan, Chokladkoppen serves delicious hot chocolate in a bowl. If you really want to indulge — and why wouldn’t you? — they also have chocolate cake that’s to die for. During the summer, enjoy the people-watching in the Nobel Museum plaza from one of the cafe’s outdoor tables.
Pharmarium Cocktail Bar
Located in Gamla Stan near where Stockholm’s first-ever pharmacy opened in 1575, Pharmarium serves a different type of modern remedy: exquisite craft cocktails. The Roses of Gold, the Pharmarium’s version of a French 75, was just what the doctor order, made to perfection with vodka, lemon, champagne, and just a sprinkle of gold powder. As if a champagne cocktail needed that extra flair.
You will find plenty of treats in Stockholm’s hip SoFo district, but nothing like the sweet-buttery deliciousness that can be found inside Pärlans Konfektyra. This quaint confectionery looks like it’s from another era. It makes classic, organic caramels and caramel sauce in Scandinavian flavors like lingonberry and salt licorice.
You’d expect this Medieval-themed restaurant would be a tourist trap, but we were the only Americans there. Medeltidskrogen Sjätte Tunnan is a little hidden hotspot to find in Gamla Stan. Once you find the door you have to walk all the way to the back before going downstairs to a cavernous restaurant serving a menu inspired by 1300 A.D. cuisine. A feast perfect for a Viking king.

Captivity and manipulation are two intricate aspects of human psychology that have fascinated researchers for decades. One phenomenon that sheds light on this complex interaction is the Stockholm Syndrome. As discussions around the topic intensify, it becomes imperative to delve deeper into its causes and explore the role that Russian propaganda plays in shaping public opinion.
The Stockholm Syndrome refers to the psychological condition where hostages develop an emotional bond with their captors. Originating from a 1973 bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden, the term has increasingly been used to explain instances of individuals identifying with their perpetrators and paradoxically defending their actions.
To truly comprehend this phenomenon, it is crucial to understand the dynamics at play during periods of captivity. When individuals find themselves in situations where their freedom is severely limited, they become vulnerable to the influence of their captors. Fear, uncertainty, and isolation create an environment where the captors can exercise power and control over their prisoners.
Interestingly, these circumstances can lead to a survival strategy known as “identification with the aggressor” or the Stockholm Syndrome. Victims might unconsciously develop empathy and positivity towards their captors as a means of self-preservation. This psychological defense mechanism aims to reduce perceived threats and increase the chances of survival within the confines of captivity.
However, it is important to note that the Stockholm Syndrome is not limited to scenarios of physical captivity alone. It can also manifest in situations involving emotional manipulation and psychological control. This is where the role of Russian propaganda becomes significant.
Russian propaganda, with its sophisticated tactics, aims to manipulate public opinion and control narratives. By leveraging psychological vulnerabilities, such as the fear of the unknown and the need for security, they can shape people’s perceptions and beliefs. This can lead to individuals sympathizing with and defending actions that align with the propagated narrative, despite their better judgment.
Exploring the complexities of captivity and manipulation, especially in the context of the Stockholm Syndrome and Russian propaganda, highlights the profound impact that external influences can have on the human psyche. By understanding these dynamics, we can develop greater awareness and critical thinking skills to navigate the intricate world of information warfare.
The Stockholm Syndrome serves as a harrowing testament to why societies need to punish criminals to deter crimes. Its intersection with Russian propaganda highlights the need for vigilance in assessing information sources and maintaining a healthy skepticism in an increasingly interconnected world. Only by questioning and seeking the truth can we break free from the invisible chains of manipulation.
Stockholm Syndrome is a psychological response observed in captive situations, where the individual begins to closely identify with their captors and even starts to sympathize with their agenda and demands. It is a complex phenomenon that has been studied and analyzed in various psychological research.
The term “Stockholm Syndrome” was coined after a notorious bank robbery and hostage situation that took place in Stockholm, Sweden in 1973. During this six-day ordeal, the hostages developed a strong bond and emotional attachment to their captors, which baffled both the authorities and the public. This case became the unprecedented reference point for understanding the psychological dynamics of captor-captive relationships.
According to Britannica, the Stockholm Syndrome is a psychological response that occurs when hostages or abuse victims develop an emotional connection with their captors or abusers. This phenomenon is named after a bank robbery that took place in Stockholm, Sweden in 1973, where the hostages ultimately expressed sympathy and loyalty towards their captors.
The syndrome is thought to be a survival mechanism that kicks in when a person feels powerless and threatened, causing them to form an attachment to their perpetrators. In these situations, the victim’s survival instincts kick in, and they begin to identify with their captors, often developing positive feelings toward them. This may be due to the captors intermittently showing kindness or providing the hostages with small acts of compassion during their confinement.
This emotional connection can be perplexing to outsiders who fail to understand the intricate dynamics at play. From an outsider’s perspective, it may seem illogical for the victims to develop positive feelings towards their captors. However, it is important to remember that these individuals are enduring a traumatic experience that distorts their perception of reality.
The Stockholm Syndrome is not limited to physical captivity alone. It can also manifest in situations of emotional manipulation and psychological control. In these cases, the victims may find themselves trapped in toxic relationships or cult-like environments where their thoughts and emotions are manipulated to serve the interests of the abuser.
In such instances, the victims’ identities become intertwined with their captors, leading to a loss of personal agency and an overwhelming sense of dependency. Breaking free from this psychological entanglement can be incredibly challenging, as the victims may fear retribution or believe that they are incapable of surviving without their captors’ support.
One of the factors that can contribute to the development of Stockholm Syndrome is the captor’s ability to instill a sense of fear and helplessness in the victims. By controlling their access to basic needs such as food, water, and sleep, the captors can create a cycle of reward and punishment, fostering a state of emotional dependency. This dependence, coupled with intermittent acts of kindness or compassion, further deepens the victims’ connection to their captors.
Furthermore, the victims may experience cognitive dissonance, a psychological phenomenon where conflicting beliefs and emotions create a state of mental discomfort. To reduce this discomfort, the victims may reinterpret the captors’ actions in a positive light, creating a narrative that justifies their bond with their captors. This cognitive restructuring allows them to maintain a sense of coherence in their worldview, despite the abusive circumstances they find themselves in.
The intersection between the Stockholm Syndrome and Russian propaganda unveils another layer of complexity. Russian propaganda, utilizing sophisticated manipulation techniques, aims to shape public opinion and control narratives. By exploiting psychological vulnerabilities, such as the fear of the unknown and the desire for security, they can sway individuals’ perceptions and evoke emotional responses.
In this context, victims of psychological manipulation may exhibit signs of the Stockholm Syndrome by defending and sympathizing with the propagated narrative, even if it contradicts their original beliefs or goes against their best interests. This underscores the immense power of psychological manipulation in shaping individuals’ thoughts and behaviors, turning them into unwitting prisoners of false ideologies.
To combat the toxic influence of propaganda and break free from the grip of manipulation, it is crucial to foster critical thinking skills and media literacy. Developing the ability to analyze information objectively, question sources, and consider multiple perspectives can help individuals resist the allure of manipulative tactics.
By shining a light on the intertwined concepts of captivity, manipulation, and the Stockholm Syndrome, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex mechanisms at play within the human psyche. It is through this understanding that we can strive to create a society that values freedom, autonomy, and the pursuit of truth, free from the shackles of psychological captivity.
Note: The term “Stockholm Syndrome” is used to describe a specific psychological response and should not be used loosely or trivialized.
One of the most infamous examples of Stockholm Syndrome is the case involving Patty Hearst, a newspaper heiress who was kidnapped in 1974 by the radical group Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA). Initially terrified and coerced, Hearst eventually joined the group and participated in their criminal activities. This case generated significant media attention and captivated the public’s interest, sparking widespread discussions about the psychological mechanisms underlying Stockholm Syndrome.
The study of Stockholm Syndrome has provided tragic insights into the complexities of human behavior and the power of psychological manipulation. Researchers have attempted to unravel the underlying factors that contribute to the development of this phenomenon. Some proposed explanations include the captives’ perception of kindness from their captors, trauma bonding, and a survival instinct that leads the captives to adapt to their circumstances.
While Stockholm Syndrome remains an obscure crime, its impact on the understanding of human psychology cannot be understated. By analyzing and comprehending the intricacies of such situations, psychologists and researchers hope to shed light on the various psychological and emotional processes that individuals may experience when faced with captivity and coercion.
It is crucial to note that each case of Stockholm Syndrome is unique, and individuals’ responses can vary significantly. The understanding and treatment of this phenomenon remain areas of ongoing research, aiming to provide support and guidance to individuals who have experienced such traumatic situations.
The study of Stockholm Syndrome has also highlighted the role of empathy and the human need for connection in captive situations. In some cases, victims may develop a sense of empathy towards their captors, seeing them as complex individuals rather than solely as perpetrators. This empathy can create a bond that reinforces the captive’s identification with the aggressor.
Furthermore, the Stockholm Syndrome can have long-lasting effects on the psychological well-being of the victims. Even after their physical captivity ends, they may continue to struggle with conflicting emotions and a sense of loyalty towards their captors. Overcoming these psychological challenges requires a supportive environment where victims can receive appropriate therapy and support to reintegrate into society.
Cultural and societal factors also play a significant role in shaping the dynamics of the Stockholm Syndrome. The cultural norms and values of a society can influence individuals’ responses to captivity and manipulation. For example, in societies that prioritize authority and obedience, victims may be more likely to develop the Stockholm Syndrome as a means of survival.
The media also has a responsibility in portraying and discussing the Stockholm Syndrome phenomenon accurately and sensitively. Misrepresentation and sensationalization can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misunderstandings about the condition. Therefore, it is crucial for media outlets to approach the topic with empathy, ensuring that victims’ experiences are heard and understood.
It is important to remember that Stockholm Syndrome is a complex psychological phenomenon that arises in captive situations, where victims develop an emotional bond with their captors. This response stems from a survival instinct and the psychological mechanisms of identification with the aggressor. It is crucial to continue studying and understanding the Stockholm Syndrome to provide support and guidance to individuals who have experienced such traumatic situations. By doing so, we can strive to create a society that values compassion, empathy, and freedom from manipulation.
A study conducted by Douglas Wilbur, a visiting scholar in the UTSA Department of Communication, sheds light on an important issue regarding the influence of Russian propaganda on popular alternative media sites. Wilbur’s research, which involved analyzing over 600 articles, provides valuable insights into the correlation between Sputnik, Russia’s state-owned media, and these alternative media platforms that are believed to present favorable coverage of Russia and its allies in the United States.
The study, “Propaganda or Not: Examining the Claims of Extensive Russian Information Operations within the United States,” provides a comprehensive content analysis of articles published in four websites that were labeled by Prop or Not as working on behalf of the Russian government. While Prop or Not faced criticism from major U.S. mainstream media for its methodology in labeling 200 sites as vehicles of propaganda, the research conducted by Wilbur demonstrates the strong credibility of the claims made by Prop or Not regarding Russian interference.
In 2017, Prop or Not alleged that Russia was manipulating U.S. public opinion through online propaganda, but their failure to provide compelling evidence left doubts lingering in the air. However, Wilbur’s research has now validated this claim, shedding light on the extent of Russian interference and its impact on U.S. public opinion. The study delves into the manipulation tactics employed by these targeted websites and explores the strategies used to influence the American narrative.
One of the key findings of Wilbur’s study is the strong, positive correlation between Sputnik and sites like Zero Hedge, a Wall Street-focused website. The analysis suggests that these alternative media outlets echo Russian propaganda, aligning with the claims made by organizations like Prop or Not. This raises concerns about covert manipulation of the U.S. news agenda, posing a potential threat to national security.
Wilbur researched articles published on several websites: Zero Hedge, New Cold War, Global Research, and The Daily Sheeple. The outlets were chosen using a random number approach. Published articles on those sites between January 2019 and July 2020 were then selected for examination if they contained the following key terms: Russia, Syria, Ukraine, Iran, Venezuela, and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). These terms were chosen because they highlight important foreign policy issues for the Russian government. Once the articles were selected, their tonality was rated on a positive or negative scale according to how the news stories described Russia and its allies versus the U.S. and its partners.
Wilbur’s analysis offers a valuable contribution to the ongoing debate surrounding the role of Russian information operations in the United States. By meticulously examining the content of these websites, the study provides insights into the methods employed by Russian actors to shape public discourse and sow discord among the American population.
This research serves as a call to action for organizations and individuals alike, highlighting the importance of critically evaluating the sources and information we encounter online. It underscores the need for improved media literacy and the development of strategies to combat disinformation campaigns that seek to undermine democracy and public trust.
In essence, the study conducted by Wilbur offers compelling evidence to support the claims made by Prop or Not regarding Russian interference in the United States. It provides a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and the general public, deepening our understanding of the evolving challenges posed by digital propaganda and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of information in the digital age.
In an era where information is easily accessible and influences public opinion, it becomes crucial for the U.S. media to be aware of and address these propaganda efforts. As Russia creates and utilizes propaganda as a weapon, it is vital for the U.S. media to have effective countermeasures in place, ensuring that accurate and unbiased information prevails.
By highlighting this issue, Wilbur’s research underscores the importance of media literacy and critical thinking. It reminds us that staying informed and discerning in the face of propaganda is integral to safeguarding the integrity of the news and protecting national interests.
Awareness of the existence and potential impact of propaganda is the first step in combating its influence. The findings of this study emphasize the need for continued research, collaboration, and awareness among media professionals, policymakers, and the general public, as they strive to ensure a vibrant and trustworthy news landscape that upholds democratic values.
Understanding the parallels between Stockholm Syndrome and Russian disinformation and propaganda sheds light on how psychological manipulation can shape public opinion and influence individuals’ beliefs. By drawing this comparison, we can gain insight into the mechanisms at play in both situations, revealing the power of manipulation in shaping individuals’ thoughts and behaviors.
Both Stockholm Syndrome and Russian propaganda involve psychological manipulation and the distortion of reality. In cases of Stockholm Syndrome, captives develop an emotional bond with their captors, defending and identifying with them despite the harm they may have suffered. Similarly, Russian propaganda aims to manipulate public opinion through sophisticated tactics, distorting information and narratives to align with their interests.
In both scenarios, fear and uncertainty play a significant role. In captivity situations, victims experience a sense of powerlessness and dependence on their captors, which can lead to the development of Stockholm Syndrome. Similarly, Russian propaganda preys on individuals’ fears and insecurities, manipulating them through emotionally charged content designed to evoke strong reactions.
Another common factor between the two is the psychological defense mechanism of cognitive restructuring. In the case of Stockholm Syndrome, captives may reinterpret their captors’ actions in a positive light, creating a narrative that justifies their bond. Similarly, victims of propaganda may engage in cognitive dissonance, modifying their beliefs to align with the propagated narrative, despite contradictory evidence.
The role of empathy, albeit in different contexts, is also crucial. In Stockholm Syndrome, victims may develop empathy towards their captors, seeing them as complex individuals rather than solely as perpetrators. In the case of Russian propaganda, individuals may sympathize with the propagated narrative and defend actions that align with it, due to the emotional appeal and manipulation employed.
By comparing Stockholm Syndrome with Russian disinformation and propaganda, we can recognize the underlying psychological mechanisms and vulnerabilities that contribute to individuals’ susceptibility to manipulation. This understanding serves as a reminder of the importance of critical thinking, media literacy, and the ability to question and analyze information from diverse perspectives.
Ultimately, by raising awareness of the tactics used in psychological manipulation, individuals can develop resilience against manipulation and make informed decisions based on reliable information. This empowers individuals to navigate the complex landscape of information warfare and mitigate the impact of psychological captivity induced by manipulation and propaganda.

In 1973, there was a huge bank robbery attempt in Stockholm, Sweden. The robbers held four bank workers hostage for six days. On the sixth days, the police broke inside, trying to arrest the robbers and save the hostages but the said hostages tried to protect the robbers from the police. Later on, the hostages refused giving testimony against the robbers and they even started collecting money to defend them. Within six days of captivity, the hostages had started developing a deep sympathy for the robbers.
As a result, the incident in which captives start developing positive feelings for their captors was named Stockholm Syndrome. This intriguing and paradoxical bond between captors and captives was also found amongst prisoners of war and those being kept in concentration camps as well. But in time, it’s seen that Stockholm Syndrome is not all about literal captors and captives. For example; Stockholm Syndrome can be found between parents and children or spouses as well as in narcissistic relationships, which is the main topic of our article.
In what conditions do we see Stockholm Syndrome?
Stockholm Syndrome requires four important elements:
Judging by the first one, you might think that Stockholm Syndrome happening in a narcissistic relationship is very unlikely. You might feel like a narcissistic relationship cannot exactly be life threatening. After all, not all narcissists resort to physical violence. On the other hand, living with a narcissist can mean that your life is indeed in danger. This danger can be physical, emotional, psychological or spiritual. Besides, narcissists can throw violent temper tantrums when they can’t get something they want or when they’re losing control over someone (narcissistic rage). People on the receiving end of this rage (even if their partners have never abused them physical in the past) may find themselves fearing for their lives or well-being in general.
And the second case is about isolating the victim. Isolating the victim is a typical abusive behavior. In some cases, the victim can practically turn into a hostage due to being completely alienated from the outside world. And in some others, the victim avoids the point of views of other people when under the influence of feelings such as jealousy, paranoia and fear fueled by the narcissist. The isolated person fails to notice the abuse they’re being put through due to not being able to consult to other people, and they also feel like this small, artificial kindness shown by the abuser is all they have now so they cling to it.
Another reason is that the victim is unable to escape, or so they believe because they were convinced by the abuser. In the Stockholm robbery, it was found out that one of the hostages got a chance to escape and yet she did not. The reason to that may be the fact she believed she could not succeed, perhaps she was simply afraid of the danger this attempt might bring. In this situation called “behavioral despair”, the victim feels so hopeless that they resign to their fate. In narcissistic relationships, if the victim is financially abused as well, or if they’re in a relationship where there are children involved, they can be convinced that there’s no way out for them. And if the abused person also has a narcissistic parent, it’s quite likely for them to show signs of behavioral despair. Babies are dependent on their parents in order to survive. But when it comes to children who grow up in problematic environments where their needs are not met; the fact they feel dependent and not strong enough as well as the “small favors” granted by their abusive parents every once in a while may cause them to develop a sympathy for them.
In our last condition, in order for the Stockholm Syndrome to emerge the abuser should display a certain amount of kindness. A desperate and hopeless person who’s already in a life threatening situation and utterly at the mercy of the abuser can start trying to rationalize the situation when they’re shown some kindness by the abuser. These attempts at rationalizing the situation may start with “it’s not that bad!” and end in deeply positive feelings for the abuser in time. After a while, the abuser stops being a bad person in the eyes of the victim, they’re simply misunderstood and turned into what they are today due to certain circumstances.
At this point, the abuser clings to the exaggerated versions of the few good memories they had with the abuser and starts seeing them the way they want them to be, not the way they actually are today.
Reasons of Stockholm Syndrome
Stockholm Syndrome is a product and natural result of systematic abuse, and it’s practically a survival mechanism. People try to save themselves from dangerous situations with “fight or flight” instincts. But running away or fighting it may not always be possible. If we consider the Stockholm robbery, the hostages cannot really overpower armed robbers, and their chances of getting shot are pretty high if they try to run away. As a result, the victim experiences stress and wants to protect themselves, but that doesn’t seem possible. Also, our brains and bodies are not fit for long-term and continuous stress. Therefore, eventually people tend to focus on the “positive aspects” instinctively in an attempt to reduce the stress they’re experiencing. This is practically something that protects them from going utterly insane and it helps them cope with the trauma. People suffering from Stockholm Syndrome have faced something so traumatic that the only way to reduce it was to do this.
The first instinct of the hostages might have been to pretend like they’re on the robbers’ side in order to avoid angering them rather than “focusing on the positive”. They can try to please the abuser to avoid violence. In bilateral relationships, if one of the parties is prone to violence and sudden, aggressive outbursts; the other party may instinctively try to keep them satisfied just to avoid their wrath. But after a while, once the hope for escape has completely faded, this situation goes beyond just pretending and the victim can find themselves feeling a genuine sympathy for the abuser.
Long story short, when there’s no hope for escape and that there’s no other options (or so you think), you try to fit in and adapt to the new conditions in order to survive. Besides, once you embrace the abuser’s point of view, you’re no longer a victim. This situation makes one feel less inferior and more in control of things. As long as the danger of maintaining the relationship isn’t much higher than the risk a breakup might bring, it’s quite hard for the victim to acknowledge the situation they’re in.
All these situations serve the abuser well, because then they’ve successfully created a voluntary victim. Especially for the emotional manipulators, keeping the victim completely under their control is not enough; they want the victim to be willing as well.
Despite all this, you might still find Stockholm Syndrome illogical. You might be having trouble understanding a hostage getting attached to their captor, or a child loving their abusive parent, or a person being unable to leave their violent partner. But do not forget that people who have suffered traumatic things cannot always make reasonable choices. Traumatic incidents are exceptional conditions and desperate times call for desperate measures.
What to do in order to get rid of Stockholm Syndrome in narcissistic relationships?
Breaking the trauma bond on your own might be too difficult, so it would be wiser to get psychological help if possible. You need to make sure the person you’re consulting to has enough knowledge and experience about narcissistic personality disorder, codependency and narcissistic relationship dynamics.
You need to cut all ties with the narcissist for good and follow the “no contact rule”. In this way, you’ll be able to establish yourself a safe zone.
And in relationships, you should always focus on the big picture rather than small details. These “small favors” other people grant you may cost you much bigger things in the long run.

24–25 Sep remembered on 8 Oct
Writing memories is like racing with time. From the Hong Kong 18 days ago, to the Bangkok 16 days ago, to the Copenhagen 13 days ago, theoretically, I am catching up with time, but as I caught up, I found remembering what happened harder and harder. Shouldn’t it be another way around? Or just the memories of Skövde, as a new place, are replacing the old ones faster? Or simply, I am tired of remembering?
“I arrived at Stockholm airport at about 0:30am, in the dark of the new moon, on the coldest day of the year. The Swedish officials had been notified of my arrival, and I had no travel documents on me. I did not use the Japanese passport to avoid committing the offence of forgery and waited for all the other travellers to clear customs before I went to the officer, telling them that I had no documents. A young officer guided me to his office to talk, and I cleared customs in about ten minutes. At the airport, Mrs. Gawell and seven or eight other members who were in charge of my case at Amnesty International came to pick me up. The temperature was -25 degrees Celsius, and they brought a jumper, long boots, gloves, a scarf, and a leather hat for me. They probably thought that I came from the subtropics, that I must have been wearing only a flimsy southern jacket. They insisted that I wear all of these things on the spot. I am sure that I must looked ridiculous. The police simply took my name and then asked me to return the next day back to the airport to complete the formalities. I felt that I was truly in another world.” — “A Perfect Escape” by Peng Ming-Min
Here we arrived at a city without memories.
I had never been to Stockholm. This was my first time. I arrived at the Arlanda Airport in the evening. Since I was travelling from Copenhagen, I did not need to go through the border control. The public transportation was easy. I managed to reach the hotel smoothly.
The name of the hotel was Hotel Expo. It was slightly out of the city centre, around 30 minutes by public transportation. However, for someone who used to live in London, anywhere that can reach the centre within 30 minutes, is included in the concept of centre and considered convenient. In conclusion, I love the hotel, and I would recommend it to anyone who’s visiting, especially if you’re on a budget. It’s right in front of a commuter’s train station, Älvsjö. (Like you can literally see the hotel as you leave the station.) I spent 1250 SEK for 3 nights. It was the friendliest price I found. What I booked was a single room with shared toilets. The room was small but with everything one would need, including a clean towel and extra movable spaces (unlike the room F and I stayed in Hong Kong). The toilets were clean and close to the room. My favourite part was the breakfast, which was included in the price. And not only it was included, it was fancy, with everything one could expect from a four-star hotel breakfast buffet — various cold cuts, cheese, breads, coffee, juice, milk, yoghourt, eggs, fruits, oatmeals, cereals, jams…etc., I can continue listing. And what was crazier was that the gym on the ground floor was also included, that as a resident of the hotel, I could use it for free. Free laundry was also available. The surrounding environment was not massively exciting but convenient, with a huge supermarket, Co-op (I almost tried with my old British membership, wondering if it worked.), along with Subway, restaurants, bars, Chinese food…etc.
The checking process was slightly odd. The man behind the counter checked me in, but said I hadn’t paid for the room. I checked the booking record, and made sure that I had. And then he said, “Oh, then don’t worry about it, I will check it again tomorrow.” That was it. He didn’t come back to me afterwards.
After my joyous breakfast the next morning, I started visiting my long list of places related to Peng or Hedin.
My first stop was Norr Mälarstrand 66. The seemingly ordinary address was where Sven Hedin used to live. The walls of the entryway were covered with murals of a world map, as well as a Chinese-style temple to honour him. I was dying to go in, so after taking some photos from the glass door outside, I decided to sit on the staircases, hoping to bump into someone leaving or entering. After 15 minutes or so, I realised that the day was not my lucky day, so I moved on to what was next on my list, Adolf Fredriks kyrkogård, where Hedin was buried, with a 30-minute walk from where he used to live.
On my way there, I realised that I was in need of a toilet. This might be something to confess — I believe that I had this “pink bubble” filter when speaking of Scandinavia. I was imagining public toilets everywhere, clean and free, public Wifi, water cooler, power outlets, free at every corner. However, a free public toilet seemed to be harder to find than I expected. It was almost 11:00am. It took me a while until I found one, an isolated one on the street. It was free, so, hurray! However, it was not as clean and well-maintained as I expected. But well, that was on me. I am the one who chose to wear the pink goggles, and to be honest, comparing it with the ones in London or Paris, it was a tiny heaven on the street. I happily finished what I needed to do, and moved on with my day.
When I arrived at the Adolf Fredriks kyrkogård, it was around 11:15am. I realised that the church was closed. (It was closed between 11:00am — 11:45am daily.) Luckily, the garden, where the cemetery is, was opened. It was a small yard, with, I would say, a bit more than 100 tombstones as far as I could see, which means, it shouldn’t be difficult for me to find the one of Sven Hedin, especially him being a famous figure. I started to stroll around, one side at a time, one roll at a time, carefully trying to locate his name. Unexpectedly, I failed. I kept wondering why and how, thinking probably Hedin did not want me to find him, that probably he did not not approve of my project, or my criticism towards the concept of explorers and what he did.
Do you remember my internet drama? So, once I arrived in Stockholm, I changed my sim card from the British one to the Taiwanese one, and bought some credit so I can have internet access here in Europe. It was slightly more expensive than usual, so I decided that I was not going to use it unless it’s necessary.
After almost half an hour of trying to locate Hedin, I gave up. I sat down on a bench, turned on the internet on my phone, googling the images of the tombstone of Sven Hedin. From using the housing in the background as a clue, I found it. Turned out that it was covered by a van, the only car parked inside the cemetery. I stood in front of him, explaining the project, and apologising, hoping to have his approval. I told him that I am aware that I am not in any position to judge, and I know it was a different time. The project is not about him, not personally at least. Through talking to him, I started to ask myself why I wanted to do this project. What is it for? I suddenly realised that in a way, migration can be a privilege, even for the ones who were forced to. Peng had to escape, otherwise he would have been killed or imprisoned, but again, how many activists at the time couldn’t, ended up in jails or some random cemeteries in Liu Zhang Li. Refugees had to leave, but again, we all know that more of them didn’t make it. So, it’s a privilege, but it doesn’t mean it’s not hard. It doesn’t mean living in a foreign place, learning a new language, facing unfamiliar environments is not something hard. If I can offer something, some sharing, some talks, so we can feel a little bit better, with our lives, with our choices, probably the whole thing would be worth it? That there could be some meanings in all these?
After talking to him, I looked at my phone, it was 11:45am. The church would be opened by now. I suddenly realised, probably he did it on purpose. If I found his tombstone easily at 11:15am, would I have the patience to sit for 30 minutes to wait for the church to open? I might have decided to move on with my day. Feeling grateful at the coincidence, I walked into the church. It was beautiful. I was the only visitor in the church, however, someone started to play the organ. Not sure if it was a regular performance, or the person was practising, it was magnetising either way. I found a bronze plaque dedicated to Sven Hedin on the wall. I guess probably that was the reason he invited me to come in. I also found a LGBTQIA+ friendly rainbow pin at the souvenir store. How sweet. I guess that would fit in the pink bubble goggle that I was wearing. After a short stay, I moved on to my next spot — Historiska Museet.
I actually can’t remember why I put Historiska Museet on my list. I guess probably at some point I read something saying that part of Hedin’s collection was in the museum. When I arrived, I noticed that on Wednesdays, which was the day I visited, tickets were half priced after 5pm. So I decided to come back later.
Where I went next was the US embassy in Stockholm. This was where Peng applied for his US visa. Even though it sounds like an insignificant part of the story, he actually visited a number of times, detailedly remembered and documented in his book. It was also kind of the turning point for him to move on with his journey from Sweden to the USA. From what I found online, the one I visited should be the same one Peng visited. It was launched in 1955.
I was surprised when I arrived. I was expecting a house, or a building at most, like most of the embassies are. The US embassy in Stockholm took up the land of the size of a university campus, composed of buildings and a huge yard. And as expected, it was barricaded. I started to take photos of the entrance, and of course, caught the attention of the security guard. He gestured to me to go over in a friendly manner, and I believed it was time for me to play the innocent, Asian girl, the tourist card. I said, “Oh, I am not here for anything. I just want to have a look, is it okay if I take some photos?” He gave me a positive answer with a smile. And without anything else to do, or could do, I moved on soon after.

Earlier this year I quit my job as the VP of Platform at SoundCloud and moved back to Stockholm. Working at SoundCloud was a hell of a ride which began back in the summer of 2009. At the time, I’d just graduated from KTH and was doing some work at Propellerhead. I was dreaming about starting my own company after falling in love with entrepreneurship during my time at SSES. Through SSES, I’d also met Eric who’s the SoundCloud co-founder and CTO. We have a lot of shared interests and became great friends.
Knowing Eric was a good reason to frequently visit Berlin where SoundCloud is headquartered. I fell in love with the city and was lucky to experience one of the legendary rooftop parties in SoundCloud’s first office. The team was starting to grow and eventually I got an offer to join. The opportunity was perfect; a chance to join a music tech startup I really believed in, work with people I really liked, and finally make the move to Berlin. We agreed over the phone on a Wednesday and started working the week after.
When I joined SoundCloud, we were less than ten people in a scrappy office and the whole company was doing daily stand-ups together. My job was to build relationships with other companies, mainly music software makers, and get developers to hack on our API. There was so much to do and so much to learn. I loved it and was so excited about getting stuff done that I was almost running to work every day.
We thought we were the coolest thing since disco, but in the beginning it was really hard to convince other companies to partner with us. After all, we were just a small startup from Berlin with rapid growth but uncertain future. However, sending thousands of emails, doing hundreds of calls, taking tons of meetings, and traveling to as many conferences as possible, eventually started to pay off.
As we got bigger, things got a lot easier and eventually we reached a point where we couldn’t even handle all the incoming requests from potential partners. I learned the hard way that it takes time to build good relationships and get people to buy into your ideas, and that timing is super important when it comes to closing deals, so you have to be patient and persistent.
Since I was doing partnerships with other tech companies, I traveled a lot to the US. At a certain point, we needed to establish a permanent presence in the Bay Area, and it was natural for me to make the move to San Francisco and setup our new office there. I was of course stoked about the opportunity to work in SF and get a chance to build a small office from scratch.
It took some time to get things in order, but eventually we got the paperwork sorted, found a great space, and started bringing on new people. I got to obsess with things like office furniture, culture (introducing Friday fika), finding the right people, maintaining the connection to our other offices, and evangelizing SoundCloud in the bay area. It reminded me how naturally passionate I am when I get to coordinate things and craft them down to the details. In the end, things worked out great and I’m really proud of having brought the SoundCloud culture overseas and established so many great relationships in the US.
Over time, we expanded the platform team and scaled up our efforts, and over time we managed to connect the vast majority of music apps and a ton of different web services. We launched partnerships with companies like Apple, Twitter, and Facebook, and created a big developer community who built hundreds of hacks on the API. I was also part of the management team and an active contributor to the overall company strategy work.
Starting a company has always been close to my heart, and as things were running smoothly in SF, I felt the timing was right to leave and build something new. I can’t help loving to build things from scratch and I’m constantly looking for new challenges. In addition, taking some time off would give me a chance to charge my batteries and think about my longterm goals in life.
I’m super proud of having contributed to building a such a great company. Building a startup is an amazing experience that I really recommend. I don’t think there’s a better way to try and learn new things. I’ve learned so many great startup lessons along the way and now I want to take that experience and create something on my own.
A massive thanks to Alex and Eric for giving me the opportunity to support their mission and the freedom to do a great job, and to all the awesome people I’ve worked with along the way! I’ve had so much fun and learned so much.

Before I go on with these holy thoughts, I must mention — Everything in KFC is overpriced. I think they are doing child trafficking for the chickens they serve their customers. So small, you start to wonder if they even allowed the chicken to walk before cooking it.
I even battled a bit of food poisoning in the end. What a way to start the week.
That said, if we stretch it far enough, it’s not hard to see how the whole Stockholm Syndrome narrative could be pushed into some rather unholy territory. I find myself thinking about how people grow up loving the very parents who used to beat the living daylight out of them.
If you’ll allow me the looseness, it doesn’t feel like a huge leap to draw a parallel with those who stay in abusive relationships, covering bruises with excuses and clinging to the people who hurt them.
Few things unsettle me more than watching a person tenderly unpack the logic behind getting brutalized by the very hands that claim to love them. It feels like a kind of demonic possession — something ancient, cruel, and crawling beneath the skin. And if we’re ranking horrors, this one isn’t coming in second.
I think it's Stockholm Syndrome, just nuanced a little.
I’m beginning to understand that there are some gentle themes to healthy living, and it…

Home to the famous pop band ABBA and furniture giant IKEA, Stockholm is the second most visited Nordic country. Built across fourteen islands, the city is known as Europe’s first “green” capital and boasts the longest life expectancy on the continent. “Fika”, the afternoon tradition of indulging in a coffee and pastry break, might also be contributing to the high life expectancy. Be sure to participate in this ritual during your time in Sweden.
This guide outlines a possible itinerary for a long weekend in the city. Below is a quick overview of the proposal:
Most US phone companies do not enable free European service. Check with your phone company before leaving to confirm your plan’s allowance.
Debit/Credit Cards are widely accepted everywhere. I never used cash. No need to take out any Swedish kronor (SEK), but if you feel so inclined, visit your local bank before you leave to get the best conversion rates.
It is important to note that Sweden (along with all of the Nordic countries) is an expensive country to visit, so plan to spend more here than other places in mainland Europe.
Stockholm experiences mild annual temperatures, with lows in the winter around 30 degrees Fahrenheit and highs in summer around 70 degrees. Its sunlight hours, however, are more interesting. During the winter, the sun rises around 9am and sets just after 3pm, making it a long, dark span of months. The summer is drastically (and thankfully) different, with the city averaging around nineteen hours of sunlight per day. Unless you plan to visit up north for winter activities, visit Stockholm from May through September for ideal temperatures and light.
The city offers numerous hotel, Airbnb, and hostel accommodations based on price. STF af Chapman & Skeppsholmen Hostel is a budget friendly, clean hostel on a quieter island conveniently in between Gamla Stan and Djurgården (the museum island, as I affectionately call it). Instead of walking (which is still very convenient), take the Skeppsholmen ferry that leaves every twenty minutes to visit main points of interest.
Gamla Stan, the old town section of the city, is another great area to stay in. The Collector’s Lady Hamilton Hotel in this neighborhood is a Victorian-style hotel with modern updates. In addition, Hotel Tegnerlunden is an affordable option in the Norrmalm District, a busy downtown neighborhood home to many iconic landmarks.
To get from the Arlanda Airport to downtown (near Gamla Stan), skip Uber and take the Arlanda Express. Purchase a ticket at the airport for $27 USD one way and arrive at the Stockholm City stop within twenty minutes. The ride includes WiFi and clean bathrooms. A walk to Gamla Stan from there takes another ten minutes.
Once in the city, utilize the SL ferries for an easy and quick system that locals and tourists alike enjoy. Purchase a ticket at every ferry station for less than $2 USD one way. Walking between each island via bridges tends to take time, so this is a better option, especially when going from Gamla Stan to Djurgården.
We got lazy and ended up Ubering to further neighborhoods like Sodermalm from our hostel (with prices averaging that of mainstream US cities). However, we wish we had taken advantage of the metro system. Clean and accessible, it holds the title of the “world’s longest art gallery” so I’m kicking myself for skipping it.
Start your day with fresh squeezed orange juice and a deliciously lite breakfast at Café Schweizer in old town Gamla Stan. This neighborhood is one of the best preserved historic districts in Europe, so take your time sipping coffee while wandering the cobblestone streets in the early morning.
Next, experience a free walking tour to better understand the history of Gamla Stan. The guide will point out key points of interest such as the Stockholm Royal Palace, Stora Nygatan (a lively street with music), and the Swedish Parliament where environmental activist Greta Thunberg began her global protests. If time permits post-tour, stop by Tasty America for a good laugh at a large collection of the over-processed foods popular in the United States. This grocery store was both intriguing and embarrassing, as it really outlines the absurdity of American food culture.
For lunch, pop over to Restaurant Tradition to taste traditional Swedish and Nordic fare. The Hairy Pig, a pub, is another great option for good food and beer. Try the Swedish Meatballs — you won’t regret it. If not quite hungry yet, take the ferry from Gamla Stan to Djurgården and head straight to one of the most popular museums on the island, the Vasa Museum.
At only $18 USD/adult, this is arguably one of the coolest museums I’ve ever been to. Vasa displays a well preserved warship from 1628 that sank twenty minutes into its maiden voyage, drowning all but thirty people out of its 300 passengers. It took 333 years for the Swedes to retrieve the ship from the bottom of the harbor. Visitors can now view the ship from four different stories, along with numerous artifacts and skeletons from the wreckage. The experience typically takes one hour. Do not miss this.
Stockholm has numerous other museums scattered throughout Djurgården and the city in general that you could hit after Vasa. The Viking Museum showcases 9th century Viking ships and artifacts along with a Disneyworld-like Viking ride. The ABBA Museum, a well marketed but somewhat superficial excursion, outlines the rise and success of the famous band. The Nobel Prize Museum highlights key Nobel prizes and laureates. The one museum I would NOT recommend, however, is the Skansen Museum. Although it is the world’s oldest open air museum and is supposed to showcase Sweden pre-industrial era, it completely lacks signage and guides to teach and clarify what you’re looking at. Skip this.
If you plan on visiting several museums, consider purchasing the All-Inclusive Stockholm Pass which will give you discounts and ‘free’ access to many city landmarks and galleries.
End the evening with dinner at Restaurang Kryp In back in Gamla Stan for more traditional Swedish fare and a great espresso martini. Then, head to Winstrom’s Pub or O’Connell’s Irish Pub for drinks and live music.
Stockholm is home to a massive archipelago with over 24,000 islands. These island chains create plenty of options for fun day trips. Stora Fjäderholmarna, Grinda, and Vaxholm are all small islands within a 90 minute boat ride from the main city center.
I had a really hard time determining which island to visit. Stora Fjäderholmarna is charming and only thirty minutes by boat, but does not allow one to truly experience life deep in the archipelago. Grinda takes approximately 90 minutes and has gorgeous views with many adventure sports to take part in, including kayaking and swimming. I’m a bit regretful that we didn’t stop here. The island we did select, however, was Vaxholm and I am both happy and disappointed in our choice.
Considered the capital of the archipelago, Vaxholm is known for idyllic roads and quaint fisherman cottages. To get there, choose from one of two main ferries. The cheapest option utilizes the public ferry, Waxholmsbolaget. Located next to the Grand Hotel and operating year round, the ferry does not allow pre-purchasing tickets so simply purchase on arrival. The trip lasts an hour or so.
The second option, and the one we selected, involves the Cinderella ferry and a history tour. With a restaurant, bar, and guided cruise, this ferry is a bit nicer and lasts approximately 90 minutes each way. It leaves from a different location (Strandvägen berth no 14) and only runs from May through September. If planning to visit Vaxholm and appreciate history, choose this option.
One can also drive or bus to the town as there is a small bridge connecting it to the mainland — but you’d be remiss to skip exploring the archipelago via water.
On land, explore the little town for an hour or two with its boutiques and waterfront parks, especially Johannesbergsparken. When ready for food, indulge in a tasty burger on the docks at Winbergs Kök & Bar or down the road at Vaxholms Hembygdsgårds Café. The latter was closed when we visited, but we stopped by to sit on the picnic tables and enjoy the view. I would have loved to eat here — the location was idyllic and the menu looked delicious.
If you have time, take a quick water taxi to the Vaxholm Fortress Museum, a site that was once the Citadel for Swedish defense in the 19th century.
My day trip to Vaxholm was great, though I wonder what it would have been like to explore a different island with perhaps more to do. The tour allowed for four or five hours on the island, which was too much for what the island offered for activities. I would have preferred to take the Cinderella ferry there for the history and the public ferry home so we could have returned faster and on our own time.
Alternatively, discover additional island tours through Get Your Guide or simply get out on the water with a RIB tour.
Once back in Stockholm, spend the rest of the evening exploring Norrmalm, a modernized downtown neighborhood next to Gamla Stan. Be sure to walk through Kungsträdgården, the city’s oldest park, and Hötorgshallen, a local food market. Grab drinks at the Lydmar Hotel outdoor pop up bar, then dine alongside locals at Restaurant 1889 Fast Fine Pizza. Known for its ritzy decor yet laid back atmosphere, this restaurant simplifies ordering with a QR barcode and no true waitstaff.
Spend the last day in Stockholm choosing from a handful of excursions:
Regardless of what you decide, enjoy the afternoon/evening in Sodermalm, the “Brooklyn” of Stockholm. Visit Söderhallarna, a modern shopping hall with gourmet food stalls and restaurants, or try Mosebacketerrassen, a beer hall with gorgeous views of Stockholm’s skyline. Skinnarviksparken, a park with hills overlooking the city, is another great place for views and people watching. For a casual dinner, head to gastro-pub Honey Honey. We visited during the Eurovision competition and had a great time watching countries compete while chowing down on pork schnitzel and Swedish meatballs with lingonberry sauce. Later, stop by Häktet for lively drinks with a younger crowd.
After four nights in Stockholm, my next stop was Helsinki, Finland. I purchased a one way flight for $200 USD that was quick and easy. However, I wish I had taken the overnight ferry with either Viking Line or Tallink Silja that would have allowed me to see more of the archipelago and saved the cost of a hotel for a night.

Visiting Stockholm | Nordiska museet (Nordic Museum) ❄️,https://medium.com/@wengileong28/visiting-stockholm-nordiska-museet-nordic-museum-%EF%B8%8F-cbe6b44d3434,"Sign up

The first museum I visited in Stockholm (I am a museum enthusiast) is the Nordiska Museum, also known as the Nordic Museum, located in Djurgården, an island in central Stockholm. This museum mainly displays the traditions and lifestyle of Scandinavians from the 16th century. It has over one and a half million pieces! The exterior of the museum is fascinating. It was designed in the Dutch-Danish Renaissance style by Isak Gustaf Clason. Founded in the late 19th century by Artur Hazelius, a Swedish scholar and museum director, who also founded the Skansen open-air museum in Stockholm.
💰Free admission with Go City Pass
Regular admission: SEK 170 by 2024 and free admission for children
Opening Time: Almost open every day, even on Christmas from 10:00–17:00
Once you enter the museum, get your tickets with your Go City Pass and you will see an enormous sculpture of King Gustav Vasa. Gustav Vasa (born Gustav Eriksson of the Vasa noble family, also called Gustav I) was King of Sweden from 1523 to 1560 and the founding father of Sweden. He brought Protestantism to Sweden and outmaneuvered the power of the Catholic Church. Every year on the 6th of June, Gustav’s name day, is celebrated as the Swedish national day to honor the electron of King Gustav Vasa.
Besides the sculpture, there are multiple exhibitions you can explore in the museum including:
The Arctic (Arctic Traces: Nature and Culture in Motion), exhibits the tools used in the Arctic and how people have lived in the Arctic through the years. It also brings up the topic of climate change and global warming. Notably, this exhibition is based on 3 years of research under Lotten Gustafsson Reinius, a visiting professor at Stockholm University.
On the right side of the lobby, you can see another exhibition: Strinderg vs. Youssef. It was created by an artist Daniel Youssef with inspiration from August Strindbuerg’s autobiographical novel Inferno. Inferno was written in French from 1896 to 1897. The book talks a lot about Strindberg’s obsession, e.g. occultism, alchemy, and shows signs of paranoia. The story behind the exhibition is interesting, but I am not going to lie, I indeed find the exhibition confusing and hard to interpret the display.
Worth mentioning that there are audio guides available in multiple languages for free!
Another exhibition is called British — Ever So Nordic. It displays the Nordic fashion, clothes style, and lifestyle that was influenced by Britain. One exhibition that I found quite interesting is the “Traditions” located on Level 3. The exhibition constructs the scenes and details of how Nordics celebrate Midsummer, Christmas, and Easter, and the history behind it. Next to this exhibition is the “Table Settings”. Basically, this exhibition shows the interiors and the table setting from the 16th century to circa 1950, including coffee and tea parties, tables for aperitifs, aquavit, and banquets. (You can also see a “Swan” in the exhibition).
The last exhibition that I went to was on Level 2 (Lobby) right next to the Children’s Playhouse. It demonstrates the setting of a traditional Nordic family and most of the displays there are interactive. However, I did not see any description on the official website, but it is worth taking a look!
Before leaving the museum, go to the museum shop and see if there is anything that you want to get as a souvenir and maybe have a real Swedish “fika” in the cafe on level 2.
Recommendation: 🌟🌟🌟/ 5
A must for those who love Nordic history!

I just finished my 5 km run. The sky was grey the whole time, but it didn’t start raining until the moment I stopped — like the weather had been holding back, waiting for me. As the first drops landed on my skin, I stood there, catching my breath, and suddenly I was somewhere else entirely.
Do you remember that day in Stockholm? Outside the Vasa Museum, the first snow of the week had started to melt into rain. We didn’t have an umbrella — of course we didn’t — and we just walked, laughing at how unprepared we were. I was giggling the whole time, remember? It was my first time experiencing snow. I must’ve looked ridiculous — eyes wide, hands out like I could catch the whole sky. But you just smiled and let me take it in. It was cold, but you didn’t complain. I think we were too caught up in the quiet magic of it all.
I closed my eyes today in the rain, and for a second, I could feel your hand in mine again. That desperate little run we made, slipping on cobblestones, trying to find shelter — we never really cared if we found one. Just being there, soaked and smiling, was enough.
I miss the way you looked at me like you wanted to say something, but didn’t. Like the silence between us held more than words ever could. I miss how we didn’t need to explain anything. Everything felt full already.
It’s strange how the body remembers. A cold wind, a wet sleeve — and suddenly I’m there again, with you.
Where are you now? Are you somewhere it’s raining too?
Always,Me

If I have to sum up 2024 it has to be ‘adventure’!
In the quest of making a pivot in my life, I made more than hundred new contacts this year. Every time I spoke with someone, I was looking for a match of vibration. And it actually worked like a story!
I clearly remember the morning when I stood outside a building in central Stockholm, inquisitive about what to expect in the meeting that was about to happen. The door opened, I was welcomed in. A nice lounge, then a kitchen with bananas on a plate. I asked if I can have one. I ran in the morning after breakfast and was exhausted of energy. The urge to have a banana overpowered my self-consciousness. Exchanging a few more sentences, it felt like here I am welcome to be who I am. It was encouraging to leave self-consciousness at the door.
The interaction with a group of people running this new AI firm was particularly positive. I met them again in a few days and it felt like they are brimming with passion to make something work. They have just started a venture and they are looking for someone sharing the vision. And it felt good.
They were fast, it took 3 weeks from the first meeting to the decision. They said this was one of the longest process! I had many questions in my mind, but positivity the company protruded overpowered it all. I matched their vibe, I felt genuinely welcome. The CTO promised me a laptop by the end of my first day. Little did I know that he literally meant it, in the evening while I was out running, I got a call from him, he was standing outside my door.
Working at an AI startup means quite a lot of new information to process everyday by everyone. We don’t have time to sit an ponder over frictions. We chase a common goal and try to resolve issues fast, that means talking more, opening up and showing earnest interest in the goals, finding what will make it work without triggering each other. Feedback loops are faster, tighter and effective. We are always learning and sharing.
There is a high intensity of external communication. We reach outs to people across the industry, write articles, active on social media, give credit to one another. My colleagues were happy to act as photographers, editors and writers to engage with the public, creating a strong thought leadership that draws visitors to our website without any external marketing help. And we pick up the phone and call! We gather most of our leads through our contacts, we make sure to present ourselves as who we are and present the strong determination to make AI agenda work, and our enthusiasm is contagious. There is a touch of genuinity in our proposals, we are a young company, innovative, ready to work, flexible. And we keep those promises that we make. No BS.
Some days are full of self doubt, prospects disappear suddenly, makes one feel small. The internal chat channels are saviors, its a lively space with messages, memes and regular business updates. We keep track of each other, not chasing hours, rather than putting in efforts to collaboratively build the brand. Its rare to have a day without a roller coaster of emotions from ‘Yayyy’ moments to existential doubts. Our salaries includes a fat portion of ‘Resilience’ which is unmatched in numbers. And it just grows, and the best part it I can cash out in any situation of my life, the ‘Resilience’ is the best fund to invest in, it will be with me through thick and thin and will be passed on in generations!
A startup business requires scaling down on lot of aspects. Conferences are silent time eaters, the more you go, the more time you need to process the information and to realign the offset it brings in schedule is weighed by the impact it brings. We don’t ditch it altogether but we are extremely choosy on what to attend. Post work gatherings on the other hand are so exciting and lively! We look forward to it, take turns to organize, sit and talk passionately about our lives and challenges. The conversations fuels the energy needs for the next couple of weeks, reloaded with laughter.
Its been 6 months, the company has grown more than a 100%. Its a dynamic environment yet quite simple, non-pretentious. Everyone brings their own self at work, with their creativity and ideas flowing beyond their roles and titles. If you work at a startup or know anyone working at one, verify if my claims. I am all ears for ‘adventures’ !

Following on from part one of my Stockholm trip at the Vasa Museet, this post reflects on my visit to Nationalmuseum — Sweden’s museum of art and design — and a conversation with Lena Eriksson, Head of Education.
Unlike my earlier visit to the bustling Vasa, this experience offered a quiet contrast. I met Lena on a Monday, when the museum was closed to the public. So instead of wandering the galleries, I had the chance to sit with Lena over coffee for a visit filled with insights rather than artworks.
Nationalmuseum is not just a museum, but also a government authority. Our mandate is to preserve cultural heritage and promote art, public interest in art, and knowledge of art. This mandate is set out in an annual letter of instruction from the Swedish government.
We want to put social development in perspective and be an active player in contemporary society.
This made me wonder: how different is a government-funded museum like this from a university museum? One key difference Lena highlighted was how shifts in government can directly impact priorities, including decisions around accessibility and entry fees. At the time of my visit, admission was 160 SEK (around £12.50), free for under-20s, but with no concessions for older adults or disabled visitors. Navigating such changes with each new administration must be complex, especially when core principles like accessibility can shift with political tides.
Lena also shared insights into the museum’s education programme, which, like many institutions, focuses heavily on children, families, and schools. Their website features a dedicated page for families, with free studio sessions every Sunday, the Oculus Walk — a self-guided family tour — and Villa Curiosa, a playful, sensory exhibition designed to spark curiosity and philosophical questions in children.
Naturally, my own research interests led the conversation towards older audiences. I was curious about the museum’s engagement with older adults and community groups.
As is so often the case, Lena explained that while some great work has been done — including sessions for people living with dementia, inspired by Meet Me at MoMA — these projects are often reliant on short-term external funding. Engagement with older adults still isn’t widely seen as a core part of museum work, despite Sweden’s super-ageing population.
One standout project during the pandemic connected older adults in Sweden and Japan through creative online dialogue — a beautiful example of how digital innovation can support inclusive, cross-cultural exchange.
Before wrapping up, I took a moment to check out Nationalmuseum’s accessibility information online. I was pleased to find it easily — just one click from the homepage — and even more impressed by the friendly, human tone of the opening message:
“We want Nationalmuseum to be open to everyone and are always working to improve our accessibility. If you have any questions or suggestions, we would be happy to hear from you.”
A small but meaningful sign that the museum is open not only to visitors, but to conversation and change.

With my other daughters occupied by their own half-term adventures, I opted for a city getaway to Stockholm; the bargain £29pp return flights played a huge part in my decision. When I’m on the lookout for affordable flights, I make it a habit to browse Skyscanner daily. Despite having to drive from the Midlands to Stansted Airport, the journey proved financially viable as we got cheap flights. Thanks to clear skies over Northern Europe, the flight itself was a mere two hours.
Stockholm in February unfolds like a fairytale, its cobblestone streets dusted with snow and its historic buildings adorned with twinkling lights. For travellers seeking an affordable escape, surprisingly this Scandinavian gem can offer a treasure trove of experiences without breaking the bank.
Embarking on a Winter Boat Trip
No visit to Stockholm would be complete without experiencing its beautiful winter scenery from the water. Despite the cold, a boat trip around Stockholm’s archipelago allows you to capture stunning views of the city draped in snow. Wrap up warmly and sip on hot beverages from the onboard café as you, immerse yourself in the tranquillity of Stockholm’s winter wonderland.
Discovering Stockholm’s Cultural Marvels
Delve into Stockholm’s rich cultural tapestry with visits to its renowned museums, including the ABBA Museum and the Vasa Museum. Dive into the pop phenomenon at the ABBA Museum, where interactive exhibits and karaoke booths bring the iconic band’s music to life. The Abba silent disco was hilarious, and my daughter and I made lasting memories. For a more educational visit then, journey back in time to the Vasa Museum, marvelling at the remarkably preserved Vasa ship that sank centuries ago in the harbour on its first voyage.
Indulging in the Culinary Scene
Stockholm’s culinary scene offers something for everyone. Don’t miss the chance to savour meatballs, a Swedish classic, paired with lingonberry sauce and creamy mashed potatoes or fermented herring. I follow a vegetarian diet, but there were plenty of delicious alternatives available. From mouthwatering vegan meatballs to falafel wraps and the comforting tradition of Fika — a hot drink paired with something sweet for a boost in cold weather — Stockholm offers an abundance of tasty dishes that won’t break the bank.
Unique Accommodation Aboard the Red Boat Hostel
For an unforgettable stay, book a room aboard the Red Boat Hostel, a floating haven nestled in Stockholm’s heart. Enjoy cosy rooms and breathtaking views of the city skyline or tranquil frozen waters surrounding the boat. With its budget-friendly rates, the hostel is the perfect choice. Plus, it’s impeccably clean, cosy, and offers a fantastic buffet breakfast.
Embracing Free Attractions
Maximise your budget with free activities, such as the brilliant and informative walking tour of Gamla Stan, Stockholm’s captivating Old Town. Wander through narrow alleyways and picturesque squares as your guide shares stories of the city’s medieval history. The knowledgeable guides generously volunteer their time, so show your appreciation by tipping them at the end of the tour. Sweden is a cash-free society, even the guides accept card for their tips.
From exploring world-class museums to indulging in culinary delicacies and embarking on free walking tours, there’s no shortage of affordable experiences awaiting you in this Scandinavian gem. Pack your bags, wrap up warm, and prepare for a memorable excursion filled with culture, cuisine, and adventure. #stockholm #citybreak #budgettravel #wintercitybreaks #copysella

Because it strikes the chord between kidnapper and captor for meeting the needs.
The primal pangs of hunger are often the driving force of human bonds. Hunger for us, is more than growling stomach.
Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs explains that a humans are motivated by five basic hungers.
a) Physiological hunger for air, water, food, shelter, and sleep.
b)Security hunger for health, property, employment.
c) Connection hunger for family, love, intimacy, friendship.
d)Psychological hunger for esteem, respect.
e) Metaphysical hunger for self actualization.
Being the head of the community vocational program designed for providing employment opportunities to girls, I’ve come across some baffling cases of marriages. No matter what the degree of abuse, these women never fail to patronize their husbands.
After listening to few girls, I decided to take an inventory to write and see that NEEDS can be irrational and self-deprecating at times.
I talked to more than 10 women from abusive marriages apparently. And to my utter shock they were point blanc unwilling to walk out of the marriage because they thought that however barbaric, they were protected from outer terror-fueled world.
Besides safety, they had one more thing in common – strong attachment.
Just like the victims of Stockholm syndrome. As they fell for their captors and develop a soft bond of connection with them. Because mostly the captors are the one’s who fulfill their basic needs like food and medicine and often physical intimacy when the require to process the trauma of being hijacked or kidnapped.
This is not very common, to fall in love for your kidnapper or captor but happens with people with low self esteem and history of abuse.
When I talked to these women, they were rude and said – better worship one man than be a raw piece of meat to wolves out there.
One of the girl who’s hardly 25 years, told me that her husband after thrashing her hard, treats her with sex and restaurant food. After beating the shit out of her when she is in pain, he doesn’t allows her to cook food. Even takes her to the doctor for treating all the bloody bruises. In this situation when she is being treated so well, she thinks of him as an emergency God. Especially when there is no support from the family.
Psychologists says that terror-bonding and feeling empathy rather than rage towards your captor is the classic example of Stockholm Syndrome. It can also develop between abusive parents and children. Where the child may feel protective toward the parent and try mending the ways to keep the parents happy, unsuccessfully.
When I tried to educate these girls on the psychology of the syndrome, they were reluctant to understand.
As they feel that bonding with their captors( read husbands) after years of intimacy is their survival strategy and looking for normality within the framework of chaos and distress.
What’s wrong in choosing bad when you have the worst? Saying this one of the girl slaps her butt and walks off to stich a new pattern of dress she’s learning under the program.
Psychological abuse is much deeper than we can imagine. It becomes the way of life when the victims have never seen the other side.
Listening to some of the girls – and coming from non-psychological background – there were times I was compelled to see their POVs.
No financial independence and emotional part of the brains shackled tightly.
I believe in rewriting these narratives women needs exposure, life skills, and independence of all nature.
Education on self-esteem, respect. But on top of all education on self-discovery, non-reliance and then finances.

In January of 2019, I started at a new company, which has its headquarter in Stockholm. It was clear that I would — at some point — travel to the capital city of Sweden to pay a visit to the main office. The first opportunity for this was an internal two-day-workshop. There were several options for the date I could choose from. I decided for the Wednesday and Thursday directly after Easter. This way, I could do use the public holidays plus only two additional vacation days to have a ten-day-travel. Two of those days, of course, for the workshop. The remaining days were free for visiting Stockholm. But with eight days at disposal, I decided to spend the first few days (Good Friday until Easter Monday) in the Norwegian capital instead.
As my company also has an office in Oslo, the idea was to meet up with some colleagues for a coffee or lunch. What I wasn’t aware of is that the Easter days are used by the Norwegians usually to spend their time skiing in the mountains. So nearly no one was even in the city and my plan to meet the local colleagues didn’t work out as planned.
20.473 steps.
To get from Oslo-Gardermoen Airport to the central station, there are basically two options: the Flytorget express train (196 NOK; 22 min) and the regional trains operated by NSB (105 NOK; 23 min), such as the R10. I chose the latter. Due to the cancellation of the flight by EasyJet I had intended to take to Oslo, I had to travel a few hours earlier than planned. Which also meant to arrive more prior in Oslo. But as the hotel I booked only offered check-in from 15:00, I had to come up with something to kill time. Unfortunately, this also meant to carry my backpack around the city as well, weighing about eight kilograms. During my first walk through the town, I already visited the Munch museum, but the famous scream was not on display, unfortunately.
One of the things I usually try to do is having a walk around the neighborhood of my hotel on the first day. This gives me quite a good feeling about the area, and I can check out where I can get some snacks for the evening and more importantly: bottled water. It’s not about not trusting the hotels tap water. But when I’m walking around the city for sightseeing, I avoid buying food or drinks in places crowded with tourists, as the prices are a bit higher there. My recommendation is to walk the narrow, little side streets and try to take a different route each time. I usually start in a general direction and find the path as I go depending on which way look more appealing. This method will give you a better picture of the city, and you will find the restaurants where the locals eat. These typically serve good quality for more reasonable prices compared to the restaurants located directly at the usual tourist routes.
28.984 steps.
For the first full day in the city, I decided to book the Oslo Pass for 24 hours using their Android app, which was very convenient. This pass already included public transport. Using this, I took the bus 30 to the peninsula of Bygdøy for visiting the Viking Ship Museum, the Holocaust Center, the Norwegian Maritime Museum, the Fram Museum, and the Kon-Tiki Museum. The Fram Museum got built around the ship of the same name, which was used for polar explorations and the museum included many stories of exploratory expeditions for the north and south pole. All of the mentioned museums had excellent exhibitions and are also suitable for tourists as items are mostly labeled in Norwegian as well as English. I originally planned to include the Norwegian Museum of Cultural History while being in Bygdøy, but instead decided to take the ferry back to the central city. After leaving the boat, I headed for the Akershus fortress, where I wanted to visit Norway’s Resistance Museum and the Norwegian Military History Museum, but both were closed for Easter. Continuing the tour of museums, I took a streetcar to Frogner Plass, to visit the Vigeland Museum about the work of sculptor Gustav Vigeland. Oslo’s city museum is just around the corner, displaying the history of Oslo or Christiania, as the city was named between 1624 and 1924. After I had to leave (as they were closing), I went back with the streetcar and having my last stop for that day, the Nobel Peace Center. This museum was designed very nicely and worth a visit.
After being afoot for more than ten hours that day, I arrived back to my hotel. Although I already knew there was a high rate of electric cars in the Nordic countries, I was still really impressed by seeing at least one Tesla in every single street. There were electric cars of other brands as well but less prominent. Furthermore, there are also quite a lot of electric scooters in the city. Problematic in this context is that they seemed to be allowed on the sidewalks, which I think is pretty dangerous. In fact, Austria just banned them from the sidewalks for this reason, and France plans to do the same.
20.236 steps.
For Easter Sunday, I booked a boat tour around the Oslofjord in the week before traveling. This tour lasted about 2 hours and might have been one of the main factors for my sunburn that I took from Oslo as a souvenir. This tour also included some facts about the buildings at the shores of the fjord and some local history. The Oslofjord is distinctive among the fjords of Norway, as it is one of the oldest, and was not formed by a moving glacier but being part of the Olso rift. After returning to the harbor, I headed to the Royal Palace, as the changing of the guard was going to happen at 13:30.
Although the park around the royal palace is quite lovely and open to the public, I went to Vigelandparken afterward, to see the sculptures, of which I had only seen the models in the museum the day before. I wasn’t the only one with this idea that day. The sun attracted a lot of people, who wanted to enjoy the beautiful sunny weather in the park. There were also some people around which seemed to me as they would be geocaching. And after looking at the map of caches around, I also started to visit some of them in the park as well as outside, while walking back to the city center. The downside was I got so distracted with geocaching, that I left my DSLR camera on a bench next to one cache. As James May would say: C**k!
C**k!
— James May
So I walked back the route I just walked as I was trying to remember when the last time was I had the camera in my hands. Fortunately, a Norwegian couple walked towards me, while I was approaching Vigelandpark again. The guy is carrying a DSLR camera around his neck. Hm, that looks exactly like the one I just lost. It even has the bubble level on it. Wait. Is that mine? It was. He handed it over and explained that they left a note where I lost it, stating they would bring it to the next police station. After having a short chat, I thanked them again, and we split up. As this was enough stress for one day, I decided the next thing I would do is to have a burger and a beer. For this, I stepped in at “The Scotsman.” Like other Norwegian places, you have to get a table first, remember the table number, and then walk up to the bar for ordering. In the background, I could watch the Premier League, as Everton vs. Manchester United was ending, followed by Cardiff vs. Liverpool. A friendly way to end this day.
8.563 steps.
On Easter Monday it was already time to leave Oslo and get on the plane for Stockholm. Somehow, I thought my flight would take off at 10:30 in the morning. Therefore I tried to be at the airport at 9:00, which worked. But somehow I had the wrong time in mind, as my flight was actually scheduled for 12:40. Well, time to find a seat and continue reading my book. But first, let’s find a pharmacy to get something to treat my sunburn. As I don’t speak any Norwegian, I took some time and was switching between shelves back and forth. In the end, I settled for a product which seemed suitable and was small enough to take on the plane. At the cashier, I didn’t have to pay anything. I was confused. The clerk pointed to a sticker on the product, which explained (in Norwegian of course) that I just found an Easter egg. This kind of ‘hide and seek’ seems to be a common thing in some Norwegian shops. It reminded me of some chocolate hidden in the Akershus fortress I noticed when I was there two days before.
After arriving at Stockholm central station, I looked for a supermarket to get bottled water and some lunch/dinner to eat in the hotel. I found a coop with a nice salad bar. And as I was in Sweden now, I couldn’t resist buying about two kilograms of Swedish candy which I emptied over the next couple of evenings at the hotel.
26.940 steps.
As the hotel I stayed at in Stockholm is named “Hotel with Urban Deli,” you can imagine that the breakfast you get here is not standard. Italian-style salami, fresh bread, fruits, yogurt, smoothies, a good selection of loose tea. There was nothing I missed and nothing I could complain about. Everything was fresh and of high quality.
After the great breakfast, I walked a bit around the neighborhood, without a specific destination in mind. While walking towards Gamla Stan, the old city, I came by the Mediterranean Museum. It has a broad selection of items from different cultures around the Mediterranean Sea, including Egypt, ancient Rome, etc. It mainly showcased the evolution of beliefs for life after death and corresponding funeral rituals. After a short stop for a chat and coffee at my company’s main office, I visited the Swedish Army Museum. Showing the history of the Swedish military equipment in the context of the timeline of wars Sweden fought.
As it was already too late for visiting the Swedish History Museum or the Royal Armory, I decided to have a short break at the hotel, before attending a 1,5 h guided tour through Gamla Stan. The tour named “The Ghost Walk” explained some of the darker aspects of Stockholm’s history and was presented by a guide, who was loving his role and tried to send chills down our spines. If you do one guided tour in Stockholm, do this!
Combined: 13.259 steps.
Here it comes, the reason I planned to travel to Stockholm in the first place. A two-day-workshop about communication and personalities. There was a lot of input I received here and lots of things I have to recap after the travel. We were eleven people in this workshop including the facilitator, most of which Swedish. Apart from having fun during the workshop doing some role-plays, we also got to know each other during joined breakfast, lunch and dinner on both days.
17.878 steps.
As the workshop days were a bit exhausting, I started this day a bit later. The breakfast in the hotel was again a great way to do this. But I passed on coffee at the hotel, as I had an appointment for coffee with someone at the company’s office again. Even though this was during my official vacation days, I took to opportunity to have coffee with some colleagues I usually would not meet (as we work in different cities).
While walking to the Royal Palace, I already noticed military marching music playing somewhere. The royal music corps was already on the way to the palace half an hour before the changing of the guard would take place (scheduled for 12:30). I wasn’t the only one having the idea of watching this today. People flooded the area in front of the palace, barely being contained by a few guards to secure the ceremony would have enough room to take place. Although I didn’t understand a single word they said via the public speaker system, it was still quite a show to experience. As the same ceremony in Oslo didn’t contain a music corps, a comparison would be unfair.
One of the most famous landmarks of Stockholm is the city hall though, the Stadshus. The Nobel prizes are awarded here, except for the Nobel Peace Prize which we spoke of before. And there are also some geocaches around. After having spent the majority of the day in parks, I headed back to the office, where an event for new hires was going to happen including Swedish student’s drinking songs, occasionally interrupted by some 15-minute talks. Another opportunity for mingling with colleagues I usually wouldn’t meet.
26.420 steps.
All the things that usually would cost an entrance fee were left for today. Firstly, because I planned to use the Stockholm pass this day, which even gets cheaper if you buy it online and then use the QR code from the mail. Secondly, because of the Stockholm Kulturnatt. Between 18:00 and midnight, a lot of museums and other places were free to visit and offered special tours or exhibitions. But the first thing I had planned for this day was to take the ferry from Klara Mälarstrand to the Royal Domain of Drottningholm to visit the palace and its surrounding park which are part of UNESCO’s world heritage list. The richly decorated palace and its park are worth a visit. In contrast to my boat tour in Oslo, I was prepared with some sun blocker this time.
After arriving back to Klara Mälarstrand, I walked towards Gamla Stan to revisit the Royal Palace. This time also from the inside. With the Stockholm pass, I could directly walk up to the entrance without the need to buy a separate ticket at the desk located in a side wing. At the admission checkpoint, you will be asked to wear your backpack in front of you. I forgot to ask why. In nearly every room, there is a little sign explaining the purpose and history of that room, from bedrooms to audience rooms. As the monarchs introduced a few different orders of chivalry over the years, there are also some rooms dedicated to them. There is a room for the Order of the Polar Star, another room for the Royal Order of the Seraphim, and so on.
Maybe the most prestigious award in the world is the Nobel Prize. Apart from the Nobel Peace Prize, the Nobel Prizes are awarded in the city hall of Stockholm. In 2001, the Nobel Museum opened in Stockholm, which was the next place to visit for me. In here you can find the history of the inception of the Nobel Prizes and temporary exhibition about Martin Luther King Jr. who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, one year after his famous speech.
The probably most popular museum in Stockholm though is the Vasa Museum. The Vasa was a ship built in the 1620s by order of Swedish king for demonstrating the great power of his empire. As he was continually changing his mind about the design of the vessel and demanding to include a higher number of cannons every time, the ship’s buoyancy was put in danger. In fact, after being hit by a mild gust, she sank during her maiden voyage while still being in the harbor of Stockholm. 333 years later, she was recovered, and the museum was built around her.
As the museums had to prepare for the Kultunatt, they all closed at 17:00. During the one hour wait for them to reopen again, I went to eat real Swedish Köttbullar with mashed potatoes and lingonberries at Sjöcafeet. Afterward, I was fit again to continue with the Kultunatt, starting back at the Vasa Museum, as I didn’t manage to see everything on the first visit. Of course, there was quite a queue for the museum building up. On the same island, there is also the Spritmuseum showcasing alcoholic beverages in the context of culture and society. It also included a temporary exhibition about food consumption and consumer behavior in general. Just a few meters further, the Nordic Museum waited to be visited, showing the history of Swedish culture. The focus for the Kulturnatt was put on how Swedish people dressed throughout the decades.
4.500 steps.
Two days before, I coincidentally read a mail from SAS stating that strikes might occur due to ongoing negotiations with their pilots. As my flight wasn’t booked with SAS directly, but via a travel agency, I had to talk to them for asking what was going to happen now. But my flight was not officially canceled yet. So I had to wait. On the next day, I rechecked the status of my flight and saw that it was canceled now. After talking to the agency again, they couldn’t book an alternative flight for me, for organizational reasons. So I had to see for myself how I would be traveling back home. I found a flight operated by a company I never heard of before, with a stop in a city I have never heard if before. And I started at Stockholm Bromma Airport now, instead of Arlanda, which in the end didn’t make any difference in my travel time though. But the 2,5 h stop in Växjö did.
Unfortunately, the Växjö Småland Airport didn’t have a transit area, so after having walked from the aircraft to the airport building, I was already out of the security area. So I had to go through another security check for getting to the gate. THE gate. There was exactly one. As only five flights departed from that airport in total on that day, they don’t need more. It’s the smallest international airport I ever visited. But it was relaxing as well. I used the time to continue the book I was reading, and soon enough it was time to board the same aircraft again for the flight to Berlin. In the end, I landed safely at Berlin-Tegel Airport and was happy to be back home.

So, it’s taken a bit of time to get this blog up… but, in this forth blog post in my #StockholmSeries, I reflect on visits to two neighbouring museums in Stockholm — ArkDes and Moderna Museet…
I came across ArkDes — the Swedish Centre for Architecture and Design — while I was exploring places to visit on this research trip.
I saw that “Admission to ArkDes is free throughout 2025” which was fantastic, but I was also really intrigued by a project they’re running — Unboxing, which runs every day for two hours enabling you to meet and chat to one of the museum’s curators.
Unboxing is the place where you, together with the museum’s curators, unpack and explore never-before-seen items from the museum’s underground archives.
I was interested by the concept of bringing the collection into a different space, giving visitors the opportunity to see behind the scenes, and the museum’s commitment to this being available to everyone, everyday. It blurred the line between exhibit and experience — a quiet but clever way to shift how people relate to the space.
I went straight to the space, which was easy to navigate to from the front of the gallery. Unboxing provides the opportunity for the museum to engage with visitors in a different way, gives curators the chance to talk about their passion, and for visitors to experience objects from the collection — for me, this was seeing architectural drawings — in a different way.
Next door at Moderna Museet, the invitation to engage was everywhere: tables with drawing paper, sketchbook stations, scattered books and varied seating. Each space offered a different kind of welcome, always with a gentle prompt to pause, reflect or create. I loved the moments of rest — especially a bench by a floor-to-ceiling window tucked behind a door marked “staff only” — an unintentional but beautiful in-between space.
I also met with staff from both museums, who spoke about the challenges (and small wins) of increasing access and inclusion, from updating signage to navigating funding and policy shifts. It was a reminder that innovation doesn’t always come from big gestures — it often lives in the details.

More than 100 miles north of the Arctic Circle, our Vy train to Narvik climbed an other-worldly landscape of lakes, rivers and waterfalls, dotted with cabins painted in Scandinavia’s iconic Falu red with white trim.
I was thousands of miles from home, and I felt as if I were on another planet.
Population and vegetation were sparse as we climbed in latitude and altitude, crossing through the Scandinavian Mountain range that forms the border between Sweden and Norway.
I have logged more than 40,000 miles by rail, and love trains so much that I’ve made slow train travel the subject of my master’s capstone. I have always been intrigued by the Arctic, drawn to the northern reaches when looking at maps. And for 24 hours in mid-October, I had the privilege of bringing these two interests together with a 637-mile train trip from Stockholm, Sweden, to Narvik, Norway.
After 48 hours in Stockholm with our cousins, my brother Michael and I arrived at Stockholms Centralstation — a 151-year-old transportation hub that draws 200,000 visitors every day — with about 45 minutes to spare, my bags a little heavier than when I first arrived in the Swedish capital.
Our sleeper train would take us through Swedish forests, over steep mountains and down to the Norwegian port city of Narvik, where we would catch a 4-hour bus ride even farther north to Tromsø, the third largest city above the Arctic Circle.
I grabbed one last cardamom bun at Stockholms Centralstation — my fourth in 48 hours — before we boarded. I had always associated cardamom with Middle Eastern food, but Sweden and Norway consume 18 and 30 times more cardamom than the global median, and cardamom buns were everywhere in Stockholm. Not knowing where I would find one again, I couldn’t resist one more.
When the train rolled in to the station, we found our car and boarded, joining a crowd of passengers from other parts of the world. I heard Italian, Chinese, and a lot of non-native English.
We had booked a couchette, a small space for six people, two benches facing each other by day, three beds on each side by night. I was hoping we’d have the space to ourselves, but we had the next best thing: just one other passenger, a quiet youngish man in a striped t-shirt and a baseball cap who had a bunk at the very top.
Mike and I didn’t stay long in the couchette. As soon as the attendant checked our tickets, we headed to the dining car, where we could sit at a table and enjoy some Bottenvikkens brews from northern Sweden and be around other passengers.
For dinner, I couldn’t pass up the most unique dish — reindeer stew with potatoes, mushrooms and lingonberries. Other offerings included folded flatbread with fried egg and Jokkmokk-sausage, and classic Swedish shrimp sandwich. Each boxed dinner bore the words “We proudly serve food made from scratch in Luleå.”
After dinner, I broke into the sampler pack of aquavit that I had purchased at the liquor store in the Åhléns department store in Stockholm.
One after another, we split four tiny bottles, each one with a different combination of flavors, including dill, caraway, rosemary, citrus, cumin, anise, sherry and cinnamon.
I split each between two glasses, and as we would do throughout our weeklong trip, Mike and I toasted with the Scandinavian “skål” first tapping each other’s glass, then tapping our own glass to the table as a toast to the house before taking the first sip.
Back at the couchette, we made our beds as quietly as we could, knowing that someone else was above us. I would have hated to be in his position, so close to the ceiling. I slept relatively well, waking up every so often to peek outside, in vain, to see if I could see the Northern Lights.
I knew that the restaurant car would open at 5 am and, wanting to be among the early risers, I got up at 5:30 to head down there.
The train was stopped at the Älvsbyn station, and as I made my way to the restaurant car, I found an open door and stuck my head out for fresh air. There I met a train attendant who told me we were stuck for a bit, awaiting information on when we could proceed. I sat and had my tea, texting with my mom and waiting — and waiting — and waiting.
I had oatmeal with cardamom, granola and lingonberries, and we waited some more.
After an hour of “we will know soon,” we were told that due to track problems ahead, we would have to take a bus to Boden and board a new train there, not arriving in Narvik until after 5 pm, long after our bus — and a final subsequent bus — to Tromsø would have departed.
At around 9:30 am, a bus arrived to take us to Boden. It meandered through Swedish forestland, the first of many, many, many miles of it that we would see in the coming hours.
I was disappointed to learn that the train we would board at Boden was a day train, lacking many of the amenities of our night train, namely, my favorite one, the restaurant car. We could buy food and drinks, but with no communal place to eat, we would have to take them back to our seats. We were assigned two window seats, one behind another.
The portion of the trip north of Boden is on a stretch of track known as the Iron Ore Line, which connects Luleå, Sweden, on the Gulf of Bothnia, with Narvik, Norway, on the North Sea.
The line was completed in 1903 to bring iron ore from Sweden to Narvik. Trains on this line have run on electric power since at least 1923 (while the vast majority of track in the United States remains non-electrified a century later). The line still transports iron ore from Kiruna, Svappavaara and Malmberget, as well as shipments of food, to the north, and fish to the south.
Watching the forests pass us by, I tried to detect changes as we moved north into a different climate. Most of the route seemed to be a dense mix of birches that were losing their leaves — a few weeks ahead of the brilliant yellow trees in Stockholm — and conifers.
As we neared the Arctic Circle, the birches had lost all their leaves, and they seemed to be fewer in number. The conifers, too, were fewer, as the dense forests grew more sparse.
What was also sparse here — noise. I like to chat with other people on trains, but this car was silent. We seemed to be the only Americans on board. Other passengers included a young British couple, a middle aged Scottish couple that we would bump into outside a pub in Narvik later that night, a group of about eight Asian people, and the rest seemed Norwegian, Swedish or German.
A walk to the coach area adjacent to the bistro was a much different story — a group of Italians were talking loudly and fast. I loved to hear it and wished we were seated with them.
Crossing the Arctic Circle was not as eventful as I expected. I had marked the spot on my Google maps a couple weeks prior to the trip so that I would know the exact moment we crossed. We passed a sign marking the spot — Polcirkeln — just before the mark on my phone. In any case, I had never before been above the Arctic Circle, so it was an exciting moment — and we still had miles and miles and miles to go.
Most of my long-distance train travel has been in the United States, where I marvel at the vast expanses of open space. With an average density of 35 people per square kilometer, the United States is half as dense as Europe, which has 73 people per square kilometer. However, for this trip, I was traveling through countries far less dense than even the United States: Sweden has 23 people per square kilometer, and Norway has only 17, about half the density of the United States. The land here was wide open.
As we pressed farther north, the train did not take on many new passengers, meaning the train, too, was not densely populated. We mostly discharged passengers, especially at Kiruna, a mining town in Swedish Lapland with about 23,000 inhabitants.
The landscape continued to change. The forested hills of southern Sweden were replaced by flatter land, shorter trees, and lots of lakes. In the distance, we could begin to see the Scandinavian Mountains, the range that runs the length of the border between Sweden and Norway, which we would soon be crossing.
After Kiruna, we could really spread out, which for me meant that I could move from the left side of the train to the right to take photos and video. It was here that we engaged in conversation with some fellow passengers.
Lars, from Bavaria, was going to Abisko, where he planned to take two 20-km hikes before continuing on to the Lofoten archipelago for a few days, and then down to Bodø by bus, and by train farther the south, to be possibly followed by a ferry to Denmark. He was clearly a fan of traveling by land and sea — and had the time to do so.
Ann, from Aarhus, was now living in Tromsø, traveling back north by land because of the detrimental effects air travel has on the climate. She was frustrated by how long and expensive the ride was, and how governments fell short of making it easier for people to make the right choices. Our delay would make her long trip longer and more costly for her. I shared her frustration, but reminded her that much of Europe is light years ahead of the United States when it comes to climate-friendly travel options.
I can’t say enough about the last few hours of that train ride.
After Abisko, the train began to climb the Scandinavian Mountains, reaching a height of about 1,700 feet above sea level, alongside mountains that towered much higher.
The word tundra always connoted to me some distant exotic landscape, something one finds in a nature book or a textbook. Now, I was riding through it, seeing it with my own eyes.
Mosses, lichens and low shrubs offered some color against the rugged, exposed rock. Birches that had long lost their leaves appeared here and there. If not for the sporadic red and gray cabins, I would have thought that a wildfire had recently wiped out this area.
To be more specific, we were crossing through a biome known as the Scandinavian Montane Birch Forests and Grasslands, a tundra ecoregion that spans much of Norway, as well as parts of northern Sweden and Finland.
Though I couldn’t identify them at the time, I later learned that many of the low shrubs I was seeing was likely a mix of crowberry, reindeer lichen, cloudberry, bilberry and wolf’s bane.
The trees were largely downy birches — I could easily identify birches by their white bark — that would grow no taller than 2 to 3 meters, but also may have included aspen, Scots pine, juniper, grey alder, rowan, goat willow and bird cherry.
We passed many alpine lakes that would soon freeze over under the coming polar night. Under the surface likely swam char, trout, tench and minnow.
In Sweden, the lakes all ended in -jávri (Báktájávri, Loktajávri, Vássejávri) the word for “lake” in the Northern Sami language. Once we crossed to Norway, they ended -vatnet (Brudeslørvatnet, Hansenvatnet, Telegrafvatnet) Norwegian for “the water.”
The sun hung low near the horizon, and I was grateful that despite the delay, we were not passing through this stretch in darkness. As I publish this in mid-November, sunset in Kiruna is 1:57 pm. On December 10, the sun will set at 11:48 am, and not rise again until 11:25 am on January 2.
In our destination of Narvik, the sun remains below the horizon from December 6 to January 7.
As we continued westward toward Norway, we hugged the side of mountains, going through several tunnels and snow sheds. Across the valley, I could see waterfalls, like ribbons spaced out on the side of the mountains. I spent much of the last hour or so in the back of the train, where I had space to myself to open and close windows on either side, and take video out of the left, right and rear of the train.
We made several stops in remote towns I could neither pronounce — Låktatjåkka, Vassijaure, Katterkåkk, Riksgränsen — nor imagine living in.
We crossed the Sweden-Norway border inside a tunnel, with the colors of the Swedish flag painted inside, changing over to the colors of the Norwegian flag.
The rail line from the border to Narvik is known as the Ofoten line, and it brought us from an elevation of 1,700 feet down to sea level over the course of 27 miles, as we made the final stretch to our destination.
Soon, we could see a body of water below, the Rombaken, a 12-mile long fjord that was the site of several naval battles during the 1940 Battle of Narvik. The fjord branches out from Narvik’s Ofotfjorden.
As we passed the massive suspension bridge that connects Narvik to Øyjorda across the fjord, we knew it was time for us to gather our bags, say farewell to Ann — with the chance we might see her on our predawn bus ride 12 hours later — and disembark, 637 miles from Stockholm and 130 miles above the Arctic circle.
At Narvik, we walked a half mile through a cloudy mist to the Scandic hotel. At nearly $200, it was the most expensive place to stay, but it was also closest to the bus station, it had a sky bar, and I was fairly confident it could be reimbursed by either the rail company or my credit card insurance.
It didn’t disappoint. The sky bar was amazing, with a nearly 360-degree view of the city. I can’t imagine being there to see either the Northern Lights or the midnight sun. But in our case, it was a cloudy and drizzly night, without much to see in the sky, but the view of the town was nonetheless fascinating.
After a drink and a massive charcuterie board, we left for Narvikguten pub, making a small loop up a hill to see what we could of the full moon. As we entered the pub, we ran into a Scottish couple from the train. I felt bad that they didn’t stick around, saying the prices were “too dear” for them, and that their pounds were especially weak these days. They were in Narvik just to check out the Arctic, heading back south soon and continuing on to Spain after.
We took seats at the bar, realizing quickly that not food would be served there. Into our second beer, we decided that dinner was not entirely necessary after the charcuterie board. We struck up a conversation with the guy next to me, Gus, originally from Oslo and now living in the north with his fiancé. He was a bartender at the bar, drinking there on his day off, stepping out occasionally for a hand-rolled cigarette.
It was interesting — and refreshing — to hear his impressions of Americans. He saw a disconnect between Americans’ personalities and what he reads in the news. We are a welcoming people, he said, based on the conversations he had with Americans on all sides of the political spectrum. But if you judged us based on what you saw in the news, what would you think, I asked? I’d think you were absolutely out of your minds crazy, he said.
During our conversation, our bartender handed Gus two buttons, meant for Mike and me. They bore the name and logo of the pub. They said it was their stamp of approval on us as visitors, and that they welcomed us back any time.
After three or four or more beers, we called it a night, returned the to sky bar for a nightcap and a bag of chips — and then turned in, alarms set for 4:15 am to make our 5:30 am bus ride, an additional four hours to the North.

Have you ever found yourself sympathizing with a known racist person or group of people? If so, this article will provide you with a lantern to make it out of the mental fog. Racism is a form of abuse. While most people do not develop Stockholm Syndrome during an abusive encounter, some do. They produce a psychological response that causes them to develop positive associations with an abuser.
You’ve probably heard about examples of Stockholm Syndrome in bank robberies, kidnappings, and domestic violence circumstances. However, there is no reason why we shouldn’t analyze how race factors into abusive relationships. I suggest that Black people and people of color who develop positive feelings about racists actually suffer from Racial Stockholm Syndrome.
Consider Uncle Ruckus from The Boondocks animated series. He is a dark-skinned Black man who often denies his Blackness, praises white people while condemning Black people. For example, Uncle Ruckus sang, “Colored folks talkin’ about ‘Save Me!’ / Wasn’t nothin’ wrong with slavery! / At least we got good food back then — uh huh, uh huh! / White man sho could be yo friend.”

In Los Angeles, the suburbs would always grow boring- a boredom similar to the tiring feeling of hearing the same song played over and over. At Princeton, you feel like you’re living in Neverland- nothing seems to change, and you always have this warm sense of quiet comfort. In Beijing, the weekends are occupied with sight seeing and night life, and the weekdays always seem to be moving in some direction.
Stockholm, Sweden is the most stable place I have ever lived. It’s also one of the most beautiful. Here’s a quick peep of the fountain right outside of my apartment:
Whenever I need a break from life, I always take a few minutes to sit by the water. Every few seconds, the wind blows the mist in your direction and you feel a momentary, gentle spray. It feels nice, like a cool, refreshing blanket that wraps around your shoulders. This is especially comforting when I think about home and the happier, safer days at Princeton.
And here’s a little view of the bridge connecting the main island with Gamla stan, the “old town” of Stockholm that’s apparently a tourist trap:
During breaks and weekends, my friends and I would take short strolls around the city, and since the majority of Stockholm is built on water, the beautiful views are never-ending. Occasionally, I would find time to walk around the city on my own. As much as I hate being alone, I could explore this place for hours, aimlessly wandering and appreciating the bits and pieces of Europe.
For those of you who don’t know, I’m here interning for a company called Nova Global, a top-talent network that finds talented people around the world and yada yada yada. Work has been amazing, and I absolutely love my coworkers-they’ve been a family to me.
But oddly enough, the memories that I’ve appreciated the most belong to the little lessons of the day-to-day life. Every single morning, I find time to go to the gym and exercise before work. And every single afternoon when I get back from work, I do the same. I’ve cooked nearly every other meal (Nikita, my friend/roommate, cooks the other half), and when the sink looks a little messy I’ll hop right on the dishes. Thanks to Nikita (he used to be a Latvian pro swimmer), I’ve learned how to prepare huge meals that are so healthy, you’d definitely have plenty left over unless you see the guy next to you scarfing down each last bit. I’m really grateful he’s here- he’s been like an older brother to me.
After reading this over, part of me wants to cringe at how spoiled I probably sound, but I don’t think I’ve been this happy for months. The first week was hard, but I finally feel like the background noise is subsiding and I’m regaining clarity and focus again. I’m finally back in my own skin.
Part of me will always be a little sad that I can’t return to the naive, safe-haven of my Sophomore year at Princeton, but I’m happy, and I’m remembering what it means to take life in strides. Week one has done me well, and I know that I’ll always find some way to appreciate each day.
A few notes about Stockholm:
Yesterday, my friends and I decided to take an impromptu cycling trip through Lidingö, a nature reserve slightly northeast of where we lived. Within half an hour, our surroundings transformed from high-rises and busy city intersections into miles and miles of forest and greenery.
Needless to say, it didn’t take long for a group of foreigners to get unbelievably lost on a never-ending trail of that. And every time I shouted to Nikita and asked if he knew where we were, we just laughed and shrugged. It was pure exploration, with no direction and no destination. It’s really been quite some time since I’ve felt so free.
Saturday afternoon, a day prior to the three hour excursion through “fucking” Lidingö (sorry folks, it’s an inside joke), Lucy and Tara convinced me to explore parts of Söldermalm with them. Similar to my little cycling adventure, most of our trip consisted of aimless wandering, letting our minds digest all the “new” that was around us.
For some reason, the entire time I wouldn’t stop chirping about how I wanted to walk along the water. Söldermalm was beautiful- arguably the most beautiful area of Stockholm I’ve seen yet- but part of me was drawn so strongly toward the water. And somehow, we eventually found ourselves standing near a cliffside that held the most breath-taking view I’ve ever seen. There was something special about the sight that restored that warm, comforting feeling that I’ve felt lacking for a while. It’s probably the happiest moment that I’ve had since I’ve landed in Stockholm.
That was when I decided that I wanted my summer to be characterized by serendipity. Week One was characterized by routine and stability, and it’s done me well. But weeks Two through Ten are going to be filled with aimless exploration and travel. I’m booked to fly off to some new country nearly every weekend, and I’m searching for something “new” everyday. It’s almost like I’ve grown an addiction to novelty.
If there’s anything I’ve learned from “fucking” Lindingö, it’s that it’s OK to get incredibly dehydrated and lost in a forest for three hours. We made more than a few wrong turns, but everyone made it out (more-or-less) alright.
Here’s a list of “new” things I’ve checked off or have yet to check off:
Part of me wishes that my mind read like a book, and that it would scribble down every moment I encountered just as it happened- a Carpe Diem recorder of some sort, I guess. But it doesn’t and it can’t, so I’ll do my best to capture how important this weekend in Amsterdam was to me.
Better yet, let me clarify: I’ll do my best to capture how important this burger-loving fiend is to me (sorry JD, but the picture’s gotta go online):
On July 15, 2015, JD Case touched down in Stockholm, and that’s when the (stupid decisions) adventures of Nathan in Europe really began. Europe, or at least the small portion of it I’ve seen, is great, but there’s always this thin cloak of nostalgia for the lazy, naïve days of year two at Princeton. There’s plenty I miss- the spontaneous trips to Starbucks, the 3 AM League games, the Papa Johns, the 3 AM Papa Johns- and I couldn’t have been more grateful that a part of that was able to visit me halfway around the world.
Last week, I surrendered my summer to serendipity, and the aimless exploration continued when we landed in Amsterdam. We hadn’t booked a place to stay until the day of, but JD was able to nab us a few nice spots for a really good price. Here’s a glimpse of the view outside of the aptly named “RoomMate Hotel”:
If Stockholm’s a stable, structured meeting where everyone in the room is prim, proper, and on time, Amsterdam’s a massive, rambunctious bar where everyone’s intoxicated by early evening. Perhaps it was the company, but the city of bikes and beer is definitely one of my favorite places to be. For those of you who don’t know, JD’s spending this summer traveling the entire world. During our conversations, he mentioned that he never missed home much because with every new place, there was always something new to see and experience. And in Amsterdam, that statement couldn’t be any more true.
Wherever you go, the bright lights that reflect off the canal waters always seem to follow you- it really makes the city feel alive by night. When we weren’t lost or eating massive amounts of food, we were in some interesting bar sipping on beers or fancy cocktails. At Vesper Bar (a place that James Bond would go to for cocktails, and with good reason), I noticed their genius motto written on the blackboard after a few drinks in: “Summer is a time when you drink triple, see double, and act single.” It’s been a few days since I’ve been back, and I think I can speak for both of us when I say that we respected that quote quite well.
Of course, the trip ended exactly as any adventure with JD Case and Nathan Lam would: food poisoning. The burger place we ate at above was great, but for some stupid reason we decided to hike twenty minutes to this other place called “Burgermeester” to grab dinner before I left, and that decision absolutely killed us. After an hour of (puking) lying on our beds in the room, we stumbled outside to enjoy a bit of Amsterdam minutes before I had to leave.
We sat by the water and talked about the “strange corners of life,” tossing little pebbles off the edge to see ripples across the surface. Moments before my Uber arrived to take me to the airport, a little lady bug landed on my hand.
They say that’s supposed to be a sign of good luck, and I sure hope it’s true. I’ve got eight weeks left to do and see everything.
A few things that serendipity brought us:
P.S. Don’t worry Chris and Jerry, there’s no way we forgot about you guys:
Here we have Chris 2Changz, shirtless as ever and with us in spirit and Snapchat. Don’t worry buddy, I’ve collected a few bottle caps, and JD and I have something way better for you when we get back to campus. Jerry, you lucked out. I couldn’t find any embarrassing pictures, but I’ll fix that up soon. I can’t wait to see what happens next year in Brown 423.
As you can see, it’s well into week five, but I’m going to do my best to do last week justice. Life in Europe hasn’t grown any less interesting, but it’s been raining lately, and the days in Stockholm feel as though they’re growing shorter and shorter. It’s not a bad thing — rather, it’s as though time has simply lost the weight that it held weeks prior, and that I’ve stopped counting the days. Novelty is always perfect for tying your mind to the present, and when you travel, you become fixated on exploration. It’s addicting, really.
Copenhagen, unlike Amsterdam, was peaceful, and I often found myself subsumed by random thoughts and musings about all the things that’ve happened the past few weeks. Even though it really hasn’t been long, I think it’s fair to say that I’ve matured a considerable amount. The bulk of the trip was spent with Lucy and Tara, but there were pockets of time where I wandered off, as usual, and stumbled upon those little treasures that make traveling worthwhile.
But I’ll get to that later. First, I want to share all the weird things that happened. I feel like that’s more fun.
“It’s like a theme park, and the theme is weed.” — Tara Ramdonee
Last week, JD and I stumbled into the Red Light District. This week, Tara, Lucy, and I discovered the Green Light District. Taking Nikita’s wonderful advice, we made it an obligation to explore Christiania, the “most ghetto, but safe” place in Copenhagen. Two things ran through my mind when I heard that statement. First, everywhere is probably safe for Nikita (the Latvian White Bear), because nobody in their right mind would threaten him. Second, if it was a ghetto, safe place, I imagined that Nikita probably was talking about some hipster hangout.
What we found was exactly as Tara aptly described above. I would’ve taken a few photos, but there’re signs posted everywhere that have a cancel sign over a camera, indicating that I would probably be badly harmed if I let the camera whore inside of me take over. There was weed. Everywhere. If you bought two burgers, you’d get a joint for free. I could probably count the number of people who weren’t high out of their minds on my hand. Don’t worry mum, we didn’t smoke. We did, however, grab a few beers and have a pretty great conversation. However, the rest of the night wasn’t exactly noteworthy. While looking for some clubs in the area, we somehow stumbled upon some eighteen year old’s Danish birthday party where they played Soulja Boy Tell ‘Em.
On Sunday morning, Lucy recommended that we go to this nice little cafe called Bankeraat for lunch. She kept talking about these “stuffed animals” and how these things were dressed up, and knowing the Hello Kitty die-hard that Lucy is, I expected something similar to Sanrio. What we found was this:
Going to the restroom was an even more interesting experience. First off, the rooms with toilets don’t have lights. Second, they have jump scares like this around the corner when you go down this steep, curled staircase into the secluded basement that houses the restroom that people use on a day to day basis:
But other than the fact that I felt like I’ve just stumbled upon the set of American Horror Story, the food was good.
All of these experiences were humorous and interesting, in a way, simply because they didn’t align with expectations. What I’m learning from all this traveling is that the world becomes unbelievably exciting when you escape expectation and let yourself float off in any direction you feel is right. I’ll talk about one last experience, and it’ll be the more sentimental of the three. Ready yourself for the strange abstractions.
Lucy was convinced- absolutely convinced- that the Little Mermaid Statue would be one of the prime tourist attractions of København. And she was right, but not for the reasons she thought were right. Here’s a picture of the Little Mermaid and all its glory:
That’s it. A dinky boulder with Ariel chilling up top. I think my friend Eric Sohng actually would’ve made a much better mermaid than the statue itself. In fact, I have photographic evidence (Warning: Adult Content). What was amazing about it was that heaps and crowds of tourists huddled around the rock, fighting for a prize spot with the star of Copenhagen.
However, there was value there, and it was in the water. I think I’ve slowly come to realize that if I were to belong to any element in the world, I belonged to the water. Right next to the statue, there was a small, unassuming strip of land where the water met Copenhagen.
For a good while, I sat there alone and retreated far beneath the surface into my thoughts. The water felt so vast and immense, and it kept me entranced during the entirety of Lucy’s photo-op (probably thirty minutes). And somehow, something unexplainable in me clicked, and I felt a pull from the world to explore everything. By that, I mean parts of South America and the rest of Asia sometime next year, etc. You can’t really explain moments like these, but they shape you and change you, and they grant you new freedoms that slowly become part of your basic human needs.
Quote of the trip:
“Shall we summon an Über?”
- Tara Ramdonee, our British friend
Perhaps it’s that I’ve grown too busy with work and travel. Perhaps it’s that I’ve really just stopped counting the weeks as I have the past month and fully adopted that Carpé Diem lifestyle. Perhaps it’s both (it’s probably both), but for some odd reason, I have been finding it so much more difficult to sit myself down to continue documenting my trip here. But I’ve started it, and I wouldn’t be proud of myself if I stopped it mid-way. Old Nathan would be fine with that. New Nathan is too, but for some reason there’s a bit more guilt attached to quitting midway.

Berlin is fucking rebellious, and I love it. In Stockholm, if you act slightly out of place in a public setting, you’ll probably be arrested shortly afterward for disturbing the peace (of course I’m exaggerating, but you get what I’m saying). So being in a city where there’s graffiti on every building, drug dealers at every metro stop, and amazing street performers scattered throughout sidewalks was especially refreshing for me.
Story time: As short-lived as the trip was, it was full of unexpected encounters, and not in the same respect as the other trips have been. Because rather than encountering beautiful vantage points and little local treasures, I shared some odd coincidences with people who I either met or, more or less, shared ‘peculiar’ ties with.
These coincidences happened a few times, but I’m only going to talk about the mind-blowing one because, well, who the hell wants to hear about anything else. On the last night I was staying in Berlin, Ray decided to stay at home. Makes total sense for him, because he doesn’t enjoy going out all that much. But for me, staying in would have been a crime because, well, I was in Berlin. And Berlin’s insane.
So I had a two options. I could try and make friends with strangers at the hostel and venture through the night with them, or I could go solo and pray that I would have fun and not look like that creepy lonely rando that you make a conscious effort to avoid on a night out.
Option One failed miserably, because everyone I spoke with in the hostel was 30+ years old and talking about heroine/death metal. Left with Option Two, I went off in some random direction and, as per the advice of my brilliant friend Stefan, just followed crowds. When I got off the metro, I saw a group of people speaking English with pretty strong American accents (yes, we have accents), and my first reaction was “Those kids are definitely in high school.” My second reaction was “Those kids are definitely from California.” I was completely off with the first guess, but spot on for the second one.
Ironically, when I passed by the group, I overheard one of the girls whisper to her friend that I was definitely from California. I guess cut-off tank tops and joggers throw you right in that bucket. And effectively, me being the desperate, lonely rando looking for friends, I turned around and, well, made friends.
Two of them were from Orange County, and all of them were juniors at Northwestern. And the crazy part is that they’re all relatively good friends with the group of Northwestern students that I met in Beijing last summer. Details aside, we had a pretty fun night, and I’m meeting up with a few of them when I get back to California in September. Despite all the wanderlust I’ve been feeling lately, there was always this anxiety attached to the thought of traveling alone. But that night helped me realize that when you’re more or less screwed with no friends, you’ll find ways to meet people.
—
Other than that, most of the trip consisted of photo-ops and (even more) aimless wandering. You could probably get the gist of the trip by scrolling through my album, since I upload enough photos to irritate the majority of my friends list, but I’ll skim through a few highlights.
Bonanza Cafe. Cool place. It’s where I wrote the Week 4 post, so if I seemed over dramatic/sentimental, it’s because they were playing in Nils Frahm in the background.
I always have these recurring nightmares where I either get hit by a car or drive off a cliff. So, being the grim and morbid child that I am, this photo’s actually pretty important to me.
For some reason, this section of East Side Gallery made me so happy I almost cried. Not entirely sure why, but I guess it was a short reassurance that even if things go to shit, everything will more or less be OK.
Random Notes:
The thing with counting is that people usually count what they’re not all too fond of. We count push ups, the minutes of a long, boring meeting, the number of days before we can see a loved one again- we count because, in those few moments, our mind becomes fixated on the passing of time.
And quite frankly, when I first landed in Stockholm, I started counting. I counted the few hours I slept each night when getting accustomed to the early rise and late shine of Stockholm Sun. I counted the number of weeks until JD arrived, and the number of surface-level trips to various countries that I used as superficial fuel to rejuvenate myself. And, by nature of this blog, I counted the weeks. Each week was tinted with its own ordeal that made me mildly uncomfortable at best, and to compensate for the discomfort, I wrote. Every point in your life- even the dry bits- can seem so much more interesting when you put pen to paper and document it all in story. Unfortunately, when that happens, you run the risk of living for photographs and “serendipity,” while casting everything else off as mundane. Trust me, it’s a pretty miserable perspective to have on life. Happiness becomes short-lived.
Roughly two weeks ago, I had a conversation with Nicole (Andrea’s Girlfriend! Go Andrea :D!) about how we’re both restless souls- the way four walls can transform into prison bars if too much time is spent at home. Eventually, we also spoke about how ridiculously unsustainable that is. And thankfully, when I started complaining about the the ‘vanilla-ness’ of Sweden and ranting about my wonderful wanderlust and need for novelty, she called me out on, well, how ridiculously unsustainable I was. Well Nicole, you got through to me pretty well, and I am infinitely grateful for that.
Recently, I haven’t written much, and I think it’s because I’ve stopped counting. I still love seeing the world and exploring and wandering, but it’s no longer what keeps me afloat. It’s been a process, and I can’t deny that, but I’ve really learned to find joy in the bits and pieces of life that I would have otherwise disregarded as ‘boring.’ Here’s a short list to give you an idea:
Come Friday, and I’ll be in London with my supposed ‘fiancée’, and come September 4th, I’ll be home. I can’t say that I’ve emerged a completely different person, but I can say that right now, I feel happy- sustainably happy- in the way that almost seems infectious enough to drown out the white noise.

“If life were as simple as a day in July, would we honor it so?” — P. J. Gordon
Can we honor the act of doing nothing more often? Would we tire of the nothingness? This reminds me of what some people picture retirement as, and I’ve witnessed many who tire from nothingness; they yearn for regimented days of rules and restrictions. They worked all of their lives to be free, and now that they’re free, they miss their cage. It reminded me of Stockholm Syndrome. When someone has been held captive, they develop a psychological bond of trust and belonging with their captor. In my poem, I put the captor as our life’s occupation.
Stockholm Syndrome is what retirees fear.
We worked all our lives waiting on the year
“What will we do with all the extra hours?”
“Guess we can finally tend the flowers.”
“What will become of the position I held?”
“Will they remember me? All I regaled?”
Years gone, time spent being fully engaged,
Almost free, but it’s hard to leave the cage.
~ P. J. Gordon
Retirement can be likened to graduation from high school. You worked hard for it, you’ve done it, now what?

Most of the human suffering in the modern world boils down to our fear of death. This is not surprising, since modern mythology stipulates that matter is primary and basically all there is.
If nothing exists beyond, above or beneath–whichever spatial metaphor you want to use–the physical universe, every physical and practical expression within its confines appears to be very important, such as gender, age, nationality, organizations, career, money, politics, laws, hospitals, formal education, formal science and titles.
Until it is not, because we all die. How unfair.
The good news is that death is merely a transition from one state to another, just like birth is. Death and birth are exactly the same kind of event, only experienced from opposite angles. We come in and we go out. It is like a long breath.*)
Suffering and the idea of an ultimate death both stem from the illusion of time.
The above means that when we are afraid to die, we are actually afraid to go home. We desperately hold on to this temporary existence, as if a temporary sojourn could ever be a true home. We persuade ourselves that the stage play we are in, this video game, this boot camp, is all we have. We anxiously pay attention to the sergeants of the boot camp who shout out their orders
One might even describe our predicament as a prison we fear leaving. This is actually a pertinent analogy, since this phenomenon is well documented — the psychology of it is well described in the wonderful film The Shawshank Redemption.
We desperately hold on to this temporary existence, as if a temporary sojourn could ever be a true home
When I look at our nonacceptance of death and unconscious rejection of home from a spiritual perspective, I see a collective Stockholm syndrome. A Stockholm syndrome on a species level, basically.
We have developed an understanding, even sympathy, for our prison guards, who constantly lead us to believe that this physical world with its societal structure, is all there is, and if we want to make the most of life, we’d better get out there and seize all the goodies we are able to lay our hands on and reach for as desirable a position in the structure we possibly can.
Of course, we can’t all acquire the same amount of things, and not everybody will be able to gain the most coveted positions. We learn this early on, and with that lesson comes another hard ”truth”: Life is not easy. Who said life should be easy? Some win, some lose, but hey, you just have to learn to bite the bullet and do the best of your situation.
But here is the truth: the essence of life is actually very simple. Life is a continuum.
Deep within, underneath the constant chaos of thoughts and feelings, you can sense that you simply are. You are conscious — you are consciousness itself. You experience — you are experience itself. Hence you exist, and you cannot not exist, because that is not an experience. This is all you can ever really, truly, know for certain is real.
Life unfolds from there, and that is all there is to it. All else are temporary mental or emotional constructs.
This physical experience is no doubt immensely important and in many ways a marvelous adventure. But it is not the whole story. Not even close. The best way to approach earthly life is with equanimous curiosity and joy. Not as if it were dead serious. When we open the door to our infinity, a weight is lifted from our hearts.
When we dismiss this simple and self-evident inner knowing life appears complicated. That is when we get the false idea we lack something, and we feel miserable and anxious. Neuroscientists have tried for decades to locate where in the brain consciousness is produced, to no avail, of course. It is in that futile physical search for meaning we become depressed, whether we try to find it in the brain or by hoarding things.
A basic prerequisite for upholding this elaborate matrix is the idea that humans are at the core selfish
We all come into this strange and wondrous place with the inner truth intact. An inkling remains for a few years, but we gradually forget who we really are. We identify with a name, a skill, a position, a story.
For thousands of years a plethora of societal structures have been imposed on us. The guardians of these structures — teachers, doctors, politicians, civil servants, lawyers, soldiers, journalists, researchers, priests, parents — are themselves involuntary pawns in the game, at least the vast majority of them.
A basic prerequisite for upholding this elaborate matrix is the idea that humans are at the core selfish and unreliable, which is why a structural order is needed. We learn that rules and regulations keep this flawed species in check to the benefit of us all. This is a tragic deception. This is, quite frankly, a big lie.
This big lie operates side by side with — and is fueled by — the widespread fear of death.
Someone might object that people were even more scared of death a few hundred years ago, before the introduction of a physicalist worldview, when almost everybody was religious, at least formally.
This might be true, but the difference would be in degree, not in kind, because that ”religiosity” was a very integral part of the matrix. In some ways the Church, for instance, was more materialistic than modern day atheism, whose proponents emphasize humanism. The Church was deeply in cahoots with the secular powers. Priests told people that God needed them to obey the lords of the world as well.
Adhering to a dogmatic, old-school religion is all about pleasing an external God and acquiescing to the hierarchy of His representatives on Earth. And if you don’t, you know which place you will be sent to.
The realization that we are all eternal sparks of God/Source/The One Consciousness is the most forbidden knowledge of all in the traditional Abrahamic religions.
We used science to drag us away from a system of outer oppression to a system of inner oppression
Wait, didn’t we liberate ourselves from all that when science broke with religion? It certainly looked like an attempt. But did we use our new scientific approach to find our way back to our true essence, our core of natural happiness? We did not. We used science to drag us in the opposite direction, away from a system of outer oppression to a system of inner oppression, called materialism.
Either your life is miserable because you are tormented by the constant condemnations of God and the Church, or your life is miserable because you feel the meaninglessness of being a randomly assembled flesh robot. In both cases you feel unfree. Imprisoned.
In the latter case, you may find temporary relief in embracing the system and its rulers, who tell you that all will be well if you just adjust a little bit more to fit into the intricate societal structures. So you try, once more, to do that. And to make the process smoother and less painful, you choose to sympathize with your prison guards.
This is psychologically very understandable as long as you don’t know that there is an alternative. But imagine the sea change in your perspective on life when you realize you can break out of it whenever you want. That all you have been told, and told yourself, about your identity is a chimera. That the essence of you is completely free.
If we all went there, no one would be afraid of death, and no one would want to control anyone or be controlled. The matrix would dissolve itself. It would be obvious there is no need for it.
*) I assume most readers of this essay are with me on what I state about a non-physical reality. However, if any readers are skeptical, simply imagine for a moment that there is a realm we temporarily leave when we are born into physical bodies and go back to when we leave those bodies, i.e. die. It may help to look into the well-documented accounts by people who have had near-death experiences, which by now count in the thousands; practically all of them say that the realm they have visited during those experiences feels very much like their real home and appears far more real than this physical one. New cases are being documented all the time. And then there is the research at the University of Virginia which, believe it or not, seems to confirm young children’s memories of previous lives. There is also other research pointing to a verifiable non-physical reality.

I wasn’t going to write about the election since it gets exhausting. But if you’re like me, you find it increasingly difficult to understand how some of your friends, co-workers, and family members continue to support President Trump. Not because of policy disagreements over everything, although there’s plenty to go around, but because of who Trump is.
Stockholm, Wisconsin is a town of 88 people last time I checked. Almost 70% of them voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012. But most voted for Trump in 2016.
Four years later, it’s time to take an audit of this president before you vote again.
It’s not that everything Trump’s ever done is horrific, although there’s plenty of that to go around, too.
I’m not oblivious to the fact that he got NATO to pay their fair share of expenses defending Europe, despite decades of American presidents asking deaf European nations to pay more. Trump defeated ISIS in Syria. I mean, when’s the last time you even heard of that group since Trump. He brought Israel and numerous Arab countries together. UAE and Bahrain to start, but I have no doubt that we’ll see another four or five peace agreements follow soon. Maybe more.

Many years ago, I used to belong to an online community which is mostly made up of young women in their early twenties. A lot of folks usually send in their questions, queries and stories seeking clarifications and often times, advice.
On a particular day, a lady sent in a long message which signaled that she was pathetic to her abuser and was also very mindful of hurting him.
There were several comments but there was a particular comment which got my attention, the commenter said’ She is suffering from Stockholm’s syndrome.
I was taken aback because the only Stockholm I knew at the time was a city in Sweden and my curiosity got the best of me. I really wanted to know what Stockholm's syndrome meant.
I decided to dig in and do a thorough research and discovered the following;
Stockholm syndrome explained
Stockholm syndrome is an emotional response which happens when an abuser develops positive feelings towards their abusers or captors.
The name came about by a man due to an incident which happened in Stockholm in the year 1973 It’s a story which depicts the loyalty of hostages to their captors.
This illness was named after a bank robbery that occurred in Stockholm, Sweden in 1973.Many of the imprisoned bank employees got sympathetic to the bank robbers during the six-day standoff with authorities.Following their release, some of the bank employees went as far as refusing to testify against the bank robbers in court, and even raised funds to defend them.The term “Stockholm syndrome” was coined by a criminologist and psychiatrist(Nils Bejerot) examining the incident to characterize the affinity some bank staff had for the bank thieves.
What causes Stockholm’s syndrome
1. Overdependent
When you’ve been dependent on your captor/abuser for basic needs, there’s a high tendency of emotional reliance on them.
2. Fair treatment
When hostages have not been threatened or when they’re being treated nicely. It becomes a dent of STOP IT, I LIKE IT
3. When hostages haven’t been dehumanized in any form.
Stockholm Syndrome and children
For situations involving children such as child abuse, there could be an emotional imbalance where the child sees the abuser as a protector especially if the abuser is a close ally or a family. Abuse in this form can be confusing for children because most times, abusers tend to intimidate and threaten their victims from speaking out. At the same time, the abuser also shows love and care to the child. This creates a confusing scenario and can also breed Stockholm syndrome where the child grows up believing the abuser to be a protector rather than a molester.
Stockholm Syndrome and tutors
In the same vein, people who have abusive coaches, tutors and teachers might develop a deep emotional connection with them and rather than see them in the light of the abuse, they create and give excuses for them thereby defending and sympathizing with them.
For Emotional, physical and mental abuse, The victims tend to develop an emotional connection with the abusers because emotional abuse on its own can make a victim develop a trauma bond with the abuser.
A trauma bond is a deep seated bond between an abuser and the person they abuse.
Stockholm Syndrome and sex trafficking
In the movie Gangubai Kathiawadi, which told the story of a young woman who was lured into prostitution and sold off to a sex trafficker, the lady refused to join in the venture because she considered it to be immoral and dishonorable. Day after day, she was subjected to series of inhumane treatment and she knew that in other to survive, she had to join them.
This goes to show that people who are captured and sold off into sex trafficking tend to rely on their dependents for survival. This can create a form of dependence on their abusers.
Is Stockholm Syndrome a mental health disorder?
Even though Stockholm’s syndrome isn’t listed as a formal mental health disorder but rather an emotional response to abuse.
However, there are common symptoms for people who have been victims of abuse such as;
1. Withdrawal
They tend to withdraw from people because most of the time, they find it hard to trust others and tend to believe that every other person is out there to hurt them.
2. Post traumatic stress disorder
PTSD is characterized by failure to recover after a traumatic event or in this case, abuse
3. Sleeplessness
4. Denial
5. feeling of hopelessness, failure, helplessness and often times
6. Depression.
If you or anyone you know is suffering from the Stockholm syndrome, please see a therapist as soon as possible so as to curtail any further imminent serious mental disorder.

25–27 Sep remembered on 8 Oct
After another 12-minute walk from the US embassy, I arrived at Etnografiska Museet, where everything converged.
This was where Peng worked during his time in Sweden, also the home of most of Sven Hedin’s collection. I spent 150 SEK for the ticket. The size of the museum is slightly smaller than I expected, but of course, it wouldn’t be fair to compare it with the British Museum or Musée du quai Branly. The first exhibition I encountered on the ground floor was Yokai, an exhibition about the Japanese Yokai culture (something ghostly or monstrous, but not exactly ghosts or monsters). It was well-curated, informational while entertaining. I was not sure if the credit should go to the Etnografiska Museet or other institutions who co-curated it. However, it was recommendable.
Despite its good quality, for a Taiwanese, Yokai culture is not something unfamiliar, and it also wasn’t the reason of my visit. So I quickly browsed through, and moved upstairs to continue my search.
When I was at the entrance, I saw one of the current exhibitions called “We are Seediq”. I thought to myself that “Oh, there is an indigenous group in Taiwan also called Seediq. What a coincidence.” Turned out that the exhibition was about the indigenous group in Taiwan. The exhibition was small, but again, well-curated and informational.
It is hard to describe how moved I was. I believe that it was the first exhibition that I’ve ever liked in any ethnographic museum. I am sure by now you can imagine, as someone like me, it’s impossible to be completely comfortable, seeing how these items were raided by Eurocentric collectors, explorers, or let’s be honest, colonisers, in the past, and seeing how the cultures were interpreted, as if there weren’t, or aren’t, any actual human beings attached to the said culture. It has always been something fascinating while irritating for me to visit ethnographic museums.
The curatorial concept of this exhibition started with a number of mysterious items as part of the museum collection, from an unsurprisingly problematic source. (What I love about it was also that the “problematic source” was clearly stated in the exhibition.) The reason I said “mysterious”, was because it was actually wrongly labelled as items from Atayal originally, instead of Seediq, due to the mis-categorization from the Japanese colonisation.
“We are Seediq” was co-curated among a number of institutions, including the Seediq National Assembly, and the Indigenous Cultural Heritage Master’s Program of Providence University in Taiwan. The involvement of the “subject’ themselves could be seen everywhere.
First, the title, the “we” implies the existence of human subjects, instead of merely culture or items. It was coming from the mouth of the subjects, not observers. And all the texts written were in three languages — Swedish, English and Chinese. (I know it’s not Seediq, but at least it’s a language that most of the Seediq nowadays can understand.) The interviews of Seediq people were presented as one of the major elements in the centre of the room. The faces and voices were unavoidably seen and heard. What moved me the most was that one of the weaved fabrics in the collection was considered the oldest, documented Seediq weaving pattern preserved in the world. And the museum is working with the organisations in Taiwan to study the pattern in order to recreate them. Even writing about these is making me emotional.
The “collection” here is no longer some “dead” items lying inside a glass vitrine. The “culture” has become alive, moving, working, involving. Then there is a meaning. There is a reason for all of these to happen. I know one might say that the museum should return the stolen items to Taiwan for good. (The texts mentioned that the items were in Taiwan for a time being before being returned to the museum.) I understand it’s not perfect. But honestly, despite the problematic, upsetting source, can we, as Taiwanese, be confident that the items would be well-stored forever, in a professional context on the island? And just reading the texts in the exhibition of a culture that somehow I found adjacent to (I wouldn’t dare to say that it’s mine) in my native language, already gave me goosebumps, which is something I can never dream of seeing in places like the British Museum. I haven’t even started to mention how Taiwan, as a country, as an island with adjacent islands, was being presented correctly in the exhibition, which is again, something I can not dream of in a European context.
After seeing the exhibition, I couldn’t help but make an Instagram story, recommending it, tagging the museum. I received a kind message from someone who runs the account. I genuinely hope that all the exhibitions in ethnographic museums could make me feel this way. I also heard that there is someone from Taiwan working at Etnografiska Museet at the moment. I am sure that helped with what I saw.
Finally, at a corner on the 2nd floor, I found something from Sven Hedin, titled Golden Temple. It’s a model temple he commissioned to make, identical to a temple he encountered in Chengde, China.
I was surprised about how little collections from him were on display, so I asked the friendly staff at the information desk in case I missed anything. She explained that on the ground floor, where the Yokai exhibition is, was Hedin’s collection. but it was removed for the Yokai exhibition. I asked if the collection will come back after Yokai ends. She replied, slightly awkwardly, with a no. I was curious about her reaction, so I googled afterwards. Turned out that the Swedish historian Tommy Lundmark published a book recently, criticising the display of Hedin’s collection in the museum. He believed that the way the collection was displayed touched only lightly, perhaps too lightly, on Hedin’s support of Nazism. Despite that Hedin being a Nazi supporter was not a news anymore, the book seemed to stir more controversies than there was. And the museum, using the coming exhibitions as a cover, removed all the Hedin’s collection, with only the temple left.
It’s a complicated issue. I don’t feel like I have any position to judge. As a researcher, of course I would like to see his collection. However, I also believe that before figuring out a proper way to deal with the problematic history, removing the collection for the time being, was more than understandable.
After the conversation with the helpful staff, I moved on with my day.
The next stop was Hedinsgatan. After I arrived, I found out that “gatan” means “street” in Swedish, instead of “garden”, as I originally thought due to its pronunciation. So, Hedinsgatan, is a street named after Sven Hedin in Stockholm. It was just an ordinary street. I couldn’t find anything special. I also couldn’t figure out the reason why this street in particular was chosen to be given the name. It was not specially close to where he used to live, or the cemetery, or the museum. It remained a mystery to me till this day.
Finally, it was five. We were back to Historiska Museet. I couldn’t find anything from Sven Hedin here, however, after knowing what happened to Etnografiska Museet, I doubt if the museum would want to point out which items were actually from Hedin anyway.
A cute anecdote happened was that, when I arrived, there was a celebratory event of the independence day of Armenia. A lady downstairs asked me to sign on the RSVP list, and I was confused, saying that I was only here to see the exhibition, so she let me pass. After going upstairs, witnessing the champaign and catering of the party, I wished I had signed so I could join. I thought about blending in, however, with my cheap, slightly torn out jeans, and the oversized jacket as a charity from my friend in Berlin last year after losing all my clothes in a luggage, I had a feeling that the plan of blending in naturally would fail. So, I tearfully walked away from the champaign and the finger food.
After the museum, I stopped by a supermarket to grab some bread, cold cuts, spreads and a light beer (which had a significant meaning that I only understood in a few days). I sat down by a beautiful harbour, and started my dinner. I was surprised that I couldn’t see anyone else doing what I was doing. The view was stunning. I remembered sitting by the Seine everyday with friends, enjoying wines and picnic-made sandwich in Paris. After a while, the wind started to blow into my bones, and despite the sunny weather during the day, my fingers started to freeze, and suddenly I realised why I was the only person sitting on the floor at this harbour, picnicking.
The next day, I visited the Konstmuseet in Skövde by train, to drop my large suitcase, so I wouldn’t have to travel in Europe inconveniently while paying for the overpriced luggage fee charged by the budget airlines (and not to mention the fear of losing it again). The trip took me almost the whole day. The 10:30am train was delayed for half an hour, so I arrived at Skövde at around 1pm. After a pleasant chat with David, the technician of the museum, who is also someone from Goldsmiths Fine Art, I went back to the station for my 14:28 train, which was again delayed for 45 minutes, and I ended up arriving at Stockholm Central after 5pm.
With some not-so-worth-mentioning anecdotes happening on the train, I arrived back at the hotel with a sense of relief, since everything I needed to do for work in Stockholm these days was done. To celebrate, I decided to take advantage of the gym downstairs. After spending 30 minutes on treadmills and other machines that I can not name, I felt like a human again. I know the ecstasy was all psychological, as a relief from the anxiety of aging and weight-gaining. Gym is a middle-class fantasy of a healthy life. When I was running on the treadmill, I believed that I was no longer the girl wearing the torn-out jeans, having cheap sandwiches and light beer sitting by the harbour, freezing, fantasising about the free champagne at other people’s parties. Whatever that was, it helped. I loved going to gyms, delusional or not.
I decided to spend my last day in Stockholm (this time) with art. After my last luxurious breakfast at Hotel Expo, I sadly said goodbye to it, and took a train and a bus to Karolinska Institute. It was where Carl Gustaf Bernhard, the host of Peng during his stay in Sweden, worked. I took some photos, and moved on to the Moderna Museet. Moderna Museet is a modern and contemporary art museum in Stockholm, connected to Arkdes, a design and architecture museum. Luckily, Arkdes offers free admission throughout the year of 2024, so I visited both museums in the afternoon, before heading to the airport, taking my 19:45, SAS flight to Heathrow, London.
I guess it’s about time to face this.

We begin with Aftab (Persian for ‘sun’s beautiful rays). Let’s send Aftab to a school friend you’ve lost touch with and would like to reconnect to.
How do you send Aftab — close your eyes for 10 secs and send the suns rays to those you have in your heart. And add to this “<name> may you be at peace, may you be happy” and turn that to yourself “may I be happy, may I be at peace”
For the past 2–3 years, I’ve had the privilege of coaching a tremendously talented former colleague on and off. Our most recent engagement concluded last Friday, and I’ve come to realize that one of the most valuable words she needs in her life right now is “No.”….and that too for turning clients away who are no longer a match for her. This message is for her and for any of you as it may offer guidance to some of you in similar situations.
No, Nada, Nee, Nej, Non
“Really successful people say no to almost everything.” — Warren Buffett
What perhaps got you to the level of success you’re at today is saying YES to almost every opportunity. What will get you to your next level of success is saying NO to almost every opportunity.
Which is why I’m going to share with you the single most powerful tool to take your life, career and…

During my recent trip to Stockholm, I was working remotely on New York hours. I ended up loving this weird working schedule. I would explore the city from 9am-3pm, work 3pm-12:30am, and then sleep 1am-9am. Since I working during dinner hours, I decided to orient my trip around a daytime delicacy — pastries. Each day, I explored a new part of the city in search of the best cardamom bun.
I’ve always been a huge fan of cardamom, so I was excited to learn how ubiquitous cardamom buns (aka kardemummabulle) are in this city. They were all delicious, so it’s really about finding the one that meets your taste — they ranged from bready to buttery and from sugary to spicy. Many bakeries were closed for summer break, but these were the favorites I tried:

Ever had the sneaking suspicion that the corporations you hate have trapped you in an endless buying cycle?
You’re confronted with sobering stats about the effects of smartphone addiction on mental health, but your phone’s the first thing you reach for in the morning. You’ve watched that documentary about the true cost of fast fashion to the environment, but you can’t resist those $10 yoga pants. You’re appalled by the piles of waste generated by single-use plastic, but you still get your coffee to-go in disposable cups and your food delivered every day. You fully understand how algorithms are designed to harvest your attention online for profit, but you feverishly refresh your Instagram feed.
Why does the captive start falling in love with the captor, who suddenly seems so indispensable and necessary for survival? Why do we hate how brands use and treat us, but keep going back for more? Consider this: your brand loyalty and relationship with monolithic corporations might actually be a version of Stockholm Syndrome.
First, big brands lure you in with the product and create the illusion of scarcity, making you feel like doing without it isn’t an option. And then, when you’re finally held hostage, even the slightest act of generosity will get the company in your good graces (see: corporate social responsibility and activist ad campaigns). In time there’s some scandal or controversy with clear evidence that the brand is causing unnecessary harm to reap immense profits — but you remain loyal through it all, even feeling friendliness where there should be fear, admiration where there should be contempt.
This is one of the most despair-inducing aspects of Stockholm Syndrome: in the end, even after being released, the captive defends the captor.
Various scholars and experts have tried to put a finger on why. A book on surveillance capitalism by Shoshana Zuboff here, an explosive Medium article on Capitalist Stockholm Syndrome by Umair Haque there. Trouble is, we often don’t even realize we’re being held hostage. The recently viral, user-generated “10 Year Challenge,” where people post then-and-now photos of themselves on social media, is actually an astroturfed meme to train Facebook’s facial recognition capabilities, speculates Kate O’Neill from Wired. In 2009, you logged into Facebook. In 2019, Facebook logs into you.
Worse yet, brands themselves admit they aren’t good for us — it’s one of the ways they keep us in line, so to speak. Apple wants to help curb your iPhone addiction with Screen Time, a new feature that breaks your smartphone usage down to the specific apps in the hopes of motivating you to spend your time differently. Cigarette conglomerate Philip Morris International just embarked on an anti-smoking campaign as part of their vision of a smoke-free future. And in what sounds like a headline from The Onion, Coca-Cola and other junk food giants in China have successfully been funding the narrative that exercise — not cutting down on sugar — can fight obesity. They use their role in creating “solutions” to problems in which they, themselves, are complicit to generate positive PR, reeling us right back in.
Why, despite all this, do we remain brand-loyal? In the 2018 dark comedy Sorry To Bother You, union organizer Squeeze explains, “If you get shown a problem but have no idea how to control it, then you just decide to get used to the problem.”
There’s also nobody else for us to go to. A protest sign spotted at the 2019 Women’s March highlighted the fact that that there’s more public trust in gas station sushi than in President Trump, which isn’t a total exaggeration. Amazon and Google beat political parties and the state government as some of the most trusted entities in an American Institutional Confidence Poll conducted online by YouGov in 2018.
In recent years, capitalism’s sheen has (finally) started fading. Today only 19% of Americans ages 18 to 29 identify themselves as “capitalists”, and the trend goes hand-in-hand with the rising popularity of the Democratic Socialist values espoused by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.
This week marks the start of the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting, attended by hundreds of the world’s most powerful leaders. The United States’ Trump, France’s Macron and Britain’s May could not make it because they are busy tending to crises at home with big economic implications — the partial government shutdown, Yellow Vest protests and Brexit. It behooves the meeting’s attendees to acknowledge that our economic systems are in serious disrepair, and that rapidly rising income inequality is a feature, not a bug, of late stage capitalism.
So how do we ensure that we don’t fall prey to Stockholm Syndrome yet again, making new excuses and justifications for the next generation of brands as we wrestle free from the mega-corporations that control so much of our lives today?
As we enter the fourth industrial revolution, we need to reconsider the role and purpose of the corporation on our planet, and weed out the put-up-or-shut-up variety of consumerism. In his new book Prosperity, Colin Mayer of Oxford’s Saïd Business School offers a new definition for private companies: “Producing profitable solutions to problems of people and planet.” Will we keep condoning the harm that some corporations inflict on society and the environment, or will we demand that they do more, do better? It’s time for the captive to thwart the captor.

Long time no see, or at least on English. I have started to write a bit more on Swedish and more company and It-security focused articles. The reasons behind it is somewhat because of i have started a company! Finally i have teased about it for some time now, am i right?!
So https://lysellssecurityandtech.com aka Lysells Security And Tech AB is live and up and running as a fully working company with stocks and CEO and management and so on, “only” me and my wife still but it is a real company :D
Therefore i will move and probably write a bit more on my new website, with a bit more focus on Security parts and what is happening within security, more focus on companies and Enterprises. But fear not i will write more here on Medium but probably a bit more like write-ups, personal thoughts and stuff that maybe not is compliant with company blogs and stuff.
So as of 12th of august i am traveling to Stockholm, Solna to be precise, every Sunday i take the train up and Thursday i travel home again, it is a lot of time being spent in Stockholm where i am work as an It-security Architect for a financial company and during the nights i try to be busy writing articles, Talks and trying to get a bit more customers where i can help out with Security work. Just to keep busy and i love to work with Security so it is a win-win situation, and if i can work as much as i want to on the evenings when i am in Stockholm that means i can focus fully on Wife, Dogs and Family when i am home, i may even not need to work on Fridays either, so that means i will have 2.5 days home with family and wifey.
But the thing is because i am working and travelling that much i have setup some timeplanning as well, so Sunday and Saturday is full family time the phone is “off” and i focus on private time, Fridays will be a mix, i will often sleep in a bit because i often get home at midnight or even later but then on Friday i will be available for calls and some work-meetings, i do have planned some talks and lunch meetings often on Fridays so often half days.
That is one thing i recommend, plan your time so you get recovery and quality time with the loved ones, for me as a workoholic i work best to do some work on Fridays just for my own sanity and that is the time i have NOT being on other assignments so it is the right thing for me do some work and often many clients wind down on the afternoon of a Friday so friday until lunch is a way to get some stuff done.
But then be able to have the Friday evening, Saturday and Sunday off and get that quality time is golden. I will probably do some every other week in the future not doing it every week as i am doing now, because it costs a lot of money living at hotels and being away from family is tough. But for now it is a fun adventure and the travel home 5–6 hours is often a good way to wind down even if the way home is the worst one, you just want to get home and you cannot get there fast enough!
This was just a word blob, basically a brain dump of my thoughts and some tips and tricks.
But until next time! Be safe on the internet and be safe!

Disclaimer: My story tackles racial prejudice, not to downplay the seriousness of the issue but to highlight its absurdity. So grab your fika or popcorn, and let’s discover the absurdity of racism.
This is my story of how an unpleasant incident had an influencing impact on my life forever.
In 1980, in Stockholm, Sweden, two Swedish colleagues and I decided to walk to the harbour for coffee. We chatted about work, Swedish girls, and beer, matching our quick steps down the lane.
Suddenly, out of nowhere, a white stranger started shouting, “Du, svarta hund, försvinn från min stad.” We froze!
My two colleagues realised that the racial slur was directed at me since I was darker than them. The stranger noticed I didn’t speak Swedish and shouted, “You, black dog, get out of my town!” Those words were sharp and hurtful. It was the first time anyone had called me a black dog.
I felt angry and sad about what had happened.
I was enraged at the ignorance behind the words and sorry for the man who said them. It made me realise that some people will…

The only thing worse than being taken captive is sympathizing and bonding with your captor. But what if our captors are our own beliefs and aspirations?
A friend sent me a blog post that stopped me in my tracks. After reading Chip’s Wounded Entrepreneur post, I immediately went to LinkedIn to reach out to him.
His lived experience and deeply personal message resembled the lives of so many of the founders and entrepreneurs I work with. Touching upon the topic of suicide, that post was a wake-up call.
That’s the driving energy behind Founders Thriving. I wanted to create a space for entrepreneurs and founders to begin developing a healthier relationship between themselves and their companies. A place to build and grow your company but be happy doing it.
The Cult of Ourselves
We all need to begin addressing the cultish beliefs that make up the abusive relationships we so willingly endure with the companies we run. What these stories represent is how easy it is to be held captive by the companies we run; physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.
Most entrepreneurs launch their endeavor with dreams F-R-E-E-D-O-M. Financial freedom, schedule freedom, and the freedom not to report to a boss.
At least those were their original north-star goals.
But ever-so-slowly we silently mortgage away that freedom until we’re caged in by the one thing we thought would free us from the trappings of a normal 9 to 5.
Then like many long-term hostage situations, we begin to bond and sympathize with our captor. Gradually abandoning the people who love and support us in our greatest times of need.
Vicious Cycle
Unfortunately, after launching startups for freedom, what usually happens is entrepreneurs slowly trade in these opportunities to assert our freedom for personal ultimatums: “I’ve gotta do this to [insert infinite to-do-list here]” scenarios. Before they know it they’re reporting to employees and investors, working more hours, and making less money than many of their own staff. #founderseatlast
Version 1.0 of our early programming usually has two hard-coded beliefs. First, putting ourselves first is selfish. Second, our self-worth is largely dependent on our net worth.
If we get good grades we’ll go to a good school. If we go to a good school, we’ll get a high-paying job. If we get a high-paying job, we’ll simply acquire everything we need to be happy.
Now layer on the toxic startup tropes of kill it, crush it, hustle, and struggle and you have a perfect recipe for an emotional or mental meltdown.
I can’t count the number of founders I work with whose goal is to “make their first million.” I call this the “Miserable Millionaire Fallacy.”
Rarely do these founders know where this thought comes from. It’s simply always been there. It’s like a hidden feature that was included in Version 1.0 and bug fixed and patched to fix our current life circumstances.
It’s not until they’ve gotten everything they dreamed of, and are still unhappy, that they begin exploring other means of happiness, purpose, and fulfillment.
Exorcise Exercise
One good way to assess this in yourself or an entrepreneur you’re working with is to have them visualize their company as a real person. Then imagine having an intimate and honest conversation with that person.
Are they kind, encouraging, and supportive? Or are they negative and condescending; taking every opportunity to remind you you’re an imposter?
When you use this personified entity approach and add a dollop of psychology you’ll find that many entrepreneurs begin to sympathize with their captor and have begun to develop deep feelings of codependency with their personified company.
When the company is successful, they are well. When the company is suffering, so do they.
The beauty of this simple exercise is that once an entrepreneur recognizes the pattern, the turn-around can be incredibly fast. The first step is acknowledging your company is not human; therefore it is not capable of taking actions for or against you or making you think or feel anything.
The second requires an acknowledgment that you are wholly responsible for your thoughts and the resulting emotions that come from those thoughts. Based on those two steps, it is 100% within your control to change the relationship you have with your company.
To unwind the default programming of our formative years we need to encourage founders to normalize new behavior and make it ok to prioritize their needs first; essentially, an upgrade to Founder Version 2.0. By prioritizing their needs above the needs of the business, their co-founders, and their investors, business owners regain the agency needed to heal the relationship with their business.
The mission of the MEA is to reframe midlife — from a crisis to a calling. And if that calling is to share your wisdom with up-and-coming entrepreneurs then let’s create a safe space to meet in the middle.
My dream is for Founders Thriving to help prepare those entrepreneurs to work with all of you. I believe that if we take care of ourselves first we can show up more fully resourced for our teams, our families, and our community. Then together, we can all Build Something Better!
If you know a business owner stuck in their own Startup Stockholm Syndrome or someone ready and willing to prioritize their needs first, please send them over to Founders Thriving and join the movement.

Ahh Disney.. The corporate machine that’s been printing money by selling your dreams back to you is a .. tale as old as time.. you could say.
But while I’m always ready to engage in good faith and justified criticism of this behemoth marketing machine, I’m not in love with criticism that points the finger at problems that don’t exist.
Today, I had a conversation with a dear friend who brought up one of the original criticisms of Beauty and the Beast that I haven’t heard mentioned in years. This friend brought up the belief that some people have alleging Belle was suffering from Stockholm syndrome, that she didn’t have enough agency in the film, and that the story is problematic in the world that exists in 2021.
Since this friend of mine is in the process of producing a live theatrical production of Beauty and the Beast, it immediately became my highest priority to disabuse her of this belief.
I, of course, sent her some rambling messages to get my point across, but after making my point, I still wasn’t satisfied. So here I am.

I love Chigozie Obi’s artistry and I love her personality even more, so it made so much sense that I desired to have a conversation with her.
Two failed attempts at meeting and a birthday pool party after, Chigozie and I finally linked, and we had a conversation about everything — from love to relationship dynamics, fitness, friendships, work and her love for Lagos that may suggest she has Stockholm syndrome. The conversation was so good that we planned a second date.
I walked into Basilico — where Chigozie had been working all afternoon — some minutes before 4pm. I scanned through the floor but couldn’t find her until she popped up from the lounge in a corner, wearing a smile so wide and looking so good, as ever, in a lovely dress. She was excitingly taller than I pictured or, if I’m being honest, I was probably shorter than I thought.“Oh my God, you look so beautiful in person,” I said. Chigozie is more beautiful in person.“You too!” She exclaimed in a smile. “I love your top,” she said.“Thank you!”“I’m so sorry I dressed down. Had a crazy gym session,” she said, walking in a limp. Chigozie has been in the gym for a year now and is notorious for tweeting about the woes of exercising, whilst showing up everyday.“That’s so true! I should have worn slippers,” I said, looking at my flat heels and then back at her pair of white slippers. “Sorry about your pain. You’re really trying o. I’ve attempted the gym twice and I’ve quit twice,” I said, chuckling.She laughed. “How?”“I didn’t have a trainer and thought I could wing it like people say. Although the first time, a friend was my gym partner until she moved. The second time, I was checking out YouTube and stuff for routines. So both were sort of epic fails. I think I lasted two weeks for both,” I said, chuckling.Chigozie laughed. “I have a trainer though.”“Yea, I saw. How has that been for you?”“I really like it. I like that I can just go in there without having to think of what I want to do, and just let someone else think for me and instruct me. My only job is to just show up.”I giggled. “I like that.”“Yeah,” she said. “I see you have a new hair done,” I said, looking at her black braids.Chigozie’s eyes beamed. “Yea, I did it yesterday,” she said, excitedly. Her excitement was so real, it was contagious.“It’s really pretty,” I continued in admiration.“Thank you. I like your beads too. You look like an African Queen.”I chuckled in excitement. “Thank you!”Compliments are ten times better when they come from women.
“How are you? How has Lagos been for you?” Chigozie asked, looking at me.“It’s been okay, it’s been chill. I miss my family sometimes though,” I replied.“Where’s family?”“My family home’s at Ekiti.”“Oh okay.”“What?” I asked chuckling.“No, Ekiti is very chill.”“Yeah, it’s very slow too, and then Lagos is pretty fast. Too fast.”“Yeah, I really love the mountains as well. It’s very serene.”“Have you been?”“Yeah. I went in secondary school to…”“Ikogosi,” I finished her statement and we burst out laughing.“Exactly, exactly,” she said in a smile. “Then I went again for an Art Bootcamp. I think that was when I really explored. I went to Ikogosi again, but I also went around town and stuff, and I was a bit older. It wasn’t like a school thing, so we had more freedom. It’s a really beautiful place.”“Lots of mountains everywhere.”“Yeah. When I travel outside of Lagos I discover we’re not chilling here at all. It’s so fast-paced and so chaotic.” Chigozie laughed.“Very chaotic.”“But the thing is that I feel like I have stockholm syndrome. Anytime I leave Lagos, I get homesick and want to come back almost immediately.”“Really?”“Yeah. For example, when I went to Abuja, I was homesick in the first couple of days. It was pretty slow and I was shocked because I thought Abuja was like the ‘next Lagos’ or something, but nah.”“Abuja is actually so dead, not gonna lie,” I said, chuckling.“For real, but apparently, the people who live there like it so much.”“And when they come here also, they want to go back. They basically can’t stand Lagos either,” I said.“Exactly. When we tweet about Abuja, they’re usually like, “No, don’t come o. We don’t want you here.”I laughed. “For real.”“I want to go back again though; just to chill or relax.”“How many times have you been?” I asked.“Once.”“Me too.”“It’s crazy how I got really home sick when I traveled to London last year for a residency, too. I think the best time to travel to London is summer, maybe June or July, when everywhere is bright. It’s very beautiful then.”“When did you go?”“I went in April. There was a lot of rain and the weather was so gloomy,” Chigozie said, irritated at the thought of it. “I get. I hate gloomy weather so much. It’s such a mood dampener.”“Exacly! I made a lot of friends though, but depression was really… was really hitting. I was like ‘Ahahn.’” It felt like she was recounting a traumatic experience.I laughed. “I was so happy on the night I got back to Lagos,” Chigozie said, shaking her head.“You were like ‘freedom at last!’” I exclaimed in a chuckle.“Yes o. Lagos is very chaotic, but it’s still home.”“If you could live in anywhere else asides Lagos, where would you live?”“I think Ghana.”“Yeah? You traveled there earlier this year right?”“Yeah, I did,” Chigozie said. “Ghana is kind of like Nigeria in some sense. Asides the borders being close, there’s a lot of similarities between us in some ways, with the people and culture.”“Yeah. That makes sense.”
We continued our talk about how chaotic Lagos is and how comfortable it is to take walks in Abuja compared to how abysmal it is to do so in Lagos without being catcalled or enraged by drivers who threaten to hit you with their cars. Chigozie then tells me that she would love to move to a place large enough to ride a bicycle in.
“Oh you can ride a bike?”She puts on a slightly judgmental look. “Yes I can. Funnily enough, whenever people tell me they can’t ride a bike, I’m like how?” she asked squinting in disbelief.“What do you mean?” I was almost ready to fight.“What were you doing when you were younger?” Chigozie asked, confused.“Not riding a bike, I guess?” I giggled. “When did you start riding a bike?”“I can’t really remember, but I was pretty young.”“Do you have a bike?”“No I don’t have a bike right now,” Chigozie said. “Bikes are so expensive now, so I’ve heard.”“Yea, I heard too. Me, I was thinking maybe it was like 100k or something.”“Me, I thought it was 30k o, I swear.”We let out a laugh. “Even bikes are expensive right now. Everything is so expensive”“For real. Funny thing is that I made a tweet one time; something in the line of ‘How come you don’t know how to ride a bicycle?’ That’s how some people took it personally. I was like please nau.”I chuckled. “You were like ‘Sorry, I didn’t mean to.’”“See. One person said I was classist or something.”I laughed out loudly. “How did we get here?”Chigozie chuckled. “It was crazy because my friends and I would joke about it and we’d laugh, you get? After I gave the girl my reply, I just blocked her. That’s alright, that’s alright.”I chuckled.“It was obviously a joke, you know? Me, I don’t know how to swim and I’m 26 right now.”“I can’t swim either. I attempted one time and I almost drowned,” I said.“Me too! I’ve almost drowned as well,” she said in a knowing tone. I gasped like I had just made a fun discovery of shared trauma. “It was a terrible day. It was very scary.”“Exactly. And you wouldn’t be able to do anything.”“You’re just there!”“For real.”
We spoke for a while longer about swimming, the injury she sustained on her knee — that led to the failure of our first attempt at meeting— and how random events can make efforts on skincare futile.Chigozie also told me about how she had initially planned to have a birthday pool party at the restaurant we were, until she was told that there was a minimum spend of 500k.“That’s so crazy because you didn’t even know what you were going to order for yet,” I said with a surprised look on my face.“Thank you. It didn’t make sense at all. And I was so disappointed because the guy who initially told me it was okay didn’t apologize for the inconvenience or whatever. I felt bad about it until a friend linked me to another location. It’s called 37 Lagos, and it was so good! Plus their pool is way larger than the one they have here.”“Oh real? Lagos restaurants are really coming up with this minimum spend thing and it’s so annoying,” I said, recounting my own experience.“It’s unnecessarily classist and annoying. I almost cancelled my birthday plans, but a friend linked me to another location.”“Do you have pictures from that day? I don’t think I saw them.”“Oh real? Are you sure?” “Yea. I think I only saw the pictures where you said you had a good day.”“Let me show you,” Chigozie said, opening her Twitter app and scrolling through her media. I spotted a viral video of Trevor Jackson covering Tyla’s Water — Chigozie had posted the video earlier that day, and we laughed about it, knowingly.“You’re such a menace,” I said in a giggle.She laughed. “That video is so funny. I laugh every time I think about it.”
“How did you have a pool party without knowing how to swim though?” I asked on a lighter note while looking through the videos of her pool party, but I was genuinely curious. The pool was truly large.Chigozie chuckled. “So I basically just stood in the shallow end and was kicking my feet. I don’t know how to swim, but I love water. I love being in water.”“Interesting.”I found it even more interesting because she loved something that she almost drowned in.“Yeah.”
“So how are you right now?” I asked.She hesitated. “I’m just here. I’m okay. Turned a new age.”“How does that feel for you?”“In my head, I feel like I’m still 22, to be honest. Or 23. Every time, I’m like ‘Wow, I’m 26.’ Obviously, I don’t behave like a 22 or 23 year old, but in my head I feel like a baby. Like I’m still quite young.”“Like you’re just a girl,” I said amused.Chigozie smiled. “Exactly! Like I’m just a girl,” she said. “It doesn’t feel that much different, to be fair, but next year, especially with my work, I want it to be more successful. I feel like this year was calm, basically for resting. It was easy, more about figuring stuff out. I’m slowly getting into work mode already though, but next year will be awesome.”“Were you excited about your birthday?”“Yes, I was, actually. Usually, I’m not necessarily excited for my birthday, but this year I decided to be. Even when the plans for my birthday location fell through and I was sad, the next day, I got up and decided to be happy,” she said. “You only get one day to truly celebrate yourself — one day that’s for you, so I believe we should try to really enjoy those special days.”“Yea exactly. You’re not lying.”
Chigozie got a call that lasted for about a minute. A call that started with “Hi baby…” and sounded pretty intimate too.
“Are you in a relationship?”“So I got into one recently,” she said.“Oh so you’re new,” I said chuckling.She smiled — or blushed. “Yeah. I feel like I’ve known him for a while though. Like I’ve known him for the longest, which is really great because we kind of like eased into it.”“Yeah. I feel like going into relationships slowly makes a lot of sense; instead of just rushing into it.”“Exactly,” Chigozie said. “So it’s really nice. I feel like it’s one of those things that make life less difficult and crazy.”“I feel you. Having someone to text on those crazy days can be very sweet.”“For real,” she said. “Are you in a relationship?” “No,” I replied almost immediately and we both burst into a long laugh.“It’s the way you replied so fast for me,” Chigozie said in a laugh.“Oh my God. I didn’t know it came out so fast either,” I said, still laughing.“Are you like searching or something?”I hesitated. “I don’t know. I don’t think I’m actively searching,” I started. “I enjoy having crushes though,” I continued in a grin.“Crushes can be fun,” Chigozie said.“Yeah. I’m so done with situationships though. Like it’s enough.”“Thank you please!” She exclaimed in alliance.“I want something really sweet.”“You’ll find it.”“Were you looking for love when you found it?”“Not necessarily. I had gotten out of a thing when it happened.”“Oh you got out of a relationship this year?”“Yeah.” Chigozie paused. “Well, no.” She smiled. “We were pretty much undefined.”“A situationship?”She laughed. “More or less. Exactly.”I chuckled. “How was that?”“Never again o!” Chigozie exclaimed.We burst out into a laugh that said a lot about the crazy experiences we’ve both had.“Literally never again. I tell everyone I know not to go into situationships. Unless you’re both really okay with it, it’s fine,” Chigozie said.“Yeah.”“I think I’m a lover, to be honest. I’m a very big lover girl. So situationships are not my thing. I’ve not had a lot of them so when people talked about them, I was like ‘I can’t relate,’ until I related and was like ‘Omo, this thing is crazy o!’ I can’t be doing this please.”I laughed.“And I feel like situationship breakups hurt even more than relationship breakups. With relationships, you had that person, you experienced that person, but with situationships, it’s just something that never was.”“Exactly. It didn’t even happen, but like it was so exciting.”“Yeah, like so much impact still. So I don’t recommend for people who love love and are very soft because they’ll definitely fall in love. It’s even more risky when sex gets involved.”“For real. There’s this bond that’ll be created. A bond that might only be in your head. Like it’d be only you catching feelings.”“Yeah. So I think it’s best to just save yourself while it’s still early because the deeper you fall into it, the more hopeful you get and the more tragic the end is,” Chigozie said.She made a lot of sense.“I saw a video one time and it described how, with men, loving occurs in a process, but with women, they most likely have feelings for a man before they even start dating. There’s this rush already.”“Yeah! That’s so accurate. I think we get too emotionally connected and sometimes we don’t even know how connected we got until much later and we’re like ‘Wow. This thing really impacted and affected me.’”“Another thing I don’t like about situationships is how you can’t hold the other person accountable for the stuff they do that may have offended you, but with relationships, you can sit your partner down and explain in detail,” I said, tapping on the couch we were sitting on.Chigozie chuckled. “You would even have the right to have the conversation. Honestly, I feel like I can be so self aware with people, so I always like to check in. I never want to overstep my boundary or feel like I’m doing too much, so I always try to be clear. That’s not something I can enjoy doing in situationships.”“Yeah, for real.”“And when you get into healthy relationships, you realize you wasted so much time holding on to half-assed love,” Chigozie said.“Right?”
We talked further about how relationships hold so much weight and how important it is to be with someone who, according to Chigozie, would not be one of your 99 problems and would love communicating with you, even during fights.“The worst thing is when you’re an overthinker and you’re not with someone who loves listening to you and is interested in validating your feelings. Every action weighs on you,” Chigozie said.“Yeah, that’s so true,” I said. “I think that when somebody raises an issue or talks about a weird way you treated them, it’s not because they hate you. I think that if they tell you that you did this, it’s because they like you enough to talk about it and they still want you to be in their life.”“Exactly.”“And most times, how you see things might be different, but it’s so important to validate those feelings still. They’re not talking about what you meant or your intent, instead, they’re talking about how you made them feel.”“Yeah. And I feel it’s so important to be considerate in expressing your feelings too. I also believe it’s important to lay your feelings down on the table and talk things out — my friends have really helped me with this. You know, you might even end up apologizing, but at the end of the day, your connection grows stronger and that’s better than any ‘win.’”“For real. I really feel you on that.”
We talked more about conflict in relationships — be it romance or friendships — and how important it is to address issues with the other person in mind. We also talked about knowing when to let go of certain people when issues keep recurring and there’s no potential of a better relationship with them.
“So I want to ask a question about your artistry. How come all your paintings look like you?” My question was almost accusatory.
“It’s not even intentional,” Chigozie replied, giggling. “I’m not even doing it on purpose all the time. A lot of my paintings speak on things concerning me, so yeah those ones, but I actually don’t do it on purpose.” She paused. “Yeah, maybe I know my face so well and the way I paint sometimes reflects that, but I don’t mind it though because at the end of the day, a lot of the things I paint speak to me, so I feel like in that way, I’m just sharing pieces of myself with people and then, even though it’s unintentional, it makes my art more recognizable. So whenever people see my painting, they know it’s Chigozie that did that.”I smiled. “Yeah like ‘That’s Chigozie Obi’s art!’ I think that’s unique.”“Yeah.”“So have you ever had a solo exhibition in Lagos?”“So I had one at the Art X Lagos Fair. That was my first, but I want to have one next year. One that isn’t attached to an organization or body or something. Just completely mine. So hopefully that goes well.”“Yeah, it’ll go well. I’ll come.”“Yes, you have to come!” Chigozie exclaimed. “I have so many ideas I want to bring to life. Four fingers crossed that it goes well.” She chuckled, crossing her fingers.I laughed.
“So you’re a first daughter. Did you see those tweets about first daughters and pieces of advice for them?” I asked referencing a Twitter trend.“I saw a few and there was one I saw that said ‘Learn when to detach from people,’ and it really hit me,” Chigozie started. I feel like I hold on to people and give them multiple chances and I feel like that may have stemmed from my experience as a first daughter. I’ve learnt that I have to learn how to be myself first, and when I lost my Mum, I think it became a thing of ‘You’re the Mum now and you have to take care of your brother and your Dad,’ but eventually, I was like I still have my own life whilst still checking in and making sure they’re good.”“When did you lose your Mum?”“2019.”“Oh really?”“Yeah,” she paused. “After my Mum died, it sunk in that you can literally die at any moment, and when you die, nothing matters. Not the money, nothing at all. And even if people celebrate you on Earth, you’ll never know. So I find enjoying myself a big deal. It’s so important to me. I might not do it in the most extravagant way because money is so important, but I always try to find pockets of joy.”“And I think you have a lot of fun too,” I said.“Yeah, I try,” Chigozie said. “I think the misconception people have of me though, is that they think my life is so soft, like I have people who will dm me and be like ‘Chigozie, you just dey chop life o,’ but I’m like, I’m out here busting my ass o. I might not just show all the processes, but underneath all of that, it’s still work,” she said. I chuckled. “Yeah, I feel you.”“I take and post a lot of pictures though. When my Mum died, we only had about three pictures together.”“Oh my God.” That was sad.“I know right? So I told myself I want to start documenting everything, from my friends, to what I’m doing, places I visit, everything actually.”“Yeah. I’ve seen your Instagram page dedicated to pictures of places and things too,” I said, referencing Le Journal De Gozie. “Yeah. Sometimes, when I’m feeling down, all I need to do is scroll through my Instagram accounts, and it’s pretty easy to document on Instagram and Twitter too.”“I think that’s very intentional. It’s really nice and I love the concept of it.”“Thank you,” she said, smiling.
“I think you’ve really hacked your style too. I notice you love clothes,” I said.“Yeah, I do.”“Your outfits are pretty.”“Right? Thank you. I think that I’m evolving too. One thing I don’t want to do is feel like I can’t wear certain outfits because I’m growing older. I want my style to remain like this forever. One day, I’m wearing ashewo clothes, the next day, I’m dressed like a boss lady. The next day, I’m doing office worker. The next day I’m doing stripper.”“Does it depend your mood?” I asked before realizing the last thing she mentioned, and I laughed.“Sometimes,” she said, laughing. “I notice that when I’m feeling down, I wear black a lot.”“Now I’m going to be on the lookout for you in black,” I said, joking.She laughed. “No no, it’s not all the time. I’m wearing black tomorrow for my birthday dinner.”“Okay. After tomorrow, I’ll be on the lookout for you in black.”Chigozie laughed.
“So you mentioned earlier how expectations have shaped you in some way as a first daughter and how you’ve managed them. Are there childhood events or trauma that you feel have, in some way, affected your current view of the world or how you relate to people?”Chigozie hesitated for a second. “Hmmm not particularly, but I know that growing up introverted, it took me having female friends to open up to certain things. I grew up with so many boys around me and I didn’t really lean into my feminine side while growing up as well. I think I was a late bloomer too. Growing up like that didn’t make me feel so great or feminine in a way, but my female friends have helped me to open up more and appreciate my body more. It’s also much easier to talk to them about topics like sex. I had to become more confident with saying how I feel and sharing how I certain things affect me too,” she said. “I did like a 180. Is it 180 or 360?” Chigozie asked. She was trying to describe the turning point in her life and I found it hilarious.“You sha did something,” I replied, laughing. My brain was not processing that either, to be honest.She laughed. “I sha did something,” she said. “I feel like younger Chigozie would be happy with where I am right now.”“I’m sure she is.”
I listened to Chigozie tell me about how growing up introverted made her self aware, and maybe a little too much in some cases, as she has now grown to be more calculative of the things she says, who she says them too and where she says them. It’s not exactly a problem though because she would never be silent when she needs to speak. It was then I realized that I hadn’t ordered for a drink or food yet.
“I think I’m ready to have a drink now,” I said. “You should have the chapman. It’s really good.”I was staring at the menu. “Oh really?” “Yeah. People say the pineapple juice is good too though.”“Nah, I’ll have the Chapman. What’s their pizza like?”“It’s so good, but disclaimer: It’s really simple. There’s nothing much happening with it.”“I love my pizza like that though. Is it flat?”“Yeah, it is. I usually have the pepperoni,” Chigozie said. “My boyfriend’s not a fan of it like I am though.”I chuckled. We had two pepperoni pizzas to go and the Chapman was really good. I tried not to finish it in one sip. Chigozie said I did a good job for not finishing it all at once.
“I really like this space,” I said, scanning through the restaurant.“Yeah it’s pretty chill. Have you been to Godaïf?”“Nah I haven’t.”“We should go there next.”I squealed in faux excitement. “Is that a second date?” Chigozie laughed.“You know those moments when you go out on a date and you get excited when they start planning a second date before the end of the first?” I asked.“Yeah,” Chigozie replied, smiling.“That’s how I feel right now.”

Perhaps I should have been more compassionate towards the Stockholm inflicted ones. I tried. Not hard but I tried. I couldn't do it. I couldn't look into the inhuman eyes of the corporate bot and feel anything but loathing.

When I visited Stockholm for the first time, I had low expectations for my trip. It’s not Paris with the Eiffel Tower and Louvre, Florence with its great art and delectable cuisine or Athens where visitors can see living history around every corner.
The most I knew about it, except for the fact I had a friend who lived there, was that it had a museum dedicated to a pop band and another museum dedicated to a ship that sank during its maiden voyage. With so much of the world for me to explore, Stockholm wasn’t on the top of my check list.
I underestimated Stockholm. and this is why you should move Stockholm to the top of your travel “to do” list too!
My husband and I decided to visit Stockholm to visit a friend from there who we met in the States several years before. Over the years we also met his brother, wife and children so by our first visit to Stockholm, we viewed them as our family.
We stayed in Gamla Stan, the old town. This is a beautiful cobblestone neighborhood on its own island. Stockholm is a city made up of many separate islands connected by bridges and ferries.
Stepping into Gamla Stan makes you feel like you took a step back in time. We stayed at a hotel called the Victory Hotel which is dedicated to Stockholm’s strong maritime heritage.
Our friend could not meet us until later in the evening on our first day so he directed us to a nearby restaurant that focused on Swedish cuisine. Although I watched some YouTube videos on the Stockholm food scene, I didn’t have high expectations for the city’s culinary offerings. Another mistake on my part.
This first meal was at a restaurant called Ardbeg Embassy. It felt very Nordic and like walking into someone’s home, so it was the perfect spot to start my Swedish adventure. We started with Toast Skagen, of course, which is essentially shrimp on toast. One bite and it was my new favorite appetizer. My husband had reindeer tenderloin and I had salmon with hollandaise sauce and potatoes. It all felt very Swedish and, after that meal, I decided I needed to dive into the city’s culinary scene more. In America, I can only get hollandaise sauce on top of poached eggs and in Sweden they put it on fish for dinner. When can I move?
Although some travel writers will disagree, when in Europe I always chose a hotel that offers breakfast in the morning. I love waking up to a breakfast buffet of fruit and charcuterie whenever I am in Europe. No matter which country I am visiting, I always know I am going to start my day with fruits, cheeses, meats, various juices, and, the best part, an automatic coffee machine which will make me a cappuccino, macchiato or espresso at the push of a button. I wish American hotels would jump on the European hotel breakfast bandwagon!
During day 2 in Stockholm, we decided to simply wander the city like tourists and then meet our friend later in the day to go to the ABBA Museum. The ABBA Museum was the one and only place that I did not want to miss. At the museum, I learned a lot about the band and its fascinating journey to stardom. We planned a low key day to save our energy for what we expected to be an epic night with our friends at a restaurant called Punk Royale.
Punk Royale — think Michelin quality fine dining but in a punk rock bar. My husband decided to go all in and showed up in an AC/DC shirt and black sunglasses. Since he has long hair, the outfit, which I thought was a gamble since this was a $300 per person restaurant, worked and he immediately received praise from the staff for showing up in costume.
The menu is a 20 course tasting menu and many courses were served with a different alcoholic beverage. The food is innovative and the atmosphere is lively and immersive. It was one of the most interesting and fabulous meals I have had.
After our wonderful meal at Punk Royale, we found ourselves at a “shot” bar called Shotluckan. I have never experienced anything like it, which appeared to be the trend for the evening. When a shot was served, it was an interactive experience. For our first shot, my husband and I found ourselves in a wedding ceremony with the bartender acting as the wedding officiant. Apparently, we even received a marriage license, which I promptly lost. For our second shot, we were instructed to put on ski goggles and compressed air was blown in our faces while we did the shot.
Needless to say, we lost the entire next day as we recovered from a Swedish night on the town. We used this development as an excuse to extend our stay one extra day. This city was so much better than I expected.
Because Stockholm is made up of many islands, ferries are part of the public transportation system. Once we recovered from our night on the town, we decided to try the ferry system to travel to an island called Fjäderholmarna for the day for a scenic ride through the archipelago and to have lunch. When we arrived on the island, I immediately felt like I was transported to seaside Maine with the forest meeting the sea and red wooden buildings dotting the coastline. We ate oysters and drank champagne and ordered more Toast Skagen while watching boaters enjoying the beautiful weather.
A visit to Stockholm would not be complete without enjoying Fika which is not a snack per sé, but a tradition of taking a break during the day to have a coffee with a baked good. The Swedes know how to make bakery items! The cinnamon rolls were delectable everywhere we went.
As our long weekend in Stockholm progressed, we became very comfortable using the public transportation system throughout the city. It was fairly easy and all done through an app on our phones. We did not have time to explore the art installations that can be found in many stations, but we intend to do that on our next visit. We never felt unsafe, but of course we remained cautious at all times.
When traveling to Stockholm, visitors should not miss the Vasa Museum. Before going to the museum, I could not understand why a museum that glorified a ship which immediately sank during its maiden voyage was a must do, but then we went. The Vasa is a preserved 17th-century warship with 98% of the original structure intact. It sank during its first voyage because it was simply too heavy to float. It was salvaged after over 300 years underwater fully preserved in the brackish water and offers a rare, time-capsule view into naval architecture and craftsmanship of the early 1600s.
My first trip to Stockholm was unexpectedly amazing and I am so glad we went. Stockholm rewards curiosity at every turn. It’s a place where history and innovation quietly collide. Venture beyond the expected, and you’ll find Stockholm is a layered and intriguing city just as I did!

Me and my wife were fortunate to became parents in 2019 with a baby girl. At the time we were living in California and I worked at Google as a Software Engineer. While enjoying free lunches at Google with collegues we talked about various topics. Sometimes about social problems, hobbies old Google stories from veteran Googlers and rarely technical topics. One day it was a story about Finland and how they send a box of things for new born babies and parents buy nothing but diapers during the first year. This has been a tradition in Finland for 75 years. He happened to read about this in a book called Nordic theory of everything.
As a new parent I was interested in reading this book and fascinated about the culture in nordic countries and their approach to life. Following this book I read a couple of more books like The Almost Nearly Perfect People, There’s no such thing as bad weather. Of course I read hundreds of Quoara posts and watched tens of youtube videos about nordic countries. I was convinced that the Nordics have a very interesting thing going on in their countries. I was intrigued by the childcare and the freedom kids were given in their childhood. Playing outside all day long, spending time in the forest, less home work and less ranking and competition. Occasionally I asked myself should we also move to one of these countries ? I felt that it would be an interesting thing to do but part of me was convinced that They have a great culture but it is probably great for the natives but not for the foreigners who move there. Would this really work out well for a brown kid, let alone her parents who were born and raised in a tropical country.
My life continued with reading here and there about the nordic culture but nothing serious happened. Then the pandemic hit and we were stuck in our newly bought house in California. Not having to spend a lot of time for commute, I finally got some time to think. Like so many other people who made life changing decisions during the pandemic, I thought this would be a good time to move to one of the Nordic countries. It is a bold thing to do but interesting. As a person who gets bored of things easily and person who likes excitement, this felt good.
On the other hand my wife was not very interested in this move. After struggling to save money for 5 years we finally bought our own home and lived there for only a couple of months. Everything was finally stable and she wanted to relax in our new home with our newborn. She is a person who can be satisfied with a very little. She is not a person who would think too much into the future. Sometime I envy her approach to life where her highest priority is to be happy with her family and live a calm peaceful life. While me reading a lot about macro social economic problems, Climate change and how they affect us and affect my child’s upbringing. May be this a good blend for a more sustainable longterm family life.
Somehow I managed to convince her that it was the right thing to do given it is important for Surali to spend her early days in the best environment. Also I convinced her it will be very interesting for her to find work in a nordic country where our salary difference will be a lot less than what we have now.
I boldly applied for a job within Google and requested for a transfer. My transfer was accepted and I was given an excellent relocation package to move to Sweden. We gave our house keys to the real estate agent, sold our car, said good bye to our close friends and left San Francisco. I am good at saying good bye to old places, either because I have less attachments to them or I am too much focus on the future and the next step. I did not regret it when I left my hometown Galle(2010), Sri Lanka(2011), Indiana (2015) or when we left USA to Sweden(2020). I am sure one day I will leave Sweden without much regret. Hard thing with the every move was leaving behind the friends and family. I still keep in touch with friends and family from each place.
Retired person picked up my car, bought it for 22,000$ and sold it for 12,000$ after 5 years of use. This was a mistake, I should have donated this car to our buddhist temple.
We arrived at SFO and the airport was almost empty and we had our flight to Europe and there were a couple of people in the flight and the crew had little to no work to do because the flight was empty. I doubt we would ever have a long haul flight like this.
In 2020 October (Fall in Sweden) we arrived in Arlanda airport and I was visiting Europe after many years (In 2009 I visited Amsterdam while I was studying in college). Arlanda airport is located middle of no where, it almost felt like landing in a forest. From the sky there weren’t any buildings visible, no perfectly created neighbourhoods lines visible from the sky, no roads spanning all possible directions, and we spotted a massive archipelago with thousands of islands.
We picked up our bags and prepared our documents ready to answer all the questions from the border control and continued to walk towards customs. If you travelled to the US you would know how the drill goes. We were pushing our carts with lots of bags and walking towards the exit and nobody asked a single question and a bunch of police officers gave us a slight smile (later I got to know that this is called Swedish look) and that was it. This is not because Sweden doesn’t have a border control but we flew through Netherlands and all the border check was done there and nothing was required at the Swedish border. But my thought was Hey, we are moving to Sweden for the first time, don’t you want to cross check us, check our papers, check our bags, what if we bring something harmful to the agriculture.
We have booked an apartment in the east of Stockholm (Östermalm) and my new manager at Google told me that this area is one of the nicest places in Stockholm, so I had lots of expectations. I expected to see perfectly manicured plants with lots of flowers by the streets, nicely cut grass everywhere and skyscrapers. But it wasn’t the case, to me it felt like an average neighbourhood in San Francisco but with lots of greenary. I noticed the huge park right in front of our hotel with a forest skyline. Now I know that in Sweden beauty kept at it’s natural state compared to the extreme human intervention in America. Östermalm has it’s own beauty with the water close by and forest and lots of walking paths. If I have the money, Östermalm would be one of my favourite areas I’d like to live. Now I get what my manager meant when he said it’s one of the best places in Sweden.
We moved to our apartment and it was a nice spacious apartment at the top floor and I noticed the high quality of construction inside the apartment compared to our old place in the US. Wooden floors, high-end kitchen equipments and the lovely view of Stockholm through the kitchen window. Same night I stepped out of the balcony and saw something I haven’t seen for a long time. I saw the man wearing a suite and waiting for the bus with bags full of groceries. This is not a common scene in America where people always drive for groceries and put them in the trunk and drive back home. This is one of the moments that I felt, oh my god, things are really different here and it is real. After seeing the grocery man I thought there must be a store close by and then I figured it is actually in the same building ground floor. How convenience is that ? You simply have to take the elevator down and you are at the store.
When I think about our move now, it was definitely a bold move, I should have done many things before moving here. I should have come for a short visit, but I couldn’t because it was in the middle of the COVID19 pandemic. I should have waited a few more years so I would save more with less taxes in the US, but then my kid wouldn’t have the great experience in Swedish preschool system. But all in all we are doing fine in Sweden now. Sometimes bold moves might bring you the greatest experiences in life. When we moved here we lived alone and barely knew anyone except one family whom we couldn’t meet for a couple of months due to pandemic rules. But what kept me going was not to over think and stay positive. I’m pretty sure lots of my friends and family questioned our decision to move to Sweden, but I still believe it gave us a different perspective to our life. It of course didn’t improve all aspects of our lives but it improved the things we value the most as a family.
Now after 3 years from our move I’m writing this article in my room in our apartment in Stockholm. We live 5km from the central Stockholm close to a small forest with 15km of bike/running paths. Since the move I have changed a lot as a person and I think I have a more balanced life than ever before. I no longer work for Google, a few weeks ago I joined a small startup with ten engineers.
After living in Sweden for 3 years, I think it is a good time to write about our experience here in the nordics. I will be writing more articles about Sweden and our life in the nordics.

Follow up with the part 1 about 10 things I love about Stockholm, here are five more things that I love about Stockholm:
As I arrived in Stockholm, carrying my luggage through the city’s bustling streets to my rental apartment, I couldn’t help but notice something remarkable — every time I approached a crosswalk, the cars would stop and the drivers would kindly wave me across. It was a small gesture, but it made a big impression on me.
As I settled into my apartment, I quickly realized that this was just the beginning of Stockholm’s pedestrian-friendly culture. The city’s well-designed streets and sidewalks made it easy and enjoyable to explore on foot, with plenty of green spaces and parks to relax in along the way.
But it wasn’t just walking that was a breeze in Stockholm — cycling was also a popular and efficient mode of transportation. The city’s network of bike lanes and paths were well-marked and separated from motorized traffic, making it safe and convenient to pedal my way around.
Exploring Stockholm’s inner city doesn’t require a car, thanks to the city’s efficient and convenient public transportation system. From buses to trams, trains, and the famous Stockholm Metro, there are plenty of options for getting around. During the summer months, ferries are also available to take you across the city’s waterways. With well-placed stations throughout the city and frequent services, navigating Stockholm is a breeze. The system is easy to use, with clear signage and ticket machines that accept both cash and card payments.
Plus, there’s even a mobile app called SL to help guide your travel, check schedules for different transportation options, and purchase tickets on-the-go. Say goodbye to traffic and hello to stress-free exploration in Stockholm with their convenient public transportation system.
You might be surprised to learn that one of the most convenient and innovative features of the country is its BankID system.
BankID is a digital identification system that allows Swedes to securely access a range of online services, from banking and government services to shopping and entertainment. You can use BankID to login your bank accounts, verify transaction, login Skatteverket (Swedish Tax Agency) to check your tax payment, login 1177.se (Swedish Health and Care) to book doctor appointment, login Pensionsmyndigheten (Pension Authority),…
In order to obtain a BankID, you must have a Swedish Personal Identity Number, be a customer of one of the banks that issue BankID. With BankID, I was able to quickly and securely authenticate my identity, without the need for clunky passwords or authentication codes. It made the process fast and hassle-free, and I never had to worry about my personal information being compromised.
Since I moved to Stockholm, I don’t use cash anymore. There are tons of benefits of that.
Firstly, I don’t need to carry around pockets full of coins and notes, worrying about losing or misplacing them.
Secondly, I also don’t need to worry about fraudster that use counterfeit money in the black market or worry about pickpocket.
Lastly, it is more convenient to control my personal finance with all the transactions are recorded in the bank account, categorise my activities so I don’t need to write down my transaction anymore.
Instead, I can pay using credit/debit card, or pay via my mobile using Apple pay, or I can may via Swish (mobile instant payment).
One of the most striking things about Stockholm, as a foreigner living here, is the locals’ fluency and friendliness in speaking English. From restaurant servers to shopkeepers, bus drivers, and security guards, nearly everyone seems to be bilingual. This ease of communication makes getting around and making connections in Stockholm an absolute breeze, and I always feel welcomed and at home here. I’ve had some truly delightful conversations with locals who were eager to practice their English skills and share their insights into Swedish culture and traditions. The friendly and fluent locals truly embody Sweden’s welcoming and inclusive spirit.
Of course, I still made an effort to learn some basic Swedish phrases and customs, out of respect for the country and its people. I appreciate how the city’s bilingualism has made my life in Stockholm stress-free and enjoyable.
I have travelled to several cities in the world, but in the end, Stockholm is and will be the city I would choose to settle long term. Whether you’re interested in history, culture, or simply enjoying the outdoors, this city has it all. With its efficient public transportation system and welcoming atmosphere, Stockholm is a perfect destination for travelers looking to explore Scandinavia? You’re sure to fall in love with Stockholm, just like I do.

Today wraps my last day in Stockholm, Sweden — The middle leg of my scandinavian holiday that I’m taking while on sabbatical. Stockholm has been great, with loads of museums, picturesque walks and today we had some snow!
I can’t help but compare Stockholm to Croydon in the UK. When we arrived at Stockholm Central station from the Airport we walked to outside Åhléns where we got the tram to the area that our hotel is based. If I replaced Åhléns with Allders then I’m basically talking about Croydon so it’s been hard to move away from that framing.
What’s also made it hard to not compare Stockholm to Croydon has been the people, who from my eight days of being here are just as rude, although not as loud as people from London (although Croydon being in London is something some will debate).
Compared to Copenhagen there’s a lot more cars and less bikes on the road in Stockholm but that’s a little more understandable due to how cold it gets here. Public transport wise it’s similar with the addition of the tram, the trains here I would say have better signage than those in Denmark with a screen showing the next 4 stops which was useful for when we headed out of the city centre.
Our first full day in Stockholm was on a Sunday so we stayed local as things were closing early and we had a lay in to sleep off getting up early to make our flight the day before. Luckily the Vasa Museum was right by our hotel so we had a wander over there and was blown away at the scale of both the ship and the craftmanship that was put into it.
On Monday we took a stroll around Stockholm’s old town (Gamla Stan) and found a really cool comic / gaming shop which had some cool D&D displays.
On Tuesday we went to Skansen which for me has been the highlight of my time in Stockholm. It’s an amazing open air museum and zoo which had a really cool mix of crafting workshops, gardens and animals. The enclosures in the zoo were massive so I was really happy to see the animals not being closed in like in some zoos, there was also a really fun monkey area you could walk through with them running around.
On Wednesday I dragged my other-half to Skogskyrkogården, a cemetry about 25 mins outside of Stockholm that was used for a picture in the liner notes (remember those) of Entombed’s Left Hand Path. Being a massive Death Metal fan I had to go see the cross there and get a picture.
On Thursday we had a boat tour of the Stockholm Archipelago booked so we went aboard and enjoyed a two and a half journey to Vaxholm and back while taking in the sites. It was around this time that the temperature dropped and I came to realise how my Barbour Ashby jacket works well for UK winters but nordic winters would require an extra layer so I decided to go buy a liner for the jacket which has proved worthwhile.
Friday saw a trip to the Toy Museum but I was a little disappointed in it. There were a few cool displays but there was nothing that really told the story of how toys changed over the years and more just collections of toys with similar properties (like cars, planes etc). I think they could have improved it by showing the evolution of toys from wooden to plastic to electronic and how the business behind toys changed too (like the 80s tie-in TV show boom).
Today (Saturday) it snowed so instead of going to see anything in particular we had a walk around some of the area in the snow as the UK doesn’t get snow in the same sense so the novelty was still there.

Ever since I relocated to Amsterdam, solo traveling has been one of my preferred activities. This enables me to have some personal time to ponder on life and also puts me in a vulnerable scenario that encourages me to explore the world alone while making new acquaintances in an unfamiliar city. Following the semester’s conclusion, I opted to travel to Stockholm, Sweden, and embark on a 3-day expedition.
Coming along with me is my Fuji film camera loaded with a Fuji 200 film roll, a non-fiction book, my journal with a cover featuring Amsterdam houses, a black pen and highlighters from MUJI, a carry-on containing a makeup bag, and overly-packed clothes (because it’s important to look stylish while traveling, don’t you agree?), and an open-minded attitude.
Naturally, my journey began with a mad dash to the bus station in order to catch the final bus to Schipol Airport for my early flight, as is typically the case. Rushing is never enjoyable, but ironically, I feel an added sense of excitement whenever I commence my travels in this manner.
To kill the waiting time before boarding on Boeing 737–800, I chose a perfect seat with a good view, put my headphone on with my travel playlist playing in the background, and waited for some interesting airport romance incidents to happen (this is part of the reason that I love flying alone). Luckily enough, early July is the peak season for all the (hot) Dutchies gathering in the airport, wearing those linen shirts, paired with shorts and light-coloured sneakers to get ready for their holidays in southern Europe.
After landing at Stockholm Arlanda Airport, the first thought that came up to my mind was, Wow! I’m in freaking Stockholm!! I’m so ready for this city!!
Without even realizing it, I found myself standing in front of Café Pascal, eager to indulge in my daily dose of caffeine and Swedish pastry as my first meal in Stockholm. Situated near Odenplan and Observatorielunden, the café offers a warm and inviting interior design, along with a stunning terrace. In addition to a wide selection of coffee, there are also plenty of sandwiches and Swedish pastries to choose from.
As Gamla Stan was introduced on the travel website, visitstockholm.com,
Gamla Stan, the Old Town in Swedish, is one of the largest and best-preserved medieval city centers in Europe, and one of the foremost attractions in Stockholm. This is where Stockholm was founded in 1252.
As I strolled through Gamla Stan, I couldn’t help but be captivated by the narrow winding cobblestone streets and charming houses, each with their unique character. I kept my film camera at the ready, eager to capture the beauty of this old town and the occasional glimpses of the harbour view that peeked out between the alleys. It was heartwarming to see elderly couples walking hand-in-hand down the street.
Amidst the steady influx of sightseers, the quaint streets and souvenir emporiums brimmed with activity. Yet, I derived solace from the tranquility and geniality of the medieval city center. Instead of hastening to snap up iconic photographs at tourist landmarks, I relish taking in the sights, sounds, and scents of the city’s breathtaking scenery. Additionally, I take pleasure in engaging in conversations with shop proprietors to glean more insights into the region’s rich history and vibrant local customs.
When I was dining at Fika & Wine, I inquired about the meaning of Fika culture from one of the baristas in Fika & Wine.
“Fika is one of those words that can be difficult to translate. Essentially, it means enjoying coffee, tea, wine, and Swedish sweets with nice company. The best part? You can have as many Fikas as you want in a day!” she said.
Fika is a Swedish tradition that encourages slowing down and savoring the moment. As a coffee enthusiast, I couldn’t resist embracing this wonderful culture.
During my visit to Stockholm, I made it a point to fully immerse myself in the Swedish lifestyle by partaking in the delightful tradition of Fika time twice a day. I was fortunate enough to discover a charming little spot in the Södermalm neighborhood called Drop Coffee Roasters, which quickly became my go-to destination for this delightful pastime. The ambiance was cozy and inviting, with an airy and bright interior that exuded warmth and comfort.
As for my Fika order, I opted for a cappuccino made with creamy oat milk, which was simply divine. The coffee was expertly brewed and had a rich and robust flavour that perfectly complemented the sweetness of the pastries. Speaking of which, I indulged in two of the most popular Fika treats, the classic Kanelbulle, which is a hall-of-fame pastry in Sweden, and the delectable Chokladbollar, a chocolatey treat that was simply irresistible.
Overall, my Fika experience at Drop Coffee Roasters was nothing short of exceptional. The baristas were friendly and willing to share their favorite cafes. I highly suggest this spot for visitors to Stockholm who desire to immerse themselves in authentic Fika culture while enjoying some of the best coffee and pastries in town.
Since returning from my trip to København in late April, journaling has become one of my favorite hygge rituals. Initially, I began journaling as a private outlet to express my thoughts and romanticize life amidst the intensity of my studies. However, it has since evolved into a unique way of documenting the little moments that occur during each trip.
During my stay in Stockholm, I made it a point to take a leisurely walk during the golden hour. Starting from Kungsträdgården, I would traverse the path that led me through the picturesque Skeppsholmsbron, and eventually arrive at Kastellholmen. Once there, I would find a cozy bench to sit on, gazing out at either the charming Gamla Stan and Södermalm or the enchanting Djurgården. The gentle breeze would caress my skin, evoking a myriad of emotions that would stir within me, bringing back fond memories of the past and inspiring hope for a bright future. It served as a wonderful reminder to appreciate and cherish the present moment.
“ … tomorrow will be the last day of this solo travel journey in Stockholm. I asked myself how was I feeling earlier today. To be completely honest, I’m not so sure and life has been quite choatic in the past few weeks. So, I would say it’s like a mix of all kinds of emotions, it’s difficult to articulate, but mostly relief …” as it was written in my journal.
This journey ended with the style of experiencing my very first airport romance while waiting for my flight back to Amsterdam. This unexpected romance occurred at the Stockholm Arlanda Airport and involved a charming Swede who was en route to Florence via Amsterdam and a Taiwanese girl who was headed back to Amsterdam.
It was the perfect finale for my solo travel journey in Stockholm.
As I reflect on my solo travel escapade in Stockholm, my heart swells with gratitude and a profound sense of fulfillment. This journey wasn’t merely a series of adventures, but a soul-enriching odyssey that allowed me to establish a profound connection with myself and the world around me.
Each and every second of my journey, starting from boarding that early morning flight to setting foot in the captivating Gamla Stan, left a deep imprint on my soul. The sheer pleasure of strolling through the winding cobblestone streets and capturing the city's exquisite charm with my faithful Fuji film camera was indescribable. However, it was the small yet significant conversations with the amiable locals and fellow voyagers that truly added a unique and meaningful touch to this unforgettable trip.
Discovering the Swedish Fika culture was a revelation. Slowing down, savoring coffee, pastries, and moments with lovely company — what a beautiful way to appreciate life’s simple pleasures! Drop Coffee Roasters became my haven, where the aroma of expertly brewed coffee mingled with the warmth of human connection. For a coffee lover like me, in particular, Fika time enriched this entire journey with an extra touch!!
While journaling during the golden hours became a cherished ritual. Pouring my thoughts onto paper, I found solace amidst life’s challenges. The picturesque spots in Stockholm became the backdrop for my reflections, reminding me to cherish the present and embrace the beauty of each moment.
And then, there was the unexpected airport romance — a serendipitous encounter that reminded me of the magic of travel. A charming Swede and a Taiwanese girl crossing paths in Stockholm — it was a heartwarming finale to my adventure, leaving me with a newfound appreciation for human connections that transcend borders.
As I bid farewell to Stockholm, I carry with me a treasure trove of memories, insights, and newfound friendships. This solo journey has reaffirmed my belief in the transformative power of travel — the way it opens our hearts and minds to the world’s diversity and beauty.
Now, back in Amsterdam, I’ll continue to cherish my Amsterdam house-covered journal, eager to document my reflections and plan future escapades.
Solo travel has become a soul-enriching way of life for me — one that fosters curiosity, self-discovery, and the courage to embrace the unknown. May we continue to explore this beautiful world with a spirit of wonder and compassion.
Until our paths cross again, dear Stockholm, I will hold you close in my heart. And as I eagerly await my next adventure, I’ll keep my mind and heart open to the wonders that lie ahead.

The first time I came to Stockholm, things weren’t going well. Back home I’d been following all the rules, but the expression “my life is passing me by” was talking about me. Pushed from the complacency of obedience, I bought a one-way ticket to Europe. I started in Germany but didn’t know what to do and felt like I was messing everything up, so I took the overnight train to Copenhagen, where I didn’t know what to do and felt like I was messing everything up, so I took the overnight train to Stockholm, where I walked to a couple hostels and found them all full.
“Didn’t you know you need to book ahead during this season?” the man asked me.
“No,” I could have answered. “Because I don’t know what to do and am messing everything up.”
Embarrassed and overwhelmed, I walked on into the cold light of an October dawn and found a little park. An old lady was walking her shivering dog. Puppy and I looked at each other in mirrored misery. Giving up, going away, I walked to the harbor and caught the overnight boat to Estonia.
The very next day an egg hatched and the travel bug that crawled out bit me so hard I must have bitten it back. From there my life took an unexpected path that felt better than anything before it, though it took some years to notice. Today that path has me back in Stockholm to lead another tour of the job I love. Every time I come back to this city (any city) I enjoy getting to know it better, but I never considered that park, held in my memory but lost to a long-ago lack of a map, much less a clue.
Until tonight, meandering home to the hotel, when I crossed a little park and felt the shock of recognition in the soft summer air. I sat on the bench where I rested my overloaded pack those many years ago, and marveled at all of it. An old lady was walking a dog. Puppy and I looked at each other with mirrored playful joy.
Travel has always taken me forward, in more ways than one, and I applaud the universe with great claps of gratitude. But travel is not an accomplishment. It’s just something you do if it’s right for you. I smile the insider smile with any of you who already know that.
Now, questions of privilege demand answers, the zeitgeist of our age. But I think a lot of people are too convinced by the burdensome “you can’t travel now, you have to work work work.” And it has to be said that human beings are good at staying within our comfort zones, to our own detriment.
Do you know anyone who needs a little push? Perhaps someone snug in the complacency of obedience, for whom the sound of that stamp landing in their passport will forever after echo as the starting pistol to run into a fuller experience of life? Is it you?
That pistol sounded for me, and looking back at it from that park bench, 16 years into my marathon, I am so glad it did. Nice to see you again, Stockholm.

I could see Stockholm’s famous city hall and tower across Riddarfjärden bay from my island of Gamla Stan. Completed in 1923, the complex is famous for hosting Sweden’s Nobel Prize banquet each year in December.
Tours were provided in English on the hour so I hiked across the Centralbron (central bridge) and joined a small group headed inside. The building was still the working hub of Stockholm municipal services so the only way to experience the interior was through the tour (pretty sure I’m not going to win a Nobel Prize any time soon).
We walked through the Blue Hall where the Nobel Prize banquet is held for 1,300 guests including that year’s winners, their invites (each winner gets 15), the Swedish Royal family and Sweden’s Prime Minister.
The Nobel Foundation awards prizes in the fields of Physics, Chemistry, Physiology/Medicine, Literature and, most famously, Peace as depicted below. Can you guess which figure represents which award?
I appreciated many of the Swedish historical details within the building but there were many I didn’t quite grasp. Unfortunately the tour moved quickly so I could only snap a few pics and plan on researching later.
I especially liked the Rådsalen where the city council worked. The architect back in the 1920s had planned for a formal ceiling but when he saw the exposed wooden beams during construction, he changed course and capped the chamber in a striking Viking theme:
The most impressive room was aptly named the Golden Hall. Eighteen million gilded tiles covered the walls and formed mosaics depicting Swedish history. There were plenty of Vikings, medieval characters and creatures from Nordic lore. It was interesting that secular and not religious themes were expressed.
The centerpiece was a massive mosaic covering the back wall dominated by a seated woman. She represented the city of Stockholm with the region’s midnight sun above her head and waters at her feet.
Stockholm is depicted at the center of the earth with the western world on one side and the eastern world on the other. You could see how 1920s Swedes idealized America complete with skyscrapers, the Statue of Liberty, the Stars and Stripes, Native Americans and the White Star Line:
The weather had improved dramatically from the blustery conditions yesterday so I took the opportunity to explore more of the city. Many Stockholmers evidently had the same idea and were out walking, ice skating and enjoying their traditional Fika.
Hiking back toward Gamla Stan, I passed Sweden’s Parliament building, the Riksdag, guarded by Egyptian lions. Traditionally-neutral Sweden is a member of the EU but chose against using the Euro. However, I probably won’t touch any Swedish kronor since this is basically a cashless society. You use your card everywhere, even for a coffee.
……….

Most Italians head to the stunning seaside for their summer vacations, but we were looking to add not shed layers, so we headed north to the land of cinnamon buns and paternity leave. Hej, Sweden!
In the weeks leading up to our trip, it appeared we might not get the cool breezes and leg-shaving respite that were so desired. Perhaps due to that #FakeNews climate change conspiracy, Sweden had its hottest July in at least 260 years. Wildfires were raging, stores sold out of fans (we had multiple Stockholmers tell us of the Great Fan Sell Out of 2018), and farmers struggled to feed their animals.
This seems especially unfair to people like the Swedes who are notoriously eco-conscious. Our Airbnb hosts said the country actually ran out of trash at one point and had to purchase foreign rubbish to continue heating homes.
Then, the day after we arrived, we were grateful to be shivering in a downpour and inhaling that fresh Nordic air of 65–75 F (18–24 C) throughout the week. So, putting aside worries about our planet for a moment, here are a few tips from our week-long Swedish vacay, should you pop over there one day or merely wish to have some mild distraction until your toothbrush vibrates at the two-minute mark.
Watch Welcome to Sweden, an unjustly cancelled TV series that features cross-cultural misunderstandings, family drama, expat shenanigans, and transatlantic love — gee, I wonder why we connected with it. Bonus: guest appearances by Amy Poehler, Aubrey Plaza and Will Ferrell.
On this trip, four years after watching the series and one day after re-watching it, we see one of the actors get off at our bus stop in Stockholm. I am starstruck and briefly consider shouting, “Birger! Welcome to Sweden!” But I can only squeeze Alberto’s arm and breathlessly say, “Oh my god, guarda, guarda,” and then Alberto’s eyes bulge, too. I turn into a paparazzo and take pictures of him as he walks away. Thank you, Claes Månsson, for being a literal one in a million Stockholm encounter.
I did some more digging after we got home and found that Swedish fathers indeed have the highest use of parental leave in the world and that in 1974 Sweden became “the first welfare democracy to introduce paid parental leave (föräldraledighet) to both parents. This law signals that fathers should take greater responsibility in caring for their young children, that children possess the right to have access to both their parents, and that fathers should facilitate mothers’ return to and involvement in paid work after having a child.” Read this Slate article to swoon (and bemoan your own country) some more: Americans Love Seeing Swedish Dads Out With Their Kids (ICYMI blog post: Motherhood from Italy to Taiwan
We stayed in an impeccably styled and clean Airbnb just south of the city center in Gamla Enskede and about a 10 minute walk to the subway. It’s located in a residential area across the street from a park and has some nice restaurants nearby with no English menus — which means you’re unlikely to be in a tourist trap but the very kind server will have to read everything off to you lest you spend 15 minutes in Google Translate before deciding you actually don’t want to eat there at all. #Awkward
We walked or took public transportation (subway, tram, bus, boat) everywhere. Public transit was very clean, reliable and convenient; a week pass is about 30 euros. It would have been cheaper and more ambitious of us to rent bikes, as recommended by many people, but the combination of rain, laziness and cinnamon buns was a deterrent.
We did three free Stockholm walking tours — Stockholm City, Gamla Stan (Old Town) and Stockholm Subway Art, and they were a great way to get acquainted with the city as well as learn more about Swedish history and culture. Tips are encouraged (in any currency) at the end of the tour.
Pro tip: Don’t withdraw any cash in the local Swedish Krona (SEK). Stockholm is on its way to going cash-free and some places will only accept cards anyway.
As mentioned above, Stockholm’s subway system is an art gallery in itself. You can go with a tour group (here’s the offical SL tour; we did a different one) to see a few of the hot spot stations and get a brief explanation, or you can go admire them on your own. Our tour guide suggested the following stations but 90+ of them have artwork, so you’re bound to run into a few even accidentally:
Blue line
Green line
Red line
Our guide said the art was commissioned as a way to lure apprehensive Swedes underground (post World War II) to use this new, potentially dangerous form of transportation. I later read on several sites that this underground exhibition was the result of a political and cultural movement in the late 1950s to make art more accessible to your average citizen and not just the Swedish elite. The official SL site notes the following motivations: beauty, safety, station identity/navigation, and vandalism reduction. Whatever the reasoning for bringing more art into the world…
It’s the same old story: a guy wanted to prove he had bigger balls than another guy — and then his hastily constructed warship sank on its maiden voyage; King Gustav just had to wave his mast in the air. Now, you and I can go gape at a massive 17th century ship that was underwater for 333 years.
Pro tip: Dress in layers. It seems sub-zero temps are necessary to preserve the artifact.
This was an interesting, well-designed photography museum and a perfect place to spend a rainy afternoon. It also has a nice cafe/restaurant upstairs with a great view of the city.
Since this royal castle from the 1600s is the king and queen’s permanent residence, they don’t grant you full access, making the interior visit shorter than expected, but it’s beautiful and the palace gardens and Chinese Pavilion are a peaceful place to amble around or have a picnic.
It was free, there were very few tourists, and the woman who founded it was doing things that a woman of her time was not supposed to do, because it interfered with duties like embroidery and shutting up. So obviously, I liked it. Or, as the museum put it, “Among women during the 1890s, Wilhelmina was quite alone in her pursuits, and she walked a fine line of what was considered appropriate for a woman of her station to devote her time to.” Cheers, Wilhelmina von Hallwyl.
Famous for being the venue of the Nobel Prize banquet plus for its grand ceremonial halls and artwork (the gold mosaic room was my favorite), the City Hall offers tours (mandatory) in several languages. It’s a popular place to get married and has a six-month waiting list; supposedly Swedes can choose between the short (two-minute) or long (four-minute) ceremony.
I was hoping to learn more about Nordic culture and history but the exhibits failed to engage us (or maybe we were coming down from a sugar high). Like, I couldn’t look at one more antique Swedish chair; I have been to IKEA five times this year already. It was interesting to learn about the Sami in Sweden, an indigenous people who have lived in the Arctic region for thousands of years.
It was our last day in Stockholm and we had limited time and attention spans left, but it’s a free museum so we popped in for an hour (only enough time to walk through the Vikings exhibit and a few others) and then ran to get one last cinnamon roll before the airport bus left.
If you’re an indoor cat who doesn’t like bugs or being wet, below are some “outdoorsy” activities we suggest. If you’re into fishing, camping, swimming, deep hiking or kayaking, we are useless to you. But, Sweden is not! They have the Right of Public Access (‘Allemansrätt’) which means you have “the right to walk, cycle, ride, ski and camp on any land with the exception of private gardens, near a dwelling house or land under cultivation.”
The medieval city center where Stockholm was founded in 1252 might be annoyingly crammed with tourists in the summer, but it’s a picturesque area to roam about.
This is a World Heritage Site cemetery where the designers wanted nature — majestic trees and rolling hills — to shine rather than the headstones. Going back to that theme of equality, it’s “impossible” to have giant burial monuments, like you’d see in Italy, for example. The legendary actress Greta Garbo is buried here; her tombstone is modest, but they gave her quite a respectful perimeter, not laying anyone to rest nearby.
Pro tip: There’s a free audio guide via your phone, so you don’t need to pay for a tour if you’re interested in its history.
Vaxholm is an archipelago town you can reach via boat from Stockholm — a nice, leisurely water ride that’s an attraction in itself. There’s the Vaxholm Castle/Fortress and the nearby Bogesunds Castle, but we didn’t tour either of them. It had quite a sleepy vibe when we were there, and we didn’t do anything except have a nice lunch at the waterfront Boulangerie Bageri & Café. The archipelago is made up of 30,000 islands, so have your pick.
This Stockholm city island is full of museums and sights, but it also has great nature areas and paths. Have a cinnamon bun and coffee on Helin’s terrace overlooking the water and then take a walk on the path leading east. Go to the garden behind Rosendal Palace and you might see dogs herding sheep along the water below. Adorbs.
Wear good shoes, and bring a bottle of wine and some snacks to watch the sunset on this rocky hilltop overlooking the water and city.
Another popular lookout point/path for your 360 photos, one Stockholm resident confirmed Monteliusvägen was one of his go-to date wooing spots.
A tranquil place for a stroll where you can peer at ducks and kayakers, near the end of this path you can grab a bite or drink at Solstugan, which has a nice deck with a view of the sea.
Look, I loved my time with you, Sweden, but I’m coming from THE Land of Food, and I never expected for you to delight me as much as the Italians do with their delicacies, so I’m not mad at you or anything. You did great with what you had and what I could stumble upon as a clueless tourist. Also, it’s my fault I don’t like salmon or herring. Phew, glad we got that out of the way.
That being said, here are a few traditional Swedish foods and places that did delight us. Plus, Swedish bars and restaurants don’t make you buy water like they do in Italy — yay for free, delicious tap water!
They say the Swedes invented cinnamon buns, so we thought it culturally sensitive that we eat 1–2 per day. They are a bit less dense and creamy than the ones in the U.S., no globs of frosting on top, and typically also contain cardamom in the dough. Our favorite buns were at Grand Cafe on the water in Blasieholmen and Café Kronan in Gamla Stan, but we weren’t disappointed with any of the other buns, except at a place a British tour guide recommended. Did Brexit bust your sense of taste too, bro?
We accompanied most of these buns with a cup of Swedish coffee, which was almost always delicious. Did you know Swedes are the second biggest coffee drinkers after the Finns?! We definitely perfected the art of the Swedish fika, a mandatory (for good life balance) coffee break accompanied by sweets like kanelbulle. Over the dark winter days when Nordic folk get so little light or warmth, one can easily understand why such a cozy, caffeinated tradition exists.
Kryp In Restaurant Prästgatan 17 (Gamla Stan)
Any loyal IKEA shopper knows that Swedish meatballs are a thing, but I don’t think I’ve ever actually eaten them there. In Stockholm, I only ate them once, and they were paired with the traditional lingonberries and mashed potatoes. My mom’s meatballs are better (she’s Italian American after all), but I was satisfied nevertheless.
“What?! Santa’s little helper?!” I exclaimed when Alberto said he was ordering the reindeer. “Yeah, he helps you survive the Nordic winter!”
I can’t remember the name (Swedish is hard, y’all), but we were also served a delicious “delicacy bread” prior to the meal, that included ingredients like potato, cardamom and syrup.
So, this first lunch was probably the most traditional, and after that, we felt some freedom to not eat “authentically Swedish” for the rest of the trip, aside from the daily buns of course.
We stumbled upon this place in the midst of a chilly rain shower and frantic Google Map search for dining options. The friendly server guided us into a cozy cave-like corner lit by candles and deep red walls. I later read in our host’s Lonely Planet Pocket Stockholm guidebook that it was a recommended spot. Score!
Our host also recommended Meatballs for the People as the best place in town for this traditional dish, but we couldn’t get a table. Or, if you don’t want to bother at all with being “authentic,” I present the following: “Swedish meatballs are actually based on a recipe King Charles XII brought home from Turkey in the early 18th century.”
Hej hej + tack very much, Sweden!

Stockholm, the vibrant capital of Sweden, is a city that offers more than just stunning architecture and picturesque waterfronts. For the food enthusiast, Stockholm is a haven of culinary delights waiting to be discovered. A culinary journey as varied as its seasons awaits you in Stockholm, where you can find everything from modern, inventive food to centuries-old, traditional meals.
Stockholm’s weather plays a significant role in shaping its culinary landscape. The city experiences four distinct seasons, each offering a unique bounty of ingredients that inspire chefs and home cooks alike.
Spring (Vår)
As winter recedes, Stockholm awakens with a burst of fresh flavors. Spring brings a sense of renewal, reflected in the dishes that grace tables across the city. Look for dishes featuring the tender, young shoots of asparagus, the first harvests of flavorful wild garlic, and the delicate sweetness of freshly sprouted peas. In restaurants and homes, you might find classics like ‘Vårkänslor’ (Spring Feelings), a dish celebrating the season with new potatoes, pickled herring, and sour cream.
Summer (Sommar)
Stockholm summers are a time of abundance, with long days that seem to stretch endlessly into twilight. This season brings a bounty of berries — lingonberries, blueberries, and the coveted wild strawberries. These berries find their way into jams, desserts, and savory dishes alike. Seafood shines in the summer, with crayfish parties (kräftskiva) a beloved tradition. Imagine tables filled with boiled crayfish, Västerbotten cheese pie, and crisp, fresh salads.
Autumn (Höst)
As the leaves turn golden and the air becomes crisp, Stockholm’s forests offer a treasure trove of mushrooms and game. Chanterelles, porcini, and the elusive ‘black gold’ of truffles make their way into hearty stews and creamy sauces. Autumn also marks the beginning of the apple and pear season, with orchards heavy with fruit. Indulge in warm apple pie topped with vanilla sauce or explore the savory side with pork dishes accompanied by tart apple compote.
Winter (Vinter)
Winter transforms Stockholm into a winter wonderland, with snow-covered streets and a cozy atmosphere. It’s a time for hearty, warming meals that fortify against the cold. Classic dishes like ‘Ärtsoppa med Pannkakor’ (Pea Soup with Pancakes) are a comforting staple, especially on Thursdays, a tradition dating back to the 15th century. Rich, meaty stews like ‘Köttbullar’ (Swedish meatballs) served with lingonberry sauce evoke cozy evenings by the fire.
While exploring Stockholm’s culinary landscape, one encounters a blend of tradition and innovation. The city has a deep-rooted respect for its culinary heritage, evident in dishes that have stood the test of time. Yet, Stockholm’s chefs are also at the forefront of culinary innovation, constantly pushing boundaries while maintaining a focus on local, seasonal ingredients.
Smörgåsbord: A quintessential Swedish dining experience, featuring a vast array of dishes from pickled herring to cured meats, cheeses, and savory pies.
Gravlax: This cured salmon dish, typically served with dill and mustard sauce, is a celebration of the city’s abundant seafood.
Surströmming: For the adventurous, this fermented herring is a pungent delicacy best experienced outdoors due to its potent aroma.
New Nordic Cuisine: Inspired by the principles of using local, sustainable ingredients, this movement has put Stockholm on the global culinary map. Restaurants like the renowned “Fäviken” and “Oaxen Krog” epitomize this ethos.
Foraging Culture: With access to pristine forests and coastline, foraging plays a significant role in Stockholm’s cuisine. Chefs and home cooks alike venture into the wild to gather ingredients like wild herbs, berries, and mushrooms, adding a fresh, earthy dimension to their dishes.
Exploring Stockholm’s cuisine goes beyond just tasting the food. It’s about immersing oneself in the culture that surrounds it. Visit local markets, such as Östermalms Saluhall or Söderhallarna, where vendors proudly display their fresh produce, meats, cheeses, and seafood. Engage with locals to learn about family recipes passed down through generations, or join in seasonal celebrations like Midsummer, where traditional foods are central to the festivities.
No exploration of Stockholm’s culture would be complete without experiencing ‘fika’. More than just a coffee break, fika is a cherished tradition of pausing, savoring a hot beverage (usually coffee or tea), and enjoying a sweet treat. Indulge in cinnamon buns (kanelbullar), cardamom-scented cakes, or almond tarts as you join Stockholmers in this daily ritual of relaxation and socializing.
In conclusion, Stockholm’s culinary scene is a tapestry woven with the threads of tradition, innovation, and the rich bounty of its seasons. Whether you’re savoring the tangy sweetness of lingonberries in summer or warming up with a steaming bowl of pea soup in winter, every bite tells a story of this beautiful city. So, pack your curiosity and appetite, and embark on a culinary journey through Stockholm — you’ll discover a world of flavors waiting to be explored.

On Stairs, Frescoes, and the Art of Rewriting
If you ever find yourself wandering the streets of Stockholm, do what I did — look up.
On a recent visit, I found myself standing before the stern, red-bricked silhouette of Stockholm’s City Hall. From the outside, it’s all weight and authority, but step inside and you’ll discover a world of meticulous design and unexpected artistry.
The Architect’s Obsession — Stairs Fit for a Queen
The story goes that Ragnar Östberg, the mastermind behind City Hall, was obsessed with getting every detail right. Not just the grand arches or the towering spire, but even the stairs.
He wanted the queen to descend them with absolute grace during the Nobel banquet.
So what did he do?
He had his wife walk up and down different prototypes of the staircase, again and again, until she was utterly sick of it.
All so that, on that one night, the queen (and every guest after her) would glide, not stumble.

Stockholm doesn’t try to compete with Europe’s biggest tech hubs on volume or visibility. It doesn’t need to. Underneath the surface, the city has built one of the continent’s most efficient and credible early-stage ecosystems, and one that’s already outperforming on density, deal quality, and network speed. But while early-stage momentum is real, there’s a catch: scale is harder. And the late-stage gap is starting to show.
Start with the fundamentals. Stockholm has around 2,500 startups. That may not sound impressive next to London’s 25,000 or Berlin’s 6,000, but raw numbers miss the point. With just 2.5 million people, Stockholm has one of the highest startup densities in Europe. Only London and Amsterdam are higher per capita. The city is tied with Berlin and well ahead of Paris, Zurich, Munich, and Madrid. This isn’t an ecosystem chasing scale for its own sake, but one that is focused on concentration, repeatability, and results. It also produces some of the most successful start-ups, as it ranks #2 in unicorns per capita in Europe (only behind Estonia)
It helps that the basics are sorted. Sweden has one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the EU at 20.6%. R&D incentives are real. The visa process, while imperfect, is smoother than in many neighboring countries. Founders can incorporate, hire, and launch without running into structural friction. That’s not true everywhere in Europe.
But regulation is only part of the story. What really makes Stockholm work is the network. The ecosystem is compact and layered. Founders, angels, VCs, private organizations (like Nordic Angels) and public-sector players operate in close proximity, quite literally. Relationships are short-range and high-frequency. Two intros are usually enough to reach anyone. It speeds everything up: hiring, fundraising, product feedback and decision-making.
Especially the angel community is functioning well. According to the recent Nordic Angels & BCG report I co-authored, Stockholm leads the region in both deal activity and investor depth. Nearly 600 active angels operate in the city, and many of them repeat founders or early operators from companies like Klarna, Spotify, and iZettle. That experience compounds. New teams benefit from old playbooks. Capital comes with context.
VC behavior reflects the broader market shift. Global dry powder is high, but deployment is cautious and conviction-driven. That suits Stockholm. The companies being built here tend to be leaner, more international, and capital-efficient. Local funds like Creandum, EQT Ventures, and Northzone are still writing early checks. And when the metrics are strong, international investors are showing up (like Accel, Sequioa, et. al.). The pipeline is healthy. The bar is high.
But not everything is working.
The late-stage environment hasn’t kept up. Series B and C rounds are regularly led by foreign investors (e.g., recently for Legora), often requiring founders to relocate teams, shift strategy, or change how they operate. When the capital isn’t local, neither is the upside. Value leaks. Talent disperses. Ecosystem effects weaken. Some of Stockholm’s most promising startups are scaling in other geographies. Not by choice, but by necessity. The ecosystem in Stockholm hasn’t quite caught up to this yet.
Capital is one challenge: Unlike in some neighboring countries, Sweden doesn’t have a strong state-backed co-investment model at the Series B and C level (but Sweden does have them in earlier stages). There’s no domestic equivalent to Finland’s Tesi or Denmark’s Vækstfonden. Those institutions actively anchor larger rounds and keep value creation local.
Senior talent is another challenge. While the city has no shortage of strong engineers and early hires, there’s a gap in commercial leadership. Experienced sales, product, and executive operators are in short supply and current stock option tax rules don’t help on retention either (the stock option tax rules are beneficial for early-stage startups, but less so for later stages). It’s workable, but it’s not competitive with ecosystems like London or Tallinn.
Diversity is still lagging. Female and underrepresented founders raise a small fraction of total capital (all-women teams represented 6.1% of all funding rounds in the Nordics in 2022 and 2023, but received only 1.2% of the total capital). It’s not unique to Stockholm, but it’s persistent. Progress is being made, but slowly. It’s an area where the city could and should lead but hasn’t yet. Diversity isn’t just social, it’s strategic. Stockholm risks missing out on market upside without more inclusive capital flows and accessing the full breadth of ideas.
And cost of living is creeping up. For junior hires, early-stage teams, or international founders trying to get started, Stockholm is no longer cheap. It hasn’t hit London levels, but it’s moving in that direction, and that friction is already starting to show.
Still, the early-stage engine is real. Stockholm’s ecosystem isn’t built on noise. It’s built on high-quality inputs: credible talent, disciplined capital, and a regulatory environment that mostly gets out of the way. Founders here are building with focus, and investors are backing with precision. That’s rare in any cycle, and especially in this one.
Stockholm’s AI startup scene is also starting to show depth. Early movers like Sana didn’t just secure funding and traction, but they helped define what AI-native startups can look like in B2B and infrastructure-heavy verticals. More importantly, they trained talent, validated use cases, and proved that it’s possible to build globally relevant AI companies out of Sweden. That groundwork is now fueling a second wave of startups, with emerging players like Legora (legal AI), Lovable (AI-powered app development platform), and others are coming to market with sharp focus and strong teams. The ecosystem’s early bets are compounding. What started with a few AI-first companies is evolving into a broader, more durable platform for applied AI innovation. Stockholm may not be chasing scale at any cost, but in AI, it’s starting to set the pace.
For investors, especially at the growth stage, this is a signal. Stockholm’s early-stage pipeline is functioning. But the gap in late-stage capital creates an opening. Companies that are raising follow-ons are often forced to look outside. That introduces pressure on geography, on strategy, and on exit dynamics. For funds willing to lean in earlier, build local relationships, and back high-quality teams before they cross borders, Stockholm is exactly where to be looking. For funds willing to underwrite scale on local terms, Stockholm might offer an arbitrage in talent, timing, and trust.
What’s missing isn’t ambition or ideas to create the next unicorns, but some infrastructure. And unless more of it develops, Stockholm risks exporting the very companies it helped create.

In the north part of Europe, surrounded by hills, endless forests, and a never-ending coastline lies the city of Stockholm, capital of Scandinavia. The whole of Scandinavia agreed on that name by the way. Technically we didn’t ask Norway, Finland and Denmark if it’s okay that we’re the capital, but we’re like 99% sure they’re okay with it.
I have lived here all my life. I love it here. It’s like being in San Francisco but with fewer unicorns and less sun. Since I'm recruiting people from all over the world and convincing them to move here I get a lot of questions about life here:
“Should I work there?”
“Can I fly to London over the day?”
“Will ABBA ever reunite?”
So here is my experience. I hope I can give an authentic look into what our cold, dark corner of the world has to offer.
My day begins when I wake up in my apartment on Kungshomen. Kungsholmen is one of the three main islands in Stockholm. From there I stroll along the water to work in the city center. It takes about 25 minutes. Unfortunately, the housing market here is a bit of a disaster, so unless you enjoy changing which apartment you sublet every month or have $350k to buy your own place you are stuck taking the bus or a train into the city center like a regular peasant.
Speaking of water, Stockholm is surrounded by it. Anywhere you go you will see water. The water is supposedly clean enough to drink. I have not tried it myself since I value my life, but there are YouTube videos of people doing it.
Nobody takes the car. Thanks to some of highest taxes in the world, cars are expensive, and besides, people here believe that if you drive to work you hate the environment and wish all animals a slow and painful death. Biking to work is a good choice. There are biking lanes everywhere. Apart from saving the planet and giving you daily exercise it also signals that you live inside of the city. Preferably get a colorful bike to maximize the attention as you ride down the city streets.
Your most important decision of the morning is where you stop to buy your café latte. I don’t drink it myself since I do paleo, but the way I understand it, it’s coffee flavored hot milk. If you work at a startup you can buy coffee at any place: both Il Café and Johan & Nyström are acceptable choices.
Our office is based in an area called city center. It’s named so because the people naming it were officially out of ideas. Nearby is the cultural house which was built as a tribute to Soviet communism.
I work out of a startup hub called “SUP46”. SUP is Swedish for “drink excessive amounts of alcohol” and 46 is the country code of Sweden. So the name literally translates to “get drunk in Sweden”. Something many people have taken to heart.
SUP46 is not just an office but also a community since it has an “event space”. During evenings, there is often free food and beer in the event space. Sometimes someone is talking in a microphone and showing powerpoint slides while you eat which can be distracting. But I’m sure people are working on fixing that.
There are a few other startup hubs, the most prominent being THINGS, which as the name implies, gives you free things.
Most people, yours truly included, work in an open office space. Your choice of clothes is important since people will be seeing you walking back and forth to the coffee machine. If you are male you should probably grow a beard.
Choice of laptop also says a lot about you.
Other companies at SUP46 are Fishbrain, which based on the name must be working on creating sentient fish and Sparta which I believe are organizing a live event where they re-enact Sparta the movie.
The most famous company in Stockholm is called Spotify. They play music and collect your personal data. It is also Europe’s most famous startup. If your CV contains the word Spotify it means you can get a job at any company at any level in Europe because you are now an expert in “digital”. There is also a company called Mojang. Nobody knows if it is an actual startup or if it’s just one guy that created a game called Minecraft and sold it to Microsoft for $2.5bn or a practical joke played by the guys behind King. Either way, we’re counting it as a unicorn.
Apart from Spotify and Mojang there are five other unicorns: Mysql, Skype, King.com, Klarna and Truecaller. Technically you could also count Russian auction site Avito.ru which was founded by two Swedes in Moscow. Before starting Avito the founders had started and sold the largest European auction site Tradera to Ebay. As part of the transaction the nice people at Ebay said “look guys, you are on your own now but don’t go start a new company or our lawyers will hunt you down” and they were like “oh but COME ON, we have to do SOMETHING, you guys are not in Russia so at least let us start a company there?”. Ebay went “lol, enjoy Soviet Russia you commies” and the rest is history. It is incidentally also the reason why Ebay’s employment agreements have changed the term “not start a competitor anywhere in the world except Russia” to “ not start a competitor anywhere in the known universe”.
The fact that Stockholm has seven unicorns while London, a city with ten times the population, only has twice the number of unicorns is basically Swedish socialism’s subtle way of giving the middle finger to the British labour party. Some people argue that Sweden has unicorns despite being socialistic not thanks to it, but I digress.
Stockholm is a special place. In the summer we swim in the warm water, in the winter we ice skate on it. We remain a thorn in the side of free market theorists by producing the highest number of unicorns per capita after San Francisco despite offering free schools and universal free healthcare.
We also love everything US and have one the biggest country subreddits to prove it. The most upvoted post last year was a picture of an Ukranian literature professor who looks like Swedish football hero Zlatan Ibrahimovich.
If you want to experience it for yourself several companies are hiring, including myself, that help with relocation. Or as ABBA said:
“If you change your mind, I’m the first in lineHoney I’m still freeTake a chance on me”
If you already work here, stop wasting your time reading this and do something productive like paying more taxes.
(Big thanks to the guys over at Padlet.com for inspiring me to write this. If you decide to work in SF you should probably work for them).

“Stockholmers call their city ‘beauty on water’. But despite the well-preserved historic core, Stockholm is no museum piece: it’s modern, dynamic and ever-evolving.” (Lonely Planet)
14 islands and 57 bridges. But what should I visit?
Before describing my 48-hour experience, let me introduce you to the history of this marvellous city by the hand of localhistories.org:
The great city of Stockholm began in the 13th century. At that time trade and commerce were increasing across Europe and many new towns were founded. In 1252 the regent of Sweden, Birger Jarl founded Stockholm. The new town grew rapidly. In 1289 it was described as the largest place in Sweden, although it would seem very small to us. By 1500 Stockholm was a flourishing town of about 6,000 people.
Then in 1520 came the Stockholm Bloodbath. The king of Denmark invaded Sweden in 1519. In 1520 he captured Stockholm and he had more than 80 Swedish nobles executed for heresy. However the Swede Gustav Vasa recaptured Stockholm in 1523.
During the 17th century Sweden was a great power in Europe. Stockholm grew rapidly and by the end of the century it had a population of around 50,000. Riddarhuset, The House of Nobility was built between 1641 and 1674.
However in 1710–1711 there was an outbreak of plague in Stockholm which killed many people. Yet Stockholm recovered and it flourished during the 18th century. Tullgarn Palace was built about 1720. The Royal Palace opened in 1754. The Obelisk was erected in 1799. Also in 1799 the statue of King Gustav III was sculpted.
In the late 19th century Sweden was transformed from an agricultural society to an industrial one. In 1850 Stockholm had a population of 93,000 and it continued to rise rapidly. By the beginning of the 20th century it had reached 300,000.
However in the mid 19th century Stockholm was an unhealthy place. There were no sewers or piped water supply. But all that changed. Stockholm gained gas light in 1853. In the 1860s a piped water supply was created. The National Museum was built in 1866. Stockholm Central Railway Station was built in 1871. Horse drawn trams began running in Stockholm in 1877. The first electric trams ran in 1901. Meanwhile Stockholm University was founded in 1877. The Swedish Army Museum opened in 1879. Skansen open air museum opened in 1891. The Biological Museum opened in 1893. Stockholm Music Museum was founded in 1899.
During the 20th century Stockholm continued to flourish. The Postal Museum opened in 1906 and the Nordic Museum was built in 1907. The Museum of National Antiquities opened in 1943. Meanwhile Parliament House was built in 1905 and City Hall was built in 1923. Stockholm escaped damage by bombing in the Second World War but in the mid 20th century a program began to modernise the city. Many old homes in Stockholm were demolished and replaced by new ones.
Today tourism is an important industry in Stockholm. The Museum of Dance opened in 1953. The Medieval Museum opened in 1986. A ship called The Vasa sank in 1628 but it was recovered in 1961 and is now on display in a museum. Today the population of Stockholm is 942,000.”

2. Checked-in at the budget Hotel Comfort Hotel Xpress Stockholm Central
3. Walked around Gamla Stan and had Swedish meatballs for dinner at Drottninggatan Street´s Pickwick Restaurang & Pub.
We did the Maths and booked the Stockholm Pass which included the main attractions we wanted to visit (1 Day Adult Pass: SEK 580.50)
There’s no better way to see the sights of Stockholm than with a free Hop On Hop Off bus, which we used to get us to the following places we chose to visit on Saturday taking advantage of the Stockholm Pass.
A way to quickly explore the three islands that compose the city center.
One of the biggest cultural treasures in Sweden — the warship Vasa that sank in 1628 on its maiden voyage from Stockholm.
Nordiska Museet (idea for next time)
Founded in 1891, Skansen is the world’s first open-air museum. Located on the island of Djurgården and close to the Vasa museum, Skansen offers a fascinating look into historical Swedish life. Recreates the life of the 19th century.
The palace dates back to the 18th century and is one of the most interesting historic buildings in Stockholm. The biggest royal palace in the world with 600 rooms. Changing of the guards take place daily at noon.
Get familiarised with the stunning scenery of Stockholm’s archipelago on a guided 3 hour boat tour. Experience the city from the water, learn about the history and be inspired by the beauty of Stockholm’s natural landscape.
Lovely cafes, restaurants, souvenir and antique shops.
Aifur Krog & Bar
We said yes to the Viking dining experience at this underground traditional live music restaurant. Candle-light warm atmosphere, big shared tables and exquisite Swedish specialities: mussels in a creamy sauce, baked salmon and venison steaks with veggies and potatoes.
Having traditional “Fika”, a Swedish coffee-break with fresh baked cakes and pastries at Vetekatten.
Sunday morning Market at Hötorget (Haymarket Square): fresh fruits and vegetables, new and second hand crafts and clothes.
Yes, again to see the rest of the city and learn some more of its history.
“Alfred Bernhard Nobel
21 October 1833
Stockholm, Sweden–Norway
Died 10 December 1896 (aged was a Swedish chemist, engineer, inventor, businessman, and philanthropist.
“Known for inventing dynamite, Nobel also owned Bofors, which he had redirected from its previous role as primarily an iron and steel producer to a major manufacturer of cannon and other armaments. Nobel held 355 different patents, dynamite being the most famous. After reading a premature obituary which condemned him for profiting from the sales of arms, he bequeathed his fortune to institute the Nobel Prizes.”
Estimates of ABBA’s total record sales are at least 400 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time.
Time to take off back home…

“Sweden is a country that has taken its culture and turned it into a brand.” – Bjorn Ulvaeus
I am exchange student with Geography background and I had always been fascinated by the unique culture and landscapes of Sweden. In January 2011, I arrived in Stockholm to begin a six-month adventure that would take me through the coldest winter days and the longest nights I had ever experienced.
At first, the darkness and the cold were a shock to my system. Coming from a tropical climate, the idea of walking to class in -20°C temperatures was daunting. But as I settled into my routine and began to explore the city, I found myself falling in love with the Swedish way of life.
One of the things that struck me the most about Swedish culture was the emphasis on sustainability and environmental stewardship. From the public transportation system to the recycling system in supermarkets, it was clear that sustainability was a top priority amongst the Swedes. As a Geography student, this was particularly inspiring, and I found myself incorporating these principles into my own daily life.
Another aspect of Swedish culture that I appreciated was the emphasis on work-life balance. Swedes take their time off seriously, and it’s not uncommon to see people taking a midday fika (coffee break) or leaving work early to spend time with family and friends. This was a refreshing change of pace from the workaholic culture that I was used to, and it allowed me to prioritize my own well-being and mental health.
Of course, as an exchange student, I also had my fair share of funny and memorable experiences. One of the highlights was celebrating Christmas with my Swedish host family, who introduced me to traditional Swedish delicacies like julbord (Christmas buffet) and glögg (mulled wine). I also had the opportunity to explore the city’s many museums, parks, and cafes, and to meet other exchange students from all over the world.
My six months in Stockholm were a transformative experience that allowed me to immerse myself in a unique culture and to learn from the people and landscapes of Sweden. From the coldest winter days to the warmest moments of connection, I will always cherish the memories and insights that I gained during my time here.

Sweden is famous for well-designed furniture, beautiful women and functional socialism. A sub-scale barren country which has somehow produced iconic global businesses like IKEA and H&M. As a tourist destination, I wasn’t sure what to expect, but assumed the place would be easy on the eye.
In early February, the sky is glum and the hours of daylight reduced, but the prettiness of Stockholm remains striking. It was cold, but not intolerable, hovering between -2 and 2 degrees Celsius. The thing to do in Stockholm in winter is drink coffee (fika in Swedish). The locals spend their days lazing in the warm, well designed Espresso House cafes. Think Starbucks with better furniture, a more nuanced color scheme and better coffee. You can’t escape them. “Why are there so many Espresso House cafes, is it a Swedish brand?” I asked the teenager behind the counter. “Yes, there are six of them on this street I think. Some Germans bought the company, and they are expanding into other Scandinavian countries, Germany and the Netherlands, it’s like another war plan” he responded, in a mocking German accent. Funny, but unlikely to be awarded Employee of the Month by his new paymasters.
If you go to Stockholm expecting to see wall-to-wall knock-out barely dressed Shield Maidens, you’ll be disappointed. Stockholm is a very multi-cultural place, filled with practically dressed typically dark haired women. The stereotypical well-tanned blue eyed, blonde, knee-buckling knock-out exists, but they are uncommon.
Stockholm is brimming with museums and galleries, exploring everything from Vikings and Sami culture to design and human rights. A highlight is the Vasa Museum in Galärvarvsvägen, visited by 1.4 million people each year. The Museum was purpose built around the Vasa, a 69 metre-long 17th century wooden ship. A 1,200 tonne war machine, with 64 cannons over two levels, ten sails and 120 tonnes of ballast. A brutal expression of Sweden’s desire to conquer new territories. “F&$k me” I muttered too loudly when I walked into the cavernous museum and saw the ship for the first time. An immense killing machine covered with hundreds of wooden sculptures. “How the hell did they build this back then?” I was thinking as I waited for my free guided tour to start.
The awe in which I held the 17th century ship builders was quickly diminished. The Vasa was a dud. The three year effort to build the ultimate war machine led to a twenty minute maiden voyage of 1.3km before it toppled in a light breeze. A colossal, embarrassing and undoubtedly expensive failure for the King.
The inquest following the sinking, brought to light that many people knew the ship was a dud, but it sailed anyway. The most shocking anecdote involved the captain overlooking the construction ordering thirty men to run back and forth along the deck in front of the Vice Admiral, when the ship was still in the port. The terrified Vice Admiral called a halt to the demonstration, as he thought the ship was going to sink. The ship was top heavy, badly proportioned and sat too high out of the water. Yet, no-one wanted to tell the King that the years of hard work and treasure had all gone to waste. Despite the loss of thirty lives, no-one was punished. The Dutch ship-builder had died during construction, and his widow who completed the project had already been paid. The King just wanted to forget about the debacle.
Swedish food is as basic as the Vasa is impressive. Meatballs and potatoes, plus a bit of fish and a few miniature prawns. Hearty food. Good for plundering, less so for the sedate modern lifestyle. Given the frigid winter and heavy diet, you’d expect the Swedes to be fatter.
The downside to travelling in Sweden is that it is frighteningly expensive. The Arlanda Express, a twenty minute train from the airport to the centre costs US$30. Take the cheaper forty minute bus ride with Flygbussarna and you are still shelling out US$13. Getting a basic meal below US$15 is tough, unless you want to eat hamburgers. I got charged US$3 for a glass of tap water when I ordered a steak.
But don’t let the jarring prices deter you. Stockholm is a must-see destination, even during the winter months.

by Sam Smith — Kiss House
Few things are cooler than tremendously hip Stockholm. Design centre and self-proclaimed capital of Scandinavia.
If cities were boyfriends (or girlfriends for that matter) then Stockholm is a keeper; successful, stylish, intelligent, fun yet super considerate. Marriage material for sure.
I recently spent the weekend here with my husband Ben and discovered that zipping about the city on two wheels like a local is the only way to get about. But I don’t mean on bicycles, I’m talking scooters, electric scooters.
Let’s be clear, we are both well into our 40’s but these are not for kids. Strictly over 18s only (ha!). Our kids had their own “mini-break” to Grandma’s house (happy face).
It is without a doubt the most fun I’ve had since turning adult and simply the BEST way to get the most out of a place. Admittedly, I need to work on my lefts and rights and remember that if you’re heading towards oncoming traffic, a bus is beeping at you and your husband is shouting at you, you’re probably on the wrong side of the road, but it was a great experience and I implore anyone to try it.
You may have seen pay as you go scooters popping up in various European cities. They first appeared in the US but Sweden is an early adopter and you can now find them in most Swedish cities. Never have London’s Boris (Santander) bikes seemed so dull. These are dockless so there’s no hunting around to locate / park, you literally jump on and off. A handy app finds them for you and signs you in and out with a simple scan.
Of course, it works well in Stockholm, with their spacious roads, pavements and seriously impressive route of cycle paths. Whizzing around at 20 kph, you see way more than you would on foot without missing a thing. There’s so much to love here. Where the old meets the new (and some interesting 70’s structures in between). There’s a lot of building work going on. The place is buzzing.
Effortless. Like it comes easy to them. But a city’s worth of cycle lanes takes a hell of a lot of planning and foresight. If we had the same in the UK I’d cycle (or scoot) everywhere and encourage my children to do the same — it’s just too dangerous, so we don’t!
We love Swedish design at Kiss House because so many of it’s values and principles align with ours. Known for its minimalism, simplicity and use of natural materials. The Swedish build quality, placing value on functionality as much as aesthetics with consideration to the environment, surely the cornerstones of all great modern design? They’ve long embraced ultra low energy builds. In fact, the two Professors responsible for developing the Passivhaus performance standard were a German physicist and a Swedish scientist.
Everything feels progressive here, considered. The air feels clean. It doesn’t surprise me that Stockholm is ranked one of the most eco-friendly cities in the world and Sweden one of the most sustainable countries.
Back in 2014, The Guardian reported on an innovative city funded high-rise project in the southern Swedish town of Växjö where two high-rises were built to the Passivhaus standard to help the country realise it’s goal of eliminating CO2 emissions by 2050. “Taking this route works very well for us as a municipality, since we want to become CO2 neutral, and homes account for 30% of energy use” explained Henrik Johansson, the city’s environmental coordinator. He added “even though the city has endured three extremely cold winters since the buildings went up, the apartments have not been cold”.
It’s the city’s most ambitious project but it’s no stranger to Passivhaus builds and even boasts a Passivhaus house style tennis complex built by former world no.1 player Stefan Edberg. Växjö’s city planners now face the dilemma of how to deal with the vast amounts of energy used by poorly insulated 1960’s and 70’s buildings, and how to make them more energy efficient or Passivhaus retrofit them. “Just another challenge to overcome” says Johansson (source: Elisabeth Braw: The Guardian).
The Swedes clearly know how to create great cities. Stockholm is a joy and is testament to their foresight and people centred design.
Whilst there zipping around, we had the benefit of recommendations from locals (because my husband is fortunate enough to spend time there for work). Below is our Top 10 things to See and Do.
2. Check out “The Future Starts Here” exhibition at Ark Des (in association with the V&A London) until 4th August 2019, a fascinating and thought-provoking exhibition about the world of tomorrow shaped by the designs and technologies emerging today.
3. Visit Fotografiska: A centre for contemporary photography housed in an old brick-built customs building
4. Check out Snösätra Graffiti Wall of Fame one of Europe’s largest graffiti exhibitions
5. Take a day cruise and experience the best parts of the beautiful Stockholm archipelago
6. Eat amazingly good Bengali Street Food at Gossip Shanti (be warned when the waiter says it’s hot, it’s HOT!)
7. Sample local cuisine in a Foodhall such as Östermalms Saluhall
8. Visit one of the city’s Roof Top bars such as Tak Stockholm
9. Mooch around cool independent boutiques and homeware stores, plus enjoy a stop-off in one of the eclectic cafes and bars in laidback Södermalm or SoFo
10. Stay in Downtown Camper by Scandic: A new first-class hotel with award winning design, rooftop bar, spa and rooftop pool as well as an excellent restaurant, Campfire.

“Life is always full of surprises”
For an Asian girl who never traveled to any European country before, the fact of moving from Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam) to Stockholm (Sweden) to live was never in my plan. However, life is always full of surprises, there are decisions we have to make, and some decisions are made for us. Moving to Stockholm has opened a brand new chapter of my life. Although I have been living here for just 11 months, there are so many things in Stockholm that I just fell in love with this city at first sight (and I’m sure you will).
After landing from the flight, I took the bus from Arlanda airport to Stockholm city. It took around 55 minutes from Arlanda airport to Stockholm City via Flygbuss with ticket price is 99 SEK (~10.3USD) for 1 round.
Firstly I was really impressed with how the city manages to preserve all the historical buildings. From churches to museums, government offices to schools, and even regular houses, Stockholm’s architecture is stunning
My friends told me that, in Stockholm, it’s very common to see houses which were built in 1900s (100 years old). These houses can survive such long time thanks to the high quality materials as well as careful maintenance. If you want to explore these building yourselves, Gamla Stan should be your must-go of Stockholm owing to its unique Swedish architecture.
My second impression was that I can drink the water from any tap in the city. My landlord proudly told me that “Stockholm has some of the purest water in the world in its taps. It has way better quality than bottled water, so yes, it’s completely safe to drink.”
At first, I did not dare to drink the water directly from the tap as it’s not common for Asian people to do so. However, seeing my landlord tried it himself, I also wanted to try. The result was a big surprise for me. I’d never tasted such fresh water before. I started searching for information about water in Stockholm and here was what I found:
“Every day Stockholm Vatten och Avfall produces 360,000 m³ of drinking water in the two water treatment works of Lovö and Norsborg, and distributes it to 1.5 million people in Stockholm.The water is retrieved in Lake Mälaren. To maintain a high quality of drinking water, measures are continuously taken to protect the source of water supply; Lake Mälaren as well as the reserve water source Bornsjön.”
Thanks to this work, we can save a lot of money on boiling water to make it drinkable. This also helps to reduce the number of plastic bottles consumed. Imagine that travellers don’t need to buy water bottles but can just simply fill the bottle with tap water. Bravo Stockholm!!!
Living in Stockholm, we don’t need to drive miles away to get into the wild because Stockholm is surrounded with a lot of lakes and green trees. There are almost 300 nature reserves around the greater Stockholm area, two national parks, one national city park and plenty of lakes that attract both wildlife and locals. Every suburb has numerous green areas, both small and large, and there are several green parks in the city. In other words, you’re just a short subway or bus ride away if you feel nature calling.
If you are lucky (like me), you might encounter some European hares happily enjoy their grass on your journey. Some of my friends live in the far north of Stockholm sometimes also see moose, deers, or even bears on the train to the inner city. There was a time, my boss nearly hit a moose while driving to Arlanda airport in a gloomy morning because the moose just suddenly jumped into the middle of the street (lucky him). So prepared yourself to meet some surprise friends on your way in Stockholm!
When it comes to air quality, there are many components to measure it including the level of pollutants like ammonia (NH3), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), … and the level of particulate matter (PM) like PM10, PM2.5. However, in this post, I won’t talk about scientific facts but how I feel when breathing the air in Stockholm.
I am living in a small apartment in southern Stockholm, around 12km from the city central so surrounding me are a lot of trees, flowers and lakes. Everyday, as long as I step out of the house, I always look up in the sky, take a really deep breath to get as much cool fresh air as possible to feed my lung. I never feel tired of doing that. Every breath I take, I can feel like the air in flowing in my body and it keeps refreshing my mind. I wish I could pack those air and ship it to my home country so that my family can enjoy it with me.
Fika is one of the most popular keywords you will hear when you are in Stockholm and it is a very traditional Swedish thing people do almost everyday. Fika basically means to meet up for a coffee and a piece of cake. Sweden enjoys a highly developed culture when it comes to baked goods, they are so in love with cake that they even have national days for some cakes.
Semla is two-layer bun made of wheat and cardamom, stuffed with almond paste under a cover of thick layered whipped cream. This is definitely the must-try item in your list when you are in Stockholm.
Every year on a Tuesday that lies on the seventh week before Easter, is where the so-called “Fat Tuesday” or “Semmeldagen” (the day of the Semla) falls.
Princess cake contains layers of light sponge cake, pastry cream, and a dome of whipped cream all covered by green marzipan and marzipan pink roses. You can find it in every bakery store with different variations, in round-shaped or in roll-shaped.
This is my most favourite cake ever! Kanelbullar is made with a perfectly soft and chewy cardamom dough, a buttery cinnamon-sugar filling, and twisted into cute little knots. Every year on October 4th, the Swedes celebrate Cinnamon Bun Day. All you need for a chilling afternoon is cup of coffee and a cinnamon roll. It is the ultimate symbol of Swedish home cooking and, as any Swede will tell you, the smell of newly baked cinnamon rolls is best smell in the world.
I usually warm the bun in microwave a little bit (30 seconds) to feel the smell of cinamon but you can try without heating it. Once you try it, you will love it forever!
— — — — — — — — — — — — —
Yay, there you go, the list of 5 things that made me fall in love with Stockholm. I really hope this list will inspire you to go to Stockholm one day. If you have been in Stockholm before or are living in Stockholm, please let me know what are your favourite things about this beautiful city.
Stay tuned for Part 2 of my top 10 things to love about Stockholm!

It all began with a single goal: to make Stockholm my new home. However, I quickly realized that the key to achieving this dream lay in securing a job in the Swedish capital. With limited funds and a burning desire to make my migration a reality without draining my savings, I embarked on a relentless quest.
For seven months, I tirelessly scoured professional platforms like LinkedIn, navigating through countless applications and attending numerous interviews. But amidst the rollercoaster ride of hope and disappointment, I confronted a difficult decision: should I risk quitting my current job to focus solely on this pursuit? The financial strain weighed heavily on my mind, urging caution when it came to advising others.
Yet, from the depths of my own experience, I discovered a valuable lesson that would shape my journey forever…
Embarking on my migration journey to Stockholm, finding a job became the crucial first step in realizing my dreams without depleting my savings. For seven long months, I tirelessly scoured platforms like LinkedIn, submitting countless applications and attending interviews. It was a challenging period, as I had taken the bold step of quitting my job to focus on this pursuit. Financial strain tested my resolve, making me hesitant to advise others to follow suit.
However, I learned a valuable lesson: once an offer arrives, swift action is vital. Initiating the notice period promptly and commencing the visa application process without delay can help secure a smoother transition, avoiding the prolonged financial hardships I faced. By sharing this experience, I hope to guide fellow migrants toward a more stable and successful path in their own endeavors.
Let us start with the time I started the interview process. As an iOS applications developer, the interview process consisted of IQ tests, coding tests, and several rounds of interviews related to my tech stack and my 10 years of experience in the industry. The interview process started at the end of December 2022, and I was offered a new opportunity to work with them in the first week of February 2023.
With the elation of securing a job offer, I eagerly signed the employment contract, understanding that this was the first step towards my new life in Stockholm. Little did I know that the journey ahead would require additional support. My new employer introduced me to a reputable visa processing agency, a third-party partner entrusted with navigating the intricate procedures involved in obtaining a visa. (Note: Specific names of the employer and third-party agency have been omitted for privacy reasons.)
The first thing they asked me to do was to fill out and sign a power of attorney form so that they could handle the application on my (and my wife’s) behalf. We also provided several pieces of information about us to the agency, such as passport data and marriage certificates. We were provided with two control numbers for me and my wife, which would help us keep track of the process on their website. You can check the status of your application using your control number here.
After waiting for about a month, I was informed by the agency that the Swedish Migration Agency had approved our application! The next process was to get the work permit card from the Embassy of Sweden. In order to obtain this, we needed to submit our biometrics to the Embassy. I swiftly booked flight tickets to New Delhi, where the Embassy of Sweden was located. You can find the details of the Embassy of Sweden in New Delhi here. The allotted time for submitting your biometrics is between 8:30 am & 10:30 am IST.
A few tips for your visit to the Embassy of Sweden:
Once inside, you will need to get a token and wait for your turn. The whole process took about 10 minutes for me and my wife. Afterward, we returned home and patiently waited for someone to reach out to us about the arrival of the permit cards.
Two weeks later, I received an email instructing me to collect the permit cards from the Embassy. The process for collecting the cards was between 11:00 am and 12:00 pm IST, and it was a swift affair, taking about 15 minutes.
As soon as I obtained my permit card, I informed my new employer, and they promptly booked my tickets to Stockholm. The next week, I found myself standing at the airport, clutching my boarding pass tightly. It was a moment of reflection on the incredible journey that led me here.
Part 1 of my migration tale had been a rollercoaster of perseverance and uncertainty, but it was just the beginning. Little did I know that the real adventure awaited me on Swedish soil. With a newfound job, a promising future, and dreams that seemed within reach, I stepped onto the plane with a mixture of excitement and apprehension.
The next chapter of my story, “Unlocking the Essentials,” would take you on a journey through the practicalities of settling in Sweden. From registering for a personal number to navigating the intricacies of the banking system and embarking on the quest for a place to call home, Part 2 reveals the essential steps that awaited me in building a life in this beautiful country.
Join me as we unlock the doors to a new chapter, where dreams become reality and Swedish adventures await. Stay tuned for “Unlocking the Essentials” in the next installment of my Sweden migration blog.

Celebrating the Unsung Heroes Behind Every Great Achievement
I visited Stockholm recently and couldn’t help noticing how much history fills the city.
I wandered through the Vasa Museum, then ended up at Stockholm’s City Hall, that red-brick landmark standing quietly over the water.
Inside, a guide led us through the halls where Nobel laureates have dined.
I stopped at the grand staircase, amazed by every curve and step. Ragnar Östberg, the architect behind it all, was known for obsessing over every detail, not for himself, but for the queen and her royal guests.
Östberg’s attention to detail was legendary.
He made his wife walk up and down different versions of the staircase until every step felt right. He wanted the queen, and every guest after her, to glide down without a stumble. But even as he worked for royalty, he never forgot the people who helped bring his vision to life.
His team — the builders, craftsmen, and artists — were honoured in a way that surprised me.
Instead of the mayor’s own bust above the office, you’ll find the faces of these collaborators, a daily reminder that nobody succeeds alone.

Here are some tips for you, Chris, for your trip to Stockholm.
Stay in Soder. Caffinate at Kaffe in the mornings and have a delicious swedish breakfast bun from across the road at Fabrique.
You will want to explore the shops around Soder, I think you will do some real damage here particularly Aplace, J.Lindberg, Gram, SnS and Cos.
To be converted to the cause of herring, you must lunch at Strommingsvagnen. It is a fish food truck which sounds like the sort of thing you should run from — unless you are in Sweden! I think we ate everything and it was all delicious. Rug up as you can only sit outside on benches.
For culture, I liked Fotografiska the photography museum not far from Soder.
For a fun day out, rent bikes and ride around Djurgården, the garden island of Stockholm’s archipelago and have lunch at Rosendahl’s Tradgard (closed Mondays). It is quite magical having a casually elegant meal in a glasshouse. All the meals are prepared with veggies and herbs harvested in the palace’s kitchen garden. A highlight.
Spend the afternoon at the contemporary art museum on the island.
Check out a gig guide if you can. We saw a great DJ play down somewhere near the water and it was awesome. Swedes know how to party.
That is all that I can remember for now. Enjoy and bring back more tips.

My generation were teenagers in the late 1970’s and thus passionate fans of Sweden since Abba dominated the Top of the Pops (God, how I hated the ghastly Dancing Queen since every girl in high school thought this syrupy pop tune was written specifically for her!) and Björn Borg dominated Centre Court at Wimbledon as the Men’s Champion until the trophy was wrested from him in 1981 in a five set marathon by the awful but brilliant American John McEnroe. As I grew older, I learnt to love Sweden’s amazing social tolerance and cosmopolitan culture, its democratic values, welfare state, its beautiful lakes, ancient cities and effervescent young women whom I met in my fave Hellenic beach resorts like Ayia Napa in Cyprus and Mykonos in the Greek Aegean.
However, in 2025, I have a special reason to love Sweden and it is definitely not the ugly furniture of Ikea my Gen-Z twins adore. The Swedish kroner has been the best anti-dollar FX hedge of 2025 and is up an incredible 17% in the last 6-months. As I expect the Trump Buckeroo to fall 20% before the Big Guy leaves the White house, I hope my Swedish kroner stash rises another 20% and offsets the already exorbitant cost of a Scandi holiday. Since I prefer the Med to the Baltics at any time of the year, why not revert back to the 1980’s watering holes in the Cyclades and meet nice Swedish people in the Scandinavian love shack rather than actually flying to Stockholm Gothenburg or Malmö.
Sweden is also one of the world’s most successful case studies in innovation and entrepreneurial capitalism, the reason Nasdaq’s Old World hub is in Stockholm. This $900 billion economy is one of my favourite countries to invest for the next 5-years as long as Putin does not invade Estonia and try to usurp King Charles XII’s role as the supreme war lord of the North with a blockade of the Baltics. After all, Putin is from St. Petersburg, a port founded by Tsar Pyotr Alexievich to fight the Swedish empire, the superpower of the North in the first decade of the 18th century.
This IT/green tech/export colossus is a goldmine for investors who love corruption free economies dedicated to innovation and talent, a natural for any refugee from Planet Dollar like moi!

How to enjoy Stockholm without breaking your bank Part 3 — getting around and my thought on Stockholm Pass.,https://medium.com/travelwithsara/how-to-enjoy-stockholm-without-breaking-your-bank-part-3-getting-around-and-my-thought-on-9d3d06602937,"Sign up

Worrying about getting around? getting to and from the airport? want to check out the archipelago but do not want to join an expensive tour?
Public transport is great in Stockholm but it is not cheap. On average, a single ride costs SEK35. As visitor, you can buy a 7 days pass at SEK315 (there are other options if you are staying for only a day or 2, check here for information).
The best thing about this card is, you can actually go to and from the airport with it without paying extra if you do not mind a slightly longer (like 20 mins) commute!
If you go to the train station, they will tell you you need to purchase a SEK120 ticket to go through (which is true). However, we were lucky enough to encounter a staff who is nice enough to tell us the alternative that saved us SEK280/pax (2 more lunches!).
When you are at SkyCity in the airport, go out (and down) from the escalator, you will see a bus stop, get on bus 583 (you can check their schedule here) and ride to the last stop at Märsta station. At Märsta station, you will get on the train that go all the way to Stockholm City.
The bus ride is about 10–15 mins and the train ride is about 30–40mins.
Märsta station is the end of the train line, so you can’t really get it wrong.
(photo credit: Brorsson)
Apart from going to and from the airport, you can also go to (some part of) the Stockholm Archipelago with your Travelcard which easily saves you hundreds of SEK.
Stockholm is made up of 30,000 islands (subject to dispute :P), and it is a large part of Stockholm Swedes’ life to go to the Archipelago during summer/vacation. (To hide away and to not talk to anyone.)
If you want to do some island hopping, you can actually do it with the public ferry which is free with the card. Since I was there in autumn (and didn’t have time), I did not explore that. However, if you have any specific island in mind, you should check the website of waxholmsbolaget for more information.
It would be a pity to visit a city without seeing it from the water. If you do not have enough time to enjoy that, a short ride on the public ferry maybe a good way to do that. We took a short ride on the number 80. My only advice is don’t do it after dark. That’s what we did and we didn’t really see much.
Stockholm metro station is renown for its artistic decorations (you can see my Part 1 post for some picture and links to plan your trip ;)).
When we were in Stockholm, weather was not the best. With the card, we can easily hop on the train/metro/bus and kept ourselves from the rain.
You know what I think, a Travelcard is well worth it I will urge you to get it. You can get the card in the train station/convenient store in the airport.
Stockholm card is different from the Travelcard. It is a card that gives you free access/discount to paid museums, sights etc.. Different from visitor pass in many other cities, it does not include public transport (you need to buy a Travelcard) on top of that.
The card comes in 3 options, from SEK 595 (1 day) to SEK1295 (6 days). I ended up not getting it and not regretting it.
As mentioned in Part 1 of this post — most of the museums have free hours, if you plan accordingly, you can easily save a SEK200–300; as for transport (which is the most expensive items on their list), the only offer they have is the hop-on-hop-off for one day. The route is basically covered by public transport, and Stockholm is a pretty walkable city without the rain.
Another draw back about thePass is that you can only get your money’s worth if you plan very carefully. Sometimes, you may end up just seeing everything but paying attention to nothing, not to mention the interesting thing that you might see if you’re not in a rush.
Lastly, when I took a look at the items, a few of them are very similar (tour around similar places), which you probably would not need to do them all.
The Verdict
I do not think it is worth it to get the pass, unless you are dead set to see all the paid museums (potentially giving up on some of the awesome free museums) and is very strategic about that.
Stockholm is not cheap, but definitely not crazy expensive like people say. I did not have a lot of time to research for the trip, and started looking when I was flights/commute, and I still managed to make the whole trip rather affordable. Doing my research, I found these blogs/site super helpful, hope you can benefit from them too:
And remember, Google is always your best friends and ready to help :)
Have a good time in Stockholm. Follow me here or on instagram @eatwithsara for more posts about food and travel!

Here at All About Capital Cities we aim to give you an overview of all the 196 capital cities in the world.
Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, has a history that spans over 700 years. It was officially founded in 1252 by Birger Jarl, a Swedish statesman who sought to protect Sweden’s interior from sea invasions and to control trade along the Baltic Sea. Its strategic location on 14 islands where Lake Mälaren meets the Baltic made Stockholm ideal for both defense and commerce.
The city quickly became a vital trade center, especially during the Hanseatic League era in the late Middle Ages. German merchants and craftsmen played a major role in shaping its early economy and architecture. In the 16th century, under the reign of Gustav Vasa, Stockholm became the political and administrative capital of a newly unified Sweden, marking the start of the Swedish Empire.
During the 17th century, Stockholm flourished as Sweden emerged as a European great power. The city expanded significantly, with grand palaces and government buildings constructed to reflect its growing prestige. However, this golden age was followed by a period of decline in the 18th century after Sweden lost much of its territory.
The Industrial Revolution in the 19th century revitalized Stockholm, transforming it into a modern city with railways, factories, and growing suburbs. It continued to evolve through the 20th century, becoming a hub for innovation, culture, and diplomacy.
Today, Stockholm is known for its beautiful mix of medieval and modern architecture, its progressive social systems, and its role as a leading city in technology, sustainability, and Scandinavian culture.
Stockholm is famous for its stunning natural setting, rich history, and modern innovation. Spread across 14 islands connected by over 50 bridges, the city is often called the “Venice of the North.” Its blend of medieval charm and cutting-edge design makes it one of Europe’s most attractive capitals.
The city is also renowned for its well-preserved Old Town, Gamla Stan, where cobbled streets and colorful 17th-century buildings surround landmarks like the Royal Palace and Stockholm Cathedral. Stockholm is the cultural heart of Sweden, home to world-class museums such as the Vasa Museum, which houses a 17th-century warship, and the ABBA Museum, celebrating Sweden’s iconic pop group.
As the home of the Nobel Prize ceremonies, Stockholm is a global symbol of intellectual achievement and innovation. The city is also recognized for its sustainability and environmental efforts, often ranking among the world’s greenest cities.
In addition, Stockholm has a vibrant food scene, cutting-edge fashion, and a strong tech industry, earning it the nickname “Unicorn Factory” due to its high number of billion-dollar startups. With its mix of history, nature, and modern living, Stockholm stands out as a unique and influential European capital.

Take a stroll through the charming streets of Gamla Stan and visit the incredible Vasa Museum. Don’t forget to explore Djurgården, the lush green island, and indulge in the world of modern art at the Fotografiska Museumet. Get ready for an unforgettable adventure in this vibrant city!
Here are five top tips, from a true Stockholm native, on what to do in Stockholm! Want more tips from me? Feel free to leave a comment!
You should check out Gamla Stan when you visit Stockholm — it is a charming neighborhood with narrow streets and colorful buildings. This historic district is located on the island of Stadsholmen and is one of the best-preserved medieval city centers in Europe.
As you wander through its winding cobblestone streets, you’ll come across beautiful architecture, quaint cafes, and charming shops selling Swedish handicrafts. Gamla Stan is also home to several notable landmarks, including the Royal Palace, Stortorget (the main square), and the Stockholm Cathedral.
Don’t forget to explore the narrow alleyways and hidden courtyards, where you’ll find hidden gems and unique surprises. Whether you’re a history buff, an architecture lover, or simply looking for a picturesque setting, Gamla Stan is a must-visit destination in Stockholm.
Located in Stockholm, the Vasa Museum exhibits a well-preserved 17th-century warship. It is a fascinating destination for history enthusiasts and maritime lovers. Upon entering the museum, visitors are greeted by the majestic sight of the Vasa ship, which was salvaged from the depths of the Stockholm harbor after sinking on its maiden voyage in 1628.
The ship’s intricate carvings and ornate details are a testament to the craftsmanship of the era. As you explore the museum, you’ll learn about the ship’s ill-fated journey and the remarkable efforts made to recover and restore it. The Vasa Museum offers a unique glimpse into Sweden’s naval history and serves as a reminder of the country’s seafaring legacy.
Wandering through Djurgården, the green island, allows you to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and immerse yourself in nature’s tranquility. Djurgården is a true oasis in the heart of Stockholm, where you can stroll along lush green pathways and breathe in the fresh air.
The absence of cars on the island adds to its charm, making it the perfect place for a leisurely walk or bike ride. As you explore Djurgården, you’ll come across beautiful gardens, picturesque waterfronts, and even a charming little village. There are also several museums and attractions to visit, such as the Vasa Museum and the ABBA Museum.
Whether you’re a nature lover or a culture enthusiast, Djurgården offers something for everyone, making it a must-visit destination in Stockholm.
The Fotografiska Museumet is a great place to explore if you are interested in contemporary art and photography. Located in Stockholm, Sweden, the museum showcases a vast collection of stunning photographs from renowned photographers around the world.
With its sleek and modern design, the museum provides a perfect backdrop for the captivating artworks on display. From thought-provoking exhibitions to interactive installations, Fotografiska offers a unique and immersive experience for visitors of all ages.

(disclaimer: this post is long overdue, as the trip happened in February. But better late than never!)
Me two months ago: Dear Santa Claus & birthday fairy lady, all I want for my birthday is to experience a white winter for my 30th before I head to Singapore. I’m talking a white winter, with glistening snow as far as the horizon stretches and air so crisp and cold that it takes your breath away. But not so debilitatingly cold that we won’t go outside… Sweden and Iceland, you say? Alright I’m in!
Turns out Stockholm and Iceland were the perfect retreats to get a refreshing dose of true winter before I move to a country with hot, hot, hot and hotter as seasons. The weather was a brisk 0 degrees C/32 degrees F, which was cold, but gave us beautiful flurries of snow every other day. In Sweden, we slowly acclimated to the cold and learned about the viking history of this Nordic country in museum after museum. Then in Iceland, we became outdoor adventurers, summiting glaciers and hiking ice caves. Even for warm-blooded Californians, these two northern spots were the ideal winter vacation.
Sweden highlights:
Iceland highlights (Part 2) is here.
Sweden runs so efficiently. The ARN airport has wifi, the express train that takes you to Central Station has wifi, and the busses run promptly every few minutes. Our Airbnb was in the adorable Old Town district, with narrow cobblestone streets that housed everything from tacky souvenir shops to quaint boutique stores that sold artisan chocolates and fancy wool textiles. It was right next to the riverwalk, where stately old buildings boasted their prowess along the water.
In true American form, we sought out the Swedish things we already knew and loved: Swedish fish, Swedish meatballs, Swedish pancakes, and Swedish massages. Our kind Airbnb host welcomed us with Swedish fish, so we immediately sought out #2: Swedish meatballs. We popped into an adorable cafe on the street corner and ordered meatballs, salmon and soup. The meatballs came in a rich cream sauce but had the appearance of Mexican mole. It was even better than all our Ikea meatball memories combined.
Warning: Swedish food is expensive. Icelandic food is even more expensive. Be prepared to drop $30 for breakfast and lunch and anywhere from $60–100 for dinner, especially if you order drinks. Thankfully (?) the SF restaurant scene has immunized me from sticker shock when I open menus anywhere in the world.
Swedish pancakes were reserved for breakfast the following day at Greasy Spoon (delicious), and it turns out Swedish pancakes are just… pancakes. But when topped with ricotta cheese and pistachios, you really don’t miss the “Swedish” at all. We also ordered eggs benedict and a salmon dish atop what can only be described as chunky potatoes.
And Swedish massages aren’t really a thing. Swedish massages were really invented by the Danish, but misattributed to the Swedish. So we scrapped that idea altogether and found a Thai massage place on Night 2. A warm Thai massage in freezing weather beats a massage in Thailand any day, even if we did pay $50 for an hour :X
Vasa Museum, 5 stars
This was one of the coolest museums I’ve ever been to. Upon entering, you’re greeted by a massive 70-meter ship (225 ft) that’s 95% of its original form. Back in 1621, Sweden was at war with Norway and the king had the ship built in two years. After just 10 minutes on the water, 1.5 km away from the shore, the Vasa ship tipped over and started to sink. She was too top-heavy and narrow in the middle to withstand a gust of wind. Of ~200 people on board, 30 died a tragic (seemingly unnecessary) death. It wasn’t until 333 years later that Sweden had the technological prowess to pull the ship up from the bottom of the ocean. The water was so cold that it was able to preserve the bones, and even the brains and shoes, of the some of the deceased aboard!
Nobel Prize Museum, 5 stars
Exhibit 1 of Swedes being incredibly nice and generous: the Nobel Prize museum was closing in 30 minutes, but the front desk man graciously allowed us in, as long as we promised not to tell anyone (he said with a wink). The museum offered an excellent crash course in all the Nobel prizes, including the Junglebook by Rudyard Kipling for literature, penicillin in medicine, and many other scientific concepts that went straight over my head.
I was frustrated by the US education system that failed to teach us about all these spectacular inventions, but also inspired to read all the Nobel-prize winning literature. Though I had read books by a few of the prize-winning authors (Beloved by Toni Morrison, Lord of the Flies by William Golding), I had barely scratched the surface of authors to read. The museum was also a crash course in learning about Alfred Nobel, a serial inventor, most known for his dynamite and explosive inventions. This was probably more world history I had retained than any class in school :X
Fotografiska Museum, 5 stars
The museum offered three powerful exhibits:
Royal Palace, 4 stars
“Royal” is a bit of a stretch to describe the Swedes’ Palace, but it is a lovely building, and aptly representative of the humble nature of the Swedes. Oddly enough, all the Swedish royalty pictured and ornately framed are brunettes, not at all like the blonde/blue-eyed people I had imagined. There are 3 main buildings — I recommend buying the ticket that gets you into all three. They’re worth checking out.
National Library of Sweden and Stockholm Public Library, 4 stars
Cause we’re #nerds. The bibliophiles in us couldn’t help but make a stop at *both* libraries. The Stockholm Public Library boasted a gorgeous rotunda on its top-level with thousands of books encircling us. As I browsed the shelves, my eyes immediately went to the Isabel Allende section where I saw the exact book I was reading on the trip: Inés of My Soul, but in Swedish. Talk about serendipity! Who needs John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale…
The National Library of Sweden had a slightly more interesting inventory. The library’s basement contained “Codex Gigas”, literally meaning “giant book”, or The Devil’s Bible. It’s the largest known medieval manuscript at 36x20x8.7 inches.
Nordic Museum, 3 stars
The exterior is stunning and looks more royal than the Royal Palace, with its turquoise sheen-ed roof atop sturdy concrete walls and multi-panel glass windows. Statues of imposing men riding horses guard the building to create a sense of awe when you enter the museum. And did I mention free entrance from 1–5pm? Apparently this is the happenin’ place on weekday afternoons with the older Swedes (aka senior citizens..), who comprised 80% of the visitors. And I don’t blame them. The atrium alone provided the most beautiful luncheon backdrop.
Eat in the museum cafe! I ordered the traditional meat and cabbage lasagna-esque dish (no noodles), and Jenn and Jenn got the salmon and mushroom soup. Keep in mind that we all grew up eating family-style, so we had the benefit of getting to try three different entrees at every meal. Plus the cafe provides all-you-can-eat bread, coffee and tea.
The rotating exhibits included Fashion through the Ages and A Nordic History, both of which were an enlightening glimpse into Nordic history through a fun, interactive lens. One exhibit provided paper for us to draw our 2050 fashion predictions and weave a giant tapestry with colorful threads that evoked different emotions.
Sodermalm Square and King’s Garden, 5 stars:
This was a beautiful garden and city center in the middle of Stockholm. There was a giant performance venue plus an ice skating rink decked out in twinkling lights, where parents and their kids swirled around unsteadily and didn’t mind taking a tumble. A small food stand served hot chocolate and even had fireplaces to roast marshmallows. If you could sit long enough in the cold, you could watch the ice sheets float down the river passing by magnificent buildings like the Grand Opera House and International Riviera Grand Hotel. It felt like Christmas in February.
Skansen “Museum”, 2 stars
The world’s oldest outdoor museum is a fascinating microcosm of Sweden. The founder brought or modeled buildings of all trades to Skansen to showcase the different industries, including glassblowing, carpentry, and other crafts. These craftsmen and women were smart and apparently decided to stay home from the cold because most of the shops were closed the day we went. There were outdoor venues, like an ice skating rink, and restaurants that were open, but we skipped. Luckily, the animals were still open for business, and we got to see wolverines (not Hugh Jackman, but honeybadger-like animals), bison, snow wolves, bobcats/lynx, and reindeer! The 2-star rating is a bit harsh, but it was pretty darn cold to spend all day at an outdoor park.
Gondolen Bar, 4 stars
Go for the views, stay for the drinks. We arrived a bit late (30 min before closing so we only had beer and wine offerings available. No matter, I immensely enjoyed my IPA.) We also were able to admire the great views from Katarinahissen, the 12-story elevator that takes you to an outdoor balcony for stunning views of the city.
Sturehof restaurant, 4 stars
Seafood lovers: go here. Again, it was expensive, but worth the price tag. We ordered a seafood platter with shrimp of all sizes, plus crab and Canadian lobster. The shrimp were incredibly tasty. The toast skagen, which is what they’re known for, is mayonnaise-y shrimp on top of toast — a bit overrated in my opinion. However, their scallop appetizer (yes, scallop singular, not plural) was to die for, but will set you back $17.
Grand Escalier, 4 stars
We tried to head to the Spy Bar, which loomed surreptitiously outside the Sturehof restaurant, but we eventually gave up trying to get in. We luckily walked inside the “galeria” (mall) right next to the restaurant and stumbled upon the Grand Escalier bar, which came highly recommended from a friend. Deeee-licious cocktails.
Östermalm Food Hall, 4 stars
I had already had moose medallions, so I was in a meat kick, looking to sample the primest cuts of Sweden’s finest. As we walked around the stalls that offered meats, seafood, pastries, and other goods, we asked a nice gentleman what the most popular meats were. He offered a sampling of their various meat cuts. We had the moose hind, moose salami, and reindeer heart and shoulder. Each had varying levels of smokiness and were all delicious.
When we attempted to pay, the man (Wes) refused and said it was his treat. And the sampling wasn’t just a piece of meat per animal, there were probably ten slices of each meat! Such. Nice. People. For a light lunch, we had their famous cheese quiche and cardamom cinnamon bun with a light hot chocolate. They really love their cardamom in Sweden. Perhaps cardamom is a natural happiness pill??
Slingerbulten restaurant: yummy restaurant. Order the moose medallions.
Da Peppe: If you want a break from Swedish restaurant, check out this very authentic Italian joint in the Old District. They were kind enough to provide free dessert plus a sufficiently embarrassing Italian rendition of “Happy Birthday.”

Stockholm ranks high on many queer people’s favourite cities list — and it’s plain to see why. This waterfront city is a hub of fashion, music, food, nature and progressive queer culture. Let me guide you to my Stockholm.
As soon as you arrive, whether it’s at Arlanda or Skavsta airport, you will be met by the views many associate with Sweden; green pine forests, yellow fields and blue lakes, with red little houses dotted all around. As you approach the city (grab Arlanda Express for the smoothest journey) the houses, as well as the vast open waters, grow in size, revealing the unique character of this capital city. Stockholm is where domestic lakes meet the Baltic sea, and whilst this is the centre of the tech, music and fashion innovation that Sweden is well known for, the city also celebrates nature, tradition — and LGBTQ rights. Let’s dive in.
Stockholm is built on 17 islands and as a visitor you simply must make the most out of this unique feature. My first tip, therefore, is: find your sea legs.
There is nothing quite like island hopping in the archipelago. Get on a traditional archipelago boat — or it’s high-speed equivalent – and take it out to Waxholm, Möja, Finnhamn, Utö or any one of the other gorgeous little stops along the way. Here you will be able to stop for a bite to eat, have a dip in the sea, and explore the Swedish forestry. Thanks to Allemansrätten, the Right of Public Access, you are free to roam the land (with only a few exceptions). If bigger boats are your thing you could get a ferry from Slussen, taking you to Finland or Estonia for the day.

Take time to soak in the waterfront in Stockholm. Whether it’s a walk on Djurgården, a stroll along the picturesque Södermälarstrand, or a panoramic tour along Fjällgatan (where my girlfriend asked me to marry her on New Year’s Eve!), I find it is impossible to get enough of the the Stockholm waterfront views. You can count on many a #selfie moment here.
What’s more, on a warm summer’s evening you will find theatre performances in Rålamshovsparken, high profile gigs at theme park Gröna Lund, romantic picnics at Skinnarviksberget, burgers and boules Boule & Berså at Danviksbro, national sing-along at open air museum Skansen and beer gardens filled with Swedes enjoying a well-earned “AW”, after-work. Following a long, dark winter Sweden embraces summer like few others.
Regardless of whether you are visiting in summer or winter, make sure you indulge in a dip. In the warmer months Stockholm’s many beaches fill up with local holiday makers, and during the rest of year (but also in summer) the many bathhouses create a relaxing oasis. Check out well-renowned Sturebadet, situated in the city centre, or Japanese sanctuary Yasuragi, located in the forests outside Nacka, to experience perfect relaxation. For an added twist and a truly Swedish experience, head out to Hellasgården for a dip in the sea — don’t worry, they cut a hole in the ice for you in the winter.
Stockholm is due to co-host EuroPride together with Gothenburg in 2018 and the city celebrates a huge Pride party every summer — but I have found it to be just as welcoming to queer people all year round.
Strolling through the streets of Stockholm I am always struck by rainbow flags, non-conformative design, boundary pushing initiatives and out gay people just being themselves. Last I was over I just happened upon a small yet mainstream jewellery shop proudly advertising rainbow marriage – that’s just one example. Swedes generally don’t even blink at the thought of same sex couples and when the Pride parade comes to town, the streets fill with people celebrating equality.
Worth noting is that the lesbian scene in Sweden is political; outspokenly feminist and trans inclusive. With lots of lesbian artists and initiatives increasingly gaining recognition across Sweden, the scene is growing particular in the Swedish capital — check out artists such as Silvana Imam, Beatrice Eli and Kakan Hermansson and you get the idea.
And whilst holding hands with my girlfriend (now fiancee!) has never caused me any grief regardless of the time of day, it is at night that the gay scene really comes alive…
Stockholm nightlife thrives particularly between May and August, when the sun doesn’t set and the summer rays stretch on into the early hours. Honestly, it’s magical.
One of the most popular establishments during this time of year (and again, one of my faves) is Mälarpaviljongen, a chic waterfront bar and restaurant buzzing with LGBT clientele, DJs, and staff. Worth noting is that the venue works with LGBT charity Regnbågsfonden and employs LGBT refugees.
Trädgården is another summer club hugely popular with the queer community. Set under the bridges near the waterfront by Eriksdalsbandet, this club invites some of the biggest acts and DJs and it is definitely one to visit. Make sure you go early, though, as queues can be long.
There are lots of club nights aimed specifically at a lesbian/bi clientele. Look out for Moxy, Bitter Pills, Hotellgänget, Club Wish (for the kinky) and keep a keen eye on Gunn Lundemo Events — this Stockholm-based DJ regularly does clubs around the world but she often also plays on home turf and her latest project with the L Word’s Daniela Sea looks seriously cool. Speaking of new, SPACE Stockholm is a recent initiative by lesbian icon and longtime Stockholm DJ Pamela, promising house music and underground decadence.
Many of the gay clubs in Stockholm attract a mixed clientele and “queer” is the buzzword here, as exemplified by the brilliant-looking Klubb Hångel, playing retro tunes and serving a no-attitude-pure-joy kind of vibe.
DATE is a club night run by underground music superstars Ji Nilsson and Julia Spada and whereas it isn’t advertised as queer, it’s a night I’d personally always try to make.
Mainstream gay clubs, where I might expect to see more men than women, include King Kong, Wonk and party boat Patricia. Bar/restaurant/club Marie Laveau, which is mixed and has a very cool vibe, puts on a queer party, Club Laveau, every Friday.
Queer friendly but not explicitly gay clubs include Debaser, Berns and Södra Teatern - but then again you will struggle to find somewhere that isn’t welcoming in Stockholm. For the latest queer events, see Visit Sweden LGBT as well as the Facebook timeline of JagVillGåPåQueerFest — the information is in Swedish but it gives a good idea of new upcoming nights. You might also want to check out Facebook’s list of gay bars here.
Say Swedish music and one band will come to mind regardless of where in the world you are. And now, finally, we have a museum dedicated to their greatness! Whether you are a huge fan or not, the ABBA museum is a Stockholm must as it lets you step back in time and rediscover pop history. Record your own song, perform in your own music video and (my favourite) learn about the music history that followed on from these super trooper dancing queens. Go, go, go!
Music thrives in Stockholm and the list of hits created here, thanks to producers such as Denniz Pop, Max Martin, RedOne, Nijs and Ji Nilsson, is endless. Spot some of the stars, including Zara Larsson, First Aid Kit and The Cardigans, live in Stockholm this summer — and do consider heading over for Popaganda, Stockholm’s coolest pop festival held early September at outdoor swimming bath Eriksdalsbadet. Years and Years and FKA Twigs were incredible last year.
Fans of modern art head to Moderna Museet or Liljevalchs, where each spring their exhibition Vårsalongen showcases the latest artists and pieces for a small entry fee. Fotografiska, the photography museum, is another must as they never fail to put on incredible and thought-provoking exhibitions, often by queer artists.
It is no secret that Swedes love IKEA as much as the rest of the world, but there is more to Swedish interior design than that. On a trip to Stockholm make sure you check out the Svenskt Tenn and Svensk hemslöjd in the city centre and discover the origins of Scandi hygge.
Stockholm Fashion Week takes place twice a year but this city breathes fashion 24/7. Home to brands such as ACNE, Stutterheim, Dagmar, Whyred, Swedish Hasbeens, Anna Holtblad, Filippa K, Hope, Nudie, Happy Socks, COS, Polarn O. Pyret as well as high street hits Weekday, Monki and of course, H&M, Stockholm makes for great shopping, especially as many of these big names actively challenge both hetero and gender norms. “Normkritik”, norm criticism is an important concept in Sweden, not least in fashion.
For high street fashion head to Drottninggatan and the city centre area between tube stops T-centralen, Hötorget and Östermalmstorg. Whilst you will find specialised (and very good!) H&M stores on almost every corner, Monki and Weekday are other Swedish-owned high street brands well worth checking out. Department store Åhléns has a good fashion department with many Swedish designers and Nordiska Kompaniet, a five minute walk from there, is excellent for your high end shopping. MOOD department store around the corner serves up a cool hipster vibe (with incredible toilets) and Biblioteksgatan, Sturegallerian and Sturegatan is where you find your luxury shopping. Do pop into Efva Attling jewellery shop on Biblioteksgatan — Efva is without a doubt one of Sweden’s biggest lesbian icons.
On Södermalm I would recommend a stroll along Åsögatan where you can discover smaller boutiques by Swedish designer stars such as Acne and Stutterheim but also nip into the shop and studio of Caroline Hjerpe, an up and coming jewellery maker with a great Instagram following. Her work has been spotted both on pop star Tove Lo and Sweden’s biggest vlogger Clara Henry (who, btw is openly bisexual and well worth checking out — YouTube here) and for good reason. If you’re lucky her adorable little dog will come say hi, too.
For vintage fashion check out Beyond Retro and Myrorna, the latter is essentially our version of Oxfam but with huge fashionista status.
There is more to Scandi cooking than meatballs and the capital of Scandinavia is well known for its culinary flair. Regardless of your budget, you can eat very, very well in Stockholm and here are a few of my favourite eateries.
Urban Deli — serving local, organic, proper classic Swedish food in a relaxed atmosphere. They have several locations but the Nytorget one is my favourite — possibly because it co-functions as a food shop and also happens to be a big queer hot spot.
Paradiest — a combined organic food store and food court where local produce is at the heart of the operation.
Green Queen — Mälarpaviljonen’s green little sister. This restaurant/deli focuses on “clean” eating, serving up delicious rainbow salads, juices and raw snacks.
Nalle o Kroppkakan — for something very Swedish and rather different, head to this restaurant near Telefonplan. They serve traditional Swedish “kroppkakor”, robust potato dumplings with different fillings. Served with lingonberries and a cold beer, it hardly gets more Swedish than this.
Vigårda — gourmet burgers at budget cost. With an ever changing menu and at least one mean veggie burger at a time this small scale burger chain is the bomb.com. (I will say that mainstream burger chain Max isn’t bad either — they do not one but six veggie options.)
Södra Teatern/Mosebacke — with one of the best views of the city, this classic Södermalm establishment serves Swedish tapas, small courses making the vegetable the star of the show (worry not, you may add meat or fish if you so wish).
A Swedish must is the tradition of fika, meaning coffee or tea with a small snack (preferably a cinnamon roll if you ask me). Your fika options are endless but these are some of my favourites:
The classic fika: Vetekatten
The posh fika: Wienerkonditoriet
The healthy, soulful fika: Koloni
The LGBT tourist fika: Chokladkoppen (ideal for an Old Town sightseeing stop)
The hipster fika: Vurma
The political, vegan fika: Femtopia
The raw fika: STHLM RAW
The Instagram worthy fika: Pom & Flora
The mainstream fika: Wayne’s
And on that sweet note, it is time to round this guide up. Do leave your favourite Stockholm tips in the comments below and hit me up on social media if you have any questions about queer life in Stockholm.
Last but not least… the practicalities.
The main inner city areas to bear in mind are Södermalm/SoFo (for a relaxed and very cool hipster vibe), Östermalm (high end shopping and first class food), gorgeous old town area Gamla Stan (the cobbled streets see you literally step back in time – make sure you visit the castle), down to earth Kungsholmen and green museum island Djurgården.
When I visit I try to walk as much as possible, just because it means I get to see more of the city, but getting around via public transport is easy. The Oyster-like SL card gives you access to the tube, bus, tram and boat — all of which feel safe and clean. Many of the tube stations are decorated with lovely bits of art and a recent addition is that the escalators are lit up by rainbow lights. You can plan your journeys here.
SAS, British Airways, RyanAir and Norwegian all fly non-stop to Stockholm from London. If you fly into Arlanda I would recommend going via Arlanda Express, Flybussarna coach or Taxi 020 — beware of individual taxi drivers trying to grab your attention at the rank and instrad pick the big taxi names, asking for a fixed price.
Stockholm Pride is taking place 31 July — 6 August 2017. See you there?

This was written by me and my spouse, Yoav Luft.
This summer we didn’t want to use planes, busses, or trains, due to the Corona. So we decided to go on a bike trip in the Stockholm archipelago.
We planned 5 days of biking and one additional day to rest on our final destination. We booked everything through an agency called ResGladh, that we’ve found through Sweden By Bike. We could have rented through ResGladh the bikes, but we wanted to keep them, so we purchased two bikes with 8 gear at Decathlon.
We received a map from Sweden By Bike with official bike paths, and prepared our riding plan according to recommendations from them and different attractions (like museums) from Google Maps. In the maps below, each square is 5 km. When planning our route, we wrote down when we will have access to restaurants and supermarkets.
We took two instant rice bags with us and some sandwiches and fruits for the first day, as well as energy bars, nuts, knäckebröd and tahini for the entire trip. We also took two bottles of water, 1 litre each.
We had one backpack of 35 litres, and one bike bag of 40 litres. We switched them during the trip according to our physical condition.
We took a ferry from Stockholm to Väsbystrand, Ljusterö with the bikes. On Summers and weekends queues start early, there is limited space for bicycles (11 on bigger ferries) and its first arrived, first served. We arrived some 45 minutes ahead of time and there was already a queue. We sailed for 2.5 hours.
Before the trip we were sure we’re going to cycle on pastoral gravel paths, so the first day was a bit shocking — although we used official maps for cycling, pretty quickly we’ve found ourselves cycling in a road for cars, without dedicated bike lane, nor shoulders. I haven’t been training recently because of the Corona, and Yoav hasn’t cycled since childhood, so cycling next to car driving 70 kmh wasn’t ideal for us. Luckily all the drivers were very careful, and waited behind us if another car was coming from the other direction.
We ate lunch after crossing from Ljusterö to the main land. We crossed on a floating road, this ferry doesn’t cost money and there’s no visible personnel on it, so it was a bit weird because we didn’t know exactly what to do, so we just went on board together with the cars, and then got off on the other side.. it arrives every 20 minutes. We ate lunch on the other side in the all ubiquitous Swedish “pizza-kebab"".
We continued cycling and stopped at Wira Bruk, a 17th century forge and weapons smithy. It’s a free open museum that we enjoyed, and we also filled our water bottles there and used the toilet. There’s also a coffee place there that we haven’t tried.
We started cycling at 11:30 and arrived at our B&B at 4:30. The owners recommended go bathing at Underskug, but we were exhausted and even missed the supermarket which closed at 18:00. So we went to eat yummy middle-eastern food at Cafè Bergshamra & Pizzeria.
In the morning we ate breakfast with Margaretha and Bosse from Carlberg B&B, chatted with their other guests, and started our longest day of the trip. In Bergshamara there was a bike lane, and next to Karl-Ols we took the side road and finally cycled in the woods on a gravel path. We then continued through Grovstanäs, which is really beautiful. We paused there for a short break by the water. We also got lost there a bit and it added 1–2 km to our original plan.
We paused for lunch at Spillersboda, were there is a café by the water, and we also filled water there, used the toilet, and purchased soap and some cans at the small supermarket there. At all the places we stayed there were towels, but none had soap or shampoo.
We continued then north and had a coffee break at Rådmansö Bakery Shop. The way from Nänninge to Björköören was again pretty intense with the cars of many people coming back to Stockholm on the last weekend of the last vacation week of August. We started to cycle in route (1) that’s marked in azure in the above map, but were stopped by a family arguing that it’s a private way that is blocked. So we switched to 2 and ended the day at STF (Svenska Turistföreningen) Kapellskär hostel in Riddersholm. There is a kiosk there with some microwave dishes, but we cooked some of the food we’ve had with us. At that point we were very sour. Our thighs muscles as well as butts hurt from cycling for two days and we decided to take it easy the next day — planning based on satellite images rather than only the map, and walking uphill instead of paddling.
We’ve decided to go through (4), (5) and (6) in the Södersvik map above. There’s a cycling path parallel to E18 that is unfortunately not marked in the map. It wasn’t very inspirational, but it was safe and easy. Around Insjövägen we got on to the official path again, which was very beautiful. From there it was very fast and nice to get to Norrtälje, and we arrived at noon, which was nice because we had time to enjoy the town.
We stayed in Berglings B&B, which was really nice. We ate at Looi sushi and Ed’s burger, and walked to the pier. In the morning we got ourselves more comfortable bike chairs at Cykelservice i Norrtälje. We also got knee elastic band for Yoav. Yes, we still suffered from the second day’s effort. We had a discussion whether we should come back home or even get a ferry to the final destination with the bikes and then get buses between the places we were supposed to stay for the nights until then. But we decided to give it another chance — and it was worth it, because the fourth day was the most beautiful.
It wasn’t supposed to be Mälby. It was supposed to be Wik B&B in Soderby-Karl, but a few days before the trip something happened and they cancelled all the reservations.
ResGladh found us a place further north, and we thought it’s going to be very tiring, but the road was really nice and quick, and there were four wonderful pauses on the way.
The first break we took was at a church in Roslags-Bro, which was pretty and re-charging.
The second is marked with (1) on the map was a really nice public bathing area with grass, sand and beautiful lake. There were a few people there except for us and it was also nice to see them because we rarely saw people on the paths in this trip.
The one marked with (2) was a coffee place we really enjoyed and also a cool store where I got lovely earrings and neckless, which made me feel much better :D.
The last leg of this day, marked with (3), was a big and nice surprise, cycling along a beautiful artificial canal.
And then we got to our night destination — Livsuniversitetet. This is a special place that we appreciated, and we were almost alone here, similarly to the situation on the second night. Lena Kristina helped us to settle down and then gave us a ride to ICA. She told us a little about this place and about herself — a pioneer psychologist who’d researched and developed methodologies around breathing. They have different retreats for groups of adults and youth. The farm is very cozy with a large kitchen and yoga room, and many secret fun corners.
In the evening we went to Ortala bathing park, which was amazingly beautiful with crystal clear water which were also too cold for us to get in.
Finally we were on our last cycling day. Feeling refreshed and excited about the rest day we planned to spend on Arholma, we started our way south-east.
We stopped at Barnens Ö for a short break, and then at Simpäs. We took the ferry in the afternoon after eating a delicious Thai lunch at the pier.
In Arholma there’s a small supermarket and a couple of restaurants that require reservation. We stayed at another STF hostel that was wonderful (and with lots of fun stuff for kids).
The best decision in preparing this trip was to take a resting day in Arholma. We toured the island, booked an hour at the sauna (private, including the water next to it), and had a really nice dinner at Arholma Dansbana. There weren’t many animals on the island, except for cows and tiny frogs. We were surprised to find a cold war bunker on the island that is now a museum with tours. The day after we hiked in the forest in the north, which was full with blueberries and linden berries, and then took a ferry back in the afternoon, a 4.5 hours trip directly to Stockholm.

There are three amazing things about Stockholm: its history, people, and cuisine. It is the capital of Sweden, a Scandinavian nation with centuries of heritage and thousands of coastal islands and inland lakes. Connected by more than 50 bridges and built on 14 islands, Stockholm houses 2.3 million people in its metropolitan area. It was settled during the Stone Age and was founded as a city in 1252. When I got the chance to visit, fueled with excitement and curiosity, I ventured on without knowing what was waiting for me.
My first stop, the Stockholm City Hall, is the building of the Municipal Council for the city. Famous for its grand ceremonial halls and unique pieces of art, City Hall is most well-known for hosting the Nobel Prize banquet each year. The guided tour is a must, and be sure to check out the Blue Hall (which is actually red), the Prince’s Gallery (with the mural pointed by Sweden’s Prince Eugen), and the Golden Hall (which is decorated with over 18 million mosaic pieces of glass and gold).
My next destination, the Royal Palace, was equally mesmerizing. The tremendous palace, built in the 1700s and painted pastel brown and yellow on the outside, holds more than 1,400 rooms. Even without a guided tour, the Palace still offers an irresistible chance for a taste of royal life. Two unique features of the palace which differentiate it from other grand palaces in Europe are the exhibition dedicated to royalty’s ceremonial outfits and a chamber furnished in 70s styles. Both share insight into the life and duties of the modern royal family.
One good thing about sightseeing in Stockholm is that a lot of the famous architecture and historical sights reside near one another within the city. Coming out from the backdoor of the Royal Palace, I was directly facing Gamla Stan, the medieval old town. Ochre-colored houses sit close to one another while busy restaurants, cafes, boutiques, and souvenir shops occupy the aged, cobblestone streets.
Just as I ventured into Gamla Stan, jet lag suddenly hit me. Unable to keep my eyes open and my body properly functioning, I needed a good, strong coffee americano to continue my journey. And that was when the “accident” took place.
“Can you pass me my wallet in the bag?”
“Yeah, sure. Just one second. But wait…where is my bag?”
“What do you mean, ‘where is your bag?’ You put it right under the table.”
“It’s not there anymore…”
After resting a bit in a small café in Gamla Stan, while going through the photos I had taken throughout the day, my mom and I noticed that our bag, which I had left under the table, had disappeared. Yep, that’s right, I lost the entire backpack on the first day of travelling. Deprived of wallets, travel documents, sunscreen, sunglasses, and basically everything needed for travelling, we were left with the one credit card that I had kept in my pocket.
Though upset at the situation, I was nevertheless surprised and comforted by the warmth of the locals. After hearing about what happened, the owner of the café ran out to comfort my mom and communicate with the local police. As I was running around the medieval alleys, circulating back and forth between fountains, statues, and small churches, looking into trash cans to see if our travel documents were at least thrown out, two shop owners sitting along the streets joined my search and started digging through the trash cans as well. However, our effort was futile in the end.
Frustrated and tired, we wandered aimlessly from Gamla Stan to the city’s central port. It was already around 6 PM, but the sunshine showed no trace of dimming, and it cast a golden tint over the entire cityscape. With an average height of five stories and a unified yellow-orange color theme, the buildings, which were mostly constructed in the 17th century, resembled each other in architectural style. Between the buildings, cobblestone paths ran across the city plane while locals immersed themselves in thoughts and conversations alongside the river.
Suddenly, upon spotting a group of people dressed in suits and gowns congregating in front of a tour boat, we decided to find out what was happening. One of the crew members explained that this was a weekly cruise tour that served fresh shrimp and seafood platters but also required a reservation at least one month in advance. Disappointed and ready to leave, we were once again surprised by “fate.” Another crew member who overheard our conversation called us back and told us that one couple had canceled their reservation last-minute due to an emergency, and that we could hop on if we wanted. Without a second of hesitation, my mom and I advanced.
After boarding the ship, we were welcomed by an ivory tablecloth, crystal wine glasses, and a sweet floral aroma in the air. The waiters soon seated us along the window and displayed the menu, which included shrimp scampi, salmon, and champagne. It was around 8 PM when the cruise sailed out of the port and started roaming gracefully through the islands during golden hours. Surrounded by fresh seafood, sunset, and nature, the lost bag was already out of my mind. From the reflective river, to the cottages hidden in nature, to the modern luxury apartments, everything seemed like an impressionist painting under the violet-blue infused sky.
Ever since I came back, I have been wondering what was so mesmerizing about Stockholm. What made me want to revisit again and again, even after my little “accident”? The answer is clear to me now, as I am recalling the memories and images in my mind: it’s the infinite possibilities one can encounter in this magical city.

Everyone will tell you eating out in Stockholm is expensive, but is quite manageable if think more about how locals eat. After exploring some great free activities, this part of the post will be more focused on the affordable eats :) :
As a foodie, I did not go all the way kebab and sandwich (like I did when I first traveled in Europe 10 years ago). You can also see my reviews about restaurant (actually, pretty affordable, even feel cheap from my Hong Kong perspective) and eating tradition (fika ❤) in my other post here with a map of restaurants that I ate at.
Lunch is the main meal where locals would eat out, and for a good amount of them, it is the main meal for them (eat more at lunch, and skip dinner… this reminds me of my parents). All-you-can-eat are actually not an uncommon option for them and available around the city and decent price (from SEK100 to mid SEK range if you’re eating during the lunch time; some places have discount for early diners).
We went to two all-you-can-eat and one of them we just love! (The other is very good for value, too).
As mentioned in Part 1 of this post, I found this place a heaven on earth! It has also come top in most of the (English) reviews. This is the first buffet where I could taste the difference in each dish and within each dish, each ingredient!
My brother and I are both picky eater, and it is the only place where we love everything (my brother hates pickle and I dislike beetroot in general, but we enjoyed them there). They do have some interesting combination of spices that I would not have thought about but turned out well.
My personal favourites are the lasagna (they made me break my low carb diet a bit), the curry and their BUTTER (I mean margarine).
Apart from great food, you can also enjoy a great view of the city from Hermans, they are pretty popular, so good luck in finding a good table.
After a day being a vegetarian, we went back to our meat lover mode. We went to another highly rated all-you-can-eat that specialized in grilled meat for lunch. Everyday, they will have 3 mains (on our day, it was beef, lamb meat loaf and fish). with a salad selection.
Taste wise I’d say it is not as flavourful as Hermans. However, you can taste the meat (it is not a rare thing here in HK where you can’t taste what you eat). I like all the 3 mains, but like the fish the most. Among everything there, my favourite is the grilled carrot and the mushroom sauce.
I read that the food is prepared from a charcoal grill. I honestly couldn’t tell, but then, they definitely deliver a good meaty, hearty lunch in the CBD at a low price.
For more options (especially if you wouldn’t mind Asian), you can take a look at this and this.
If a sit down lunch is a bit out of budget or simply out of time, you are lucky. Stockholm is a great place for street food with a lot of good roadside grills, food stand and food trucks offering American, Mexican, Middle Eastern food and more.
If you’re determined to look for the food truck, I will definitely recommend you to follow this article and download the apps. We did not do it, and have wasted like an hour’s time to search for truck that are not out on the day.
After one hours’ walking we decided to go for the stand. Our original pick was Nystekt Stromming; however it moved (damn you Google) and we did not know the new location was actually very close… (like across the bridge kind of close). Just walking across the bridge to the old town and you’re there.
Instead of walking across the bridge, we walked to the metro and went to Ostermalms Korvspecialist.
Although not our first choice, this small hot dog stand where chef eats did not disappoint. It has a generous amount of freshly grilled and tasty sausage, but the best part is the bread.
Unlike your regular hot dog, the bread wrap the sausage like a pocket. It makes it easier to eat and also easier to eat both bread and sausages together. The baguette is rightly toasted, very crispy on the outside and still soft on the inside (however much that’s left for the inside).
Another thing that I like about them is their sauerkraut does not taste too strong and would not overpower their sausage.
One hotdog is around SEK50–70, and is enough to feed one adult of reasonable appetite. The staff is quite friendly and I would recommend you to ask for recommendation.
Apart from the fried herring burger, some other fast food that I planned to eat but missed this time are kebab, kebab pizza and falafel. I will be back for you guys (waving)!
This one I can only contribute a little bit, as I did the research but didn’t try that our myself.
There are 2 types of food halls in the world — expensive one and affordable ones. If you go to a food court not because of price but the variety or experience, you could go for more upscale food hall like Östermalms Saluhall.
It might be a good idea if you are planning to buy some fresh food to cook at home.
For the rest of us who are looking for cheap in food halls, the following comes up in my research (in order of popularity):
Ok, if you are really on a budget, picnic is a great idea when the weather allows it.
There are plenty of beautiful green area and parks in Stockholm and you can leisurely enjoy your food in a park. Go for a cheaper supermarket and some of them, like urban deli, also have hot food for sale (if you don’t have anywhere to cook).
Essentially, afterwork is like happy hour, except that some bar would have a small (free) buffet of food. Check out the bars on your way!
For every city, there is definitely places that are affordable if you search for it. Generally, Middle Eastern food (check out my post on my Turkish dinner!), and Asian (which I did not take) would be cheaper. Bar maybe a good options, too. I had 1/2 kg of reasonably good mussels at around SEK165. Also, not to forget you always have your beloved IKEA as an option (although it’s a bit out of the way… who cares with the free shuttle?).
One thing I notice is that, do not follow Tripadvisor (and Yelp!) as most of the reviewers are from a few countries (unless you are their fellow country people), and most of the time, the price tag and review is skewed. I skipped all the results from Tripadvisor.
Another interesting find is Facebook does make decent recommendations! I actually discovered 2 of the places I like through them!
On to the next and last part of this series: how to get around Stockholm cheap (apart from walking and swimming).
Feeling full just from reading? You can also go back to the first part to take a look at all the free activities :)
Just to let you know, I relied on the following posts to gather idea on food :) :

Björn Ståhl, Founding Partner, Uncommon Stockholm said: “We will focus on brands that people in the real world are glad exist. These brands are uncommon and they can make a difference like never before. I’ve admired what Nils, Lucy and Natalie have been building at Uncommon for some time and we can’t wait to continue their impact and partner together in Stockholm.”
Natalie Graeme, Co-founder at Uncommon Creative Studio added: “Björn, Mia and Max have the perfect balance — they each bring a unique quality and their collective experience is impressive. They see the world the same way we do and match our ambition at Uncommon. We’re thrilled to welcome them into the fold and couldn’t think of better partners to venture into Stockholm with.”
Six years in, the studio continues to make awarded and stand-out work winning its first Grand Prix at this year’s Cannes Lions for its groundbreaking campaign with British Airways.
Notably work also includes creating the most recognised mental health initiative in the UK with ITV, to creating a globally infamous free suit hire initiative for H&M — The One Second Suit, to help young men find work, to redefining what the Nike Jordan brand means today launching during the 23’ NBA All-Star Weekend through the eyes of an aspiring female baller.
The studio has always believed in creativity — applying its founding principles of building brands that matter — acts rather than advertising. The studio has built successfully portfolios across experience, CX, design and production — with Uncommon producing its first feature documentary with renowned director Andrew Dominik for Nick Cave and Warren Ellis’ ‘This Much I Know To Be True’ premiering at Berlinale and SXSW and achieved critical acclaim including The Guardian’s Film of the Week as well as being listed in NME’s top films of the year. Its second feature ‘In Camera’ is in the running for Best First Feature at the upcoming annual BFI London Film Festival.
Though the Studio was set up with a clear point of view and purpose, it also wanted to explore a new business model. Rather than just working for clients, if the studio saw a concept that deserved to exist, it would back it. So far the studio has launched the world’s first fully compostable coffee capsule Halo Coffee, a sexual wellness brand SEX BRAND launching with the UK’s most sustainable condom and most recently Communion — a new money saving app on a mission to unlock the freedom associated with the act of saving.
Uncommon also invested in the purpose-driven accelerator Unrest — to support diverse and sustainable businesses. Since its launch two years ago, it has helped 47 startups, raising £7.2M with a total valuation of £110M.

( This piece started in February, finished in June.)
Day 34. It has been more than a month since the experiential heat in the Lion City.
I don’t quite miss home yet, but it’s long enough for me to see stark differences between both cities and culture.
Facial features. Architecture. Museums. Weather. Snow. Winter.
2. Transportation
Metro. Subway. T-bana. Pendeltåg. Train. Escalator. Reliable. Not reliable. like SMRT? And not everyone has a car.
3. Working culture
Fika means put down your stuff and gather for Coffee Break. Phone-usage is a no-no, Socialising is encouraged.Lunch is Lunch. Work is Work. Party is Party. Work-Life Balance. And we take out our shoes when we are in office.
4. Social norms
More reserved. Strangers rarely say Hi. Yet seemed nice after the ‘ice has been broken’. Cashiers are the friendliest.
5. Standard of Living
Singapore is expensive. Deal with it. Stockholm is expensive too (including student hostels). In fact one of the most expensive in Scandinavia/Europe. High taxation. High expenditure on food, drinks, party. Then again, their wages are high as well.
I have met a couple of Singaporeans who got married and settled/is settling in here at Stockholm. Their stories are pretty amazing.
The city is beautiful, Swedes/locals lead less stressful lives, welfare and happiness are never taken for granted.
Perhaps Singapore can learn more from them.If I do have some form of political/social power, I will attempt to change some things back home. Change, is the only constant.

Stockholm, basically a town that is built across little islands at the spot where the fresh waters connect with the salty waters, is, in a way, soaked to the bone with olden tales. That starts from those brave Viking settlers going on, through to big posh palaces plus tales about brave actions at critical times; the Swedish main town gives you that grabbing feel for times of old. Instead of plainly peeking around at sites — why not set out on an immersive day of delight taking one the various history-based days out that Stockholm has available. With many things to select, where should one begin, you could be asking? But don’t stress about this at all! I kinda made this brief rundown of great historical picks found inside Stockholm that, in a way, promises super good times will be had! Let’s ready that travel kit, step on way-back ride machines, let’s get the facts popping coming directly outta those really superb aged settings this grand locale stores carefully! Find the untold experiences of Stockholm simply visit Stockholm’s historical insights just for fun.
So a top choice whilst coming to check the cool times long ago stored in Stockholm definitely asks one see the Vasa boat gallery spot, too! That impressive building protects bits associated to Vasa which stayed surprisingly sound for getting the facts regarding that battleship sinking really fast since making her initial trip going back during 1628. What is rad pertaining that boat could possibly not even revolve ‘round great scales, let’s imagine skilled carvers instead that outstanding piece concerning conserving works after its rescue efforts occurred! Try sensing yourself taking time backwards plus sensing, too, specifically what took ground by taking warships reaching day break for awful occasions took possession. Seeing vast details becomes heart tugging. Certain group programs highlight key bits like politic schemes King Gustavus pushed forward since they also check ship design actions occurring as factors created wreckages plus sunken depths arose also. Give yourself space with watching special booths and rooms particularly renovated cottages or fun playing installations. By really saving change be wise looking at packages visiting all areas offered alongside some guided Vasa Museum tour.
“In every way gaspingly gorgeous! Okay I might have seen news around this one, I just never pictured real views arriving live this! Those specialists presenting, I believe spoke super intelligently and seriously produced vessel memories alive now that felt actually pretty awesome that date! High fives going their means for good experiences!” — Sarah M., History Lover
I tell you those advisors guiding through it basically pour over solid background with interesting tiny tidbits going directly adding charm once drawing images considering existences sailing by sea while onboard ships constructed throughout these days old. I kinda have this sneaky feeling you begin falling breathless as quality happens then also think humbled in knowing tragic ending of some naval thing meeting oceans however having sailed a mile basically; try sinking deeper alongside oceans heritage that instant. Next watch details like they concern themselves uponVasa shipbuilding legacy, hopefully increasing brains inside.
Just that little by slowly disappearing alongside the cuteness found scattered around this town named Gamla Stan basically an area Stockholm says the earliest chapters of lives occur across all these streets is possibly interesting when thinking of the things discovered in all those cool walks during a time of sunshine filled play that takes days really! Paths of rock go spinning close all sides amongst structure of long-lasting nature and paints looking lively inside shades combining that old style mustard yellow alongside reddish exteriors everywhere! That point probably makes something feel beginning directly now across where tales speak around marketers living long ago beside monarchs plotting also not overlooking turns concerning the events inside days of country of Sweden that is her homeland there, specifically now. Person leading usually starts slowly bringing everyone close while discovering alleys almost secretive inside some part, going with gardens unseen generally alongside some gateways never spotted solo now. I’m very very likely that a feeling passes where all footstep has knowledge on this land when that moment arises strolling beside that grand Royal build plus market center Stortorget then possibly not skipping this grand gallery place linked to a guy called Nobel, definitely! Try thinking of crazy trading happenings going wayyy down here across that district as carriages horse guided echoes resounded, hearing quietly all communications hidden. Dig close on past occurrences using this fantastic one to choose alongside me: ahistoric walking tour.
It is cool cause just above what sights pop at eye glance level this place beats full life basically; something seems alive inside that district while moments tick right across history’s grand clock that feels nice and something that might be needed across someone thinking where adventure waits generally; watch some very very cool settings when considering that journey. Know a wide array via a Gamla Stan sites then get shown across paths found created as a pattern thanks a guru showing those points! Basically give yourselves freedoms traveling far time where every uncovered bit plus gripping accounts show themselves out the earliest areas forming spots in capital of Sweden..
In order for a shift for what Stockholm stores by days from long previous: consider watching Sodermalm something pretty awesome discovered toward land reaching off through southern spots past that territory called Gamla. The setting has gradually transformed spanning times right from district reaching at laborers where right now hip elements shoot into show at boutiques created through owners individually or restaurant innovators! This time probably should work seeing together its past history and cool happenings occurring at current that everyone would go through. Next watch the place speak the story beside spots tourists watch plus take that route athidden gems of Stockholm and more.
FeatureBrief Talk Over Here:Times Older!Look out closely how previous times got formed alongside that location known also how events got switched spanning each age for information really?Cooler WaysSeriously taste all feeling known while there really that communities existing art besides some occasions at night having wild nature maybe?Artwork Design!View things that combine little tiny shelters built vintage style versus a few building towers or fun sketches seen through street roads you probably should understand!.Tastes!Really eat meals together those ones known plus various international type you’ve spotted!.
Then walk down avenues at places having good skyline views whilst tales about those big influencers appearing at that area begin sounding now! Maybe just maybe you’ll begin passing some very boho alleys known really also known toward the “SoFo”. Now after hard job hours became stories: one regarding transformation where today the site stores culture those two things make one say one thing “strength”. View way existences have expression inhistoric Sodermalm charm: what richness is being created upon her soil.!
I bet going off that loudness that forms the town and try taking trips going smoothly onboard moving river vessels is a brilliant way how someone visits”Drottningholm,” something awesome that world watches through a protection association!. This impressive place appears really like that district”Versailles” through parts throughout Stockholm that protects the king, as a normal event. View wide space insides but wander down to sweet outside spots whilst something big concerning heritage plays there. A few times those presenting moments bring up happenings belonging at crown persons around that location-parties seen here? Think super persons making places exist, as artwork and something adorning her style! See it there maybe alongside: Swedish royalty and you can do more..
Regardless if people grasp parts regarding royal persons around that spot or others liking forms formed inside spots plus a spot silent arriving by, land with those Palaces offer you moments remembered really! Next take moments guiding yourself where insights start becoming real upon palace grounds Stockholm since moments begin arriving over ground where events play regularly really really..
After reviewing these picks above; comes time we watch place making local residents feel Stockholm is “theirs” (sort off, kinda)? This thing there becomes a place they watch as local authority area still also a piece holding values throughout ground: how prizes that person “Nobel” gets will get honors in days occurring here at a moment year for year. Through showing moment tours occurring here? Through these times begin people watching space appearing huge or art-full or something appearing metallic too- scenes created through all through area as the mother territory stands, known as Sweden! Be open learning things in area- but look how area stands out as strong from plans throughout the long era since then too!!! For spots known building big from history try booking: Stockholm historic buildings ahead and maybe go now.
Making those memories here feels maybe nice through one thing: see those booking occurring containing spot climbing to great levels, too probably. Look up all round location where beautiful events might just knock feet from floor when something plays up there as one watches!
Now those people who begin that part (those tourists) in soil that keeps culture- then the colors looking so attractive becomes super in area they enter really then that moment really forms really awesome sensation. So after times getting big meanings next feelings form right on then next someone getting tours together feels maybe okay through seeingswedish national heritage really!?.

I take the blue line, change to the green one in T-Centralen, and go down in Slussen. I glance through the windows of the galleries while walking through Hornsgatan. I was planning to watch the sunset from the viewpoint at Skinnarviksparken but the weather is not on my side and by the time I get there, dark clouds fill the horizon. I sit down on a bench to watch the snowflakes descend.
At five twenty, I go down and walk along the empty sidewalk next to the water. At some point, it stops snowing and I decide to continue my stroll to Gamla Stan, the old city in the center of Stockholm. The view of the Kungsholmen shore is gorgeous. It has been about a year and a half since the last time I passed through here. One gets too caught up in the routine and life goes by fast.
I continue walking to Rådhuset to take the blue line back home. By the time I am halfway, the dense dark clouds completely erase the lights of the Södermalm district. I can barely see the tower of the Stadhuset next to me. A blizzard covers the city on a white veil. My footprints don’t last more than a few seconds and I stop several times to clean the ice from my glasses.
I finally make it to the blue line and I am back in the warmth of my room a few minutes later. The snowstorm continues outside as if it was to last forever. I sit down in front of my desk and find refuge in the pages of my journal.
I like to write. I have been compiling journals for fifteen years. I write to put my thoughts into words and bring structure and clarity to my mind. I write to immortalize my memories, my beliefs, my stories. We are storytellers after all. We need stories to communicate, to give meaning to the world, and to make sense of our existence.
I leaf through the soft ivory paper of my journal and realize how the last months have been embedded into just a few pages. In contrast, when I go further back to my time as a traveler, several pages are needed to capture a single day of wander: the things I do, the places I visit, the colorful streets, and the different tastes and aromas of a new city, and the conversations I have with the people I meet. Paragraphs pile up and my hand write deteriorates as I rush to capture these experiences before they are altered or, even worse, forgotten by my fragile memory.
I look through the window as the ephemeral snow particles dance to the sound of the wind. I don’t want my days to go by helpless, at the mercy of the wind of life. I fear the moment I wake up and realize that decades have passed and I am still the same person.
I think about Memoirs of Hadrian, a novel by the Belgian writer Margarita Yourcenar. On his deathbed, Hadrian writes a letter to Marcus Aurelius, his future successor. The text recounts the wisdom the Roman Emperor has accumulated throughout different episodes of his life. Particularly, Hadrian declares that there are three ways to learn about human existence: through our own experience, through the experiences of others, and through books.
As a travel enthusiast, I cannot help but relate Margarita’s words to traveling.
By traveling, we leave behind our comfort and dive into the unknown. We expose ourselves to different environments and diverge from our beliefs, values, and prejudices. By traveling, we interact with the people we meet. We engage in conversations and dive into their stories. We learn to see the world through their eyes and add their experience to our own. By reading, we travel to different narratives. We learn from the stories of those who lived in distant times. We are entrusted with their stories to make them our own.
And yet all these perspectives remain incomplete. We see the world from the narrow lenses created by the conditioning our environment has provided. Even books carry the prejudices of the pen. Nevertheless, a rich life is born out of the combination of these incomplete stories.
Life is about feeding our stories through new experiences, rich conversations, and good books that change our narratives. To lead a life that cannot be reduced to just a few pages.

Stockholm, Sweden….A few weeks ago I hopped aboard a plane and headed to Sweden for the weekend. The truth is that Sweden has never been high on my wish list radar, as a destination, so I just have been skipping it year after year. However, living in Poland, Sweden has a huge advantage as a holiday destination. It is located so close to my homeland that it is easy to visit. I only need to cross the Baltic Sea and I’m there. The plane tickets to Sweden are usually bloody cheap … if only the weather there could be better.
Weather is always a strange thing. Every time I visit the Polish coast and look North, it seems that Sweden has better weather, as there are usually no clouds on the horizon. But the reality is far different. The weather in Sweden is cold and windy most of the year, except in summer. I didn’t want the Scandinavian weather to deceive me as I booked my ticket. I hoped that the sun would have mercy on me and would appear in Sweden during my stay. Sure enough, the weather had its way! I left sunny Poland and landed in quite a cloudy Sweden. During my stay, the sun tried to defeat the clouds but failed. My consolation was that it did not rain.
My motto is “like the places to which you travel and appreciate that you can visit them, no matter what”. Seems to me, as a traveller, that we should want to go everywhere and find something interesting anywhere. Consequently, I always try to see the best in each country I visit. Before going to Scandinavia my number one wish, while there was to experience the fjords! But that’s in Norway. Thinking which Scandinavian city would be my number one choice, I had a feeling it would be Stockholm. Now, after returning home, I can confirm 100%, that to me, Stockholm is absolutely the number one city in Scandinavia.
Nordic cities in my opinion are hit or miss. You love or hate them. They don’t have many landmarks, are very expensive and at first glance, they look just boring. Nordic cities such as Oslo, Helsinki, Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Reykjavík share one thing in common. They are coastal cities. I usually love cities bordering on a body of water, as a relationship with water adds a whole new dimension to city life … and Stockholm has lots of water!
People say that Stockholm is the Venice of the North. The city is spread out over 14 islands, that are connected by 57 bridges, with an eye towards my beloved Baltic Sea to the East. There’s something incredibly soothing about almost always having water in sight and that makes Stockholm a nice destination to explore on foot. It is pleasant to stroll when you are never more than a stone’s throw away from the water. There’s so much water everywhere that sometimes it seems like there’s more water than land. Hence, it may seem that there are more boats than cars, in the city. They are moored to the shore and sway on the gentle waves.
But such a picturesque location has also cons. A few times I found it slightly annoying to not be able to get somewhere, located just a few meters away from me, just because there was no bridge exactly where I needed it, and I had to walk around a channel, that made the way much longer.
All in all, I think that water is what makes Stockholm charming. It makes the air feel fresher and clearer. Waterworks for Stockholm especially when the day gives way to the evening. Sunset in Stockholm is a magical time. It is so nice to be near the water when the sun is setting and see Stockholm in its magic hour.
The second thing that struck me the most about the city was the colour. Everywhere, from the gems of the Old Town to more modern architecture, colour seems to be present on every surface. I think that the colours are Stockholm’s heaviest weapon against gloomy and cloudy weather. There is no logic or scheme to the colours of buildings, as they would have never been treated as a wholeness, but as individuals.
It’s more expensive than Paris and London, but it’s not as expensive as people expect. I spent most of my money on food. I’m glad that I had a hotel breakfast at the price of my room because going out for a meal more often than once a day would have ruined my budget.
The silence in Stockholm really hits you when you arrive. The cars seem to move in a silent mode and there is almost a hushed feeling everywhere.
Sweden’s capital city is a 700-year-old European city. It attracts many visitors each year looking to experience Sweden’s largest city, however, there were fewer tourists than I expected. Thanks to that Stockholm has a very relaxed feel. There are not many people on the streets and sometimes it seemed to me, that I had Stockholm, just to myself.
The city has an atmosphere that is very calm compared to other European capitals. Perhaps it is the people living here. Most Swedes seem patient and quiet. Maybe it’s because there are so many open spaces and of course water. Maybe it is because of the history felt in the air. Or maybe because the buildings are so colourful and in some way, they force you to stop and stare at them. Maybe it’s all of this put together…..

I just got back from my two-week trip across most of Northern Europe. This is my third trip back to Europe. (My first was a summer abroad in Italy nearly 8 years ago and my second was another two-week trip in 2014 where we explored Dublin, London, Amsterdam, and Paris.) I daresay this was the best so far! Thom and I visited Stockholm, Copenhagen, Berlin, and again, Amsterdam this time around. In order to share our experience and to create a living record of its details, I’ve decided to write across a few posts on each city and its adventures. This first post serves to detail our overall travel plans, information on flights/places to stay, tips on light packing, and general advice for good travel. I should mention that I’m not an expert on any other these things but it’s worth sharing the little knowledge that I gained before, during, and after this trip.
To begin with, here are a few starting facts about our trip:
Let’s begin by discussing budget flights. Nine months before this vacation even happened I found some non-stop flights from Oakland to Stockholm for $600 a person. These flights kicked off the entire trip and made everything possible. I recall the very first time I ever flew to Europe. (Which was 8 years this summer!) It was to Genoa, Italy from Buffalo, NY. That flight had three stops (Buffalo to NYC, NYC to Frankfurt, and Frankfurt to Milan) and one train (Milan to Genoa) in order to get to my destination with a total of over 20+ hours at a hefty price of $1500. (Thanks Aer Lingus! 🖕) So to come across a flight that was only 10 hours and non-stop to my choice destination, it felt like fate...
Doesn’t that last sentence feel so inspiring? Statements and facts like those are the gold and shiny wrapper on the cheap bar of travel chocolate. Here’s the nitty-gritty of budget flying:
With some of the add-ons and extra taxes, our $600 tickets actually came to $711.30 a person. Our in-between flights from city to city were around $50 a person. (As compared to a train from Berlin to Amsterdam which was $120 a ticket.) In the end, you have to deal with the minor annoyances for that 💰deal.
Let’s move on to transportation.
Thom and I took public transit for the most part. (I’ll discuss the bicycling and Uber rides a bit later in some of my city posts.) For us, it’s a fun challenge learning a new city’s public transit. And unlike American public transportation, European public transportation is fast, convenient, and very, VERY reliable. Upon arriving at the Arlanda Airport, which is located just outside of Stockholm, we took the Arlanda Express Train that runs directly to the city center in just 20 minutes. (As compared to my 1.5 hour MUNI and BART trip to Oakland International Airport. 😑) Out of the four cities we visited, Berlin boasted the fastest and most reliable transportation (dat German innovation) with Amsterdam coming in at a close second. (Trams, trams everywhere!) All the trams, trains, and buses that we took were clean and clearly marked. My only complaint was the summer heat which was especially felt in the enclosed and non-air conditioned trains.
I plan to discuss each Airbnb in detail for each city post but in general our decision to use this service came from a few points:
Finally, let’s talk about packing. Much like my last Europe trip, I took a single backpack and personal bag with me. That was it! Now that this trip is over, I can say, quite proudly, that it was the best decision that I made for packing. After each city we visited, Thom and I both got a little better at packing our bags. It was a very efficient way to travel, IMO.
Here are some pros:
I admit that there are some cons involved with this kind of packing. While I can pack a mean bag, it doesn’t exclude the fact that the weight gets to you…no matter how light. If you’ve ever landed at an airport and took public transit into a city, the transfers mean a lot of walking between terminals and stations. The weight of the bag can cause a lot of stress on your neck and shoulders. Even this year, I packed a bag that weighed about 8 lbs total and after a while, say 20 minutes of walking, it can really push down on you. I should mention that my bag isn’t meant for hiking or true backpacking and therefore isn’t super ergonomic. I’m sure if I had chosen a small hiking backpack, my experience would be different. The bag that I took is just an everyday backpack for commuting which is why long walks with a lot of weight can easily become a small burden.
Backpacking can also force you to make some crucial decisions as to what you pack. One small error (should I bring a bathing suit?) and you’ll be forced to carry that item throughout the entire trip with much resentment. The last time we were in Europe, it rained for most of the trip. Thom brought an umbrella this year. He never needed it! 😂 🙃 Lessons learned.
A few surprising things that we did bring this year are:
I’ve only really traveled internationally in the summer months so packing has always been dictated by the warmer weather. I took mainly dresses with a single pair of jeans and shorts. A few shirts to mix it up and a hoodie with a jean jacket for cooler evenings/days. I took a pair of black flats since they’re so versatile and my Keds for comfort as I walked/biked everywhere. I kept toiletries to small sizes and bought anything else that might have run out.
Thom and I failed to exchange any currency prior to the trip. But I would recommend making that order with your bank if possible since ATMs abroad will charge you a fee for any withdrawals. Also, make the obligatory call to your bank letting them know that you are traveling abroad so that they don’t lock your card and account.
A kind co-worker provided us an extra SIM card and we had another already from past trips, so this year we both had data/service for our phones. Thankfully our SIM cards were both purchased in the Netherlands with Vodaphone. These cards worked in all the other countries we visited and we didn’t need to purchase new cards along the way.
Finally, I’ll add that we obtained Global Entry prior to the trip. It made entering the US very easy and fast when going through customs. If you are a frequent international flyer, consider getting Global Entry. Global Entry includes TSA PreCheck. So if you fly around the country frequently (which I do), it’s very convenient and handy for jumping those long security lines.
This post is a part of a series based on my recent two-week trip to Europe.

3C for describing Stockholm: cold, cool, culture. Its historical background, architecture, fashion, style, traditional foods, and of course ABBA, all make it so cool! It can be also called ‘North Venice’ because of the 14 islands.
We went to Stockholm by Flixbus departed from Copenhagen. It was night and long ride, besides I spent the night awake because of my flu and I really terrified about the journey. The road was empty without lightning… Also, our bus was moving fast. Uh, terrifying…
We started the city tour with Riddarholmen Church which has a thousand years of history.
We sat on the benches around the church, watching Stockholm architecture.
We watched the iconic Södermalm view. Like a postcard…
Gamla Stan: best for the time traveling…
Narrow streets, yellow colors, cinnamon smells… It makes me feel like I am in a different zone.
Me and my friend exploring the city by walking, climbing hills and from the beginning of the city tour, we constantly arguing about which city is better… Copenhagen or Stockholm? We are counting the pros and cons. However, it is an inconclusive debate. After wandering around the Gamla Stan’s old streets, another debate… Does it look like Florence? Then, we are sitting on a bench watching the Baltic Sea, talking about how can we do more efficient things, and be successful in our aims. I guess, this is Stockholm energy. Not syndrome… but this city has effects on people.
I ticked eating Swedish Meatballs in Sweden and going to Ikea in Sweden off on the bucket list. It was the first time I’ve eaten meatballs with sweet lingonberry jam (it was great). I also had Kladdkaka, Kanelbulle and irrelevantly, fortune cookies. All of them were delicious…
We passed through the Øresund Bridge which is so impressive, like diving into the middle of the sea. We are surrounded by only blue: sea and sky. Furthermore thanks to our Flixbus Driver, he was playing the Swedish Eurovision song: Loreen — Tatto. It was pretty unforgettable for me since I listened to this song hundreds of times and never thought I would be listening to this in the main country. (I know the photo is not very good, but I recorded videos and enjoyed the moment.)
Overall
Stockholm is so suitable for a student budget. I was expecting extreme prices, but I was wrong. Especially the souvenirs’ and Ikea’s food prices were acceptable. I want to visit Stockholm again with a rich budget and at that time I must stay at least 3 nights, attend to Stockholm Ghost Walk and Historical Tour, go to the Skansen Open Air Museum and ABBA Museum, appreciate subway art, go to Birka the Viking city, having Fika in a warm, cozy place with enjoying the Northern snow.
Regards, Ozlem.

To be honest, I wasn’t too pleased when I saw the temperature in Stockholm was going to be -5 degrees celsius. But I’m not one to turn down an opportunity to experience different cultures and meet new people. The view from the plane window pretty much confirmed that I was in for a cold couple of days. Sweden from the sky was pretty much blanketed in snow, with forests, motorways and buildings adding speckles of colour to the pure white landscape. Stockholm’s temperature was as expected — FREEZING — but admiring the beautiful architecture as we walked to the office made me temporarily forget this fact.
One of the great things about using Slack at Manifest is how it renders borders immaterial. It’s not perfect and working in different time zones does present its challenges, but being able to meet up with a colleague in a different country and pick-up where you left off on Slack is a great plus.
We like to believe everything is better in Sweden, and while that’s mostly true (I say mostly because the weather ain’t better) I have to say, the coffee machine at our Stockholm office is straight out of Star Trek. To hell with cafetieres and capsules, this baby uses an iPad touchscreen to brew you some of the best tasting Americanos I’ve ever had. We need to figure out a way to set one up in London too. It might even make me do a tea round….once or twice.
Our short time in Stockholm was spent darting from meeting to meeting. We had a couple of new business meetings interspersed with meeting existing clients. I’ve got to say, the half day we spent with Houdini was probably the most inspired I’ve been in my five years at Manifest. It’s not often you sit in a room where everyone is extremely passionate about what they do and where they want their company to go. I’m proud to be working with such a visionary brand, and you can bet you’ll hear a lot more from them in the coming months.
I cannot write a blog about Sweden without mentioning delicious Swedish meatballs and aquavit. Aquavit (literal meaning: water of life) is an important part of Scandinavian drinking culture. We were treated to a Swedish folk song by Anna and Josefine before downing a shot of the drink. Much to the surprise of the Swedes, Alex and myself did not seem at all perturbed by the 37% ABV beverage. We both have strong constitutions, and attempting to drink us under the table is never wise.
After meetings were done, I had the opportunity to explore more of Stockholm over the weekend- it’s truly a stunning city, one I hope to be visiting often… during warmer months.
Manifest has offices in Stockholm, London and New York and we’re recruiting. So, if you fancy joining our international family check out our careers page.

I belong in a gang of 4. Four colleagues, friends and something more than that. Anna, the 1/4 of our gang, spent (and she still has a month there) this semester in Stockholm, Sweden, as an Erasmus student.So the rest of us decided to visit her, have some fun all together in Stockholm and discover this Scandinavian city.
I have tons of stories to tell you about that trip, so I’m gonna keep it simple and write about the most important stuff in bulletpoints and also post along some photos we shot so that I give you a better understanding of what was going on.

Finally, I have to say that it was an awesome trip overall! Of course this was special for my and my mates, because we were all together, but I bet you’re gonna love this city no matter what!

I’m a US expat living in Stockholm since 2018. Originally lived in central Stockholm, now living in the burbs. A co-worker once asked me for tips on what to do when they were coming over for a visit. I typed up something, and later another and another person asked, each time I pulled up the old doc, and maybe made some additions. On the most recent instance of this, I realized I could probably just publish this for anyone to find.
If I had to narrow it down to 3 easy things, I’d do Moderna Museet (free), Fotografiska (~$20), and a walk through Gamla Stan.
Quick list of things to do:
Museums:
Sightseeing:
Restaurants:Swedish food
Really good sushi
Mexican
Steak
Choose Uber over cabs when in the city (seriously might be faster to take a scooter though 🙃). If you must use a cab only use these companies: Taxi Stockholm 150000, Taxi Kurir, Sverigetaxi. Most of the others will rip you off (my wife got charged $50 for a 8min ride). For getting from the airport, the Arlanda Express is a direct train to central stockholm, that only takes 18 minutes; you can buy the tickets online or at the airport, and you get a big discount for buying them as a group. A cab to/from would be ~30-40min depending on traffic.

Designing with AI: Reflections from a Night with Miro’s CEO in Stockholm,https://medium.com/@ajithachellam/designing-with-ai-reflections-from-a-night-with-miros-ceo-in-stockholm-c5e94f35b368,"Sign up

On Tuesday, 24th of June I attended an intimate fireside chat in Stockholm with Miro CEO Andrey Khusid, alongside Armin Catovic (Head of AI at Aloi and Vice Chair at Stockholm AI) and Elena Verna, Head of Growth at Lovable. Andre spoke about creativity, product leadership, and what it means to build with purpose in the age of AI. This blog is my attempt to capture that moment: for myself, for other designers navigating similar questions, and for anyone trying to make sense of where we’re all headed next.
“It’s a dance. A dance between humans and AI.”
I liked how Andrey used the word dance and not collaborators. It blew my mind when Andrey introduced the new AI features of Miro and introduced this concept of Canvas as a prompt.
“Some of us think in text. Some think in tables. Some in images. Some in handwriting. AI can translate between all these formats.”
It made me reflect on my own process. How often do I get stuck on one way of seeing things — one visual, one narrative, one iteration. This new dance invites us to explore the edges, to try “what if” scenarios we might not have considered. That’s not just productivity. That’s power. It’s not about outsourcing creativity. It’s about augmenting our intuition with speed, synthesis, and scale. And maybe, just maybe, creating space for more meaningful work.
This night wasn’t just about Miro. It was about the larger wave of transformation pulsing through the city, and one of the clearest signals of that was from Lovable. It was exciting to hear from Elena Verna about how Lovable as an entire company is AI-first, not just the product, but the tooling, workflows, culture, and even mindset.
They recently ran a weekend hackathon where anyone could use Lovable’s tools to build with three major LLMs. More than 2.5 million people created something just in a weekend. It was a strong message to startup founders to scale to the top. And simply, people are looking for a simple and easy product when it comes to digital experiences. Lovable is simple and people love it.
And perhaps that’s what makes Stockholm special right now: it’s not just building tools; it’s building momentum. Hmm, what a great time to be here at the center of tech innovation!
When I was working on the book Catch the Feeling, we discussed a lot about ‘sameness’. With AI-generated content, there is a general play of sameness in designs, products and content that is out. With this thought in mind, we had a question from the room,
What happens when everyone uses the same tools, the same AI models, the same prompts? Will we all just end up building the same thing?
Andrey replied,
“What makes the difference, is human empathy, point of view, and taste.”
It can accelerate your process, suggest alternatives, and synthesize patterns, but if you don’t show up with a strong perspective, it’ll just give you more of what everyone else is getting. In a world of infinite output, originality comes from the courage to have a point of view. Being human!
My friend Jaydatta is doing his Master's Thesis about decision making in Swedish startups. We were having a brief discussion about his findings and how actors and factors influence a major decision in a product. Later in the evening, MIRO CEO touched on his decision-making and leadership style.
“I was scared of adding complexity. I didn’t want to overwhelm the user.”
His vision in 2011 was to build the first browser-based whiteboard, and he kept the product as simple as possible. Andre shared how his leadership style had shifted over the years.
From top-down decision-making in the early days, to bottom-up ownership where teams shaped features based on user needs. He held back a key feature, not because they couldn’t build it, but because he believed simplicity was more important. But when the pandemic hit and MIRO was used heavily, he made a drastic shift, focusing on synchronous collaboration.
And now, as Miro matures again, they’re returning to a model where teams can own and shape their areas. But what stays constant, Andre said, is the need for a strong product vision, otherwise, you end up with 25 products inside one. This was a really powerful insight.
There was a question about what are the emerging skills and the right mindset to survive in a transitioning face in tech.
“The companies that thrive will be full of T-shaped people. Those who go deep in one craft, but also know how to connect the dots across disciplines and prompt machines to get the job done.”
That means being a designer who understands marketing. An engineer who thinks in UX. A PM who can sketch a landing page, run a prompt, and launch it in hours. And increasingly, these people won’t be full-time hires. They’ll be fractional experts, brought in for short bursts of high-impact work.
Lovable is already ahead of this curve. With under 50 full-time roles and revenue approaching $100 million, they’re proving what’s possible when AI augments the builders and everyone is trusted to own more.
Andre even predicted something that caught the room off guard: “Compensation will look different. In a few years, the same job title could pay 5x more to the person who brings exponential impact.”
Not because of tenure. But because they know how to leverage tools, think across domains, and ship value fast. The more impact you create in the company, the more compensation!
With big giants in the picture, someone asked a question,
“What if OpenAI builds your product tomorrow and destroys your business?”
Andre simply smiled and said something that brought a lot of hope and smiles in the room.
“We’re not building because we think OpenAI won’t do it. We’re building because we love what we do.”
A truth that often gets lost in metrics, frameworks, and the pressure to always be future-proof. It reminded me that the joy of creation doesn’t disappear just because the landscape changes.
“We might all be a little f**ked,” Andre joked, “but we’re in it together. And we’re still building.” And that, to me, is what this night in Stockholm was about.
Hope it inspired you too, dear reader. Connect with me on LinkedIn to follow my journey.

After many years of choosing busy beach destinations for our summer holidays, this year we decided to embrace the ‘coolcation’ trend and look for an alternative holiday focusing on cooler climates, scenic landscapes, and opportunities for relaxation and mental wellness. If you are also seeking this kind of holiday, then Stockholm should top your bucket list.
Stockholm, the capital of Sweden is a city that beautifully blends innovation, with its rich historical charm. The summer season truly accentuates its allure with extended daylight hours, festivities, nightlife and a bustling ambiance.
We visited Stockholm in June and were fortunate enough to experience some fantastic weather. We chose to stay at the Grand Hôtel, strategically positioned along the waterfront, providing views of both the Royal Palace and Gamla Stan. It served as an excellent base for us to explore all the city’s attractions, the highlights of which are listed below.
What impressed us the most, coming from a Mediterranean country, was the Scandinavian phenomenon of long days. The sun stays up until late into the evening, creating a sense of endless daylight and extending the feeling of a truly prolonged holiday.

On 10th August, 1628, the Swedish navy launched the maiden voyage of the Vasa .The Vasa was part of the military expansion and an expression of Swedish naval power: It was explicitly built at the order of the King of Sweden Gustavus Adolphus, and was richly decorated to show off Swedish might and wealth. No expense was spared. One of the rooms was made to look like the royal palace. There were numerous Roman statues on board, — King Adolphus was sending a message that ‘hey, Sweden is the modern Roman empire’. Upon completion, it was one of the most powerful armed vessels in the world.
August 10 was a calm day, perfect for a launch, with a light breeze from the southwest. It passed the Royal palace, and the gun ports were opened for a Royal salute. When doing so, a gust of wind -nothing crazy — filled its sails and it heeled to the port. It passed some bluffs to the south (Södermalm, for those familiar with the geography). A little later, at Tegelviken, a stronger gust caused it to again heel to the port side — and went past the point beyond which the ship could right itself. The gun ports were open because 1300 meters past its launch, the Vasa sank, and about 30 people died (it included women and children as well, since it was a ceremonial trip around the harbor). It took all of 5 minutes to sink, and a major reason was the lower gun ports were open and water poured in as it heeled. But more on this later.
The Vasa lay on the bottom of the Stockholm harbor for 333 years, before it was successfully raised and the Vasa museum captures its stunning story of mismanagement, in a fashion eerily similar to mismanagement as seen in some modern software companies. I was lucky enough to have a tour through this museum while on a work trip to Stockholm. I would visit Stockholm again just to go back to the museum (though Stockholm has so much to see and do)
The Vasa’s story serves as a powerful metaphor for modern software companies, particularly in how organizational dynamics can lead to technical disaster. Just as Vasa’s builders continued with a fundamentally flawed design due to royal pressure, software teams sometimes proceed with architectures or technical decisions they know are problematic due to executive mandates or market pressures. The tragic part of Vasa’s story is that it was known that it was unlikely to survive its launch. In 1628, the captain arranged for the Vice Admiral to demonstrate its stability. 30 men ran back and forth across the upper deck, and the ship started to roll. The Admiral stopped the test because he was afraid the ship would capsize in the harbor. Does this sound familiar to anyone?
Consider how often we see software projects that are “too big to fail” — platforms or products that have had so much investment and executive attention that stopping to address fundamental issues becomes politically impossible. Like the Vasa’s gun ports being open for a royal salute (a political requirement) directly contributing to its sinking, we often see technical compromises made for business optics that ultimately undermine the product’s stability.
The parallel extends to modern engineering organizations where technical experts — much like the shipbuilders of the Vasa — might recognize fundamental flaws but feel unable to effectively raise these concerns up the chain of command. In both cases, the culture of deference to authority and the pressure to deliver can override technical wisdom. Today’s “royal demands” might come in the form of arbitrary deadlines, feature requirements that compromise system stability, or architectural decisions made to align with executive presentations rather than engineering realities. There is a tendency to ‘drift to failure’ in organizations that show up only when it blows up in their faces.
Most tellingly, just as the Vasa’s builders had proven experience with smaller ships but ran into trouble when scaling up to a larger, more complex vessel, software companies often face challenges when scaling from successful smaller systems to more complex platforms. The same principles that worked at a smaller scale can become catastrophic liabilities when applied without adaptation to larger, more complex systems.
This is a standard practice in product development (my writeup on it can be read here). Well, certainly at every place where I had influence over the process. It is entertaining to turn the 5 Why’s framework on the Vasa to get to root cause: King Adolphus was furious, of course, and the loss of his statement piece, and the loss of the many cannons that were on the Vasa (2 gun decks that can be seen in the photo above — it had 64 cannons). There was a royal inquiry, and no one was found guilty — it would be foolhardy — deadly — to point the finger at the king, who was responsible for the tragedy.
So what would the 5 Why’s for the Vasa look like?
The ship capsized and sank about 1,300 meters into its maiden voyage in Stockholm harbor on August 10, 1628. A light gust of wind caused it to heel (tilt) severely to port. Water rushed through the open gun ports, which were only 1.2 meters above the waterline, flooding the ship and causing it to sink within minutes.
The Vasa was dangerously unstable due to its top-heavy design. The ship carried 64 heavy bronze cannons, mostly on the upper gun deck. More critically, the ship’s ballast (72 tonnes) was insufficient to counterbalance the weight of the upper structure, guns, and heavy decorative sculptures. Stability tests before launch showed the ship was dangerously unstable — it heeled severely when just 30 men ran from side to side.
Despite shipbuilder Jakobsson noting the stability problems during construction, and despite a stability test where the ship dangerously heeled, no significant changes were made. Admiral Fleming, who oversaw the test, feared reporting the full extent of the problems to the king. The shipbuilders and naval officers knew of the issues but proceeded with the launch anyway.
In Swedish society under King Adolphus, challenging royal authority was unthinkable. (Note: This is of course not particular to Swedish culture). The king had personally ordered multiple changes during construction, including the second gun deck and additional heavy bronze cannons. He was deeply involved in the design, viewing the Vasa as a symbol of Swedish naval power. No one, including the shipwright, dared question the kings demands.
Sweden in the 1620s operated under absolute monarchy where the king’s word was literally law. King Adolphus had transformed Sweden into a major military power, leading successful campaigns in the Thirty Years’ War. The hierarchical culture of 17th-century Sweden, combined with the king’s reputation as a militant leader, created an environment where professional expertise was subordinate to royal authority. There was no cultural framework for “speaking truth to power” — the concept itself would have been alien to most 17th-century Swedes.
The fundamental issue was a cultural environment that prioritized deference to authority over technical expertise and safety concerns. This cultural dynamic made it impossible for technical experts to effectively challenge decisions that compromised the ship’s safety, even when they recognized the dangers.
The tragic irony is that Adolphus, despite his direct involvement in the ship’s design changes, never saw the Vasa — he was away on campaign in Poland when it sank. The culture of absolute deference to royal authority operated even in his absence, preventing necessary corrections to a fatally flawed design.
Well, that is the Vasa. And we have many modern day examples. I’d love to hear about your experiences!

Stockholm. A city I had heard of since childhood.
I associated its name with major international agreements, particularly the Stockholm Declaration of 1972 — the very first large-scale world conference to make the environment as a major global issue. It marked the beginning of international environmental governance and laid the foundation for what would later become the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This conference shaped the world’s approach to sustainability and climate action, yet I never imagined that one day, I would walk its very streets where such historic discussions took place.
Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would experience this city firsthand. It still feels surreal that I am here.
What struck me the most when I arrived was the contrast — the weather, the atmosphere, the way of life. Coming from Indonesia, where temperatures soar to 35°C with high humidity, adjusting to Stockholm’s crisp air and freezing winters was a challenge. Even in summer, I find myself trembling while Swedes enjoy the sunshine in shorts and tank tops. The shift from tropical heat to below-zero temperatures was an entirely new physical adjustments and rhythm of life.
But despite the cold, I fell in love with this city. There is a sense of calm, an unspoken rhythm that blends modernity with nature. Stockholm moves at its own pace — not too fast, not too slow.
And then, there’s Fika — the Swedish tradition of taking a break over coffee and pastries. At first, I thought it was just a casual coffee break, but I soon realized it’s much more than that. It’s a moment of pause, of connection, of simply being present. In a world that constantly pushes us to be productive, Fika is a reminder that it’s okay to slow down. This ties into something else I admire about Sweden — their emphasis on work-life balance. Here, taking a break is not seen as laziness but as an essential part of life. People respect their time off, and there is an understanding that rest is just as important as work.
The other thing that fascinated me was the language. The moment I heard Swedes casually chatting in their melodic Swedish, I felt a strange excitement. It was unfamiliar yet intriguing.
But, beyond the language, what truly inspires me about Sweden is its commitment to sustainability. Swedes don’t just talk about being environmentally friendly; they integrate it into their daily lives. Recycling, efficient public transport, and waste reduction are not just trends but ingrained habits. It’s no surprise that the world’s first environmental conference was held in Stockholm in 1972, leading to the establishment of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).
One of the biggest realizations I had was about landfills. My perspective on landfills was shaped by what I had seen in Indonesia, where waste management remains a major challenge. Landfills there often emit a strong odor, appear overwhelming, and lack proper handling. But here, it feels different — the landfill doesn’t smell as strong, the area is well-managed, and waste is systematically processed.
I also learned a lot about organic waste. If we truly want to combat climate change, organic waste should never end up in landfills. Food waste releases methane, a greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide. This realization made me see how small actions — like composting or waste sorting — suddenly felt much more significant.
Living in Stockholm has made me reflect on many things. It has challenged my habits, reshaped my mindset, and broadened my perspective. I’ve learned to embrace silence and to enjoy solitude without feeling lonely. I’ve come to appreciate the power of simplicity — how less can be more and how slowing down can actually bring more meaning.
Nonetheless, this is just the beginning of my journey in Stockholm.
— Fingers crossed for what the future has in store! ❤

Report of the Go Global Mission to Stockholm (25 - 28 October 2017)
As an entrepreneur, it is important to broaden your perspectives and keep an eye out on the world, even more so in this digital world we live and work in every day. Hence, I was very excited to join the Go Global Mission to Stockholm, an organization of startups.be and Jong VOKA Oost-Vlaanderen.
Sweden has been an inspiration for me ever since I became involved with technology and startups. The country has an impressive track record: after Silicon Valley, Sweden has the highest number of unicorns per head of population in the world. Iconic companies like Skype (sold to Microsoft), King (the maker of Candy Crush, IPO), Mojang (the company behind Minecraft, sold to Microsoft) and Spotify (you know Spotify), have all been founded in this Nordic country.
How is this possible? What are the reasons behind Sweden’s overwhelming success? Is this story future proof? 3 days in the country’s lovely capital Stockholm would provide all the answers.
A 2 hour flight from Brussels led us to Bromma, a cozy airport about 20 minutes from downtown Stockholm. Hard to imagine this is the main entrance to a European capital where so much value has been created over the past decade.
First stop on our trip was the Stockholm Fintech Hub, a huge co-working space located conveniently above Stockholm’s central train station. Besides the fancy decoration, I noticed a couple of interesting things here:
Off to a good start!
Our visit to Invest Stockholm gave us a lot of insights on the success of Stockholm. The seeds of the Swedish tech boom were planted in the 90s, when the government subsidized the required infrastructure for the digital age.
First, every household in Sweden was granted a personal computer. Every successful tech entrepreneur of today grew up with a PC! Digital natives avant la lettre.
Second, almost every household in Sweden has fiber internet access. Hard to imagine in Belgium, where to this day the public and private sector are still arguing who is going to make the required investments.
It is clear that government initiatives in the nineties have laid the foundations for the incredible success of the past decade.
The impact of these exits cannot be underestimated. As often happens with successful entrepreneurs, they do not rest on their laurels. After selling Skype, Niklas Zennström went on to found Atomico, now one of the most famous venture capital firms in Europe. Same goes for the founders of King with their fund Sweet Capital.
As a result, there is plenty of capital available to invest in promising startups that might become the unicorns of the coming decade. Success often creates even more success. The future of the Swedish tech ecosystem seems bright.
Some (fun) facts about Sweden:
Day 2 started with the highlight of our trip: a visit to Spotify. The music streaming service has over 50 million paying subscribers and is valued at 16 Bio USD in the private markets. Even though it is still making a loss, it is reportedly preparing its long-awaited IPO for somewhere mid 2018.
Spotify is one of those iconic tech companies of this age. The company, led by the enigmatic founder Daniel Ek, has proven to be an exceptional innovator on multiple levels:
1) Business model innovation: in the wake of illegal P2P networks like Napster and Kazaa, Spotify sought to find a legitimate way to revolutionize the music industry.
2) Technical innovation: the secret sauce to Spotify’s early success was the incredibly fast loading of songs. This was an engineering challenge of enormous size and difficulty. The majority of people at Spotify are still deep tech engineers working to make sure load times stay at this amazing level, even at such a huge scale.
3) Organizational innovation: much has been written and said about Spotify’s organizational model. The concepts of autonomous teams (grouped in squads, tribes & alliances), the agile way of working, the flat organization, … have been widely documented and copied by other tech startups. Many attribute the success of Spotify to this special culture of continuous experimentation and improvement, cultivated by the founders from day 1.
It will be very interesting to see what happens to this culture when Spotify goes public. Not making a profit yet, investor pressure might force it to tighten reigns and start cutting costs.
Later, we paid a visit to Detectify, whose founder notoriously hacked Google and got access to a huge amount of customer data. He received a bounty of 10.000 USD and went on to start a successful company in ethical hacking.
I arrived at the hotel at around 10 pm. Having some energy left in the tank, I put on my running shoes. I really enjoy jogging in big cities. Since there is always something new to discover, you hardly notice you are running after a while.
I ran to the Gamla Stan island where I accidentally bumped into the changing of the guards routine at the royal palace. Quite hilarious and way over the top if you ask me!
This run wasn’t only for sightseeing, though. Last week, I decided I am going to run my first marathon in 2018! There you go, the word is out, no coming back to it now. I couldn’t really miss the second training on my schedule, right…
Day 3 started at Klarna, another Swedish unicorn, active in online payment processing. A couple of years ago, it also received a banking license. We got a presentation about the major branding exercise this company had undertaken earlier this year. The result was fascinating: from a dull banking brand to an extravagant colorful identity. Klarna wants to be a bank focused on the consumer’s experience, not on its own payments product. It definitely stands out in its sector with this bold and brave move I can only applaud.
Next stop was the Goodbye Kansas Gaming Studio. Stockholm has an enormous amount of talented gaming engineers, resulting in big hits like Minecraft, Candy Crush Saga, Angry Birds 2 and a host of other console and PC titles. We were told the long dark nights might have something to do with this.
Final stop was at EQT Ventures, one of the top tier venture firms in the Nordics. EQT Ventures is owned by Sweden’s wealthiest family, the Wallenbergs. Over the past century (!), the Wallenbergs have accumulated an enormous portfolio of global industrial players, including Electrolux, Atlas Copco, ABB, SEB, SKF, … to name a few. Add Volvo, Scania and IKEA to the Sweden’s list and you get a sense of how many successful international corporations this country produces. Same goes for its music industry: ABBA, Roxette, Ace of Base, Europe … and more recently Avicii, Robyn, Swedish House Mafia. Due to the small internal market, anyone aspiring a big entrepreneurial or artistic career just has to move abroad as soon as possible.
EQT Ventures is the venture capital firm of the Wallenberg conglomerate. Besides funding (with its 565 Mio EUR investment vehicle), it also offers active guidance to its entrepreneurs (growth, engineering, marketing,…).
EQT Ventures invests in scale-ups that have reached product market fit and about 100k MRR. It sweet spot investment size is between 8 and 10 Million EUR.
EQT gave us a demo of their internal data processing tool called Motherbrain. This platform gathers all publicly available data on technology companies (e.g. Crunchbase, Pitchbook data,..) and enriches them by adding trends in social media activity, number of followers, press coverage, … EQT believes this gives them a competitive advantage in discovering promising startups earlier and getting into deals faster.
4 startups had the opportunity to present their company:
The trip ended with a nice dinner in the city center of Sweden’s lovely capital.
My key takeaways from this Go Global Mission to Stockholm:
Looking forward to getting back into the action at Hyperlane on Monday, fully energized and inspired by 3 awesome days.

This is not just a political reckoning. It is a personal one.
I come from survivors — not only of the Holocaust itself, but of the moral disorientation it left behind. My father escaped Nazi Germany on the last Kindertransport to London. He later carried messages between generals after landing on Normandy Beach, speaking the languages of both the oppressed and the empire. My grandfather survived by finding refuge in Sweden. My lineage is braided with escape, resilience, and silence.
And now, I speak to honor them. To wrest history from the hands of fear.
To advocate for a universalist, justice-rooted Judaism in today’s climate is to invite pushback — from within our communities. These pushbacks do not always come from cruelty. They often come from heartbreak. They come from those who believe they are defending Jewish life, when in fact they may be protecting Jewish trauma from healing and perpetuating animosity worldwide.
To walk into this conversation, we must understand the language of fear — not to be manipulated by it, but to meet it with truth.
Here are five of the most common arguments used to reject a Judaism of shared humanity and prophetic conscience. Then we will reconstruct the machinery of propaganda as it is deployed, in order to disarm it with truth. Then a short and printable “pocket guide” to help us return to our core teachings.
They are not caricatures. They are cries. And if we are to become the choosing ones — not merely the chosen — we must listen with clarity, respond with compassion, and never forget: Again and again and again, Never Again must mean never for anyone...for everyone.
Let us begin where our ancestors survived — but refuse to end there.
Understanding the counterarguments made by fear-based ethnocentric voices — particularly those within Jewish communities that resist universalist interpretations — is essential for both refining your own position and preparing for meaningful dialogue.
Here are five of the most common arguments used by fear-based ethnocentrists to dismiss or dismantle the kind of covenantal, universalist Judaism I advocate:
1. The “Survival First” Argument
Claim: Before we can worry about others, we must secure the survival of the Jewish people. We are always one catastrophe away from annihilation.
Key Points:
Response:
This argument exploits trauma to justify ongoing preemptive dominance. It conflates existential threats with political criticism and flattens time, as if Pharaoh, Hitler, and any current dissenter are interchangeable. It demands eternal victimhood even when Jews wield state or institutional power.
2. The “Particularism is Not a Sin” Argument
Claim: Every nation puts itself first — why should Jews be held to a higher moral standard?
Key Points:
Response:
This argument deliberately ignores that Jewish ethics — rooted in Torah, prophets, and rabbinic tradition — do demand more. It erases the prophetic voice of justice. It also neglects the fact that being a light to the nations (Isaiah 49:6) is not optional in Judaism — it’s core.
3. The “You Don’t Understand Realpolitik” Argument
Claim: Your argument is philosophically interesting but politically dangerous. The world is not a yeshiva or a seminar. We must protect ourselves with strength, not sermons.
Key Points:
Response:
This response uses cynicism to neutralize ethics. It assumes power and moral courage are mutually exclusive. In reality, prophetic leadership has always been a countercultural phenomenon. Moses, Isaiah, and Heschel all spoke into power from a place of moral clarity, not political comfort.
4. The “We Tried Peace, It Didn’t Work” Argument
Claim: We gave land for peace. We made offers. We withdrew. And what did it get us? Rockets. Stabbings. Terror. You’re asking us to endanger our children.
Key Points:
Response:
This is trauma talking — but selectively. It collapses decades of failed diplomacy, settler expansion, and blockade into a single defensive narrative. While security is valid, it cannot be divorced from justice — and justice requires that we confront the history we created, not just the history done to us.
5. The “Self-Hating Jew” Accusation
Claim: Jews who criticize Israel or prioritize universal ethics over Jewish solidarity are internalizing antisemitic narratives. You’re aiding our enemies.
Key Points:
Response:
This is emotional blackmail disguised as community protection. It conflates dissent with betrayal. In truth, ethical critique is an ancient Jewish tradition — from Abraham arguing with God to Jeremiah lamenting corruption in Jerusalem. To speak truth to Jewish power is not betrayal; it is fidelity.
If one were trying to design a manipulative, propagandistic narrative in support of a fear-based ethnocentric worldview, one would need to activate collective trauma, moral inversion, and identity loyalty. The goal is not truth, but emotional certainty, enemy construction, and justified power.
Here are 10 potent narrative devices — some are outright lies, some half-truths, and all are repeated enough to feel self-evident.
They may sound familiar.
1. “We are the eternal victim.”
No one has suffered like us. No one ever will. We are history’s permanent target.
2. “They all want to kill us — again.”
Scratch any critic, and you’ll find a hidden antisemite.
3. “Survival justifies anything.”
If we don’t do this, we won’t exist tomorrow. That’s just how it is.
4. “Our power is only defensive.”
When we act, it’s because we were provoked. When we strike, it’s because we had no choice.
5. “There are no civilians among them.”
They are all complicit — every man, woman, and child. They elected terrorists. They cheer death.
6. “We already tried peace. They spat in our face.”
We offered everything. They gave us rockets. What more proof do you need?
7. “Anyone who criticizes us wants us destroyed.”
You say ‘human rights,’ but you mean ‘our extinction.’
8. “We are the West’s last line of defense.”
Support us, or terrorism wins. We are your moral outpost.
9. “We speak for all Jews.”
If you oppose us, you’re not one of us. You’re self-hating or brainwashed.
10. “History has absolved us.”
After what was done to us, we’ve earned the right to do whatever is necessary.
Repetition and Ritual
These ideas are not just said. They’re:
The Manipulation Goal:
Make it emotionally intolerable — even existentially traitorous — for someone to:
In case you want to have a conscious way to reject manipulation here’s a pocket-sized pamphlet — concise, powerful, and portable — designed to interrupt propaganda in real time and rekindle moral clarity when fear-based ethnocentric messaging is heard. Copy and print it and put it anywhere you want to remain a thinking and feeling human being, grounded in Judaism's highest teachings.
Spotting Propaganda. Reclaiming Conscience.
WHEN YOU HEAR:
“We’re the eternal victim.”
ASK YOURSELF: Is this invoking history to justify current harm?
“They all want to kill us.”
REMEMBER: Fear paints everyone an enemy. But fear is not truth.
“Survival justifies anything.”
TRUTH: Freedom without ethics is just a new kind of Pharaoh.
“They don’t value life like we do.”
DANGER: That’s dehumanization. The oldest lie used to justify violence.
“We tried peace. They gave us terror.”
PAUSE: Did we try peace — or control disguised as peace?
“Everyone’s a terrorist over there.”
FACT: Blanket blame is genocide’s gateway.
“Critics are antisemitic.”
NO. Ethics ≠ hate. Dissent ≠ betrayal.
“We’re defending civilization.”
WATCH OUT: That’s colonial language. That’s empire talking.
“We speak for all Jews.”
YOU KNOW: No one speaks for all of us. Judaism is not a monolith. Never was.
“History has absolved us.”
NEVER. No past horror gives license to inflict one.
INSTEAD, REMEMBER:
“We were slaves in Egypt…” Not to become Pharaohs, but to never be one.
“You shall not oppress the stranger…” Not once — but 36 times. That’s covenant.
“We are not free until all are free.” That’s Judaism at its best. That’s how you know.
Carry this not as a weapon, but as an anchor. So when fear speaks, you remember:
“Justice, justice shall you pursue.”
(Even when it costs. Especially when it costs.)

This is my 28-day journey of living a temporary life in Helsinki, Tallinn, Stockholm, and Copenhagen.
🇸🇪 August 4, 2019
It’s very lucky to have a friend who lives in Stockholm. Jimmie was one of my classmates when I was in San Francisco. He is a writer and a freelance journalist. After leaving San Francisco, I’ve kept in touch with him on Facebook. And luckily I had a chance to visit Stockholm and saw him again.
Thanks to Jimmie, I could visit a beautiful island, Vaxholm in Sweden. It is not far from Stockholm, but it is not easy to get there by public transportation. We went outside of Stockholm by car, arrived at a town with a small dock, and waited for a public ship that moves cars from islands to islands. Because there are no bridges between islands in some places, so the ship plays a role as a bridge. We got on a ship, crossed a bay and got to Vaxholm.
Vaxholm looks like a small town in the countryside. It was a military fortress in the 16th century like Suomenlinna in Finland, but now it is one of the tourist attractions for hiking, camping, or just relaxing. We stopped by a small cafe and had Swedish Fika(coffee) and cinnamon rolls. They tasted really good. We looked around the island by driving and walking.
Vaxholm, this is the place that I have been looking for!! A calm and peaceful place. There are some stores for convenience but not many. There are some people, but it was not crowded. I can go hiking, sailing, fishing, swimming or camping. Or I can just take a walk along the coast. It’s the best place to relax. I wanted to stay more, but I should go back to Stockholm for tomorrow’s new adventure. I just left my heart in Vaxholm.
The more I stay, the more I like Sweden, maybe more than Tallinn. Sorry, Tallinn.

At first glance, it looked just like any suburban street in Sweden. The houses were similar; compact but well-designed with sharp corners and adorned with perfectly manicured lawns. The sidewalks did not have a crack in them and the cars parked next to it were modestly luxurious; not flashy Ferraris but rather fully accessorized Audis.
As we rounded a corner, we came into a small outdoor shopping complex akin to an American strip mall but without the decadent vibes. There were a multitude of real estate agencies, including Skandia Mäklarna, showing off the latest hot properties on the market with pools and staggeringly high prices on the corner of the posters.
The local branch of Handelsbanken was closed but its ATM seemed to be functioning, although nobody lined up because cash is essentially extinct as far as Swedes are concerned. A hip brunch spot — the type where you overpay for a cortado, complain about it but continue going to be seen — was also already closed but we noted it for our next breakfast.
On the other end of the complex was a small independent supermarket called Spisa with…

Thinking about traveling to Stockholm? Here’s the only guide you’ll need to avoid the notorious taxi scams that have tripped up even seasoned travelers.
I’d like to say I’m a savvy traveler, with 35 years of globetrotting experience under my belt.
I know the usual tricks — check prices online, avoid unsolicited “cheap” rides, stick to the designated taxi zones, and confirm the fare in advance.
I had done my homework, read all the guides, and felt confident about getting around Stockholm safely.
But what should’ve been a routine taxi ride quickly turned into a high-stakes lesson in navigating travel scams.
The moment I stepped into that “official” taxi queue, I had no idea I was about to become the latest victim of a meticulously organized setup.
I’m sharing my story to help you avoid the same trap and keep your Stockholm adventure as memorable as mine should have been.

Stockholm is arguably one of the world’s most beautiful capitals. It is built on 14 islands around medieval city center and is located where the freshwater Lake Mälaren flows out into the Baltic Sea. Stockholm is the most populous city in the Scandinavia, with 2.2 million people living in the metropolitan area. Running in Stockholm is a treat, given the water, unique geography, and well laid out pedestrian and recreational paths. The Stockholm Marathon is claimed to have one of the most beautiful marathon routes in the world.
The best running routes in Stockholm are defined by scenic paths along the waterfront, across bridges to the islands, and some lovely green spaces. We also have some routes that combine some of the main Stockholm sights with some pleasant parks and urban highlights. Stockholm has an excellent public transportation system consisting of bus, tram, local train (pendeltåg) and subway (tunnelbana; look for a T-sign).
One of the defining elements of running in Stockholm is its latitude. In summer, running late at night is a particular treat due to 18+hours of daylight. In winter, Stockholm makes up for short days in part by providing good lighting along most of its paths. Despite its northern location, Stockholm has relatively mild weather compared to other locations at similar latitude, or even farther south — receiving more sunshine per year than Paris or London, but also precipitation on about half the days through the year. It can snow from November to April, and winter running will likely involve snow or ice so bring your Yak-Traks. Summers are mild but rarely warm. You’ll almost always need an extra later for morning runs, even in July.

5.5-mile loop. Accessible any point in downtown. MAP
This route covers some of the main sights of the city, with lots of folks out walking and running. Much of the route is along the water and over bridges to two islands. Start your run at Gustav Adolfs square, next to the Royal Opera House. Head to Gamla Stan (Old Town) and pass Riksdagshuset where the Swedish Parliament is situated, as well as, the Royal Palace — His Majesty The King’s official residence. Enjoy the views of the idyllic Gamla Stan while you run south towards Södermalm island. Head west along the waterfront all the way to Långholmen, which is a former prison island, and currently one of Stockholm’s green oases. Cross the bridge to Kungsholmen island and head back east. You will pass another main sight, Stadthus (City Hall), which is also the venue of the annual Nobel Prize banquet. Complete the loop at Gustav Adolfs square.
7.2-mile loop. Access: several subways or buses to Slussen stop. MAP
Södermalm, or Söder as locals call it, is an island in south Stockholm. The vibe in Södermalm is relaxed and trendy, and it was selected as the coolest neighborhood in Europe by Vogue magazine in 2014. Running a loop around the island is a treat. Start your run at Södermalm market square which is easily accessible by public transportation (Slussen stop). Head west and enjoy views in Montelusvägen — a walking path looking over the waterfront to Kungsholmen. Continue further west and climb to Skinnarviksberget, a hill offering another breathtaking view over the city. Run to waterfront and make a loop around the island. Probably the most scenic parts of the loop are a path from Tantolunden in the west to Eriksdalsbadet in the south, and northeast area of the island when you run along the waterfront with Gamla Stan on your right.
5.2-mile loop. Start: Djurgårdsbron Bridge. Access: Bus 76 from downtown. MAP
Djurgården is a green and idyllic island close to central Stockholm, offering a beautiful setting for running. Its official name Kungliga Djurgården means Royal Game Park and it is one of the most popular recreation areas of the city. Start your run at Djurgårdsbron bridge and head east along the canal all the way to Lilla Sjötullsbron bridge. Cross the bridge to south and enter Djurgården island where you will pass scenic green areas and several historical buildings and monuments, the Vasa museum, art galleries, and the popular amusement park Gröna Lund. In the interior of the island is Royal Djurgården, which has gravel, more forested paths that can be a nice add-on.
8.1-mile loop. Access: bus 515 MAP
Hagaparken — a lovely green park about 5km north of the city — is a popular running destination any time of year. The park offers several scenic running paths. The best option is to make a loop along around Brunnsviken lake. Hagaparken is Sweden’s purest version of an ‘English park’, and the surrounding area contains three royal palaces. Probably the most famous building is Haga Palace where Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden, and her husband, Prince Daniel, Duke of Västergötland, moved shortly after their wedding in 2010.
5.6-mile loop. Access: any bus, tram or subway to Central Station MAP
Kungsholmen is a residential island where also the most prominent building of the Stockholm skyline and the venue of the annual Nobel Prize banquet, City Hall, is located. It is also another great running location. A good option to start your run is near Central Station. Head south and you will see Gamla Stan on the other side of waterfront. After passing the City Hall, continue west along the waterfront. Other highlights are a beautiful park called Rålambshovsparken and the inner city beach Smedsuddsbadet on the south side of the island, and Hornsbergs Strand on the north side. Most of the run is along the water.
Hellasgården is a nice recreation area offering several running trails in the woods and along the Källtorpssjön lake. It is located about 20 minutes by bus from downtown Stockholm — take bus 401 from Slussen to the Hellasgården stop in Älta. There are also excellent refreshment possibilities after your run, or options for a sauna or enjoying a sandy beach. See our 5.1 mile route here. Some of the trails have lights but note that in winter season, some of the trails are kept clean from snow while others are used for skiing, thus not suitable for running. See additional information here.
Stockholm has a wide selection of hotels in the downtown area and all of our iconic routes are located within a few mile radius. To have a fast access to the Stockholm Highlights loop, Djurgården and Södermalm routes, look for hotels in Östermalm and Gamla Stan areas. If you want to stay closer to Hagaparken route, then the Vasastan is a good option. It is still very close to Central loop and Södermalm routes, but a bit further from Djurgården. In addition to big international chains see also the following options:
Radisson Blu. Chain of well equipped hotels. Several locations in downtown.
Scandic. Another chain, several locations in downtown.
Nordic Light Hotel. A nice hotel with great location.
Runner’s Store is the biggest running specialty store in Sweden. Located downtown.
Löplabbet is another running specialty store with knowledgeable staff.
XXL. Price-driven big box retailer which has disrupted Scandinavian sporting goods retailers recently. One location in downtown on Hamngatan, another in Bromma airport.
Asics Flagship Store located in downtown on Hamngatan
Run With Me Stockholm offers a variety of private guided running tours covering main sights and attractions of the city. Has free group runs, too.
Stockholm Running Tours is another group combining sightseeing and running.
Nike+ Run Club offers several group runs to runners of all speeds.
Hash House Harriers is a Stockholm chapter of this globally spread “Drinking club with a running problem”. Meets every Wednesday night and every second Saturday afternoon for running, beer and fun.
Stockholm Frontrunners is running and walking group for LGBTQ people and their friends. Meets every Tuesday for group runs.
Stockholm Marathon is the main marathon race in the city, taking place annually late May or early June. Consists of two loops around the city and the finishing line is located on track of the Olympic Stadium.
Stockholm Half Marathon. September. This race has been in its current form since 2007 but its roots date to the 1920's.
Midnattsloppet. August. The “midnight run”, is a 10k race which has been run in Stockholm since 1982. As the name suggests, around 20,000 runners hit the streets of the city after the sunset. The same event is organized annually also in Malmö, Göteborg and Helsinki.
Women’s Health Half Marathon is the biggest half marathon exclusively for women in Europe. Offers also a possibility to run as a pair and split the distance with your friend. Website available only in Swedish — to learn more in English, contact whhm@marathon.se

Who do so many employees fall in love with their companies and practices, even the most terrible ones?
If you’re not familiar with Stockholm Syndrome then you’ve either never been held captive by an agile cell of fervent evangelists, wielding a full set of colourful whiteboard markers, in the company boardroom, you’ve never encountered a technical problem so difficult that you considered bailing out doing a PMP¹ course instead, or perhaps you’ve never had the financial pressure to keep a job you absolutely hate.
And, fellow player in the Grand Game of Software Engineering, even if you did, I have total faith that you wouldn’t give in to your captors.
You see, it’s survival of the fittest out there on the board — meaning it’s those that are technically competent, don’t have a strange love of garments woven from man made fibres, and those who know that management means having an irreversible frontal lobotomy (with a laminated certificate to prove it) and inevitable crossing to the other side of the board that will survive.
We all encounter those that have been summarily brainwashed every now and again in the Grand Game. Whether they’re seen to be repeatedly donning company merch unnecessarily², whether they spend their time organising (i.e. micromanaging) others unnecessarily, or just won’t have a word spoken against…

Stockholm syndrome is often defined as when a hostage develops an empathetic psychological connection with their captor. The reason this happens (as clearly, the hostage is the victim) is that the hostage subconsciously figures out, as seems reasonable, that if they are nice to their captors, they will receive better treatment in exchange. And that’s true.
An easy reference to this is the trope of the “Uncle Tom” in African American slave life during American slavery. During American slavery, certain slaves were mentally trained that if they accepted their slavery, and willingly worked with their master, they would receive better treatment in exchange. And said slaves bought into this, and cooperated in exchange for said better treatment. The African American community now refers to such slaves as “Uncle Toms”.
I propose that the process by which Stockholm syndrome sets in subconsciously, is a tool that ministers of faith use consciously to trick those in their congregation into becoming ardent followers of their own supposed volition.
I’ll explain. When a person enters a church community, they are usually doing it simply for the community at first. A community is a small society. And the smaller the society, the more socialist the society. This is why socialism works well in small countries. The…

My trip started from Turku to Stockholm via the Viking Glory, which is a cruise ferry that runs between Turku-Åland and Islands-Stockholm. Before arriving in Stockholm, I strongly recommend buying a Go City Pass (Stockholm Pass). It includes 50+ attractions, ranging from Museums, Skansen, and Boat tours. You can buy a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5-day pass from SEK 824 (71 €) to SEK 1,899 (162 €) — depending on the validity period. Once you bought the pass, download the Go City app, and you can show the QR code to attractions that are included in the pass to explore the city.
The Go City Pass includes: (More on the official Website) 📱
…
⚠️Not all the attractions are open all year round, for example, the Drottningholm Palace was closed from December 11th — December 30th, 2023, so you may not be able to get in if you go there during the Christmas Season. Same for the Stockholm Winter Tour by Boat, of course, it is only available during the winter season, but there is another boat tour available at other times of the year as well. (I highly recommended the Winter Boat Tour 🛥️)
💰Compile attractions that can be accessed free by the pass in two or three days to save money.
Note that the Go City Pass does not include public transportation unlike the Oslo Pass, so please remember to buy Travelcards if you want to explore the city without limitations. (You can get a discount if you are over 65 years of age, a student holding a Swedish student ID, or if you are under 20 years of age😊). The Travelcards are available on the smartphone app “SL-Journey Planner Ticket” and you can get on the tram, subway, bus, or commuter train within the validity period. 🚌
When you hop on a bus, you need to show the code to the driver, and you need the code for the subway (Marked as Ⓣ) as well. However, for the tram, you can just simply hop on and off!
I would say the subway and the tram are the most common transportation that I used during my stay.

By MATT PUSATERI
Five years ago, my brother sent me a link to a YouTube video. “This is awesome,” he texted. When I clicked it, I was baffled: it was a clip of a song-and-dance number on a football field from Fox’s series Glee (2009–15).
I didn’t get it: why he loved it, or why he was sharing it with me. After all, this was my brother — a first-born, take-charge, cut-the-bullshit engineer, and he really, really wanted me to see a clip from Glee? Maybe, I thought, he accidently pasted the wrong link?
What I didn't appreciate back then was that he was living at home with two teenage girls. He was outnumbered three-to-one by women. His view of the world, pop culture, and entertainment was distorted day after day to the point where he didn’t realize what had happened. He was a victim of Parental Stockholm Syndrome.
Classic Stockholm Syndrome refers to “a psychological phenomenon in which hostages express empathy and sympathy and have positive feelings toward their captors, sometimes to the point of defending and identifying with the captors.” It was inspired by a Stockholm bank robbery in 1973, during which hostages inside the bank gradually came to defend the criminals who took them hostage.
Parental Stockholm Syndrome is the same thing, except instead of being victims of a bank robbery held at gunpoint, it applies to parents held captive to shows like Glee as well as TV channels like Disney Junior and PBS Kids.
This is a real condition. I know, because I suffer from Parental Stockholm Syndrome.
I've actually said these things in the past year:
If I didn't live with two little girls — ages seven and five — I wouldn't be able to distinguish Periwinkle, a brave Winter fairy, from Rosetta, a plucky gardening fairy with a classic Southern accent. I also wouldn't have strong feelings about the sharp decline in the writing of Dora the Explorer (2000- ) after season two. And I never would have walked around the gym humming to myself the national anthem of Enchancia.
You can resist, but it’s inevitable. When you become a parent, you don’t just bring children into your world; they pull you into theirs.
Try as I might to get them to love things I love — DC Comics, Chicago-style pizza, Texas Hold’em, and North Carolina basketball — they want me to sit with them and enjoy the things they love: Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood (2012- ), Pinkalicious, and almost any movie about mermaids.
I might fight it, clinging to the adult world I left nearly eight years ago, struggling to maintain the illusion that I'm not captive to the passions and imaginations of two little girls. Or I can sit back, let go, and allow myself to tear up when Rapunzel is finally reunited with her parents at the top of the castle.

So, I realise as I write this that my last blog post was about an ECR event at the University of Stirling, arranged by the British Society of Gerontology’s Emerging Researcher’s in Ageing group (ERA). Ironic then, that I am writing this blog post in a former prison in Stockholm, on an ERA Writing Retreat at Långholmen!
The writing retreat, which I’ll write up in a separate post, was scheduled for Wednesday to Friday, so my brain quickly went into planning a research trip around it. Who might I be able to speak to at museums or universities in Stockholm about my research and practice at the Fitzwilliam Museum? And what might I learn about Nordic practice? I did some desk-top research, wrote some emails, and before I knew it, I had conjured up a plan for a research trip! And again, I was visiting a place I hadn’t been to before, so this was exciting…
Arriving on Saturday afternoon, I was able to spend the weekend strolling around the city (which was freezing!), being a tourist in a new city. I took an archipelago boat tour on Sunday morning, followed up by a visit to the Vasa Museet — the museum that I was told was one not to be missed! It was here that I was reminded that I am now unable to visit a museum without stepping into research mode…
The museum is vast — with many floors, and a lack of clear navigation route. Whilst the ship itself (if you’re interested in the story, you can read more on the museum’s website) is impressive, I felt immediately overwhelmed, not knowing where to start, or where to go. I found myself looking for somewhere to sit!
I saw a station where you could collect a map (which was available in numerous different languages), as well as clicking on a QR code to access a FREE audio guide. A map on the wall showed the location of all the stories in the audio guide, which was helpful (although they were not shown on the paper map which you carried with you). I looked around me, and found a theatre style set of wooden steps, where I could sit, look at the ship, and listen to the audio…
The audio was quite interesting, but then I quickly became frustrated by the imitation waves that were added in for effect. Time to move on!
There were lifts, but often with a group of people already waiting, so I chose to use the stairs. I found it quite confusing to navigate my way around, and it was too dark to read the map, so I stopped trying!
The museum is very interactive, with a wide variety of displays, ways to engage, and a LOT of information. I realised I was finding the displays a bit overwhelming, and so decided to focus on the ship itself — actually, as I write this, it’s probably how I usually navigate a museum. Focus on the object of interest!
This was the start of my trip, before I even intended to be focused on research. I’ll add further blogs to this series (links to be added, as I write them):

This is not your romantic cruise! But a beer-soaked “The Love Boat” episode ala Viking style version with hard liquor and long parties.
We decided one weekend to celebrate family birthdays on the ferry trip from Helsinki-Åland-Stockholm. Two good, highly competitive lines, Viking Line and Tallink Silja, the Tallink Silja Viking Line connects Sweden’s capital with Finlands.
We took the Silja Line Promenade for 1–4 persons plus breakfast and grande buffets for each person during the trip. The promenade room is located in the middle and offers a view of the boat’s hallway.
In my honest opinion, Tallink Silja is more upscale and Viking Line is the less expensive one but also a popular one. The Helsinki to Stockholm cruise or vice-versa has a 2-nights and 3-day cruise and is one of the popular ferry trips.
For Finnish people, having a ferry ride from Helsinki to Stockholm is just as common as having a train ride between cities. One of the most popular routes between Sweden and Finland is the Stockholm-Helsinki ferry.

This article originally appeared on Confessions of a Boy Toy
Stockholm is a truly magical city. This spring, we traveled to Sweden’s capital to experience the fairy tale magic for ourselves. From getting lost through the cobblestone streets of charming Gamla Stan (Old Town) or boutique-hopping in the city’s super-hip SoFo neighborhood, Stockholm has enchanting surprises at every turn.
Here are some incredible places you’ll be delighted to stumble upon shall you find yourself in Stockholm.
The clothes and furniture at Grandpa embodies everything we love about the SoFo district: Casual, super-cool and contemporary, despite its name. Grandpa focuses on highlighting Scandinavian fashion and furniture designers with a reputation for making things that are eco-friendly and sustainable, with materials sourced locally, organically or through fair trade.
Another quintessential SoFo shop, Coctail is like a Pedro Almodovar movie that’s come to life. No wonder it’s so popular with film location scouts. While most of Stockholm is still enamored with minimalism, this tiny shop aims for “maximalism” — everything here is just the most, from the luchador masks, the Dia de Los Muertos figurines, the Frida Kahlo mugs, and other colorful, authentic trinkets shipped from Mexican street vendors.
Located in Gamla Stan since 1864, E.Torndahl is a tiny, family-owned boutique featuring the work of local Scandinavian designers and artists. Here, you’ll find fascinating gifts in the form of jewelry, wallets, metallic hair-trimmers shaped like exotic birds, coasters with a bearded man illustration, a portable phone charger shaped like a river rock, and more.
Photography lovers should spend an afternoon — especially if it’s raining — perusing Fotografiska, a for-profit center for modern photography. This place is not afraid to exhibit controversial and provocative photos, so make sure to wear your open-minded goggles. During our visit, we saw work by African artists Samuel Fosso and Rotimi Fani-Kayode, as well as a special exhibition on French fashion photographer Bettina Rheims.
There’s no inch of Stockholm that’s not drenched in history and culture, even down in the subway. The city’s public transit system is said to be the world’s longest art exhibit, with 90 percent of the subway stations decorated with sculptures, mosaics, paintings and public installations by over 150 artists. Some of the most eye-grabbing subway art can be found at the following stations: Kungsträdgården, T-Centralen, Rådhuset, Solna Centrum and Tensta.
If you find yourself in Gamla Stan around noon, check out the changing of the guard at the Royal Palace. It takes place at 12:15 p.m. daily during the summer and on weekends year-round. The Royal Palace itself is a sight to see. You can take a tour of the inside and check out five museums, including the royal treasury, home to the crown jewels, an armory with knights’ gear and the royal stable with coronation carriages and intricate coaches.
Are you a fan of Game of Thrones or Harry Potter or Star Trek or E.T. or Marvel superheroes or Buffy the Vampire Slayer or all of the above? You’re bound to find a book, graphic novel, or other gift for all your geek-related obsessions at this sci-fi mecca in Gamla Stan. Let’s just say this shop has everything you could ever possibly need to decipher every reference in Stranger Things.
If it’s sunny out, this lively terrace at the top of Sodrateatern, an iconic theater in the heart of Stockholm, has to be on your to-do list. And if the weather is not cooperating, Sodrateatern offers plenty of indoor festivities as well, including jazz-fueled dinners that turn into full-blown dance parties.
If you’re traveling to Stockholm during the summer, from early April to late September, make sure to catch the sunset at the hyper-scenic Mälarpaviljongen. This high-spirited, straight-friendly restaurant and outdoor bar is located on the waterfront barges along the Riddarfjärden bay. You can even arrive by boat after a day out on the bay to cap off your cruising adventures.
A gay-owned coffee shop painted mustard-yellow in the heart of Gamla Stan, Chokladkoppen serves delicious hot chocolate in a bowl. If you really want to indulge — and why wouldn’t you? — they also have chocolate cake that’s to die for. During the summer, enjoy the people-watching in the Nobel Museum plaza from one of the cafe’s outdoor tables.
Pharmarium Cocktail Bar
Located in Gamla Stan near where Stockholm’s first-ever pharmacy opened in 1575, Pharmarium serves a different type of modern remedy: exquisite craft cocktails. The Roses of Gold, the Pharmarium’s version of a French 75, was just what the doctor order, made to perfection with vodka, lemon, champagne, and just a sprinkle of gold powder. As if a champagne cocktail needed that extra flair.
You will find plenty of treats in Stockholm’s hip SoFo district, but nothing like the sweet-buttery deliciousness that can be found inside Pärlans Konfektyra. This quaint confectionery looks like it’s from another era. It makes classic, organic caramels and caramel sauce in Scandinavian flavors like lingonberry and salt licorice.
You’d expect this Medieval-themed restaurant would be a tourist trap, but we were the only Americans there. Medeltidskrogen Sjätte Tunnan is a little hidden hotspot to find in Gamla Stan. Once you find the door you have to walk all the way to the back before going downstairs to a cavernous restaurant serving a menu inspired by 1300 A.D. cuisine. A feast perfect for a Viking king.

Understanding the Stockholm Syndrome Phenomenon and Russian Propaganda: Exploring the Complexities of Captivity and Manipulation,https://medium.com/@sleuthyfella/understanding-the-stockholm-syndrome-phenomenon-and-russian-propaganda-exploring-the-complexities-b79a1c1724ab,"Sign up

Captivity and manipulation are two intricate aspects of human psychology that have fascinated researchers for decades. One phenomenon that sheds light on this complex interaction is the Stockholm Syndrome. As discussions around the topic intensify, it becomes imperative to delve deeper into its causes and explore the role that Russian propaganda plays in shaping public opinion.
The Stockholm Syndrome refers to the psychological condition where hostages develop an emotional bond with their captors. Originating from a 1973 bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden, the term has increasingly been used to explain instances of individuals identifying with their perpetrators and paradoxically defending their actions.
To truly comprehend this phenomenon, it is crucial to understand the dynamics at play during periods of captivity. When individuals find themselves in situations where their freedom is severely limited, they become vulnerable to the influence of their captors. Fear, uncertainty, and isolation create an environment where the captors can exercise power and control over their prisoners.
Interestingly, these circumstances can lead to a survival strategy known as “identification with the aggressor” or the Stockholm Syndrome. Victims might unconsciously develop empathy and positivity towards their captors as a means of self-preservation. This psychological defense mechanism aims to reduce perceived threats and increase the chances of survival within the confines of captivity.
However, it is important to note that the Stockholm Syndrome is not limited to scenarios of physical captivity alone. It can also manifest in situations involving emotional manipulation and psychological control. This is where the role of Russian propaganda becomes significant.
Russian propaganda, with its sophisticated tactics, aims to manipulate public opinion and control narratives. By leveraging psychological vulnerabilities, such as the fear of the unknown and the need for security, they can shape people’s perceptions and beliefs. This can lead to individuals sympathizing with and defending actions that align with the propagated narrative, despite their better judgment.
Exploring the complexities of captivity and manipulation, especially in the context of the Stockholm Syndrome and Russian propaganda, highlights the profound impact that external influences can have on the human psyche. By understanding these dynamics, we can develop greater awareness and critical thinking skills to navigate the intricate world of information warfare.
The Stockholm Syndrome serves as a harrowing testament to why societies need to punish criminals to deter crimes. Its intersection with Russian propaganda highlights the need for vigilance in assessing information sources and maintaining a healthy skepticism in an increasingly interconnected world. Only by questioning and seeking the truth can we break free from the invisible chains of manipulation.
Stockholm Syndrome is a psychological response observed in captive situations, where the individual begins to closely identify with their captors and even starts to sympathize with their agenda and demands. It is a complex phenomenon that has been studied and analyzed in various psychological research.
The term “Stockholm Syndrome” was coined after a notorious bank robbery and hostage situation that took place in Stockholm, Sweden in 1973. During this six-day ordeal, the hostages developed a strong bond and emotional attachment to their captors, which baffled both the authorities and the public. This case became the unprecedented reference point for understanding the psychological dynamics of captor-captive relationships.
According to Britannica, the Stockholm Syndrome is a psychological response that occurs when hostages or abuse victims develop an emotional connection with their captors or abusers. This phenomenon is named after a bank robbery that took place in Stockholm, Sweden in 1973, where the hostages ultimately expressed sympathy and loyalty towards their captors.
The syndrome is thought to be a survival mechanism that kicks in when a person feels powerless and threatened, causing them to form an attachment to their perpetrators. In these situations, the victim’s survival instincts kick in, and they begin to identify with their captors, often developing positive feelings toward them. This may be due to the captors intermittently showing kindness or providing the hostages with small acts of compassion during their confinement.
This emotional connection can be perplexing to outsiders who fail to understand the intricate dynamics at play. From an outsider’s perspective, it may seem illogical for the victims to develop positive feelings towards their captors. However, it is important to remember that these individuals are enduring a traumatic experience that distorts their perception of reality.
The Stockholm Syndrome is not limited to physical captivity alone. It can also manifest in situations of emotional manipulation and psychological control. In these cases, the victims may find themselves trapped in toxic relationships or cult-like environments where their thoughts and emotions are manipulated to serve the interests of the abuser.
In such instances, the victims’ identities become intertwined with their captors, leading to a loss of personal agency and an overwhelming sense of dependency. Breaking free from this psychological entanglement can be incredibly challenging, as the victims may fear retribution or believe that they are incapable of surviving without their captors’ support.
One of the factors that can contribute to the development of Stockholm Syndrome is the captor’s ability to instill a sense of fear and helplessness in the victims. By controlling their access to basic needs such as food, water, and sleep, the captors can create a cycle of reward and punishment, fostering a state of emotional dependency. This dependence, coupled with intermittent acts of kindness or compassion, further deepens the victims’ connection to their captors.
Furthermore, the victims may experience cognitive dissonance, a psychological phenomenon where conflicting beliefs and emotions create a state of mental discomfort. To reduce this discomfort, the victims may reinterpret the captors’ actions in a positive light, creating a narrative that justifies their bond with their captors. This cognitive restructuring allows them to maintain a sense of coherence in their worldview, despite the abusive circumstances they find themselves in.
The intersection between the Stockholm Syndrome and Russian propaganda unveils another layer of complexity. Russian propaganda, utilizing sophisticated manipulation techniques, aims to shape public opinion and control narratives. By exploiting psychological vulnerabilities, such as the fear of the unknown and the desire for security, they can sway individuals’ perceptions and evoke emotional responses.
In this context, victims of psychological manipulation may exhibit signs of the Stockholm Syndrome by defending and sympathizing with the propagated narrative, even if it contradicts their original beliefs or goes against their best interests. This underscores the immense power of psychological manipulation in shaping individuals’ thoughts and behaviors, turning them into unwitting prisoners of false ideologies.
To combat the toxic influence of propaganda and break free from the grip of manipulation, it is crucial to foster critical thinking skills and media literacy. Developing the ability to analyze information objectively, question sources, and consider multiple perspectives can help individuals resist the allure of manipulative tactics.
By shining a light on the intertwined concepts of captivity, manipulation, and the Stockholm Syndrome, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex mechanisms at play within the human psyche. It is through this understanding that we can strive to create a society that values freedom, autonomy, and the pursuit of truth, free from the shackles of psychological captivity.
Note: The term “Stockholm Syndrome” is used to describe a specific psychological response and should not be used loosely or trivialized.
One of the most infamous examples of Stockholm Syndrome is the case involving Patty Hearst, a newspaper heiress who was kidnapped in 1974 by the radical group Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA). Initially terrified and coerced, Hearst eventually joined the group and participated in their criminal activities. This case generated significant media attention and captivated the public’s interest, sparking widespread discussions about the psychological mechanisms underlying Stockholm Syndrome.
The study of Stockholm Syndrome has provided tragic insights into the complexities of human behavior and the power of psychological manipulation. Researchers have attempted to unravel the underlying factors that contribute to the development of this phenomenon. Some proposed explanations include the captives’ perception of kindness from their captors, trauma bonding, and a survival instinct that leads the captives to adapt to their circumstances.
While Stockholm Syndrome remains an obscure crime, its impact on the understanding of human psychology cannot be understated. By analyzing and comprehending the intricacies of such situations, psychologists and researchers hope to shed light on the various psychological and emotional processes that individuals may experience when faced with captivity and coercion.
It is crucial to note that each case of Stockholm Syndrome is unique, and individuals’ responses can vary significantly. The understanding and treatment of this phenomenon remain areas of ongoing research, aiming to provide support and guidance to individuals who have experienced such traumatic situations.
The study of Stockholm Syndrome has also highlighted the role of empathy and the human need for connection in captive situations. In some cases, victims may develop a sense of empathy towards their captors, seeing them as complex individuals rather than solely as perpetrators. This empathy can create a bond that reinforces the captive’s identification with the aggressor.
Furthermore, the Stockholm Syndrome can have long-lasting effects on the psychological well-being of the victims. Even after their physical captivity ends, they may continue to struggle with conflicting emotions and a sense of loyalty towards their captors. Overcoming these psychological challenges requires a supportive environment where victims can receive appropriate therapy and support to reintegrate into society.
Cultural and societal factors also play a significant role in shaping the dynamics of the Stockholm Syndrome. The cultural norms and values of a society can influence individuals’ responses to captivity and manipulation. For example, in societies that prioritize authority and obedience, victims may be more likely to develop the Stockholm Syndrome as a means of survival.
The media also has a responsibility in portraying and discussing the Stockholm Syndrome phenomenon accurately and sensitively. Misrepresentation and sensationalization can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misunderstandings about the condition. Therefore, it is crucial for media outlets to approach the topic with empathy, ensuring that victims’ experiences are heard and understood.
It is important to remember that Stockholm Syndrome is a complex psychological phenomenon that arises in captive situations, where victims develop an emotional bond with their captors. This response stems from a survival instinct and the psychological mechanisms of identification with the aggressor. It is crucial to continue studying and understanding the Stockholm Syndrome to provide support and guidance to individuals who have experienced such traumatic situations. By doing so, we can strive to create a society that values compassion, empathy, and freedom from manipulation.
A study conducted by Douglas Wilbur, a visiting scholar in the UTSA Department of Communication, sheds light on an important issue regarding the influence of Russian propaganda on popular alternative media sites. Wilbur’s research, which involved analyzing over 600 articles, provides valuable insights into the correlation between Sputnik, Russia’s state-owned media, and these alternative media platforms that are believed to present favorable coverage of Russia and its allies in the United States.
The study, “Propaganda or Not: Examining the Claims of Extensive Russian Information Operations within the United States,” provides a comprehensive content analysis of articles published in four websites that were labeled by Prop or Not as working on behalf of the Russian government. While Prop or Not faced criticism from major U.S. mainstream media for its methodology in labeling 200 sites as vehicles of propaganda, the research conducted by Wilbur demonstrates the strong credibility of the claims made by Prop or Not regarding Russian interference.
In 2017, Prop or Not alleged that Russia was manipulating U.S. public opinion through online propaganda, but their failure to provide compelling evidence left doubts lingering in the air. However, Wilbur’s research has now validated this claim, shedding light on the extent of Russian interference and its impact on U.S. public opinion. The study delves into the manipulation tactics employed by these targeted websites and explores the strategies used to influence the American narrative.
One of the key findings of Wilbur’s study is the strong, positive correlation between Sputnik and sites like Zero Hedge, a Wall Street-focused website. The analysis suggests that these alternative media outlets echo Russian propaganda, aligning with the claims made by organizations like Prop or Not. This raises concerns about covert manipulation of the U.S. news agenda, posing a potential threat to national security.
Wilbur researched articles published on several websites: Zero Hedge, New Cold War, Global Research, and The Daily Sheeple. The outlets were chosen using a random number approach. Published articles on those sites between January 2019 and July 2020 were then selected for examination if they contained the following key terms: Russia, Syria, Ukraine, Iran, Venezuela, and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). These terms were chosen because they highlight important foreign policy issues for the Russian government. Once the articles were selected, their tonality was rated on a positive or negative scale according to how the news stories described Russia and its allies versus the U.S. and its partners.
Wilbur’s analysis offers a valuable contribution to the ongoing debate surrounding the role of Russian information operations in the United States. By meticulously examining the content of these websites, the study provides insights into the methods employed by Russian actors to shape public discourse and sow discord among the American population.
This research serves as a call to action for organizations and individuals alike, highlighting the importance of critically evaluating the sources and information we encounter online. It underscores the need for improved media literacy and the development of strategies to combat disinformation campaigns that seek to undermine democracy and public trust.
In essence, the study conducted by Wilbur offers compelling evidence to support the claims made by Prop or Not regarding Russian interference in the United States. It provides a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and the general public, deepening our understanding of the evolving challenges posed by digital propaganda and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of information in the digital age.
In an era where information is easily accessible and influences public opinion, it becomes crucial for the U.S. media to be aware of and address these propaganda efforts. As Russia creates and utilizes propaganda as a weapon, it is vital for the U.S. media to have effective countermeasures in place, ensuring that accurate and unbiased information prevails.
By highlighting this issue, Wilbur’s research underscores the importance of media literacy and critical thinking. It reminds us that staying informed and discerning in the face of propaganda is integral to safeguarding the integrity of the news and protecting national interests.
Awareness of the existence and potential impact of propaganda is the first step in combating its influence. The findings of this study emphasize the need for continued research, collaboration, and awareness among media professionals, policymakers, and the general public, as they strive to ensure a vibrant and trustworthy news landscape that upholds democratic values.
Understanding the parallels between Stockholm Syndrome and Russian disinformation and propaganda sheds light on how psychological manipulation can shape public opinion and influence individuals’ beliefs. By drawing this comparison, we can gain insight into the mechanisms at play in both situations, revealing the power of manipulation in shaping individuals’ thoughts and behaviors.
Both Stockholm Syndrome and Russian propaganda involve psychological manipulation and the distortion of reality. In cases of Stockholm Syndrome, captives develop an emotional bond with their captors, defending and identifying with them despite the harm they may have suffered. Similarly, Russian propaganda aims to manipulate public opinion through sophisticated tactics, distorting information and narratives to align with their interests.
In both scenarios, fear and uncertainty play a significant role. In captivity situations, victims experience a sense of powerlessness and dependence on their captors, which can lead to the development of Stockholm Syndrome. Similarly, Russian propaganda preys on individuals’ fears and insecurities, manipulating them through emotionally charged content designed to evoke strong reactions.
Another common factor between the two is the psychological defense mechanism of cognitive restructuring. In the case of Stockholm Syndrome, captives may reinterpret their captors’ actions in a positive light, creating a narrative that justifies their bond. Similarly, victims of propaganda may engage in cognitive dissonance, modifying their beliefs to align with the propagated narrative, despite contradictory evidence.
The role of empathy, albeit in different contexts, is also crucial. In Stockholm Syndrome, victims may develop empathy towards their captors, seeing them as complex individuals rather than solely as perpetrators. In the case of Russian propaganda, individuals may sympathize with the propagated narrative and defend actions that align with it, due to the emotional appeal and manipulation employed.
By comparing Stockholm Syndrome with Russian disinformation and propaganda, we can recognize the underlying psychological mechanisms and vulnerabilities that contribute to individuals’ susceptibility to manipulation. This understanding serves as a reminder of the importance of critical thinking, media literacy, and the ability to question and analyze information from diverse perspectives.
Ultimately, by raising awareness of the tactics used in psychological manipulation, individuals can develop resilience against manipulation and make informed decisions based on reliable information. This empowers individuals to navigate the complex landscape of information warfare and mitigate the impact of psychological captivity induced by manipulation and propaganda.

In 1973, there was a huge bank robbery attempt in Stockholm, Sweden. The robbers held four bank workers hostage for six days. On the sixth days, the police broke inside, trying to arrest the robbers and save the hostages but the said hostages tried to protect the robbers from the police. Later on, the hostages refused giving testimony against the robbers and they even started collecting money to defend them. Within six days of captivity, the hostages had started developing a deep sympathy for the robbers.
As a result, the incident in which captives start developing positive feelings for their captors was named Stockholm Syndrome. This intriguing and paradoxical bond between captors and captives was also found amongst prisoners of war and those being kept in concentration camps as well. But in time, it’s seen that Stockholm Syndrome is not all about literal captors and captives. For example; Stockholm Syndrome can be found between parents and children or spouses as well as in narcissistic relationships, which is the main topic of our article.
In what conditions do we see Stockholm Syndrome?
Stockholm Syndrome requires four important elements:
Judging by the first one, you might think that Stockholm Syndrome happening in a narcissistic relationship is very unlikely. You might feel like a narcissistic relationship cannot exactly be life threatening. After all, not all narcissists resort to physical violence. On the other hand, living with a narcissist can mean that your life is indeed in danger. This danger can be physical, emotional, psychological or spiritual. Besides, narcissists can throw violent temper tantrums when they can’t get something they want or when they’re losing control over someone (narcissistic rage). People on the receiving end of this rage (even if their partners have never abused them physical in the past) may find themselves fearing for their lives or well-being in general.
And the second case is about isolating the victim. Isolating the victim is a typical abusive behavior. In some cases, the victim can practically turn into a hostage due to being completely alienated from the outside world. And in some others, the victim avoids the point of views of other people when under the influence of feelings such as jealousy, paranoia and fear fueled by the narcissist. The isolated person fails to notice the abuse they’re being put through due to not being able to consult to other people, and they also feel like this small, artificial kindness shown by the abuser is all they have now so they cling to it.
Another reason is that the victim is unable to escape, or so they believe because they were convinced by the abuser. In the Stockholm robbery, it was found out that one of the hostages got a chance to escape and yet she did not. The reason to that may be the fact she believed she could not succeed, perhaps she was simply afraid of the danger this attempt might bring. In this situation called “behavioral despair”, the victim feels so hopeless that they resign to their fate. In narcissistic relationships, if the victim is financially abused as well, or if they’re in a relationship where there are children involved, they can be convinced that there’s no way out for them. And if the abused person also has a narcissistic parent, it’s quite likely for them to show signs of behavioral despair. Babies are dependent on their parents in order to survive. But when it comes to children who grow up in problematic environments where their needs are not met; the fact they feel dependent and not strong enough as well as the “small favors” granted by their abusive parents every once in a while may cause them to develop a sympathy for them.
In our last condition, in order for the Stockholm Syndrome to emerge the abuser should display a certain amount of kindness. A desperate and hopeless person who’s already in a life threatening situation and utterly at the mercy of the abuser can start trying to rationalize the situation when they’re shown some kindness by the abuser. These attempts at rationalizing the situation may start with “it’s not that bad!” and end in deeply positive feelings for the abuser in time. After a while, the abuser stops being a bad person in the eyes of the victim, they’re simply misunderstood and turned into what they are today due to certain circumstances.
At this point, the abuser clings to the exaggerated versions of the few good memories they had with the abuser and starts seeing them the way they want them to be, not the way they actually are today.
Reasons of Stockholm Syndrome
Stockholm Syndrome is a product and natural result of systematic abuse, and it’s practically a survival mechanism. People try to save themselves from dangerous situations with “fight or flight” instincts. But running away or fighting it may not always be possible. If we consider the Stockholm robbery, the hostages cannot really overpower armed robbers, and their chances of getting shot are pretty high if they try to run away. As a result, the victim experiences stress and wants to protect themselves, but that doesn’t seem possible. Also, our brains and bodies are not fit for long-term and continuous stress. Therefore, eventually people tend to focus on the “positive aspects” instinctively in an attempt to reduce the stress they’re experiencing. This is practically something that protects them from going utterly insane and it helps them cope with the trauma. People suffering from Stockholm Syndrome have faced something so traumatic that the only way to reduce it was to do this.
The first instinct of the hostages might have been to pretend like they’re on the robbers’ side in order to avoid angering them rather than “focusing on the positive”. They can try to please the abuser to avoid violence. In bilateral relationships, if one of the parties is prone to violence and sudden, aggressive outbursts; the other party may instinctively try to keep them satisfied just to avoid their wrath. But after a while, once the hope for escape has completely faded, this situation goes beyond just pretending and the victim can find themselves feeling a genuine sympathy for the abuser.
Long story short, when there’s no hope for escape and that there’s no other options (or so you think), you try to fit in and adapt to the new conditions in order to survive. Besides, once you embrace the abuser’s point of view, you’re no longer a victim. This situation makes one feel less inferior and more in control of things. As long as the danger of maintaining the relationship isn’t much higher than the risk a breakup might bring, it’s quite hard for the victim to acknowledge the situation they’re in.
All these situations serve the abuser well, because then they’ve successfully created a voluntary victim. Especially for the emotional manipulators, keeping the victim completely under their control is not enough; they want the victim to be willing as well.
Despite all this, you might still find Stockholm Syndrome illogical. You might be having trouble understanding a hostage getting attached to their captor, or a child loving their abusive parent, or a person being unable to leave their violent partner. But do not forget that people who have suffered traumatic things cannot always make reasonable choices. Traumatic incidents are exceptional conditions and desperate times call for desperate measures.
What to do in order to get rid of Stockholm Syndrome in narcissistic relationships?
Breaking the trauma bond on your own might be too difficult, so it would be wiser to get psychological help if possible. You need to make sure the person you’re consulting to has enough knowledge and experience about narcissistic personality disorder, codependency and narcissistic relationship dynamics.
You need to cut all ties with the narcissist for good and follow the “no contact rule”. In this way, you’ll be able to establish yourself a safe zone.
And in relationships, you should always focus on the big picture rather than small details. These “small favors” other people grant you may cost you much bigger things in the long run.

24–25 Sep remembered on 8 Oct
Writing memories is like racing with time. From the Hong Kong 18 days ago, to the Bangkok 16 days ago, to the Copenhagen 13 days ago, theoretically, I am catching up with time, but as I caught up, I found remembering what happened harder and harder. Shouldn’t it be another way around? Or just the memories of Skövde, as a new place, are replacing the old ones faster? Or simply, I am tired of remembering?
“I arrived at Stockholm airport at about 0:30am, in the dark of the new moon, on the coldest day of the year. The Swedish officials had been notified of my arrival, and I had no travel documents on me. I did not use the Japanese passport to avoid committing the offence of forgery and waited for all the other travellers to clear customs before I went to the officer, telling them that I had no documents. A young officer guided me to his office to talk, and I cleared customs in about ten minutes. At the airport, Mrs. Gawell and seven or eight other members who were in charge of my case at Amnesty International came to pick me up. The temperature was -25 degrees Celsius, and they brought a jumper, long boots, gloves, a scarf, and a leather hat for me. They probably thought that I came from the subtropics, that I must have been wearing only a flimsy southern jacket. They insisted that I wear all of these things on the spot. I am sure that I must looked ridiculous. The police simply took my name and then asked me to return the next day back to the airport to complete the formalities. I felt that I was truly in another world.” — “A Perfect Escape” by Peng Ming-Min
Here we arrived at a city without memories.
I had never been to Stockholm. This was my first time. I arrived at the Arlanda Airport in the evening. Since I was travelling from Copenhagen, I did not need to go through the border control. The public transportation was easy. I managed to reach the hotel smoothly.
The name of the hotel was Hotel Expo. It was slightly out of the city centre, around 30 minutes by public transportation. However, for someone who used to live in London, anywhere that can reach the centre within 30 minutes, is included in the concept of centre and considered convenient. In conclusion, I love the hotel, and I would recommend it to anyone who’s visiting, especially if you’re on a budget. It’s right in front of a commuter’s train station, Älvsjö. (Like you can literally see the hotel as you leave the station.) I spent 1250 SEK for 3 nights. It was the friendliest price I found. What I booked was a single room with shared toilets. The room was small but with everything one would need, including a clean towel and extra movable spaces (unlike the room F and I stayed in Hong Kong). The toilets were clean and close to the room. My favourite part was the breakfast, which was included in the price. And not only it was included, it was fancy, with everything one could expect from a four-star hotel breakfast buffet — various cold cuts, cheese, breads, coffee, juice, milk, yoghourt, eggs, fruits, oatmeals, cereals, jams…etc., I can continue listing. And what was crazier was that the gym on the ground floor was also included, that as a resident of the hotel, I could use it for free. Free laundry was also available. The surrounding environment was not massively exciting but convenient, with a huge supermarket, Co-op (I almost tried with my old British membership, wondering if it worked.), along with Subway, restaurants, bars, Chinese food…etc.
The checking process was slightly odd. The man behind the counter checked me in, but said I hadn’t paid for the room. I checked the booking record, and made sure that I had. And then he said, “Oh, then don’t worry about it, I will check it again tomorrow.” That was it. He didn’t come back to me afterwards.
After my joyous breakfast the next morning, I started visiting my long list of places related to Peng or Hedin.
My first stop was Norr Mälarstrand 66. The seemingly ordinary address was where Sven Hedin used to live. The walls of the entryway were covered with murals of a world map, as well as a Chinese-style temple to honour him. I was dying to go in, so after taking some photos from the glass door outside, I decided to sit on the staircases, hoping to bump into someone leaving or entering. After 15 minutes or so, I realised that the day was not my lucky day, so I moved on to what was next on my list, Adolf Fredriks kyrkogård, where Hedin was buried, with a 30-minute walk from where he used to live.
On my way there, I realised that I was in need of a toilet. This might be something to confess — I believe that I had this “pink bubble” filter when speaking of Scandinavia. I was imagining public toilets everywhere, clean and free, public Wifi, water cooler, power outlets, free at every corner. However, a free public toilet seemed to be harder to find than I expected. It was almost 11:00am. It took me a while until I found one, an isolated one on the street. It was free, so, hurray! However, it was not as clean and well-maintained as I expected. But well, that was on me. I am the one who chose to wear the pink goggles, and to be honest, comparing it with the ones in London or Paris, it was a tiny heaven on the street. I happily finished what I needed to do, and moved on with my day.
When I arrived at the Adolf Fredriks kyrkogård, it was around 11:15am. I realised that the church was closed. (It was closed between 11:00am — 11:45am daily.) Luckily, the garden, where the cemetery is, was opened. It was a small yard, with, I would say, a bit more than 100 tombstones as far as I could see, which means, it shouldn’t be difficult for me to find the one of Sven Hedin, especially him being a famous figure. I started to stroll around, one side at a time, one roll at a time, carefully trying to locate his name. Unexpectedly, I failed. I kept wondering why and how, thinking probably Hedin did not want me to find him, that probably he did not not approve of my project, or my criticism towards the concept of explorers and what he did.
Do you remember my internet drama? So, once I arrived in Stockholm, I changed my sim card from the British one to the Taiwanese one, and bought some credit so I can have internet access here in Europe. It was slightly more expensive than usual, so I decided that I was not going to use it unless it’s necessary.
After almost half an hour of trying to locate Hedin, I gave up. I sat down on a bench, turned on the internet on my phone, googling the images of the tombstone of Sven Hedin. From using the housing in the background as a clue, I found it. Turned out that it was covered by a van, the only car parked inside the cemetery. I stood in front of him, explaining the project, and apologising, hoping to have his approval. I told him that I am aware that I am not in any position to judge, and I know it was a different time. The project is not about him, not personally at least. Through talking to him, I started to ask myself why I wanted to do this project. What is it for? I suddenly realised that in a way, migration can be a privilege, even for the ones who were forced to. Peng had to escape, otherwise he would have been killed or imprisoned, but again, how many activists at the time couldn’t, ended up in jails or some random cemeteries in Liu Zhang Li. Refugees had to leave, but again, we all know that more of them didn’t make it. So, it’s a privilege, but it doesn’t mean it’s not hard. It doesn’t mean living in a foreign place, learning a new language, facing unfamiliar environments is not something hard. If I can offer something, some sharing, some talks, so we can feel a little bit better, with our lives, with our choices, probably the whole thing would be worth it? That there could be some meanings in all these?
After talking to him, I looked at my phone, it was 11:45am. The church would be opened by now. I suddenly realised, probably he did it on purpose. If I found his tombstone easily at 11:15am, would I have the patience to sit for 30 minutes to wait for the church to open? I might have decided to move on with my day. Feeling grateful at the coincidence, I walked into the church. It was beautiful. I was the only visitor in the church, however, someone started to play the organ. Not sure if it was a regular performance, or the person was practising, it was magnetising either way. I found a bronze plaque dedicated to Sven Hedin on the wall. I guess probably that was the reason he invited me to come in. I also found a LGBTQIA+ friendly rainbow pin at the souvenir store. How sweet. I guess that would fit in the pink bubble goggle that I was wearing. After a short stay, I moved on to my next spot — Historiska Museet.
I actually can’t remember why I put Historiska Museet on my list. I guess probably at some point I read something saying that part of Hedin’s collection was in the museum. When I arrived, I noticed that on Wednesdays, which was the day I visited, tickets were half priced after 5pm. So I decided to come back later.
Where I went next was the US embassy in Stockholm. This was where Peng applied for his US visa. Even though it sounds like an insignificant part of the story, he actually visited a number of times, detailedly remembered and documented in his book. It was also kind of the turning point for him to move on with his journey from Sweden to the USA. From what I found online, the one I visited should be the same one Peng visited. It was launched in 1955.
I was surprised when I arrived. I was expecting a house, or a building at most, like most of the embassies are. The US embassy in Stockholm took up the land of the size of a university campus, composed of buildings and a huge yard. And as expected, it was barricaded. I started to take photos of the entrance, and of course, caught the attention of the security guard. He gestured to me to go over in a friendly manner, and I believed it was time for me to play the innocent, Asian girl, the tourist card. I said, “Oh, I am not here for anything. I just want to have a look, is it okay if I take some photos?” He gave me a positive answer with a smile. And without anything else to do, or could do, I moved on soon after.

Earlier this year I quit my job as the VP of Platform at SoundCloud and moved back to Stockholm. Working at SoundCloud was a hell of a ride which began back in the summer of 2009. At the time, I’d just graduated from KTH and was doing some work at Propellerhead. I was dreaming about starting my own company after falling in love with entrepreneurship during my time at SSES. Through SSES, I’d also met Eric who’s the SoundCloud co-founder and CTO. We have a lot of shared interests and became great friends.
Knowing Eric was a good reason to frequently visit Berlin where SoundCloud is headquartered. I fell in love with the city and was lucky to experience one of the legendary rooftop parties in SoundCloud’s first office. The team was starting to grow and eventually I got an offer to join. The opportunity was perfect; a chance to join a music tech startup I really believed in, work with people I really liked, and finally make the move to Berlin. We agreed over the phone on a Wednesday and started working the week after.
When I joined SoundCloud, we were less than ten people in a scrappy office and the whole company was doing daily stand-ups together. My job was to build relationships with other companies, mainly music software makers, and get developers to hack on our API. There was so much to do and so much to learn. I loved it and was so excited about getting stuff done that I was almost running to work every day.
We thought we were the coolest thing since disco, but in the beginning it was really hard to convince other companies to partner with us. After all, we were just a small startup from Berlin with rapid growth but uncertain future. However, sending thousands of emails, doing hundreds of calls, taking tons of meetings, and traveling to as many conferences as possible, eventually started to pay off.
As we got bigger, things got a lot easier and eventually we reached a point where we couldn’t even handle all the incoming requests from potential partners. I learned the hard way that it takes time to build good relationships and get people to buy into your ideas, and that timing is super important when it comes to closing deals, so you have to be patient and persistent.
Since I was doing partnerships with other tech companies, I traveled a lot to the US. At a certain point, we needed to establish a permanent presence in the Bay Area, and it was natural for me to make the move to San Francisco and setup our new office there. I was of course stoked about the opportunity to work in SF and get a chance to build a small office from scratch.
It took some time to get things in order, but eventually we got the paperwork sorted, found a great space, and started bringing on new people. I got to obsess with things like office furniture, culture (introducing Friday fika), finding the right people, maintaining the connection to our other offices, and evangelizing SoundCloud in the bay area. It reminded me how naturally passionate I am when I get to coordinate things and craft them down to the details. In the end, things worked out great and I’m really proud of having brought the SoundCloud culture overseas and established so many great relationships in the US.
Over time, we expanded the platform team and scaled up our efforts, and over time we managed to connect the vast majority of music apps and a ton of different web services. We launched partnerships with companies like Apple, Twitter, and Facebook, and created a big developer community who built hundreds of hacks on the API. I was also part of the management team and an active contributor to the overall company strategy work.
Starting a company has always been close to my heart, and as things were running smoothly in SF, I felt the timing was right to leave and build something new. I can’t help loving to build things from scratch and I’m constantly looking for new challenges. In addition, taking some time off would give me a chance to charge my batteries and think about my longterm goals in life.
I’m super proud of having contributed to building a such a great company. Building a startup is an amazing experience that I really recommend. I don’t think there’s a better way to try and learn new things. I’ve learned so many great startup lessons along the way and now I want to take that experience and create something on my own.
A massive thanks to Alex and Eric for giving me the opportunity to support their mission and the freedom to do a great job, and to all the awesome people I’ve worked with along the way! I’ve had so much fun and learned so much.

Before I go on with these holy thoughts, I must mention — Everything in KFC is overpriced. I think they are doing child trafficking for the chickens they serve their customers. So small, you start to wonder if they even allowed the chicken to walk before cooking it.
I even battled a bit of food poisoning in the end. What a way to start the week.
That said, if we stretch it far enough, it’s not hard to see how the whole Stockholm Syndrome narrative could be pushed into some rather unholy territory. I find myself thinking about how people grow up loving the very parents who used to beat the living daylight out of them.
If you’ll allow me the looseness, it doesn’t feel like a huge leap to draw a parallel with those who stay in abusive relationships, covering bruises with excuses and clinging to the people who hurt them.
Few things unsettle me more than watching a person tenderly unpack the logic behind getting brutalized by the very hands that claim to love them. It feels like a kind of demonic possession — something ancient, cruel, and crawling beneath the skin. And if we’re ranking horrors, this one isn’t coming in second.
I think it's Stockholm Syndrome, just nuanced a little.
I’m beginning to understand that there are some gentle themes to healthy living, and it…

Home to the famous pop band ABBA and furniture giant IKEA, Stockholm is the second most visited Nordic country. Built across fourteen islands, the city is known as Europe’s first “green” capital and boasts the longest life expectancy on the continent. “Fika”, the afternoon tradition of indulging in a coffee and pastry break, might also be contributing to the high life expectancy. Be sure to participate in this ritual during your time in Sweden.
This guide outlines a possible itinerary for a long weekend in the city. Below is a quick overview of the proposal:
Most US phone companies do not enable free European service. Check with your phone company before leaving to confirm your plan’s allowance.
Debit/Credit Cards are widely accepted everywhere. I never used cash. No need to take out any Swedish kronor (SEK), but if you feel so inclined, visit your local bank before you leave to get the best conversion rates.
It is important to note that Sweden (along with all of the Nordic countries) is an expensive country to visit, so plan to spend more here than other places in mainland Europe.
Stockholm experiences mild annual temperatures, with lows in the winter around 30 degrees Fahrenheit and highs in summer around 70 degrees. Its sunlight hours, however, are more interesting. During the winter, the sun rises around 9am and sets just after 3pm, making it a long, dark span of months. The summer is drastically (and thankfully) different, with the city averaging around nineteen hours of sunlight per day. Unless you plan to visit up north for winter activities, visit Stockholm from May through September for ideal temperatures and light.
The city offers numerous hotel, Airbnb, and hostel accommodations based on price. STF af Chapman & Skeppsholmen Hostel is a budget friendly, clean hostel on a quieter island conveniently in between Gamla Stan and Djurgården (the museum island, as I affectionately call it). Instead of walking (which is still very convenient), take the Skeppsholmen ferry that leaves every twenty minutes to visit main points of interest.
Gamla Stan, the old town section of the city, is another great area to stay in. The Collector’s Lady Hamilton Hotel in this neighborhood is a Victorian-style hotel with modern updates. In addition, Hotel Tegnerlunden is an affordable option in the Norrmalm District, a busy downtown neighborhood home to many iconic landmarks.
To get from the Arlanda Airport to downtown (near Gamla Stan), skip Uber and take the Arlanda Express. Purchase a ticket at the airport for $27 USD one way and arrive at the Stockholm City stop within twenty minutes. The ride includes WiFi and clean bathrooms. A walk to Gamla Stan from there takes another ten minutes.
Once in the city, utilize the SL ferries for an easy and quick system that locals and tourists alike enjoy. Purchase a ticket at every ferry station for less than $2 USD one way. Walking between each island via bridges tends to take time, so this is a better option, especially when going from Gamla Stan to Djurgården.
We got lazy and ended up Ubering to further neighborhoods like Sodermalm from our hostel (with prices averaging that of mainstream US cities). However, we wish we had taken advantage of the metro system. Clean and accessible, it holds the title of the “world’s longest art gallery” so I’m kicking myself for skipping it.
Start your day with fresh squeezed orange juice and a deliciously lite breakfast at Café Schweizer in old town Gamla Stan. This neighborhood is one of the best preserved historic districts in Europe, so take your time sipping coffee while wandering the cobblestone streets in the early morning.
Next, experience a free walking tour to better understand the history of Gamla Stan. The guide will point out key points of interest such as the Stockholm Royal Palace, Stora Nygatan (a lively street with music), and the Swedish Parliament where environmental activist Greta Thunberg began her global protests. If time permits post-tour, stop by Tasty America for a good laugh at a large collection of the over-processed foods popular in the United States. This grocery store was both intriguing and embarrassing, as it really outlines the absurdity of American food culture.
For lunch, pop over to Restaurant Tradition to taste traditional Swedish and Nordic fare. The Hairy Pig, a pub, is another great option for good food and beer. Try the Swedish Meatballs — you won’t regret it. If not quite hungry yet, take the ferry from Gamla Stan to Djurgården and head straight to one of the most popular museums on the island, the Vasa Museum.
At only $18 USD/adult, this is arguably one of the coolest museums I’ve ever been to. Vasa displays a well preserved warship from 1628 that sank twenty minutes into its maiden voyage, drowning all but thirty people out of its 300 passengers. It took 333 years for the Swedes to retrieve the ship from the bottom of the harbor. Visitors can now view the ship from four different stories, along with numerous artifacts and skeletons from the wreckage. The experience typically takes one hour. Do not miss this.
Stockholm has numerous other museums scattered throughout Djurgården and the city in general that you could hit after Vasa. The Viking Museum showcases 9th century Viking ships and artifacts along with a Disneyworld-like Viking ride. The ABBA Museum, a well marketed but somewhat superficial excursion, outlines the rise and success of the famous band. The Nobel Prize Museum highlights key Nobel prizes and laureates. The one museum I would NOT recommend, however, is the Skansen Museum. Although it is the world’s oldest open air museum and is supposed to showcase Sweden pre-industrial era, it completely lacks signage and guides to teach and clarify what you’re looking at. Skip this.
If you plan on visiting several museums, consider purchasing the All-Inclusive Stockholm Pass which will give you discounts and ‘free’ access to many city landmarks and galleries.
End the evening with dinner at Restaurang Kryp In back in Gamla Stan for more traditional Swedish fare and a great espresso martini. Then, head to Winstrom’s Pub or O’Connell’s Irish Pub for drinks and live music.
Stockholm is home to a massive archipelago with over 24,000 islands. These island chains create plenty of options for fun day trips. Stora Fjäderholmarna, Grinda, and Vaxholm are all small islands within a 90 minute boat ride from the main city center.
I had a really hard time determining which island to visit. Stora Fjäderholmarna is charming and only thirty minutes by boat, but does not allow one to truly experience life deep in the archipelago. Grinda takes approximately 90 minutes and has gorgeous views with many adventure sports to take part in, including kayaking and swimming. I’m a bit regretful that we didn’t stop here. The island we did select, however, was Vaxholm and I am both happy and disappointed in our choice.
Considered the capital of the archipelago, Vaxholm is known for idyllic roads and quaint fisherman cottages. To get there, choose from one of two main ferries. The cheapest option utilizes the public ferry, Waxholmsbolaget. Located next to the Grand Hotel and operating year round, the ferry does not allow pre-purchasing tickets so simply purchase on arrival. The trip lasts an hour or so.
The second option, and the one we selected, involves the Cinderella ferry and a history tour. With a restaurant, bar, and guided cruise, this ferry is a bit nicer and lasts approximately 90 minutes each way. It leaves from a different location (Strandvägen berth no 14) and only runs from May through September. If planning to visit Vaxholm and appreciate history, choose this option.
One can also drive or bus to the town as there is a small bridge connecting it to the mainland — but you’d be remiss to skip exploring the archipelago via water.
On land, explore the little town for an hour or two with its boutiques and waterfront parks, especially Johannesbergsparken. When ready for food, indulge in a tasty burger on the docks at Winbergs Kök & Bar or down the road at Vaxholms Hembygdsgårds Café. The latter was closed when we visited, but we stopped by to sit on the picnic tables and enjoy the view. I would have loved to eat here — the location was idyllic and the menu looked delicious.
If you have time, take a quick water taxi to the Vaxholm Fortress Museum, a site that was once the Citadel for Swedish defense in the 19th century.
My day trip to Vaxholm was great, though I wonder what it would have been like to explore a different island with perhaps more to do. The tour allowed for four or five hours on the island, which was too much for what the island offered for activities. I would have preferred to take the Cinderella ferry there for the history and the public ferry home so we could have returned faster and on our own time.
Alternatively, discover additional island tours through Get Your Guide or simply get out on the water with a RIB tour.
Once back in Stockholm, spend the rest of the evening exploring Norrmalm, a modernized downtown neighborhood next to Gamla Stan. Be sure to walk through Kungsträdgården, the city’s oldest park, and Hötorgshallen, a local food market. Grab drinks at the Lydmar Hotel outdoor pop up bar, then dine alongside locals at Restaurant 1889 Fast Fine Pizza. Known for its ritzy decor yet laid back atmosphere, this restaurant simplifies ordering with a QR barcode and no true waitstaff.
Spend the last day in Stockholm choosing from a handful of excursions:
Regardless of what you decide, enjoy the afternoon/evening in Sodermalm, the “Brooklyn” of Stockholm. Visit Söderhallarna, a modern shopping hall with gourmet food stalls and restaurants, or try Mosebacketerrassen, a beer hall with gorgeous views of Stockholm’s skyline. Skinnarviksparken, a park with hills overlooking the city, is another great place for views and people watching. For a casual dinner, head to gastro-pub Honey Honey. We visited during the Eurovision competition and had a great time watching countries compete while chowing down on pork schnitzel and Swedish meatballs with lingonberry sauce. Later, stop by Häktet for lively drinks with a younger crowd.
After four nights in Stockholm, my next stop was Helsinki, Finland. I purchased a one way flight for $200 USD that was quick and easy. However, I wish I had taken the overnight ferry with either Viking Line or Tallink Silja that would have allowed me to see more of the archipelago and saved the cost of a hotel for a night.

Visiting Stockholm | Nordiska museet (Nordic Museum) ❄️,https://medium.com/@wengileong28/visiting-stockholm-nordiska-museet-nordic-museum-%EF%B8%8F-cbe6b44d3434,"Sign up

The first museum I visited in Stockholm (I am a museum enthusiast) is the Nordiska Museum, also known as the Nordic Museum, located in Djurgården, an island in central Stockholm. This museum mainly displays the traditions and lifestyle of Scandinavians from the 16th century. It has over one and a half million pieces! The exterior of the museum is fascinating. It was designed in the Dutch-Danish Renaissance style by Isak Gustaf Clason. Founded in the late 19th century by Artur Hazelius, a Swedish scholar and museum director, who also founded the Skansen open-air museum in Stockholm.
💰Free admission with Go City Pass
Regular admission: SEK 170 by 2024 and free admission for children
Opening Time: Almost open every day, even on Christmas from 10:00–17:00
Once you enter the museum, get your tickets with your Go City Pass and you will see an enormous sculpture of King Gustav Vasa. Gustav Vasa (born Gustav Eriksson of the Vasa noble family, also called Gustav I) was King of Sweden from 1523 to 1560 and the founding father of Sweden. He brought Protestantism to Sweden and outmaneuvered the power of the Catholic Church. Every year on the 6th of June, Gustav’s name day, is celebrated as the Swedish national day to honor the electron of King Gustav Vasa.
Besides the sculpture, there are multiple exhibitions you can explore in the museum including:
The Arctic (Arctic Traces: Nature and Culture in Motion), exhibits the tools used in the Arctic and how people have lived in the Arctic through the years. It also brings up the topic of climate change and global warming. Notably, this exhibition is based on 3 years of research under Lotten Gustafsson Reinius, a visiting professor at Stockholm University.
On the right side of the lobby, you can see another exhibition: Strinderg vs. Youssef. It was created by an artist Daniel Youssef with inspiration from August Strindbuerg’s autobiographical novel Inferno. Inferno was written in French from 1896 to 1897. The book talks a lot about Strindberg’s obsession, e.g. occultism, alchemy, and shows signs of paranoia. The story behind the exhibition is interesting, but I am not going to lie, I indeed find the exhibition confusing and hard to interpret the display.
Worth mentioning that there are audio guides available in multiple languages for free!
Another exhibition is called British — Ever So Nordic. It displays the Nordic fashion, clothes style, and lifestyle that was influenced by Britain. One exhibition that I found quite interesting is the “Traditions” located on Level 3. The exhibition constructs the scenes and details of how Nordics celebrate Midsummer, Christmas, and Easter, and the history behind it. Next to this exhibition is the “Table Settings”. Basically, this exhibition shows the interiors and the table setting from the 16th century to circa 1950, including coffee and tea parties, tables for aperitifs, aquavit, and banquets. (You can also see a “Swan” in the exhibition).
The last exhibition that I went to was on Level 2 (Lobby) right next to the Children’s Playhouse. It demonstrates the setting of a traditional Nordic family and most of the displays there are interactive. However, I did not see any description on the official website, but it is worth taking a look!
Before leaving the museum, go to the museum shop and see if there is anything that you want to get as a souvenir and maybe have a real Swedish “fika” in the cafe on level 2.
Recommendation: 🌟🌟🌟/ 5
A must for those who love Nordic history!

I just finished my 5 km run. The sky was grey the whole time, but it didn’t start raining until the moment I stopped — like the weather had been holding back, waiting for me. As the first drops landed on my skin, I stood there, catching my breath, and suddenly I was somewhere else entirely.
Do you remember that day in Stockholm? Outside the Vasa Museum, the first snow of the week had started to melt into rain. We didn’t have an umbrella — of course we didn’t — and we just walked, laughing at how unprepared we were. I was giggling the whole time, remember? It was my first time experiencing snow. I must’ve looked ridiculous — eyes wide, hands out like I could catch the whole sky. But you just smiled and let me take it in. It was cold, but you didn’t complain. I think we were too caught up in the quiet magic of it all.
I closed my eyes today in the rain, and for a second, I could feel your hand in mine again. That desperate little run we made, slipping on cobblestones, trying to find shelter — we never really cared if we found one. Just being there, soaked and smiling, was enough.
I miss the way you looked at me like you wanted to say something, but didn’t. Like the silence between us held more than words ever could. I miss how we didn’t need to explain anything. Everything felt full already.
It’s strange how the body remembers. A cold wind, a wet sleeve — and suddenly I’m there again, with you.
Where are you now? Are you somewhere it’s raining too?
Always,Me

If I have to sum up 2024 it has to be ‘adventure’!
In the quest of making a pivot in my life, I made more than hundred new contacts this year. Every time I spoke with someone, I was looking for a match of vibration. And it actually worked like a story!
I clearly remember the morning when I stood outside a building in central Stockholm, inquisitive about what to expect in the meeting that was about to happen. The door opened, I was welcomed in. A nice lounge, then a kitchen with bananas on a plate. I asked if I can have one. I ran in the morning after breakfast and was exhausted of energy. The urge to have a banana overpowered my self-consciousness. Exchanging a few more sentences, it felt like here I am welcome to be who I am. It was encouraging to leave self-consciousness at the door.
The interaction with a group of people running this new AI firm was particularly positive. I met them again in a few days and it felt like they are brimming with passion to make something work. They have just started a venture and they are looking for someone sharing the vision. And it felt good.
They were fast, it took 3 weeks from the first meeting to the decision. They said this was one of the longest process! I had many questions in my mind, but positivity the company protruded overpowered it all. I matched their vibe, I felt genuinely welcome. The CTO promised me a laptop by the end of my first day. Little did I know that he literally meant it, in the evening while I was out running, I got a call from him, he was standing outside my door.
Working at an AI startup means quite a lot of new information to process everyday by everyone. We don’t have time to sit an ponder over frictions. We chase a common goal and try to resolve issues fast, that means talking more, opening up and showing earnest interest in the goals, finding what will make it work without triggering each other. Feedback loops are faster, tighter and effective. We are always learning and sharing.
There is a high intensity of external communication. We reach outs to people across the industry, write articles, active on social media, give credit to one another. My colleagues were happy to act as photographers, editors and writers to engage with the public, creating a strong thought leadership that draws visitors to our website without any external marketing help. And we pick up the phone and call! We gather most of our leads through our contacts, we make sure to present ourselves as who we are and present the strong determination to make AI agenda work, and our enthusiasm is contagious. There is a touch of genuinity in our proposals, we are a young company, innovative, ready to work, flexible. And we keep those promises that we make. No BS.
Some days are full of self doubt, prospects disappear suddenly, makes one feel small. The internal chat channels are saviors, its a lively space with messages, memes and regular business updates. We keep track of each other, not chasing hours, rather than putting in efforts to collaboratively build the brand. Its rare to have a day without a roller coaster of emotions from ‘Yayyy’ moments to existential doubts. Our salaries includes a fat portion of ‘Resilience’ which is unmatched in numbers. And it just grows, and the best part it I can cash out in any situation of my life, the ‘Resilience’ is the best fund to invest in, it will be with me through thick and thin and will be passed on in generations!
A startup business requires scaling down on lot of aspects. Conferences are silent time eaters, the more you go, the more time you need to process the information and to realign the offset it brings in schedule is weighed by the impact it brings. We don’t ditch it altogether but we are extremely choosy on what to attend. Post work gatherings on the other hand are so exciting and lively! We look forward to it, take turns to organize, sit and talk passionately about our lives and challenges. The conversations fuels the energy needs for the next couple of weeks, reloaded with laughter.
Its been 6 months, the company has grown more than a 100%. Its a dynamic environment yet quite simple, non-pretentious. Everyone brings their own self at work, with their creativity and ideas flowing beyond their roles and titles. If you work at a startup or know anyone working at one, verify if my claims. I am all ears for ‘adventures’ !

Following on from part one of my Stockholm trip at the Vasa Museet, this post reflects on my visit to Nationalmuseum — Sweden’s museum of art and design — and a conversation with Lena Eriksson, Head of Education.
Unlike my earlier visit to the bustling Vasa, this experience offered a quiet contrast. I met Lena on a Monday, when the museum was closed to the public. So instead of wandering the galleries, I had the chance to sit with Lena over coffee for a visit filled with insights rather than artworks.
Nationalmuseum is not just a museum, but also a government authority. Our mandate is to preserve cultural heritage and promote art, public interest in art, and knowledge of art. This mandate is set out in an annual letter of instruction from the Swedish government.
We want to put social development in perspective and be an active player in contemporary society.
This made me wonder: how different is a government-funded museum like this from a university museum? One key difference Lena highlighted was how shifts in government can directly impact priorities, including decisions around accessibility and entry fees. At the time of my visit, admission was 160 SEK (around £12.50), free for under-20s, but with no concessions for older adults or disabled visitors. Navigating such changes with each new administration must be complex, especially when core principles like accessibility can shift with political tides.
Lena also shared insights into the museum’s education programme, which, like many institutions, focuses heavily on children, families, and schools. Their website features a dedicated page for families, with free studio sessions every Sunday, the Oculus Walk — a self-guided family tour — and Villa Curiosa, a playful, sensory exhibition designed to spark curiosity and philosophical questions in children.
Naturally, my own research interests led the conversation towards older audiences. I was curious about the museum’s engagement with older adults and community groups.
As is so often the case, Lena explained that while some great work has been done — including sessions for people living with dementia, inspired by Meet Me at MoMA — these projects are often reliant on short-term external funding. Engagement with older adults still isn’t widely seen as a core part of museum work, despite Sweden’s super-ageing population.
One standout project during the pandemic connected older adults in Sweden and Japan through creative online dialogue — a beautiful example of how digital innovation can support inclusive, cross-cultural exchange.
Before wrapping up, I took a moment to check out Nationalmuseum’s accessibility information online. I was pleased to find it easily — just one click from the homepage — and even more impressed by the friendly, human tone of the opening message:
“We want Nationalmuseum to be open to everyone and are always working to improve our accessibility. If you have any questions or suggestions, we would be happy to hear from you.”
A small but meaningful sign that the museum is open not only to visitors, but to conversation and change.

With my other daughters occupied by their own half-term adventures, I opted for a city getaway to Stockholm; the bargain £29pp return flights played a huge part in my decision. When I’m on the lookout for affordable flights, I make it a habit to browse Skyscanner daily. Despite having to drive from the Midlands to Stansted Airport, the journey proved financially viable as we got cheap flights. Thanks to clear skies over Northern Europe, the flight itself was a mere two hours.
Stockholm in February unfolds like a fairytale, its cobblestone streets dusted with snow and its historic buildings adorned with twinkling lights. For travellers seeking an affordable escape, surprisingly this Scandinavian gem can offer a treasure trove of experiences without breaking the bank.
Embarking on a Winter Boat Trip
No visit to Stockholm would be complete without experiencing its beautiful winter scenery from the water. Despite the cold, a boat trip around Stockholm’s archipelago allows you to capture stunning views of the city draped in snow. Wrap up warmly and sip on hot beverages from the onboard café as you, immerse yourself in the tranquillity of Stockholm’s winter wonderland.
Discovering Stockholm’s Cultural Marvels
Delve into Stockholm’s rich cultural tapestry with visits to its renowned museums, including the ABBA Museum and the Vasa Museum. Dive into the pop phenomenon at the ABBA Museum, where interactive exhibits and karaoke booths bring the iconic band’s music to life. The Abba silent disco was hilarious, and my daughter and I made lasting memories. For a more educational visit then, journey back in time to the Vasa Museum, marvelling at the remarkably preserved Vasa ship that sank centuries ago in the harbour on its first voyage.
Indulging in the Culinary Scene
Stockholm’s culinary scene offers something for everyone. Don’t miss the chance to savour meatballs, a Swedish classic, paired with lingonberry sauce and creamy mashed potatoes or fermented herring. I follow a vegetarian diet, but there were plenty of delicious alternatives available. From mouthwatering vegan meatballs to falafel wraps and the comforting tradition of Fika — a hot drink paired with something sweet for a boost in cold weather — Stockholm offers an abundance of tasty dishes that won’t break the bank.
Unique Accommodation Aboard the Red Boat Hostel
For an unforgettable stay, book a room aboard the Red Boat Hostel, a floating haven nestled in Stockholm’s heart. Enjoy cosy rooms and breathtaking views of the city skyline or tranquil frozen waters surrounding the boat. With its budget-friendly rates, the hostel is the perfect choice. Plus, it’s impeccably clean, cosy, and offers a fantastic buffet breakfast.
Embracing Free Attractions
Maximise your budget with free activities, such as the brilliant and informative walking tour of Gamla Stan, Stockholm’s captivating Old Town. Wander through narrow alleyways and picturesque squares as your guide shares stories of the city’s medieval history.

Because it strikes the chord between kidnapper and captor for meeting the needs.
The primal pangs of hunger are often the driving force of human bonds. Hunger for us, is more than growling stomach.
Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs explains that a humans are motivated by five basic hungers.
a) Physiological hunger for air, water, food, shelter, and sleep.
b)Security hunger for health, property, employment.
c) Connection hunger for family, love, intimacy, friendship.
d)Psychological hunger for esteem, respect.
e) Metaphysical hunger for self actualization.
Being the head of the community vocational program designed for providing employment opportunities to girls, I’ve come across some baffling cases of marriages. No matter what the degree of abuse, these women never fail to patronize their husbands.
After listening to few girls, I decided to take an inventory to write and see that NEEDS can be irrational and self-deprecating at times.
I talked to more than 10 women from abusive marriages apparently. And to my utter shock they were point blanc unwilling to walk out of the marriage because they thought that however barbaric, they were protected from outer terror-fueled world.
Besides safety, they had one more thing in common – strong attachment.
Just like the victims of Stockholm syndrome. As they fell for their captors and develop a soft bond of connection with them. Because mostly the captors are the one’s who fulfill their basic needs like food and medicine and often physical intimacy when the require to process the trauma of being hijacked or kidnapped.
This is not very common, to fall in love for your kidnapper or captor but happens with people with low self esteem and history of abuse.
When I talked to these women, they were rude and said – better worship one man than be a raw piece of meat to wolves out there.
One of the girl who’s hardly 25 years, told me that her husband after thrashing her hard, treats her with sex and restaurant food. After beating the shit out of her when she is in pain, he doesn’t allows her to cook food. Even takes her to the doctor for treating all the bloody bruises. In this situation when she is being treated so well, she thinks of him as an emergency God. Especially when there is no support from the family.
Psychologists says that terror-bonding and feeling empathy rather than rage towards your captor is the classic example of Stockholm Syndrome. It can also develop between abusive parents and children. Where the child may feel protective toward the parent and try mending the ways to keep the parents happy, unsuccessfully.
When I tried to educate these girls on the psychology of the syndrome, they were reluctant to understand.
As they feel that bonding with their captors( read husbands) after years of intimacy is their survival strategy and looking for normality within the framework of chaos and distress.
What’s wrong in choosing bad when you have the worst? Saying this one of the girl slaps her butt and walks off to stich a new pattern of dress she’s learning under the program.
Psychological abuse is much deeper than we can imagine. It becomes the way of life when the victims have never seen the other side.
Listening to some of the girls – and coming from non-psychological background – there were times I was compelled to see their POVs.
No financial independence and emotional part of the brains shackled tightly.
I believe in rewriting these narratives women needs exposure, life skills, and independence of all nature.
Education on self-esteem, respect. But on top of all education on self-discovery, non-reliance and then finances.

In January of 2019, I started at a new company, which has its headquarter in Stockholm. It was clear that I would — at some point — travel to the capital city of Sweden to pay a visit to the main office. The first opportunity for this was an internal two-day-workshop. There were several options for the date I could choose from. I decided for the Wednesday and Thursday directly after Easter. This way, I could do use the public holidays plus only two additional vacation days to have a ten-day-travel. Two of those days, of course, for the workshop. The remaining days were free for visiting Stockholm. But with eight days at disposal, I decided to spend the first few days (Good Friday until Easter Monday) in the Norwegian capital instead.
As my company also has an office in Oslo, the idea was to meet up with some colleagues for a coffee or lunch. What I wasn’t aware of is that the Easter days are used by the Norwegians usually to spend their time skiing in the mountains. So nearly no one was even in the city and my plan to meet the local colleagues didn’t work out as planned.
20.473 steps.
To get from Oslo-Gardermoen Airport to the central station, there are basically two options: the Flytorget express train (196 NOK; 22 min) and the regional trains operated by NSB (105 NOK; 23 min), such as the R10. I chose the latter. Due to the cancellation of the flight by EasyJet I had intended to take to Oslo, I had to travel a few hours earlier than planned. Which also meant to arrive more prior in Oslo. But as the hotel I booked only offered check-in from 15:00, I had to come up with something to kill time. Unfortunately, this also meant to carry my backpack around the city as well, weighing about eight kilograms. During my first walk through the town, I already visited the Munch museum, but the famous scream was not on display, unfortunately.
One of the things I usually try to do is having a walk around the neighborhood of my hotel on the first day. This gives me quite a good feeling about the area, and I can check out where I can get some snacks for the evening and more importantly: bottled water. It’s not about not trusting the hotels tap water. But when I’m walking around the city for sightseeing, I avoid buying food or drinks in places crowded with tourists, as the prices are a bit higher there. My recommendation is to walk the narrow, little side streets and try to take a different route each time. I usually start in a general direction and find the path as I go depending on which way look more appealing. This method will give you a better picture of the city, and you will find the restaurants where the locals eat. These typically serve good quality for more reasonable prices compared to the restaurants located directly at the usual tourist routes.
28.984 steps.
For the first full day in the city, I decided to book the Oslo Pass for 24 hours using their Android app, which was very convenient. This pass already included public transport. Using this, I took the bus 30 to the peninsula of Bygdøy for visiting the Viking Ship Museum, the Holocaust Center, the Norwegian Maritime Museum, the Fram Museum, and the Kon-Tiki Museum. The Fram Museum got built around the ship of the same name, which was used for polar explorations and the museum included many stories of exploratory expeditions for the north and south pole. All of the mentioned museums had excellent exhibitions and are also suitable for tourists as items are mostly labeled in Norwegian as well as English. I originally planned to include the Norwegian Museum of Cultural History while being in Bygdøy, but instead decided to take the ferry back to the central city. After leaving the boat, I headed for the Akershus fortress, where I wanted to visit Norway’s Resistance Museum and the Norwegian Military History Museum, but both were closed for Easter. Continuing the tour of museums, I took a streetcar to Frogner Plass, to visit the Vigeland Museum about the work of sculptor Gustav Vigeland. Oslo’s city museum is just around the corner, displaying the history of Oslo or Christiania, as the city was named between 1624 and 1924. After I had to leave (as they were closing), I went back with the streetcar and having my last stop for that day, the Nobel Peace Center. This museum was designed very nicely and worth a visit.
After being afoot for more than ten hours that day, I arrived back to my hotel. Although I already knew there was a high rate of electric cars in the Nordic countries, I was still really impressed by seeing at least one Tesla in every single street. There were electric cars of other brands as well but less prominent. Furthermore, there are also quite a lot of electric scooters in the city. Problematic in this context is that they seemed to be allowed on the sidewalks, which I think is pretty dangerous. In fact, Austria just banned them from the sidewalks for this reason, and France plans to do the same.
20.236 steps.
For Easter Sunday, I booked a boat tour around the Oslofjord in the week before traveling. This tour lasted about 2 hours and might have been one of the main factors for my sunburn that I took from Oslo as a souvenir. This tour also included some facts about the buildings at the shores of the fjord and some local history. The Oslofjord is distinctive among the fjords of Norway, as it is one of the oldest, and was not formed by a moving glacier but being part of the Olso rift. After returning to the harbor, I headed to the Royal Palace, as the changing of the guard was going to happen at 13:30.
Although the park around the royal palace is quite lovely and open to the public, I went to Vigelandparken afterward, to see the sculptures, of which I had only seen the models in the museum the day before. I wasn’t the only one with this idea that day. The sun attracted a lot of people, who wanted to enjoy the beautiful sunny weather in the park. There were also some people around which seemed to me as they would be geocaching. And after looking at the map of caches around, I also started to visit some of them in the park as well as outside, while walking back to the city center. The downside was I got so distracted with geocaching, that I left my DSLR camera on a bench next to one cache. As James May would say: C**k!
C**k!
— James May
So I walked back the route I just walked as I was trying to remember when the last time was I had the camera in my hands. Fortunately, a Norwegian couple walked towards me, while I was approaching Vigelandpark again. The guy is carrying a DSLR camera around his neck. Hm, that looks exactly like the one I just lost. It even has the bubble level on it. Wait. Is that mine? It was. He handed it over and explained that they left a note where I lost it, stating they would bring it to the next police station. After having a short chat, I thanked them again, and we split up. As this was enough stress for one day, I decided the next thing I would do is to have a burger and a beer. For this, I stepped in at “The Scotsman.” Like other Norwegian places, you have to get a table first, remember the table number, and then walk up to the bar for ordering. In the background, I could watch the Premier League, as Everton vs. Manchester United was ending, followed by Cardiff vs. Liverpool. A friendly way to end this day.
8.563 steps.
On Easter Monday it was already time to leave Oslo and get on the plane for Stockholm. Somehow, I thought my flight would take off at 10:30 in the morning. Therefore I tried to be at the airport at 9:00, which worked. But somehow I had the wrong time in mind, as my flight was actually scheduled for 12:40. Well, time to find a seat and continue reading my book. But first, let’s find a pharmacy to get something to treat my sunburn. As I don’t speak any Norwegian, I took some time and was switching between shelves back and forth. In the end, I settled for a product which seemed suitable and was small enough to take on the plane. At the cashier, I didn’t have to pay anything. I was confused. The clerk pointed to a sticker on the product, which explained (in Norwegian of course) that I just found an Easter egg. This kind of ‘hide and seek’ seems to be a common thing in some Norwegian shops. It reminded me of some chocolate hidden in the Akershus fortress I noticed when I was there two days before.
After arriving at Stockholm central station, I looked for a supermarket to get bottled water and some lunch/dinner to eat in the hotel. I found a coop with a nice salad bar. And as I was in Sweden now, I couldn’t resist buying about two kilograms of Swedish candy which I emptied over the next couple of evenings at the hotel.
26.940 steps.
As the hotel I stayed at in Stockholm is named “Hotel with Urban Deli,” you can imagine that the breakfast you get here is not standard. Italian-style salami, fresh bread, fruits, yogurt, smoothies, a good selection of loose tea. There was nothing I missed and nothing I could complain about. Everything was fresh and of high quality.
After the great breakfast, I walked a bit around the neighborhood, without a specific destination in mind. While walking towards Gamla Stan, the old city, I came by the Mediterranean Museum. It has a broad selection of items from different cultures around the Mediterranean Sea, including Egypt, ancient Rome, etc. It mainly showcased the evolution of beliefs for life after death and corresponding funeral rituals. After a short stop for a chat and coffee at my company’s main office, I visited the Swedish Army Museum. Showing the history of the Swedish military equipment in the context of the timeline of wars Sweden fought.
As it was already too late for visiting the Swedish History Museum or the Royal Armory, I decided to have a short break at the hotel, before attending a 1,5 h guided tour through Gamla Stan. The tour named “The Ghost Walk” explained some of the darker aspects of Stockholm’s history and was presented by a guide, who was loving his role and tried to send chills down our spines. If you do one guided tour in Stockholm, do this!
Combined: 13.259 steps.
Here it comes, the reason I planned to travel to Stockholm in the first place. A two-day-workshop about communication and personalities. There was a lot of input I received here and lots of things I have to recap after the travel. We were eleven people in this workshop including the facilitator, most of which Swedish. Apart from having fun during the workshop doing some role-plays, we also got to know each other during joined breakfast, lunch and dinner on both days.
17.878 steps.
As the workshop days were a bit exhausting, I started this day a bit later. The breakfast in the hotel was again a great way to do this. But I passed on coffee at the hotel, as I had an appointment for coffee with someone at the company’s office again. Even though this was during my official vacation days, I took to opportunity to have coffee with some colleagues I usually would not meet (as we work in different cities).
While walking to the Royal Palace, I already noticed military marching music playing somewhere. The royal music corps was already on the way to the palace half an hour before the changing of the guard would take place (scheduled for 12:30). I wasn’t the only one having the idea of watching this today. People flooded the area in front of the palace, barely being contained by a few guards to secure the ceremony would have enough room to take place. Although I didn’t understand a single word they said via the public speaker system, it was still quite a show to experience. As the same ceremony in Oslo didn’t contain a music corps, a comparison would be unfair.
One of the most famous landmarks of Stockholm is the city hall though, the Stadshus. The Nobel prizes are awarded here, except for the Nobel Peace Prize which we spoke of before. And there are also some geocaches around. After having spent the majority of the day in parks, I headed back to the office, where an event for new hires was going to happen including Swedish student’s drinking songs, occasionally interrupted by some 15-minute talks. Another opportunity for mingling with colleagues I usually wouldn’t meet.
26.420 steps.
All the things that usually would cost an entrance fee were left for today. Firstly, because I planned to use the Stockholm pass this day, which even gets cheaper if you buy it online and then use the QR code from the mail. Secondly, because of the Stockholm Kulturnatt. Between 18:00 and midnight, a lot of museums and other places were free to visit and offered special tours or exhibitions. But the first thing I had planned for this day was to take the ferry from Klara Mälarstrand to the Royal Domain of Drottningholm to visit the palace and its surrounding park which are part of UNESCO’s world heritage list. The richly decorated palace and its park are worth a visit. In contrast to my boat tour in Oslo, I was prepared with some sun blocker this time.
After arriving back to Klara Mälarstrand, I walked towards Gamla Stan to revisit the Royal Palace. This time also from the inside. With the Stockholm pass, I could directly walk up to the entrance without the need to buy a separate ticket at the desk located in a side wing. At the admission checkpoint, you will be asked to wear your backpack in front of you. I forgot to ask why. In nearly every room, there is a little sign explaining the purpose and history of that room, from bedrooms to audience rooms. As the monarchs introduced a few different orders of chivalry over the years, there are also some rooms dedicated to them. There is a room for the Order of the Polar Star, another room for the Royal Order of the Seraphim, and so on.
Maybe the most prestigious award in the world is the Nobel Prize. Apart from the Nobel Peace Prize, the Nobel Prizes are awarded in the city hall of Stockholm. In 2001, the Nobel Museum opened in Stockholm, which was the next place to visit for me. In here you can find the history of the inception of the Nobel Prizes and temporary exhibition about Martin Luther King Jr. who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, one year after his famous speech.
The probably most popular museum in Stockholm though is the Vasa Museum. The Vasa was a ship built in the 1620s by order of Swedish king for demonstrating the great power of his empire. As he was continually changing his mind about the design of the vessel and demanding to include a higher number of cannons every time, the ship’s buoyancy was put in danger. In fact, after being hit by a mild gust, she sank during her maiden voyage while still being in the harbor of Stockholm. 333 years later, she was recovered, and the museum was built around her.
As the museums had to prepare for the Kultunatt, they all closed at 17:00. During the one hour wait for them to reopen again, I went to eat real Swedish Köttbullar with mashed potatoes and lingonberries at Sjöcafeet. Afterward, I was fit again to continue with the Kultunatt, starting back at the Vasa Museum, as I didn’t manage to see everything on the first visit. Of course, there was quite a queue for the museum building up. On the same island, there is also the Spritmuseum showcasing alcoholic beverages in the context of culture and society. It also included a temporary exhibition about food consumption and consumer behavior in general. Just a few meters further, the Nordic Museum waited to be visited, showing the history of Swedish culture. The focus for the Kulturnatt was put on how Swedish people dressed throughout the decades.
4.500 steps.
Two days before, I coincidentally read a mail from SAS stating that strikes might occur due to ongoing negotiations with their pilots. As my flight wasn’t booked with SAS directly, but via a travel agency, I had to talk to them for asking what was going to happen now. But my flight was not officially canceled yet. So I had to wait. On the next day, I rechecked the status of my flight and saw that it was canceled now. After talking to the agency again, they couldn’t book an alternative flight for me, for organizational reasons. So I had to see for myself how I would be traveling back home. I found a flight operated by a company I never heard of before, with a stop in a city I have never heard if before. And I started at Stockholm Bromma Airport now, instead of Arlanda, which in the end didn’t make any difference in my travel time though. But the 2,5 h stop in Växjö did.
Unfortunately, the Växjö Småland Airport didn’t have a transit area, so after having walked from the aircraft to the airport building, I was already out of the security area. So I had to go through another security check for getting to the gate. THE gate. There was exactly one. As only five flights departed from that airport in total on that day, they don’t need more. It’s the smallest international airport I ever visited. But it was relaxing as well. I used the time to continue the book I was reading, and soon enough it was time to board the same aircraft again for the flight to Berlin. In the end, I landed safely at Berlin-Tegel Airport and was happy to be back home.

So, it’s taken a bit of time to get this blog up… but, in this forth blog post in my #StockholmSeries, I reflect on visits to two neighbouring museums in Stockholm — ArkDes and Moderna Museet…
I came across ArkDes — the Swedish Centre for Architecture and Design — while I was exploring places to visit on this research trip.
I saw that “Admission to ArkDes is free throughout 2025” which was fantastic, but I was also really intrigued by a project they’re running — Unboxing, which runs every day for two hours enabling you to meet and chat to one of the museum’s curators.
Unboxing is the place where you, together with the museum’s curators, unpack and explore never-before-seen items from the museum’s underground archives.
I was interested by the concept of bringing the collection into a different space, giving visitors the opportunity to see behind the scenes, and the museum’s commitment to this being available to everyone, everyday. It blurred the line between exhibit and experience — a quiet but clever way to shift how people relate to the space.
I went straight to the space, which was easy to navigate to from the front of the gallery. Unboxing provides the opportunity for the museum to engage with visitors in a different way, gives curators the chance to talk about their passion, and for visitors to experience objects from the collection — for me, this was seeing architectural drawings — in a different way.
Next door at Moderna Museet, the invitation to engage was everywhere: tables with drawing paper, sketchbook stations, scattered books and varied seating. Each space offered a different kind of welcome, always with a gentle prompt to pause, reflect or create. I loved the moments of rest — especially a bench by a floor-to-ceiling window tucked behind a door marked “staff only” — an unintentional but beautiful in-between space.
I also met with staff from both museums, who spoke about the challenges (and small wins) of increasing access and inclusion, from updating signage to navigating funding and policy shifts. It was a reminder that innovation doesn’t always come from big gestures — it often lives in the details.

More than 100 miles north of the Arctic Circle, our Vy train to Narvik climbed an other-worldly landscape of lakes, rivers and waterfalls, dotted with cabins painted in Scandinavia’s iconic Falu red with white trim.
I was thousands of miles from home, and I felt as if I were on another planet.
Population and vegetation were sparse as we climbed in latitude and altitude, crossing through the Scandinavian Mountain range that forms the border between Sweden and Norway.
I have logged more than 40,000 miles by rail, and love trains so much that I’ve made slow train travel the subject of my master’s capstone. I have always been intrigued by the Arctic, drawn to the northern reaches when looking at maps. And for 24 hours in mid-October, I had the privilege of bringing these two interests together with a 637-mile train trip from Stockholm, Sweden, to Narvik, Norway.
After 48 hours in Stockholm with our cousins, my brother Michael and I arrived at Stockholms Centralstation — a 151-year-old transportation hub that draws 200,000 visitors every day — with about 45 minutes to spare, my bags a little heavier than when I first arrived in the Swedish capital.
Our sleeper train would take us through Swedish forests, over steep mountains and down to the Norwegian port city of Narvik, where we would catch a 4-hour bus ride even farther north to Tromsø, the third largest city above the Arctic Circle.
I grabbed one last cardamom bun at Stockholms Centralstation — my fourth in 48 hours — before we boarded. I had always associated cardamom with Middle Eastern food, but Sweden and Norway consume 18 and 30 times more cardamom than the global median, and cardamom buns were everywhere in Stockholm. Not knowing where I would find one again, I couldn’t resist one more.
When the train rolled in to the station, we found our car and boarded, joining a crowd of passengers from other parts of the world. I heard Italian, Chinese, and a lot of non-native English.
We had booked a couchette, a small space for six people, two benches facing each other by day, three beds on each side by night. I was hoping we’d have the space to ourselves, but we had the next best thing: just one other passenger, a quiet youngish man in a striped t-shirt and a baseball cap who had a bunk at the very top.
Mike and I didn’t stay long in the couchette. As soon as the attendant checked our tickets, we headed to the dining car, where we could sit at a table and enjoy some Bottenvikkens brews from northern Sweden and be around other passengers.
For dinner, I couldn’t pass up the most unique dish — reindeer stew with potatoes, mushrooms and lingonberries. Other offerings included folded flatbread with fried egg and Jokkmokk-sausage, and classic Swedish shrimp sandwich. Each boxed dinner bore the words “We proudly serve food made from scratch in Luleå.”
After dinner, I broke into the sampler pack of aquavit that I had purchased at the liquor store in the Åhléns department store in Stockholm.
One after another, we split four tiny bottles, each one with a different combination of flavors, including dill, caraway, rosemary, citrus, cumin, anise, sherry and cinnamon.
I split each between two glasses, and as we would do throughout our weeklong trip, Mike and I toasted with the Scandinavian “skål” first tapping each other’s glass, then tapping our own glass to the table as a toast to the house before taking the first sip.
Back at the couchette, we made our beds as quietly as we could, knowing that someone else was above us. I would have hated to be in his position, so close to the ceiling. I slept relatively well, waking up every so often to peek outside, in vain, to see if I could see the Northern Lights.
I knew that the restaurant car would open at 5 am and, wanting to be among the early risers, I got up at 5:30 to head down there.
The train was stopped at the Älvsbyn station, and as I made my way to the restaurant car, I found an open door and stuck my head out for fresh air. There I met a train attendant who told me we were stuck for a bit, awaiting information on when we could proceed. I sat and had my tea, texting with my mom and waiting — and waiting — and waiting.
I had oatmeal with cardamom, granola and lingonberries, and we waited some more.
After an hour of “we will know soon,” we were told that due to track problems ahead, we would have to take a bus to Boden and board a new train there, not arriving in Narvik until after 5 pm, long after our bus — and a final subsequent bus — to Tromsø would have departed.
At around 9:30 am, a bus arrived to take us to Boden. It meandered through Swedish forestland, the first of many, many, many miles of it that we would see in the coming hours.
I was disappointed to learn that the train we would board at Boden was a day train, lacking many of the amenities of our night train, namely, my favorite one, the restaurant car. We could buy food and drinks, but with no communal place to eat, we would have to take them back to our seats. We were assigned two window seats, one behind another.
The portion of the trip north of Boden is on a stretch of track known as the Iron Ore Line, which connects Luleå, Sweden, on the Gulf of Bothnia, with Narvik, Norway, on the North Sea.
The line was completed in 1903 to bring iron ore from Sweden to Narvik. Trains on this line have run on electric power since at least 1923 (while the vast majority of track in the United States remains non-electrified a century later). The line still transports iron ore from Kiruna, Svappavaara and Malmberget, as well as shipments of food, to the north, and fish to the south.
Watching the forests pass us by, I tried to detect changes as we moved north into a different climate. Most of the route seemed to be a dense mix of birches that were losing their leaves — a few weeks ahead of the brilliant yellow trees in Stockholm — and conifers.
As we neared the Arctic Circle, the birches had lost all their leaves, and they seemed to be fewer in number. The conifers, too, were fewer, as the dense forests grew more sparse.
What was also sparse here — noise. I like to chat with other people on trains, but this car was silent. We seemed to be the only Americans on board. Other passengers included a young British couple, a middle aged Scottish couple that we would bump into outside a pub in Narvik later that night, a group of about eight Asian people, and the rest seemed Norwegian, Swedish or German.
A walk to the coach area adjacent to the bistro was a much different story — a group of Italians were talking loudly and fast. I loved to hear it and wished we were seated with them.
Crossing the Arctic Circle was not as eventful as I expected. I had marked the spot on my Google maps a couple weeks prior to the trip so that I would know the exact moment we crossed. We passed a sign marking the spot — Polcirkeln — just before the mark on my phone. In any case, I had never before been above the Arctic Circle, so it was an exciting moment — and we still had miles and miles and miles to go.
Most of my long-distance train travel has been in the United States, where I marvel at the vast expanses of open space. With an average density of 35 people per square kilometer, the United States is half as dense as Europe, which has 73 people per square kilometer. However, for this trip, I was traveling through countries far less dense than even the United States: Sweden has 23 people per square kilometer, and Norway has only 17, about half the density of the United States. The land here was wide open.
As we pressed farther north, the train did not take on many new passengers, meaning the train, too, was not densely populated. We mostly discharged passengers, especially at Kiruna, a mining town in Swedish Lapland with about 23,000 inhabitants.
The landscape continued to change. The forested hills of southern Sweden were replaced by flatter land, shorter trees, and lots of lakes. In the distance, we could begin to see the Scandinavian Mountains, the range that runs the length of the border between Sweden and Norway, which we would soon be crossing.
After Kiruna, we could really spread out, which for me meant that I could move from the left side of the train to the right to take photos and video. It was here that we engaged in conversation with some fellow passengers.
Lars, from Bavaria, was going to Abisko, where he planned to take two 20-km hikes before continuing on to the Lofoten archipelago for a few days, and then down to Bodø by bus, and by train farther the south, to be possibly followed by a ferry to Denmark. He was clearly a fan of traveling by land and sea — and had the time to do so.
Ann, from Aarhus, was now living in Tromsø, traveling back north by land because of the detrimental effects air travel has on the climate. She was frustrated by how long and expensive the ride was, and how governments fell short of making it easier for people to make the right choices. Our delay would make her long trip longer and more costly for her. I shared her frustration, but reminded her that much of Europe is light years ahead of the United States when it comes to climate-friendly travel options.
I can’t say enough about the last few hours of that train ride.
After Abisko, the train began to climb the Scandinavian Mountains, reaching a height of about 1,700 feet above sea level, alongside mountains that towered much higher.
The word tundra always connoted to me some distant exotic landscape, something one finds in a nature book or a textbook. Now, I was riding through it, seeing it with my own eyes.
Mosses, lichens and low shrubs offered some color against the rugged, exposed rock. Birches that had long lost their leaves appeared here and there. If not for the sporadic red and gray cabins, I would have thought that a wildfire had recently wiped out this area.
To be more specific, we were crossing through a biome known as the Scandinavian Montane Birch Forests and Grasslands, a tundra ecoregion that spans much of Norway, as well as parts of northern Sweden and Finland.
Though I couldn’t identify them at the time, I later learned that many of the low shrubs I was seeing was likely a mix of crowberry, reindeer lichen, cloudberry, bilberry and wolf’s bane.
The trees were largely downy birches — I could easily identify birches by their white bark — that would grow no taller than 2 to 3 meters, but also may have included aspen, Scots pine, juniper, grey alder, rowan, goat willow and bird cherry.
We passed many alpine lakes that would soon freeze over under the coming polar night. Under the surface likely swam char, trout, tench and minnow.
In Sweden, the lakes all ended in -jávri (Báktájávri, Loktajávri, Vássejávri) the word for “lake” in the Northern Sami language. Once we crossed to Norway, they ended -vatnet (Brudeslørvatnet, Hansenvatnet, Telegrafvatnet) Norwegian for “the water.”
The sun hung low near the horizon, and I was grateful that despite the delay, we were not passing through this stretch in darkness. As I publish this in mid-November, sunset in Kiruna is 1:57 pm. On December 10, the sun will set at 11:48 am, and not rise again until 11:25 am on January 2.
In our destination of Narvik, the sun remains below the horizon from December 6 to January 7.
As we continued westward toward Norway, we hugged the side of mountains, going through several tunnels and snow sheds. Across the valley, I could see waterfalls, like ribbons spaced out on the side of the mountains. I spent much of the last hour or so in the back of the train, where I had space to myself to open and close windows on either side, and take video out of the left, right and rear of the train.
We made several stops in remote towns I could neither pronounce — Låktatjåkka, Vassijaure, Katterkåkk, Riksgränsen — nor imagine living in.
We crossed the Sweden-Norway border inside a tunnel, with the colors of the Swedish flag painted inside, changing over to the colors of the Norwegian flag.
The rail line from the border to Narvik is known as the Ofoten line, and it brought us from an elevation of 1,700 feet down to sea level over the course of 27 miles, as we made the final stretch to our destination.
Soon, we could see a body of water below, the Rombaken, a 12-mile long fjord that was the site of several naval battles during the 1940 Battle of Narvik. The fjord branches out from Narvik’s Ofotfjorden.
As we passed the massive suspension bridge that connects Narvik to Øyjorda across the fjord, we knew it was time for us to gather our bags, say farewell to Ann — with the chance we might see her on our predawn bus ride 12 hours later — and disembark, 637 miles from Stockholm and 130 miles above the Arctic circle.
At Narvik, we walked a half mile through a cloudy mist to the Scandic hotel. At nearly $200, it was the most expensive place to stay, but it was also closest to the bus station, it had a sky bar, and I was fairly confident it could be reimbursed by either the rail company or my credit card insurance.
It didn’t disappoint. The sky bar was amazing, with a nearly 360-degree view of the city. I can’t imagine being there to see either the Northern Lights or the midnight sun. But in our case, it was a cloudy and drizzly night, without much to see in the sky, but the view of the town was nonetheless fascinating.
After a drink and a massive charcuterie board, we left for Narvikguten pub, making a small loop up a hill to see what we could of the full moon. As we entered the pub, we ran into a Scottish couple from the train. I felt bad that they didn’t stick around, saying the prices were “too dear” for them, and that their pounds were especially weak these days. They were in Narvik just to check out the Arctic, heading back south soon and continuing on to Spain after.
We took seats at the bar, realizing quickly that not food would be served there. Into our second beer, we decided that dinner was not entirely necessary after the charcuterie board. We struck up a conversation with the guy next to me, Gus, originally from Oslo and now living in the north with his fiancé. He was a bartender at the bar, drinking there on his day off, stepping out occasionally for a hand-rolled cigarette.
It was interesting — and refreshing — to hear his impressions of Americans. He saw a disconnect between Americans’ personalities and what he reads in the news. We are a welcoming people, he said, based on the conversations he had with Americans on all sides of the political spectrum. But if you judged us based on what you saw in the news, what would you think, I asked? I’d think you were absolutely out of your minds crazy, he said.
During our conversation, our bartender handed Gus two buttons, meant for Mike and me. They bore the name and logo of the pub. They said it was their stamp of approval on us as visitors, and that they welcomed us back any time.
After three or four or more beers, we called it a night, returned the to sky bar for a nightcap and a bag of chips — and then turned in, alarms set for 4:15 am to make our 5:30 am bus ride, an additional four hours to the North.

Have you ever found yourself sympathizing with a known racist person or group of people? If so, this article will provide you with a lantern to make it out of the mental fog. Racism is a form of abuse. While most people do not develop Stockholm Syndrome during an abusive encounter, some do. They produce a psychological response that causes them to develop positive associations with an abuser.
You’ve probably heard about examples of Stockholm Syndrome in bank robberies, kidnappings, and domestic violence circumstances. However, there is no reason why we shouldn’t analyze how race factors into abusive relationships. I suggest that Black people and people of color who develop positive feelings about racists actually suffer from Racial Stockholm Syndrome.
Consider Uncle Ruckus from The Boondocks animated series. He is a dark-skinned Black man who often denies his Blackness, praises white people while condemning Black people. For example, Uncle Ruckus sang, “Colored folks talkin’ about ‘Save Me!’ / Wasn’t nothin’ wrong with slavery! / At least we got good food back then — uh huh, uh huh! / White man sho could be yo friend.”

In Los Angeles, the suburbs would always grow boring- a boredom similar to the tiring feeling of hearing the same song played over and over. At Princeton, you feel like you’re living in Neverland- nothing seems to change, and you always have this warm sense of quiet comfort. In Beijing, the weekends are occupied with sight seeing and night life, and the weekdays always seem to be moving in some direction.
Stockholm, Sweden is the most stable place I have ever lived. It’s also one of the most beautiful. Here’s a quick peep of the fountain right outside of my apartment:
Whenever I need a break from life, I always take a few minutes to sit by the water. Every few seconds, the wind blows the mist in your direction and you feel a momentary, gentle spray. It feels nice, like a cool, refreshing blanket that wraps around your shoulders. This is especially comforting when I think about home and the happier, safer days at Princeton.
And here’s a little view of the bridge connecting the main island with Gamla stan, the “old town” of Stockholm that’s apparently a tourist trap:
During breaks and weekends, my friends and I would take short strolls around the city, and since the majority of Stockholm is built on water, the beautiful views are never-ending. Occasionally, I would find time to walk around the city on my own. As much as I hate being alone, I could explore this place for hours, aimlessly wandering and appreciating the bits and pieces of Europe.
For those of you who don’t know, I’m here interning for a company called Nova Global, a top-talent network that finds talented people around the world and yada yada yada. Work has been amazing, and I absolutely love my coworkers-they’ve been a family to me.
But oddly enough, the memories that I’ve appreciated the most belong to the little lessons of the day-to-day life. Every single morning, I find time to go to the gym and exercise before work. And every single afternoon when I get back from work, I do the same. I’ve cooked nearly every other meal (Nikita, my friend/roommate, cooks the other half), and when the sink looks a little messy I’ll hop right on the dishes. Thanks to Nikita (he used to be a Latvian pro swimmer), I’ve learned how to prepare huge meals that are so healthy, you’d definitely have plenty left over unless you see the guy next to you scarfing down each last bit. I’m really grateful he’s here- he’s been like an older brother to me.
After reading this over, part of me wants to cringe at how spoiled I probably sound, but I don’t think I’ve been this happy for months. The first week was hard, but I finally feel like the background noise is subsiding and I’m regaining clarity and focus again. I’m finally back in my own skin.
Part of me will always be a little sad that I can’t return to the naive, safe-haven of my Sophomore year at Princeton, but I’m happy, and I’m remembering what it means to take life in strides. Week one has done me well, and I know that I’ll always find some way to appreciate each day.
A few notes about Stockholm:
Yesterday, my friends and I decided to take an impromptu cycling trip through Lidingö, a nature reserve slightly northeast of where we lived. Within half an hour, our surroundings transformed from high-rises and busy city intersections into miles and miles of forest and greenery.
Needless to say, it didn’t take long for a group of foreigners to get unbelievably lost on a never-ending trail of that. And every time I shouted to Nikita and asked if he knew where we were, we just laughed and shrugged. It was pure exploration, with no direction and no destination. It’s really been quite some time since I’ve felt so free.
Saturday afternoon, a day prior to the three hour excursion through “fucking” Lidingö (sorry folks, it’s an inside joke), Lucy and Tara convinced me to explore parts of Söldermalm with them. Similar to my little cycling adventure, most of our trip consisted of aimless wandering, letting our minds digest all the “new” that was around us.
For some reason, the entire time I wouldn’t stop chirping about how I wanted to walk along the water. Söldermalm was beautiful- arguably the most beautiful area of Stockholm I’ve seen yet- but part of me was drawn so strongly toward the water. And somehow, we eventually found ourselves standing near a cliffside that held the most breath-taking view I’ve ever seen. There was something special about the sight that restored that warm, comforting feeling that I’ve felt lacking for a while. It’s probably the happiest moment that I’ve had since I’ve landed in Stockholm.
That was when I decided that I wanted my summer to be characterized by serendipity. Week One was characterized by routine and stability, and it’s done me well. But weeks Two through Ten are going to be filled with aimless exploration and travel. I’m booked to fly off to some new country nearly every weekend, and I’m searching for something “new” everyday. It’s almost like I’ve grown an addiction to novelty.
If there’s anything I’ve learned from “fucking” Lindingö, it’s that it’s OK to get incredibly dehydrated and lost in a forest for three hours. We made more than a few wrong turns, but everyone made it out (more-or-less) alright.
Here’s a list of “new” things I’ve checked off or have yet to check off:
Part of me wishes that my mind read like a book, and that it would scribble down every moment I encountered just as it happened- a Carpe Diem recorder of some sort, I guess. But it doesn’t and it can’t, so I’ll do my best to capture how important this weekend in Amsterdam was to me.
Better yet, let me clarify: I’ll do my best to capture how important this burger-loving fiend is to me (sorry JD, but the picture’s gotta go online):
On July 15, 2015, JD Case touched down in Stockholm, and that’s when the (stupid decisions) adventures of Nathan in Europe really began. Europe, or at least the small portion of it I’ve seen, is great, but there’s always this thin cloak of nostalgia for the lazy, naïve days of year two at Princeton. There’s plenty I miss- the spontaneous trips to Starbucks, the 3 AM League games, the Papa Johns, the 3 AM Papa Johns- and I couldn’t have been more grateful that a part of that was able to visit me halfway around the world.
Last week, I surrendered my summer to serendipity, and the aimless exploration continued when we landed in Amsterdam. We hadn’t booked a place to stay until the day of, but JD was able to nab us a few nice spots for a really good price. Here’s a glimpse of the view outside of the aptly named “RoomMate Hotel”:
If Stockholm’s a stable, structured meeting where everyone in the room is prim, proper, and on time, Amsterdam’s a massive, rambunctious bar where everyone’s intoxicated by early evening. Perhaps it was the company, but the city of bikes and beer is definitely one of my favorite places to be. For those of you who don’t know, JD’s spending this summer traveling the entire world. During our conversations, he mentioned that he never missed home much because with every new place, there was always something new to see and experience. And in Amsterdam, that statement couldn’t be any more true.
Wherever you go, the bright lights that reflect off the canal waters always seem to follow you- it really makes the city feel alive by night. When we weren’t lost or eating massive amounts of food, we were in some interesting bar sipping on beers or fancy cocktails. At Vesper Bar (a place that James Bond would go to for cocktails, and with good reason), I noticed their genius motto written on the blackboard after a few drinks in: “Summer is a time when you drink triple, see double, and act single.” It’s been a few days since I’ve been back, and I think I can speak for both of us when I say that we respected that quote quite well.
Of course, the trip ended exactly as any adventure with JD Case and Nathan Lam would: food poisoning. The burger place we ate at above was great, but for some stupid reason we decided to hike twenty minutes to this other place called “Burgermeester” to grab dinner before I left, and that decision absolutely killed us. After an hour of (puking) lying on our beds in the room, we stumbled outside to enjoy a bit of Amsterdam minutes before I had to leave.
We sat by the water and talked about the “strange corners of life,” tossing little pebbles off the edge to see ripples across the surface. Moments before my Uber arrived to take me to the airport, a little lady bug landed on my hand.
They say that’s supposed to be a sign of good luck, and I sure hope it’s true. I’ve got eight weeks left to do and see everything.
A few things that serendipity brought us:
P.S. Don’t worry Chris and Jerry, there’s no way we forgot about you guys:
Here we have Chris 2Changz, shirtless as ever and with us in spirit and Snapchat. Don’t worry buddy, I’ve collected a few bottle caps, and JD and I have something way better for you when we get back to campus. Jerry, you lucked out. I couldn’t find any embarrassing pictures, but I’ll fix that up soon. I can’t wait to see what happens next year in Brown 423.
As you can see, it’s well into week five, but I’m going to do my best to do last week justice. Life in Europe hasn’t grown any less interesting, but it’s been raining lately, and the days in Stockholm feel as though they’re growing shorter and shorter. It’s not a bad thing — rather, it’s as though time has simply lost the weight that it held weeks prior, and that I’ve stopped counting the days. Novelty is always perfect for tying your mind to the present, and when you travel, you become fixated on exploration. It’s addicting, really.
Copenhagen, unlike Amsterdam, was peaceful, and I often found myself subsumed by random thoughts and musings about all the things that’ve happened the past few weeks. Even though it really hasn’t been long, I think it’s fair to say that I’ve matured a considerable amount. The bulk of the trip was spent with Lucy and Tara, but there were pockets of time where I wandered off, as usual, and stumbled upon those little treasures that make traveling worthwhile.
But I’ll get to that later. First, I want to share all the weird things that happened. I feel like that’s more fun.
“It’s like a theme park, and the theme is weed.” — Tara Ramdonee
Last week, JD and I stumbled into the Red Light District. This week, Tara, Lucy, and I discovered the Green Light District. Taking Nikita’s wonderful advice, we made it an obligation to explore Christiania, the “most ghetto, but safe” place in Copenhagen. Two things ran through my mind when I heard that statement. First, everywhere is probably safe for Nikita (the Latvian White Bear), because nobody in their right mind would threaten him. Second, if it was a ghetto, safe place, I imagined that Nikita probably was talking about some hipster hangout.
What we found was exactly as Tara aptly described above. I would’ve taken a few photos, but there’re signs posted everywhere that have a cancel sign over a camera, indicating that I would probably be badly harmed if I let the camera whore inside of me take over. There was weed. Everywhere. If you bought two burgers, you’d get a joint for free. I could probably count the number of people who weren’t high out of their minds on my hand. Don’t worry mum, we didn’t smoke. We did, however, grab a few beers and have a pretty great conversation. However, the rest of the night wasn’t exactly noteworthy. While looking for some clubs in the area, we somehow stumbled upon some eighteen year old’s Danish birthday party where they played Soulja Boy Tell ‘Em.
On Sunday morning, Lucy recommended that we go to this nice little cafe called Bankeraat for lunch. She kept talking about these “stuffed animals” and how these things were dressed up, and knowing the Hello Kitty die-hard that Lucy is, I expected something similar to Sanrio. What we found was this:
Going to the restroom was an even more interesting experience. First off, the rooms with toilets don’t have lights. Second, they have jump scares like this around the corner when you go down this steep, curled staircase into the secluded basement that houses the restroom that people use on a day to day basis:
But other than the fact that I felt like I’ve just stumbled upon the set of American Horror Story, the food was good.
All of these experiences were humorous and interesting, in a way, simply because they didn’t align with expectations. What I’m learning from all this traveling is that the world becomes unbelievably exciting when you escape expectation and let yourself float off in any direction you feel is right. I’ll talk about one last experience, and it’ll be the more sentimental of the three. Ready yourself for the strange abstractions.
Lucy was convinced- absolutely convinced- that the Little Mermaid Statue would be one of the prime tourist attractions of København. And she was right, but not for the reasons she thought were right. Here’s a picture of the Little Mermaid and all its glory:
That’s it. A dinky boulder with Ariel chilling up top. I think my friend Eric Sohng actually would’ve made a much better mermaid than the statue itself. In fact, I have photographic evidence (Warning: Adult Content). What was amazing about it was that heaps and crowds of tourists huddled around the rock, fighting for a prize spot with the star of Copenhagen.
However, there was value there, and it was in the water. I think I’ve slowly come to realize that if I were to belong to any element in the world, I belonged to the water. Right next to the statue, there was a small, unassuming strip of land where the water met Copenhagen.
For a good while, I sat there alone and retreated far beneath the surface into my thoughts. The water felt so vast and immense, and it kept me entranced during the entirety of Lucy’s photo-op (probably thirty minutes). And somehow, something unexplainable in me clicked, and I felt a pull from the world to explore everything. By that, I mean parts of South America and the rest of Asia sometime next year, etc. You can’t really explain moments like these, but they shape you and change you, and they grant you new freedoms that slowly become part of your basic human needs.
Quote of the trip:
“Shall we summon an Über?”
- Tara Ramdonee, our British friend
Perhaps it’s that I’ve grown too busy with work and travel. Perhaps it’s that I’ve really just stopped counting the weeks as I have the past month and fully adopted that Carpé Diem lifestyle. Perhaps it’s both (it’s probably both), but for some odd reason, I have been finding it so much more difficult to sit myself down to continue documenting my trip here. But I’ve started it, and I wouldn’t be proud of myself if I stopped it mid-way. Old Nathan would be fine with that. New Nathan is too, but for some reason there’s a bit more guilt attached to quitting midway.

Berlin is fucking rebellious, and I love it. In Stockholm, if you act slightly out of place in a public setting, you’ll probably be arrested shortly afterward for disturbing the peace (of course I’m exaggerating, but you get what I’m saying). So being in a city where there’s graffiti on every building, drug dealers at every metro stop, and amazing street performers scattered throughout sidewalks was especially refreshing for me.
Story time: As short-lived as the trip was, it was full of unexpected encounters, and not in the same respect as the other trips have been. Because rather than encountering beautiful vantage points and little local treasures, I shared some odd coincidences with people who I either met or, more or less, shared ‘peculiar’ ties with.
These coincidences happened a few times, but I’m only going to talk about the mind-blowing one because, well, who the hell wants to hear about anything else. On the last night I was staying in Berlin, Ray decided to stay at home. Makes total sense for him, because he doesn’t enjoy going out all that much. But for me, staying in would have been a crime because, well, I was in Berlin. And Berlin’s insane.
So I had a two options. I could try and make friends with strangers at the hostel and venture through the night with them, or I could go solo and pray that I would have fun and not look like that creepy lonely rando that you make a conscious effort to avoid on a night out.
Option One failed miserably, because everyone I spoke with in the hostel was 30+ years old and talking about heroine/death metal. Left with Option Two, I went off in some random direction and, as per the advice of my brilliant friend Stefan, just followed crowds. When I got off the metro, I saw a group of people speaking English with pretty strong American accents (yes, we have accents), and my first reaction was “Those kids are definitely in high school.” My second reaction was “Those kids are definitely from California.” I was completely off with the first guess, but spot on for the second one.
Ironically, when I passed by the group, I overheard one of the girls whisper to her friend that I was definitely from California. I guess cut-off tank tops and joggers throw you right in that bucket. And effectively, me being the desperate, lonely rando looking for friends, I turned around and, well, made friends.
Two of them were from Orange County, and all of them were juniors at Northwestern. And the crazy part is that they’re all relatively good friends with the group of Northwestern students that I met in Beijing last summer. Details aside, we had a pretty fun night, and I’m meeting up with a few of them when I get back to California in September. Despite all the wanderlust I’ve been feeling lately, there was always this anxiety attached to the thought of traveling alone. But that night helped me realize that when you’re more or less screwed with no friends, you’ll find ways to meet people.
—
Other than that, most of the trip consisted of photo-ops and (even more) aimless wandering. You could probably get the gist of the trip by scrolling through my album, since I upload enough photos to irritate the majority of my friends list, but I’ll skim through a few highlights.
Bonanza Cafe. Cool place. It’s where I wrote the Week 4 post, so if I seemed over dramatic/sentimental, it’s because they were playing in Nils Frahm in the background.
I always have these recurring nightmares where I either get hit by a car or drive off a cliff. So, being the grim and morbid child that I am, this photo’s actually pretty important to me.
For some reason, this section of East Side Gallery made me so happy I almost cried. Not entirely sure why, but I guess it was a short reassurance that even if things go to shit, everything will more or less be OK.
Random Notes:
The thing with counting is that people usually count what they’re not all too fond of. We count push ups, the minutes of a long, boring meeting, the number of days before we can see a loved one again- we count because, in those few moments, our mind becomes fixated on the passing of time.
And quite frankly, when I first landed in Stockholm, I started counting. I counted the few hours I slept each night when getting accustomed to the early rise and late shine of Stockholm Sun. I counted the number of weeks until JD arrived, and the number of surface-level trips to various countries that I used as superficial fuel to rejuvenate myself. And, by nature of this blog, I counted the weeks. Each week was tinted with its own ordeal that made me mildly uncomfortable at best, and to compensate for the discomfort, I wrote. Every point in your life- even the dry bits- can seem so much more interesting when you put pen to paper and document it all in story. Unfortunately, when that happens, you run the risk of living for photographs and “serendipity,” while casting everything else off as mundane. Trust me, it’s a pretty miserable perspective to have on life. Happiness becomes short-lived.
Roughly two weeks ago, I had a conversation with Nicole (Andrea’s Girlfriend! Go Andrea :D!) about how we’re both restless souls- the way four walls can transform into prison bars if too much time is spent at home. Eventually, we also spoke about how ridiculously unsustainable that is. And thankfully, when I started complaining about the the ‘vanilla-ness’ of Sweden and ranting about my wonderful wanderlust and need for novelty, she called me out on, well, how ridiculously unsustainable I was. Well Nicole, you got through to me pretty well, and I am infinitely grateful for that.
Recently, I haven’t written much, and I think it’s because I’ve stopped counting. I still love seeing the world and exploring and wandering, but it’s no longer what keeps me afloat. It’s been a process, and I can’t deny that, but I’ve really learned to find joy in the bits and pieces of life that I would have otherwise disregarded as ‘boring.’ Here’s a short list to give you an idea:
Come Friday, and I’ll be in London with my supposed ‘fiancée’, and come September 4th, I’ll be home. I can’t say that I’ve emerged a completely different person, but I can say that right now, I feel happy- sustainably happy- in the way that almost seems infectious enough to drown out the white noise.

“If life were as simple as a day in July, would we honor it so?” — P. J. Gordon
Can we honor the act of doing nothing more often? Would we tire of the nothingness? This reminds me of what some people picture retirement as, and I’ve witnessed many who tire from nothingness; they yearn for regimented days of rules and restrictions. They worked all of their lives to be free, and now that they’re free, they miss their cage. It reminded me of Stockholm Syndrome. When someone has been held captive, they develop a psychological bond of trust and belonging with their captor. In my poem, I put the captor as our life’s occupation.
Stockholm Syndrome is what retirees fear.
We worked all our lives waiting on the year
“What will we do with all the extra hours?”
“Guess we can finally tend the flowers.”
“What will become of the position I held?”
“Will they remember me? All I regaled?”
Years gone, time spent being fully engaged,
Almost free, but it’s hard to leave the cage.
~ P. J. Gordon
Retirement can be likened to graduation from high school. You worked hard for it, you’ve done it, now what?

Most of the human suffering in the modern world boils down to our fear of death. This is not surprising, since modern mythology stipulates that matter is primary and basically all there is.
If nothing exists beyond, above or beneath–whichever spatial metaphor you want to use–the physical universe, every physical and practical expression within its confines appears to be very important, such as gender, age, nationality, organizations, career, money, politics, laws, hospitals, formal education, formal science and titles.
Until it is not, because we all die. How unfair.
The good news is that death is merely a transition from one state to another, just like birth is. Death and birth are exactly the same kind of event, only experienced from opposite angles. We come in and we go out. It is like a long breath.*)
Suffering and the idea of an ultimate death both stem from the illusion of time.
The above means that when we are afraid to die, we are actually afraid to go home. We desperately hold on to this temporary existence, as if a temporary sojourn could ever be a true home. We persuade ourselves that the stage play we are in, this video game, this boot camp, is all we have. We anxiously pay attention to the sergeants of the boot camp who shout out their orders
One might even describe our predicament as a prison we fear leaving. This is actually a pertinent analogy, since this phenomenon is well documented — the psychology of it is well described in the wonderful film The Shawshank Redemption.
We desperately hold on to this temporary existence, as if a temporary sojourn could ever be a true home
When I look at our nonacceptance of death and unconscious rejection of home from a spiritual perspective, I see a collective Stockholm syndrome. A Stockholm syndrome on a species level, basically.
We have developed an understanding, even sympathy, for our prison guards, who constantly lead us to believe that this physical world with its societal structure, is all there is, and if we want to make the most of life, we’d better get out there and seize all the goodies we are able to lay our hands on and reach for as desirable a position in the structure we possibly can.
Of course, we can’t all acquire the same amount of things, and not everybody will be able to gain the most coveted positions. We learn this early on, and with that lesson comes another hard ”truth”: Life is not easy. Who said life should be easy? Some win, some lose, but hey, you just have to learn to bite the bullet and do the best of your situation.
But here is the truth: the essence of life is actually very simple. Life is a continuum.
Deep within, underneath the constant chaos of thoughts and feelings, you can sense that you simply are. You are conscious — you are consciousness itself. You experience — you are experience itself. Hence you exist, and you cannot not exist, because that is not an experience. This is all you can ever really, truly, know for certain is real.
Life unfolds from there, and that is all there is to it. All else are temporary mental or emotional constructs.
This physical experience is no doubt immensely important and in many ways a marvelous adventure. But it is not the whole story. Not even close. The best way to approach earthly life is with equanimous curiosity and joy. Not as if it were dead serious. When we open the door to our infinity, a weight is lifted from our hearts.
When we dismiss this simple and self-evident inner knowing life appears complicated. That is when we get the false idea we lack something, and we feel miserable and anxious. Neuroscientists have tried for decades to locate where in the brain consciousness is produced, to no avail, of course. It is in that futile physical search for meaning we become depressed, whether we try to find it in the brain or by hoarding things.
A basic prerequisite for upholding this elaborate matrix is the idea that humans are at the core selfish
We all come into this strange and wondrous place with the inner truth intact. An inkling remains for a few years, but we gradually forget who we really are. We identify with a name, a skill, a position, a story.
For thousands of years a plethora of societal structures have been imposed on us. The guardians of these structures — teachers, doctors, politicians, civil servants, lawyers, soldiers, journalists, researchers, priests, parents — are themselves involuntary pawns in the game, at least the vast majority of them.
A basic prerequisite for upholding this elaborate matrix is the idea that humans are at the core selfish and unreliable, which is why a structural order is needed. We learn that rules and regulations keep this flawed species in check to the benefit of us all. This is a tragic deception. This is, quite frankly, a big lie.
This big lie operates side by side with — and is fueled by — the widespread fear of death.
Someone might object that people were even more scared of death a few hundred years ago, before the introduction of a physicalist worldview, when almost everybody was religious, at least formally.
This might be true, but the difference would be in degree, not in kind, because that ”religiosity” was a very integral part of the matrix. In some ways the Church, for instance, was more materialistic than modern day atheism, whose proponents emphasize humanism. The Church was deeply in cahoots with the secular powers. Priests told people that God needed them to obey the lords of the world as well.
Adhering to a dogmatic, old-school religion is all about pleasing an external God and acquiescing to the hierarchy of His representatives on Earth. And if you don’t, you know which place you will be sent to.
The realization that we are all eternal sparks of God/Source/The One Consciousness is the most forbidden knowledge of all in the traditional Abrahamic religions.
We used science to drag us away from a system of outer oppression to a system of inner oppression
Wait, didn’t we liberate ourselves from all that when science broke with religion? It certainly looked like an attempt. But did we use our new scientific approach to find our way back to our true essence, our core of natural happiness? We did not. We used science to drag us in the opposite direction, away from a system of outer oppression to a system of inner oppression, called materialism.
Either your life is miserable because you are tormented by the constant condemnations of God and the Church, or your life is miserable because you feel the meaninglessness of being a randomly assembled flesh robot. In both cases you feel unfree. Imprisoned.
In the latter case, you may find temporary relief in embracing the system and its rulers, who tell you that all will be well if you just adjust a little bit more to fit into the intricate societal structures. So you try, once more, to do that. And to make the process smoother and less painful, you choose to sympathize with your prison guards.
This is psychologically very understandable as long as you don’t know that there is an alternative. But imagine the sea change in your perspective on life when you realize you can break out of it whenever you want. That all you have been told, and told yourself, about your identity is a chimera. That the essence of you is completely free.
If we all went there, no one would be afraid of death, and no one would want to control anyone or be controlled. The matrix would dissolve itself. It would be obvious there is no need for it.
*) I assume most readers of this essay are with me on what I state about a non-physical reality. However, if any readers are skeptical, simply imagine for a moment that there is a realm we temporarily leave when we are born into physical bodies and go back to when we leave those bodies, i.e. die. It may help to look into the well-documented accounts by people who have had near-death experiences, which by now count in the thousands; practically all of them say that the realm they have visited during those experiences feels very much like their real home and appears far more real than this physical one. New cases are being documented all the time. And then there is the research at the University of Virginia which, believe it or not, seems to confirm young children’s memories of previous lives. There is also other research pointing to a verifiable non-physical reality.

I wasn’t going to write about the election since it gets exhausting. But if you’re like me, you find it increasingly difficult to understand how some of your friends, co-workers, and family members continue to support President Trump. Not because of policy disagreements over everything, although there’s plenty to go around, but because of who Trump is.
Stockholm, Wisconsin is a town of 88 people last time I checked. Almost 70% of them voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012. But most voted for Trump in 2016.
Four years later, it’s time to take an audit of this president before you vote again.
It’s not that everything Trump’s ever done is horrific, although there’s plenty of that to go around, too.
I’m not oblivious to the fact that he got NATO to pay their fair share of expenses defending Europe, despite decades of American presidents asking deaf European nations to pay more. Trump defeated ISIS in Syria. I mean, when’s the last time you even heard of that group since Trump. He brought Israel and numerous Arab countries together. UAE and Bahrain to start, but I have no doubt that we’ll see another four or five peace agreements follow soon. Maybe more.

Many years ago, I used to belong to an online community which is mostly made up of young women in their early twenties. A lot of folks usually send in their questions, queries and stories seeking clarifications and often times, advice.
On a particular day, a lady sent in a long message which signaled that she was pathetic to her abuser and was also very mindful of hurting him.
There were several comments but there was a particular comment which got my attention, the commenter said’ She is suffering from Stockholm’s syndrome.
I was taken aback because the only Stockholm I knew at the time was a city in Sweden and my curiosity got the best of me. I really wanted to know what Stockholm's syndrome meant.
I decided to dig in and do a thorough research and discovered the following;
Stockholm syndrome explained
Stockholm syndrome is an emotional response which happens when an abuser develops positive feelings towards their abusers or captors.
The name came about by a man due to an incident which happened in Stockholm in the year 1973 It’s a story which depicts the loyalty of hostages to their captors.
This illness was named after a bank robbery that occurred in Stockholm, Sweden in 1973.Many of the imprisoned bank employees got sympathetic to the bank robbers during the six-day standoff with authorities.Following their release, some of the bank employees went as far as refusing to testify against the bank robbers in court, and even raised funds to defend them.The term “Stockholm syndrome” was coined by a criminologist and psychiatrist(Nils Bejerot) examining the incident to characterize the affinity some bank staff had for the bank thieves.
What causes Stockholm’s syndrome
1. Overdependent
When you’ve been dependent on your captor/abuser for basic needs, there’s a high tendency of emotional reliance on them.
2. Fair treatment
When hostages have not been threatened or when they’re being treated nicely. It becomes a dent of STOP IT, I LIKE IT
3. When hostages haven’t been dehumanized in any form.
Stockholm Syndrome and children
For situations involving children such as child abuse, there could be an emotional imbalance where the child sees the abuser as a protector especially if the abuser is a close ally or a family. Abuse in this form can be confusing for children because most times, abusers tend to intimidate and threaten their victims from speaking out. At the same time, the abuser also shows love and care to the child. This creates a confusing scenario and can also breed Stockholm syndrome where the child grows up believing the abuser to be a protector rather than a molester.
Stockholm Syndrome and tutors
In the same vein, people who have abusive coaches, tutors and teachers might develop a deep emotional connection with them and rather than see them in the light of the abuse, they create and give excuses for them thereby defending and sympathizing with them.
For Emotional, physical and mental abuse, The victims tend to develop an emotional connection with the abusers because emotional abuse on its own can make a victim develop a trauma bond with the abuser.
A trauma bond is a deep seated bond between an abuser and the person they abuse.
Stockholm Syndrome and sex trafficking
In the movie Gangubai Kathiawadi, which told the story of a young woman who was lured into prostitution and sold off to a sex trafficker, the lady refused to join in the venture because she considered it to be immoral and dishonorable. Day after day, she was subjected to series of inhumane treatment and she knew that in other to survive, she had to join them.
This goes to show that people who are captured and sold off into sex trafficking tend to rely on their dependents for survival. This can create a form of dependence on their abusers.
Is Stockholm Syndrome a mental health disorder?
Even though Stockholm’s syndrome isn’t listed as a formal mental health disorder but rather an emotional response to abuse.
However, there are common symptoms for people who have been victims of abuse such as;
1. Withdrawal
They tend to withdraw from people because most of the time, they find it hard to trust others and tend to believe that every other person is out there to hurt them.
2. Post traumatic stress disorder
PTSD is characterized by failure to recover after a traumatic event or in this case, abuse
3. Sleeplessness
4. Denial
5. feeling of hopelessness, failure, helplessness and often times
6. Depression.
If you or anyone you know is suffering from the Stockholm syndrome, please see a therapist as soon as possible so as to curtail any further imminent serious mental disorder.

25–27 Sep remembered on 8 Oct
After another 12-minute walk from the US embassy, I arrived at Etnografiska Museet, where everything converged.
This was where Peng worked during his time in Sweden, also the home of most of Sven Hedin’s collection. I spent 150 SEK for the ticket. The size of the museum is slightly smaller than I expected, but of course, it wouldn’t be fair to compare it with the British Museum or Musée du quai Branly. The first exhibition I encountered on the ground floor was Yokai, an exhibition about the Japanese Yokai culture (something ghostly or monstrous, but not exactly ghosts or monsters). It was well-curated, informational while entertaining. I was not sure if the credit should go to the Etnografiska Museet or other institutions who co-curated it. However, it was recommendable.
Despite its good quality, for a Taiwanese, Yokai culture is not something unfamiliar, and it also wasn’t the reason of my visit. So I quickly browsed through, and moved upstairs to continue my search.
When I was at the entrance, I saw one of the current exhibitions called “We are Seediq”. I thought to myself that “Oh, there is an indigenous group in Taiwan also called Seediq. What a coincidence.” Turned out that the exhibition was about the indigenous group in Taiwan. The exhibition was small, but again, well-curated and informational.
It is hard to describe how moved I was. I believe that it was the first exhibition that I’ve ever liked in any ethnographic museum. I am sure by now you can imagine, as someone like me, it’s impossible to be completely comfortable, seeing how these items were raided by Eurocentric collectors, explorers, or let’s be honest, colonisers, in the past, and seeing how the cultures were interpreted, as if there weren’t, or aren’t, any actual human beings attached to the said culture. It has always been something fascinating while irritating for me to visit ethnographic museums.
The curatorial concept of this exhibition started with a number of mysterious items as part of the museum collection, from an unsurprisingly problematic source. (What I love about it was also that the “problematic source” was clearly stated in the exhibition.) The reason I said “mysterious”, was because it was actually wrongly labelled as items from Atayal originally, instead of Seediq, due to the mis-categorization from the Japanese colonisation.
“We are Seediq” was co-curated among a number of institutions, including the Seediq National Assembly, and the Indigenous Cultural Heritage Master’s Program of Providence University in Taiwan. The involvement of the “subject’ themselves could be seen everywhere.
First, the title, the “we” implies the existence of human subjects, instead of merely culture or items. It was coming from the mouth of the subjects, not observers. And all the texts written were in three languages — Swedish, English and Chinese. (I know it’s not Seediq, but at least it’s a language that most of the Seediq nowadays can understand.) The interviews of Seediq people were presented as one of the major elements in the centre of the room. The faces and voices were unavoidably seen and heard. What moved me the most was that one of the weaved fabrics in the collection was considered the oldest, documented Seediq weaving pattern preserved in the world. And the museum is working with the organisations in Taiwan to study the pattern in order to recreate them. Even writing about these is making me emotional.
The “collection” here is no longer some “dead” items lying inside a glass vitrine. The “culture” has become alive, moving, working, involving. Then there is a meaning. There is a reason for all of these to happen. I know one might say that the museum should return the stolen items to Taiwan for good. (The texts mentioned that the items were in Taiwan for a time being before being returned to the museum.) I understand it’s not perfect. But honestly, despite the problematic, upsetting source, can we, as Taiwanese, be confident that the items would be well-stored forever, in a professional context on the island? And just reading the texts in the exhibition of a culture that somehow I found adjacent to (I wouldn’t dare to say that it’s mine) in my native language, already gave me goosebumps, which is something I can never dream of seeing in places like the British Museum. I haven’t even started to mention how Taiwan, as a country, as an island with adjacent islands, was being presented correctly in the exhibition, which is again, something I can not dream of in a European context.
After seeing the exhibition, I couldn’t help but make an Instagram story, recommending it, tagging the museum. I received a kind message from someone who runs the account. I genuinely hope that all the exhibitions in ethnographic museums could make me feel this way. I also heard that there is someone from Taiwan working at Etnografiska Museet at the moment. I am sure that helped with what I saw.
Finally, at a corner on the 2nd floor, I found something from Sven Hedin, titled Golden Temple. It’s a model temple he commissioned to make, identical to a temple he encountered in Chengde, China.
I was surprised about how little collections from him were on display, so I asked the friendly staff at the information desk in case I missed anything. She explained that on the ground floor, where the Yokai exhibition is, was Hedin’s collection. but it was removed for the Yokai exhibition. I asked if the collection will come back after Yokai ends. She replied, slightly awkwardly, with a no. I was curious about her reaction, so I googled afterwards. Turned out that the Swedish historian Tommy Lundmark published a book recently, criticising the display of Hedin’s collection in the museum. He believed that the way the collection was displayed touched only lightly, perhaps too lightly, on Hedin’s support of Nazism. Despite that Hedin being a Nazi supporter was not a news anymore, the book seemed to stir more controversies than there was. And the museum, using the coming exhibitions as a cover, removed all the Hedin’s collection, with only the temple left.
It’s a complicated issue. I don’t feel like I have any position to judge. As a researcher, of course I would like to see his collection. However, I also believe that before figuring out a proper way to deal with the problematic history, removing the collection for the time being, was more than understandable.
After the conversation with the helpful staff, I moved on with my day.
The next stop was Hedinsgatan. After I arrived, I found out that “gatan” means “street” in Swedish, instead of “garden”, as I originally thought due to its pronunciation. So, Hedinsgatan, is a street named after Sven Hedin in Stockholm. It was just an ordinary street. I couldn’t find anything special. I also couldn’t figure out the reason why this street in particular was chosen to be given the name. It was not specially close to where he used to live, or the cemetery, or the museum. It remained a mystery to me till this day.
Finally, it was five. We were back to Historiska Museet. I couldn’t find anything from Sven Hedin here, however, after knowing what happened to Etnografiska Museet, I doubt if the museum would want to point out which items were actually from Hedin anyway.
A cute anecdote happened was that, when I arrived, there was a celebratory event of the independence day of Armenia. A lady downstairs asked me to sign on the RSVP list, and I was confused, saying that I was only here to see the exhibition, so she let me pass. After going upstairs, witnessing the champaign and catering of the party, I wished I had signed so I could join. I thought about blending in, however, with my cheap, slightly torn out jeans, and the oversized jacket as a charity from my friend in Berlin last year after losing all my clothes in a luggage, I had a feeling that the plan of blending in naturally would fail. So, I tearfully walked away from the champaign and the finger food.
After the museum, I stopped by a supermarket to grab some bread, cold cuts, spreads and a light beer (which had a significant meaning that I only understood in a few days). I sat down by a beautiful harbour, and started my dinner. I was surprised that I couldn’t see anyone else doing what I was doing. The view was stunning. I remembered sitting by the Seine everyday with friends, enjoying wines and picnic-made sandwich in Paris. After a while, the wind started to blow into my bones, and despite the sunny weather during the day, my fingers started to freeze, and suddenly I realised why I was the only person sitting on the floor at this harbour, picnicking.
The next day, I visited the Konstmuseet in Skövde by train, to drop my large suitcase, so I wouldn’t have to travel in Europe inconveniently while paying for the overpriced luggage fee charged by the budget airlines (and not to mention the fear of losing it again). The trip took me almost the whole day. The 10:30am train was delayed for half an hour, so I arrived at Skövde at around 1pm. After a pleasant chat with David, the technician of the museum, who is also someone from Goldsmiths Fine Art, I went back to the station for my 14:28 train, which was again delayed for 45 minutes, and I ended up arriving at Stockholm Central after 5pm.
With some not-so-worth-mentioning anecdotes happening on the train, I arrived back at the hotel with a sense of relief, since everything I needed to do for work in Stockholm these days was done. To celebrate, I decided to take advantage of the gym downstairs. After spending 30 minutes on treadmills and other machines that I can not name, I felt like a human again. I know the ecstasy was all psychological, as a relief from the anxiety of aging and weight-gaining. Gym is a middle-class fantasy of a healthy life. When I was running on the treadmill, I believed that I was no longer the girl wearing the torn-out jeans, having cheap sandwiches and light beer sitting by the harbour, freezing, fantasising about the free champagne at other people’s parties. Whatever that was, it helped. I loved going to gyms, delusional or not.
I decided to spend my last day in Stockholm (this time) with art. After my last luxurious breakfast at Hotel Expo, I sadly said goodbye to it, and took a train and a bus to Karolinska Institute. It was where Carl Gustaf Bernhard, the host of Peng during his stay in Sweden, worked. I took some photos, and moved on to the Moderna Museet. Moderna Museet is a modern and contemporary art museum in Stockholm, connected to Arkdes, a design and architecture museum. Luckily, Arkdes offers free admission throughout the year of 2024, so I visited both museums in the afternoon, before heading to the airport, taking my 19:45, SAS flight to Heathrow, London.
I guess it’s about time to face this.

Aftab
We begin with Aftab (Persian for ‘sun’s beautiful rays). Let’s send Aftab to a school friend you’ve lost touch with and would like to reconnect to.
How do you send Aftab — close your eyes for 10 secs and send the suns rays to those you have in your heart. And add to this “<name> may you be at peace, may you be happy” and turn that to yourself “may I be happy, may I be at peace”
For the past 2–3 years, I’ve had the privilege of coaching a tremendously talented former colleague on and off. Our most recent engagement concluded last Friday, and I’ve come to realize that one of the most valuable words she needs in her life right now is “No.”….and that too for turning clients away who are no longer a match for her. This message is for her and for any of you as it may offer guidance to some of you in similar situations.
No, Nada, Nee, Nej, Non
“Really successful people say no to almost everything.” — Warren Buffett
What perhaps got you to the level of success you’re at today is saying YES to almost every opportunity. What will get you to your next level of success is saying NO to almost every opportunity.
Which is why I’m going to share with you the single most powerful tool to take your life, career and…

During my recent trip to Stockholm, I was working remotely on New York hours. I ended up loving this weird working schedule. I would explore the city from 9am-3pm, work 3pm-12:30am, and then sleep 1am-9am. Since I working during dinner hours, I decided to orient my trip around a daytime delicacy — pastries. Each day, I explored a new part of the city in search of the best cardamom bun.
I’ve always been a huge fan of cardamom, so I was excited to learn how ubiquitous cardamom buns (aka kardemummabulle) are in this city. They were all delicious, so it’s really about finding the one that meets your taste — they ranged from bready to buttery and from sugary to spicy. Many bakeries were closed for summer break, but these were the favorites I tried:

Ever had the sneaking suspicion that the corporations you hate have trapped you in an endless buying cycle?
You’re confronted with sobering stats about the effects of smartphone addiction on mental health, but your phone’s the first thing you reach for in the morning. You’ve watched that documentary about the true cost of fast fashion to the environment, but you can’t resist those $10 yoga pants. You’re appalled by the piles of waste generated by single-use plastic, but you still get your coffee to-go in disposable cups and your food delivered every day. You fully understand how algorithms are designed to harvest your attention online for profit, but you feverishly refresh your Instagram feed.
Why does the captive start falling in love with the captor, who suddenly seems so indispensable and necessary for survival? Why do we hate how brands use and treat us, but keep going back for more? Consider this: your brand loyalty and relationship with monolithic corporations might actually be a version of Stockholm Syndrome.
First, big brands lure you in with the product and create the illusion of scarcity, making you feel like doing without it isn’t an option. And then, when you’re finally held hostage, even the slightest act of generosity will get the company in your good graces (see: corporate social responsibility and activist ad campaigns). In time there’s some scandal or controversy with clear evidence that the brand is causing unnecessary harm to reap immense profits — but you remain loyal through it all, even feeling friendliness where there should be fear, admiration where there should be contempt.
This is one of the most despair-inducing aspects of Stockholm Syndrome: in the end, even after being released, the captive defends the captor.
Various scholars and experts have tried to put a finger on why. A book on surveillance capitalism by Shoshana Zuboff here, an explosive Medium article on Capitalist Stockholm Syndrome by Umair Haque there. Trouble is, we often don’t even realize we’re being held hostage. The recently viral, user-generated “10 Year Challenge,” where people post then-and-now photos of themselves on social media, is actually an astroturfed meme to train Facebook’s facial recognition capabilities, speculates Kate O’Neill from Wired. In 2009, you logged into Facebook. In 2019, Facebook logs into you.
Worse yet, brands themselves admit they aren’t good for us — it’s one of the ways they keep us in line, so to speak. Apple wants to help curb your iPhone addiction with Screen Time, a new feature that breaks your smartphone usage down to the specific apps in the hopes of motivating you to spend your time differently. Cigarette conglomerate Philip Morris International just embarked on an anti-smoking campaign as part of their vision of a smoke-free future. And in what sounds like a headline from The Onion, Coca-Cola and other junk food giants in China have successfully been funding the narrative that exercise — not cutting down on sugar — can fight obesity. They use their role in creating “solutions” to problems in which they, themselves, are complicit to generate positive PR, reeling us right back in.
Why, despite all this, do we remain brand-loyal? In the 2018 dark comedy Sorry To Bother You, union organizer Squeeze explains, “If you get shown a problem but have no idea how to control it, then you just decide to get used to the problem.”
There’s also nobody else for us to go to. A protest sign spotted at the 2019 Women’s March highlighted the fact that that there’s more public trust in gas station sushi than in President Trump, which isn’t a total exaggeration. Amazon and Google beat political parties and the state government as some of the most trusted entities in an American Institutional Confidence Poll conducted online by YouGov in 2018.
In recent years, capitalism’s sheen has (finally) started fading. Today only 19% of Americans ages 18 to 29 identify themselves as “capitalists”, and the trend goes hand-in-hand with the rising popularity of the Democratic Socialist values espoused by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.
This week marks the start of the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting, attended by hundreds of the world’s most powerful leaders. The United States’ Trump, France’s Macron and Britain’s May could not make it because they are busy tending to crises at home with big economic implications — the partial government shutdown, Yellow Vest protests and Brexit. It behooves the meeting’s attendees to acknowledge that our economic systems are in serious disrepair, and that rapidly rising income inequality is a feature, not a bug, of late stage capitalism.
So how do we ensure that we don’t fall prey to Stockholm Syndrome yet again, making new excuses and justifications for the next generation of brands as we wrestle free from the mega-corporations that control so much of our lives today?
As we enter the fourth industrial revolution, we need to reconsider the role and purpose of the corporation on our planet, and weed out the put-up-or-shut-up variety of consumerism. In his new book Prosperity, Colin Mayer of Oxford’s Saïd Business School offers a new definition for private companies: “Producing profitable solutions to problems of people and planet.” Will we keep condoning the harm that some corporations inflict on society and the environment, or will we demand that they do more, do better? It’s time for the captive to thwart the captor.

Long time no see, or at least on English. I have started to write a bit more on Swedish and more company and It-security focused articles. The reasons behind it is somewhat because of i have started a company! Finally i have teased about it for some time now, am i right?!
So https://lysellssecurityandtech.com aka Lysells Security And Tech AB is live and up and running as a fully working company with stocks and CEO and management and so on, “only” me and my wife still but it is a real company :D
Therefore i will move and probably write a bit more on my new website, with a bit more focus on Security parts and what is happening within security, more focus on companies and Enterprises. But fear not i will write more here on Medium but probably a bit more like write-ups, personal thoughts and stuff that maybe not is compliant with company blogs and stuff.
So as of 12th of august i am traveling to Stockholm, Solna to be precise, every Sunday i take the train up and Thursday i travel home again, it is a lot of time being spent in Stockholm where i am work as an It-security Architect for a financial company and during the nights i try to be busy writing articles, Talks and trying to get a bit more customers where i can help out with Security work. Just to keep busy and i love to work with Security so it is a win-win situation, and if i can work as much as i want to on the evenings when i am in Stockholm that means i can focus fully on Wife, Dogs and Family when i am home, i may even not need to work on Fridays either, so that means i will have 2.5 days home with family and wifey.
But the thing is because i am working and travelling that much i have setup some timeplanning as well, so Sunday and Saturday is full family time the phone is “off” and i focus on private time, Fridays will be a mix, i will often sleep in a bit because i often get home at midnight or even later but then on Friday i will be available for calls and some work-meetings, i do have planned some talks and lunch meetings often on Fridays so often half days.
That is one thing i recommend, plan your time so you get recovery and quality time with the loved ones, for me as a workoholic i work best to do some work on Fridays just for my own sanity and that is the time i have NOT being on other assignments so it is the right thing for me do some work and often many clients wind down on the afternoon of a Friday so friday until lunch is a way to get some stuff done.
But then be able to have the Friday evening, Saturday and Sunday off and get that quality time is golden. I will probably do some every other week in the future not doing it every week as i am doing now, because it costs a lot of money living at hotels and being away from family is tough. But for now it is a fun adventure and the travel home 5–6 hours is often a good way to wind down even if the way home is the worst one, you just want to get home and you cannot get there fast enough!
This was just a word blob, basically a brain dump of my thoughts and some tips and tricks.
But until next time! Be safe on the internet and be safe!

Disclaimer: My story tackles racial prejudice, not to downplay the seriousness of the issue but to highlight its absurdity. So grab your fika or popcorn, and let’s discover the absurdity of racism.
This is my story of how an unpleasant incident had an influencing impact on my life forever.
In 1980, in Stockholm, Sweden, two Swedish colleagues and I decided to walk to the harbour for coffee. We chatted about work, Swedish girls, and beer, matching our quick steps down the lane.
Suddenly, out of nowhere, a white stranger started shouting, “Du, svarta hund, försvinn från min stad.” We froze!
My two colleagues realised that the racial slur was directed at me since I was darker than them. The stranger noticed I didn’t speak Swedish and shouted, “You, black dog, get out of my town!” Those words were sharp and hurtful. It was the first time anyone had called me a black dog.
I felt angry and sad about what had happened.
I was enraged at the ignorance behind the words and sorry for the man who said them. It made me realise that some people will…

The only thing worse than being taken captive is sympathizing and bonding with your captor. But what if our captors are our own beliefs and aspirations?
A friend sent me a blog post that stopped me in my tracks. After reading Chip’s Wounded Entrepreneur post, I immediately went to LinkedIn to reach out to him.
His lived experience and deeply personal message resembled the lives of so many of the founders and entrepreneurs I work with. Touching upon the topic of suicide, that post was a wake-up call.
That’s the driving energy behind Founders Thriving. I wanted to create a space for entrepreneurs and founders to begin developing a healthier relationship between themselves and their companies. A place to build and grow your company but be happy doing it.
The Cult of Ourselves
We all need to begin addressing the cultish beliefs that make up the abusive relationships we so willingly endure with the companies we run. What these stories represent is how easy it is to be held captive by the companies we run; physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.
Most entrepreneurs launch their endeavor with dreams F-R-E-E-D-O-M. Financial freedom, schedule freedom, and the freedom not to report to a boss.
At least those were their original north-star goals.
But ever-so-slowly we silently mortgage away that freedom until we’re caged in by the one thing we thought would free us from the trappings of a normal 9 to 5.
Then like many long-term hostage situations, we begin to bond and sympathize with our captor. Gradually abandoning the people who love and support us in our greatest times of need.
Vicious Cycle
Unfortunately, after launching startups for freedom, what usually happens is entrepreneurs slowly trade in these opportunities to assert our freedom for personal ultimatums: “I’ve gotta do this to [insert infinite to-do-list here]” scenarios. Before they know it they’re reporting to employees and investors, working more hours, and making less money than many of their own staff. #founderseatlast
Version 1.0 of our early programming usually has two hard-coded beliefs. First, putting ourselves first is selfish. Second, our self-worth is largely dependent on our net worth.
If we get good grades we’ll go to a good school. If we go to a good school, we’ll get a high-paying job. If we get a high-paying job, we’ll simply acquire everything we need to be happy.
Now layer on the toxic startup tropes of kill it, crush it, hustle, and struggle and you have a perfect recipe for an emotional or mental meltdown.
I can’t count the number of founders I work with whose goal is to “make their first million.” I call this the “Miserable Millionaire Fallacy.”
Rarely do these founders know where this thought comes from. It’s simply always been there. It’s like a hidden feature that was included in Version 1.0 and bug fixed and patched to fix our current life circumstances.
It’s not until they’ve gotten everything they dreamed of, and are still unhappy, that they begin exploring other means of happiness, purpose, and fulfillment.
Exorcise Exercise
One good way to assess this in yourself or an entrepreneur you’re working with is to have them visualize their company as a real person. Then imagine having an intimate and honest conversation with that person.
Are they kind, encouraging, and supportive? Or are they negative and condescending; taking every opportunity to remind you you’re an imposter?
When you use this personified entity approach and add a dollop of psychology you’ll find that many entrepreneurs begin to sympathize with their captor and have begun to develop deep feelings of codependency with their personified company.
When the company is successful, they are well. When the company is suffering, so do they.
The beauty of this simple exercise is that once an entrepreneur recognizes the pattern, the turn-around can be incredibly fast. The first step is acknowledging your company is not human; therefore it is not capable of taking actions for or against you or making you think or feel anything.
The second requires an acknowledgment that you are wholly responsible for your thoughts and the resulting emotions that come from those thoughts. Based on those two steps, it is 100% within your control to change the relationship you have with your company.
To unwind the default programming of our formative years we need to encourage founders to normalize new behavior and make it ok to prioritize their needs first; essentially, an upgrade to Founder Version 2.0. By prioritizing their needs above the needs of the business, their co-founders, and their investors, business owners regain the agency needed to heal the relationship with their business.
The mission of the MEA is to reframe midlife — from a crisis to a calling. And if that calling is to share your wisdom with up-and-coming entrepreneurs then let’s create a safe space to meet in the middle.
My dream is for Founders Thriving to help prepare those entrepreneurs to work with all of you. I believe that if we take care of ourselves first we can show up more fully resourced for our teams, our families, and our community. Then together, we can all Build Something Better!
If you know a business owner stuck in their own Startup Stockholm Syndrome or someone ready and willing to prioritize their needs first, please send them over to Founders Thriving and join the movement.

Ahh Disney.. The corporate machine that’s been printing money by selling your dreams back to you is a .. tale as old as time.. you could say.
But while I’m always ready to engage in good faith and justified criticism of this behemoth marketing machine, I’m not in love with criticism that points the finger at problems that don’t exist.
Today, I had a conversation with a dear friend who brought up one of the original criticisms of Beauty and the Beast that I haven’t heard mentioned in years. This friend brought up the belief that some people have alleging Belle was suffering from Stockholm syndrome, that she didn’t have enough agency in the film, and that the story is problematic in the world that exists in 2021.
Since this friend of mine is in the process of producing a live theatrical production of Beauty and the Beast, it immediately became my highest priority to disabuse her of this belief.
I, of course, sent her some rambling messages to get my point across, but after making my point, I still wasn’t satisfied. So here I am.

I love Chigozie Obi’s artistry and I love her personality even more, so it made so much sense that I desired to have a conversation with her.
Two failed attempts at meeting and a birthday pool party after, Chigozie and I finally linked, and we had a conversation about everything — from love to relationship dynamics, fitness, friendships, work and her love for Lagos that may suggest she has Stockholm syndrome. The conversation was so good that we planned a second date.
I walked into Basilico — where Chigozie had been working all afternoon — some minutes before 4pm. I scanned through the floor but couldn’t find her until she popped up from the lounge in a corner, wearing a smile so wide and looking so good, as ever, in a lovely dress. She was excitingly taller than I pictured or, if I’m being honest, I was probably shorter than I thought.“Oh my God, you look so beautiful in person,” I said. Chigozie is more beautiful in person.“You too!” She exclaimed in a smile. “I love your top,” she said.“Thank you!”“I’m so sorry I dressed down. Had a crazy gym session,” she said, walking in a limp. Chigozie has been in the gym for a year now and is notorious for tweeting about the woes of exercising, whilst showing up everyday.“That’s so true! I should have worn slippers,” I said, looking at my flat heels and then back at her pair of white slippers. “Sorry about your pain. You’re really trying o. I’ve attempted the gym twice and I’ve quit twice,” I said, chuckling.She laughed. “How?”“I didn’t have a trainer and thought I could wing it like people say. Although the first time, a friend was my gym partner until she moved. The second time, I was checking out YouTube and stuff for routines. So both were sort of epic fails. I think I lasted two weeks for both,” I said, chuckling.Chigozie laughed. “I have a trainer though.”“Yea, I saw. How has that been for you?”“I really like it. I like that I can just go in there without having to think of what I want to do, and just let someone else think for me and instruct me. My only job is to just show up.”I giggled. “I like that.”“Yeah,” she said. “I see you have a new hair done,” I said, looking at her black braids.Chigozie’s eyes beamed. “Yea, I did it yesterday,” she said, excitedly. Her excitement was so real, it was contagious.“It’s really pretty,” I continued in admiration.“Thank you. I like your beads too. You look like an African Queen.”I chuckled in excitement. “Thank you!”Compliments are ten times better when they come from women.
“How are you? How has Lagos been for you?” Chigozie asked, looking at me.“It’s been okay, it’s been chill. I miss my family sometimes though,” I replied.“Where’s family?”“My family home’s at Ekiti.”“Oh okay.”“What?” I asked chuckling.“No, Ekiti is very chill.”“Yeah, it’s very slow too, and then Lagos is pretty fast. Too fast.”“Yeah, I really love the mountains as well. It’s very serene.”“Have you been?”“Yeah. I went in secondary school to…”“Ikogosi,” I finished her statement and we burst out laughing.“Exactly, exactly,” she said in a smile. “Then I went again for an Art Bootcamp. I think that was when I really explored. I went to Ikogosi again, but I also went around town and stuff, and I was a bit older. It wasn’t like a school thing, so we had more freedom. It’s a really beautiful place.”“Lots of mountains everywhere.”“Yeah. When I travel outside of Lagos I discover we’re not chilling here at all. It’s so fast-paced and so chaotic.” Chigozie laughed.“Very chaotic.”“But the thing is that I feel like I have stockholm syndrome. Anytime I leave Lagos, I get homesick and want to come back almost immediately.”“Really?”“Yeah. For example, when I went to Abuja, I was homesick in the first couple of days. It was pretty slow and I was shocked because I thought Abuja was like the ‘next Lagos’ or something, but nah.”“Abuja is actually so dead, not gonna lie,” I said, chuckling.“For real, but apparently, the people who live there like it so much.”“And when they come here also, they want to go back. They basically can’t stand Lagos either,” I said.“Exactly. When we tweet about Abuja, they’re usually like, “No, don’t come o. We don’t want you here.”I laughed. “For real.”“I want to go back again though; just to chill or relax.”“How many times have you been?” I asked.“Once.”“Me too.”“It’s crazy how I got really home sick when I traveled to London last year for a residency, too. I think the best time to travel to London is summer, maybe June or July, when everywhere is bright. It’s very beautiful then.”“When did you go?”“I went in April. There was a lot of rain and the weather was so gloomy,” Chigozie said, irritated at the thought of it. “I get. I hate gloomy weather so much. It’s such a mood dampener.”“Exacly! I made a lot of friends though, but depression was really… was really hitting. I was like ‘Ahahn.’” It felt like she was recounting a traumatic experience.I laughed. “I was so happy on the night I got back to Lagos,” Chigozie said, shaking her head.“You were like ‘freedom at last!’” I exclaimed in a chuckle.“Yes o. Lagos is very chaotic, but it’s still home.”“If you could live in anywhere else asides Lagos, where would you live?”“I think Ghana.”“Yeah? You traveled there earlier this year right?”“Yeah, I did,” Chigozie said. “Ghana is kind of like Nigeria in some sense. Asides the borders being close, there’s a lot of similarities between us in some ways, with the people and culture.”“Yeah. That makes sense.”
We continued our talk about how chaotic Lagos is and how comfortable it is to take walks in Abuja compared to how abysmal it is to do so in Lagos without being catcalled or enraged by drivers who threaten to hit you with their cars. Chigozie then tells me that she would love to move to a place large enough to ride a bicycle in.
“Oh you can ride a bike?”She puts on a slightly judgmental look. “Yes I can. Funnily enough, whenever people tell me they can’t ride a bike, I’m like how?” she asked squinting in disbelief.“What do you mean?” I was almost ready to fight.“What were you doing when you were younger?” Chigozie asked, confused.“Not riding a bike, I guess?” I giggled. “When did you start riding a bike?”“I can’t really remember, but I was pretty young.”“Do you have a bike?”“No I don’t have a bike right now,” Chigozie said. “Bikes are so expensive now, so I’ve heard.”“Yea, I heard too. Me, I was thinking maybe it was like 100k or something.”“Me, I thought it was 30k o, I swear.”We let out a laugh. “Even bikes are expensive right now. Everything is so expensive”“For real. Funny thing is that I made a tweet one time; something in the line of ‘How come you don’t know how to ride a bicycle?’ That’s how some people took it personally. I was like please nau.”I chuckled. “You were like ‘Sorry, I didn’t mean to.’”“See. One person said I was classist or something.”I laughed out loudly. “How did we get here?”Chigozie chuckled. “It was crazy because my friends and I would joke about it and we’d laugh, you get? After I gave the girl my reply, I just blocked her. That’s alright, that’s alright.”I chuckled.“It was obviously a joke, you know? Me, I don’t know how to swim and I’m 26 right now.”“I can’t swim either. I attempted one time and I almost drowned,” I said.“Me too! I’ve almost drowned as well,” she said in a knowing tone. I gasped like I had just made a fun discovery of shared trauma. “It was a terrible day. It was very scary.”“Exactly. And you wouldn’t be able to do anything.”“You’re just there!”“For real.”
We spoke for a while longer about swimming, the injury she sustained on her knee — that led to the failure of our first attempt at meeting— and how random events can make efforts on skincare futile.Chigozie also told me about how she had initially planned to have a birthday pool party at the restaurant we were, until she was told that there was a minimum spend of 500k.“That’s so crazy because you didn’t even know what you were going to order for yet,” I said with a surprised look on my face.“Thank you. It didn’t make sense at all. And I was so disappointed because the guy who initially told me it was okay didn’t apologize for the inconvenience or whatever. I felt bad about it until a friend linked me to another location. It’s called 37 Lagos, and it was so good! Plus their pool is way larger than the one they have here.”“Oh real? Lagos restaurants are really coming up with this minimum spend thing and it’s so annoying,” I said, recounting my own experience.“It’s unnecessarily classist and annoying. I almost cancelled my birthday plans, but a friend linked me to another location.”“Do you have pictures from that day? I don’t think I saw them.”“Oh real? Are you sure?” “Yea. I think I only saw the pictures where you said you had a good day.”“Let me show you,” Chigozie said, opening her Twitter app and scrolling through her media. I spotted a viral video of Trevor Jackson covering Tyla’s Water — Chigozie had posted the video earlier that day, and we laughed about it, knowingly.“You’re such a menace,” I said in a giggle.She laughed. “That video is so funny. I laugh every time I think about it.”
“How did you have a pool party without knowing how to swim though?” I asked on a lighter note while looking through the videos of her pool party, but I was genuinely curious. The pool was truly large.Chigozie chuckled. “So I basically just stood in the shallow end and was kicking my feet. I don’t know how to swim, but I love water. I love being in water.”“Interesting.”I found it even more interesting because she loved something that she almost drowned in.“Yeah.”
“So how are you right now?” I asked.She hesitated. “I’m just here. I’m okay. Turned a new age.”“How does that feel for you?”“In my head, I feel like I’m still 22, to be honest. Or 23. Every time, I’m like ‘Wow, I’m 26.’ Obviously, I don’t behave like a 22 or 23 year old, but in my head I feel like a baby. Like I’m still quite young.”“Like you’re just a girl,” I said amused.Chigozie smiled. “Exactly! Like I’m just a girl,” she said. “It doesn’t feel that much different, to be fair, but next year, especially with my work, I want it to be more successful. I feel like this year was calm, basically for resting. It was easy, more about figuring stuff out. I’m slowly getting into work mode already though, but next year will be awesome.”“Were you excited about your birthday?”“Yes, I was, actually. Usually, I’m not necessarily excited for my birthday, but this year I decided to be. Even when the plans for my birthday location fell through and I was sad, the next day, I got up and decided to be happy,” she said. “You only get one day to truly celebrate yourself — one day that’s for you, so I believe we should try to really enjoy those special days.”“Yea exactly. You’re not lying.”
Chigozie got a call that lasted for about a minute. A call that started with “Hi baby…” and sounded pretty intimate too.
“Are you in a relationship?”“So I got into one recently,” she said.“Oh so you’re new,” I said chuckling.She smiled — or blushed. “Yeah. I feel like I’ve known him for a while though. Like I’ve known him for the longest, which is really great because we kind of like eased into it.”“Yeah. I feel like going into relationships slowly makes a lot of sense; instead of just rushing into it.”“Exactly,” Chigozie said. “So it’s really nice. I feel like it’s one of those things that make life less difficult and crazy.”“I feel you. Having someone to text on those crazy days can be very sweet.”“For real,” she said. “Are you in a relationship?” “No,” I replied almost immediately and we both burst into a long laugh.“It’s the way you replied so fast for me,” Chigozie said in a laugh.“Oh my God. I didn’t know it came out so fast either,” I said, still laughing.“Are you like searching or something?”I hesitated. “I don’t know. I don’t think I’m actively searching,” I started. “I enjoy having crushes though,” I continued in a grin.“Crushes can be fun,” Chigozie said.“Yeah. I’m so done with situationships though. Like it’s enough.”“Thank you please!” She exclaimed in alliance.“I want something really sweet.”“You’ll find it.”“Were you looking for love when you found it?”“Not necessarily. I had gotten out of a thing when it happened.”“Oh you got out of a relationship this year?”“Yeah.” Chigozie paused. “Well, no.” She smiled. “We were pretty much undefined.”“A situationship?”She laughed. “More or less. Exactly.”I chuckled. “How was that?”“Never again o!” Chigozie exclaimed.We burst out into a laugh that said a lot about the crazy experiences we’ve both had.“Literally never again. I tell everyone I know not to go into situationships. Unless you’re both really okay with it, it’s fine,” Chigozie said.“Yeah.”“I think I’m a lover, to be honest. I’m a very big lover girl. So situationships are not my thing. I’ve not had a lot of them so when people talked about them, I was like ‘I can’t relate,’ until I related and was like ‘Omo, this thing is crazy o!’ I can’t be doing this please.”I laughed.“And I feel like situationship breakups hurt even more than relationship breakups. With relationships, you had that person, you experienced that person, but with situationships, it’s just something that never was.”“Exactly. It didn’t even happen, but like it was so exciting.”“Yeah, like so much impact still. So I don’t recommend for people who love love and are very soft because they’ll definitely fall in love. It’s even more risky when sex gets involved.”“For real. There’s this bond that’ll be created. A bond that might only be in your head. Like it’d be only you catching feelings.”“Yeah. So I think it’s best to just save yourself while it’s still early because the deeper you fall into it, the more hopeful you get and the more tragic the end is,” Chigozie said.She made a lot of sense.“I saw a video one time and it described how, with men, loving occurs in a process, but with women, they most likely have feelings for a man before they even start dating. There’s this rush already.”“Yeah! That’s so accurate. I think we get too emotionally connected and sometimes we don’t even know how connected we got until much later and we’re like ‘Wow. This thing really impacted and affected me.’”“Another thing I don’t like about situationships is how you can’t hold the other person accountable for the stuff they do that may have offended you, but with relationships, you can sit your partner down and explain in detail,” I said, tapping on the couch we were sitting on.Chigozie chuckled. “You would even have the right to have the conversation. Honestly, I feel like I can be so self aware with people, so I always like to check in. I never want to overstep my boundary or feel like I’m doing too much, so I always try to be clear. That’s not something I can enjoy doing in situationships.”“Yeah, for real.”“And when you get into healthy relationships, you realize you wasted so much time holding on to half-assed love,” Chigozie said.“Right?”
We talked further about how relationships hold so much weight and how important it is to be with someone who, according to Chigozie, would not be one of your 99 problems and would love communicating with you, even during fights.“The worst thing is when you’re an overthinker and you’re not with someone who loves listening to you and is interested in validating your feelings. Every action weighs on you,” Chigozie said.“Yeah, that’s so true,” I said. “I think that when somebody raises an issue or talks about a weird way you treated them, it’s not because they hate you. I think that if they tell you that you did this, it’s because they like you enough to talk about it and they still want you to be in their life.”“Exactly.”“And most times, how you see things might be different, but it’s so important to validate those feelings still. They’re not talking about what you meant or your intent, instead, they’re talking about how you made them feel.”“Yeah. And I feel it’s so important to be considerate in expressing your feelings too. I also believe it’s important to lay your feelings down on the table and talk things out — my friends have really helped me with this. You know, you might even end up apologizing, but at the end of the day, your connection grows stronger and that’s better than any ‘win.’”“For real. I really feel you on that.”
We talked more about conflict in relationships — be it romance or friendships — and how important it is to address issues with the other person in mind. We also talked about knowing when to let go of certain people when issues keep recurring and there’s no potential of a better relationship with them.
“So I want to ask a question about your artistry. How come all your paintings look like you?” My question was almost accusatory.
“It’s not even intentional,” Chigozie replied, giggling. “I’m not even doing it on purpose all the time. A lot of my paintings speak on things concerning me, so yeah those ones, but I actually don’t do it on purpose.” She paused. “Yeah, maybe I know my face so well and the way I paint sometimes reflects that, but I don’t mind it though because at the end of the day, a lot of the things I paint speak to me, so I feel like in that way, I’m just sharing pieces of myself with people and then, even though it’s unintentional, it makes my art more recognizable. So whenever people see my painting, they know it’s Chigozie that did that.”I smiled. “Yeah like ‘That’s Chigozie Obi’s art!’ I think that’s unique.”“Yeah.”“So have you ever had a solo exhibition in Lagos?”“So I had one at the Art X Lagos Fair. That was my first, but I want to have one next year. One that isn’t attached to an organization or body or something. Just completely mine. So hopefully that goes well.”“Yeah, it’ll go well. I’ll come.”“Yes, you have to come!” Chigozie exclaimed. “I have so many ideas I want to bring to life. Four fingers crossed that it goes well.” She chuckled, crossing her fingers.I laughed.
“So you’re a first daughter. Did you see those tweets about first daughters and pieces of advice for them?” I asked referencing a Twitter trend.“I saw a few and there was one I saw that said ‘Learn when to detach from people,’ and it really hit me,” Chigozie started. I feel like I hold on to people and give them multiple chances and I feel like that may have stemmed from my experience as a first daughter. I’ve learnt that I have to learn how to be myself first, and when I lost my Mum, I think it became a thing of ‘You’re the Mum now and you have to take care of your brother and your Dad,’ but eventually, I was like I still have my own life whilst still checking in and making sure they’re good.”“When did you lose your Mum?”“2019.”“Oh really?”“Yeah,” she paused. “After my Mum died, it sunk in that you can literally die at any moment, and when you die, nothing matters. Not the money, nothing at all. And even if people celebrate you on Earth, you’ll never know. So I find enjoying myself a big deal. It’s so important to me. I might not do it in the most extravagant way because money is so important, but I always try to find pockets of joy.”“And I think you have a lot of fun too,” I said.“Yeah, I try,” Chigozie said. “I think the misconception people have of me though, is that they think my life is so soft, like I have people who will dm me and be like ‘Chigozie, you just dey chop life o,’ but I’m like, I’m out here busting my ass o. I might not just show all the processes, but underneath all of that, it’s still work,” she said. I chuckled. “Yeah, I feel you.”“I take and post a lot of pictures though. When my Mum died, we only had about three pictures together.”“Oh my God.” That was sad.“I know right? So I told myself I want to start documenting everything, from my friends, to what I’m doing, places I visit, everything actually.”“Yeah. I’ve seen your Instagram page dedicated to pictures of places and things too,” I said, referencing Le Journal De Gozie. “Yeah. Sometimes, when I’m feeling down, all I need to do is scroll through my Instagram accounts, and it’s pretty easy to document on Instagram and Twitter too.”“I think that’s very intentional. It’s really nice and I love the concept of it.”“Thank you,” she said, smiling.
“I think you’ve really hacked your style too. I notice you love clothes,” I said.“Yeah, I do.”“Your outfits are pretty.”“Right? Thank you. I think that I’m evolving too. One thing I don’t want to do is feel like I can’t wear certain outfits because I’m growing older. I want my style to remain like this forever. One day, I’m wearing ashewo clothes, the next day, I’m dressed like a boss lady. The next day, I’m doing office worker. The next day I’m doing stripper.”“Does it depend your mood?” I asked before realizing the last thing she mentioned, and I laughed.“Sometimes,” she said, laughing. “I notice that when I’m feeling down, I wear black a lot.”“Now I’m going to be on the lookout for you in black,” I said, joking.She laughed. “No no, it’s not all the time. I’m wearing black tomorrow for my birthday dinner.”“Okay. After tomorrow, I’ll be on the lookout for you in black.”Chigozie laughed.
“So you mentioned earlier how expectations have shaped you in some way as a first daughter and how you’ve managed them. Are there childhood events or trauma that you feel have, in some way, affected your current view of the world or how you relate to people?”Chigozie hesitated for a second. “Hmmm not particularly, but I know that growing up introverted, it took me having female friends to open up to certain things. I grew up with so many boys around me and I didn’t really lean into my feminine side while growing up as well. I think I was a late bloomer too. Growing up like that didn’t make me feel so great or feminine in a way, but my female friends have helped me to open up more and appreciate my body more. It’s also much easier to talk to them about topics like sex. I had to become more confident with saying how I feel and sharing how I certain things affect me too,” she said. “I did like a 180. Is it 180 or 360?” Chigozie asked. She was trying to describe the turning point in her life and I found it hilarious.“You sha did something,” I replied, laughing. My brain was not processing that either, to be honest.She laughed. “I sha did something,” she said. “I feel like younger Chigozie would be happy with where I am right now.”“I’m sure she is.”
I listened to Chigozie tell me about how growing up introverted made her self aware, and maybe a little too much in some cases, as she has now grown to be more calculative of the things she says, who she says them too and where she says them. It’s not exactly a problem though because she would never be silent when she needs to speak. It was then I realized that I hadn’t ordered for a drink or food yet.
“I think I’m ready to have a drink now,” I said. “You should have the chapman. It’s really good.”I was staring at the menu. “Oh really?” “Yeah. People say the pineapple juice is good too though.”“Nah, I’ll have the Chapman. What’s their pizza like?”“It’s so good, but disclaimer: It’s really simple. There’s nothing much happening with it.”“I love my pizza like that though. Is it flat?”“Yeah, it is. I usually have the pepperoni,” Chigozie said. “My boyfriend’s not a fan of it like I am though.”I chuckled. We had two pepperoni pizzas to go and the Chapman was really good. I tried not to finish it in one sip. Chigozie said I did a good job for not finishing it all at once.
“I really like this space,” I said, scanning through the restaurant.“Yeah it’s pretty chill. Have you been to Godaïf?”“Nah I haven’t.”“We should go there next.”I squealed in faux excitement. “Is that a second date?” Chigozie laughed.“You know those moments when you go out on a date and you get excited when they start planning a second date before the end of the first?” I asked.“Yeah,” Chigozie replied, smiling.“That’s how I feel right now.”

Perhaps I should have been more compassionate towards the Stockholm inflicted ones. I tried. Not hard but I tried. I couldn't do it. I couldn't look into the inhuman eyes of the corporate bot and feel anything but loathing.

Stockholm Syndrome, a perplexing psychological phenomenon, has captured the attention of experts and the public alike due to its intricate interplay between captive and captor. This psychological response, which was first observed during a bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden in 1973, continues to raise questions about human behavior under duress.
When individuals find themselves in situations of extreme vulnerability and captivity, they may develop a peculiar bond with their captors. This bond appears counterintuitive, as one might expect fear and aversion to predominate in such scenarios. However, Stockholm Syndrome highlights the complexity of human coping mechanisms, shedding light on the psychological mechanisms that drive these unexpected emotional connections.
Victims of Stockholm Syndrome often display empathy and loyalty towards their captors, perceiving them as protectors or guardians rather than aggressors. This psychological shift can be attributed to several factors, including perceived dependency on the captor for basic needs, isolation…

We are at our best when we establish authentic connections with one another, lifting each other up. Two incredible highlights this week: ⭐Helping a dear friend securing an interview and watching him shine bright after listening to him painfully talk himself down for months; ⭐My call with Giulia Fiorista has become a weekly opportunity for me to brainstorm, be inspired, and inspire. This time around, I shared some input that might’ve turned out more useful than I expected. And that’s why it’s usually a good idea to share your knowledge: you might be sitting on someone’s goldmine taking it completely for granted.
I posted about it on LinkedIn earlier this week: I was sorting some ancient papers and documents and unearthed one of my first CVs ever! The “good old days” when: 1) You printed and handed your CV in person wherever you wished to apply; 2) I didn’t realise I could be creative and make up a format of my own (and remove the headshot altogether); 3) LinkedIn wasn’t really a thing. So much has changed in 10 years uh?!
Talking with colleagues in tech, it seems there’s a pattern of communication issues between Product and Commercial across the industry. How many opportunities is this incommunicability costing us? Something to think about…
My final thought is coming from a place of distrust. Some weeks ago I reached out to a popular pre-employment testing company with some questions about what steps they take to make your their timed logics test is “neurodiverse-friendly”. For example, people with dyslexia are known to underperform on timed tests, is there an option for a time-extension? It’s something simple that can make a huge difference for a candidate. I reached out to them through 4 different sources and was ignored for the most part until I was told someone would get in contact. So far, it’s only been silence on their part… If this lack of response equals to a “no”, wouldn’t these tests be highly discriminatory?
Thanks for reading, happy weekend! 👒

No trip to Stockholm is complete with a visit to the archipelago. Let me guide you to some of my favourite spots…
“Stockholm i mitt hjärta, Stockholm in my heart — a city of islands, that is you.” Those are the words by Lasse Berghagen that fill the air every Tuesday summer night as thousands of people, gathered at open air museum Skansen for the popular singalong TV show Allsång på Skansen, take tune. As their words travel across the bay below, the cameras pan over the stunning water landscape and one wonders if the melody manages to reach all of the 14 islands that make up the capital of Scandinavia — or indeed the patchwork of 30,000 islands that spread out beyond that.
Stockholm is beautiful any time of the year, but the magical, seemingly endless, summer light sees the capital come to life more than ever — and at this time of the year there is only one place to be. Outside.
Whether it’s a walk through the national park and museum island of Royal Djurgården or a stroll along the picturesque Söder Mälarstrand, a run along Årstaviken or a panoramic tour of Fjällgatan, the inner city waterfront views are breathtaking. However, a summer trip to Stockholm is not complete without a trip to skärgården, the archipelago.
To explore the 30,000 islands that make up the Stockholm archipelago (all accessible thanks to the Swedish Right To Roam), simply hop on a traditional white, wooden boat from Waxholmsbolaget or a speedier Cinderella ferry from Strömma. Once on board, the archipelago world is your oyster.
Where to go? Here are a few suggestions.
Fjäderholmarna is a good start. Located 30 minutes from Stockholm’s Nybrokajen, this cluster of islands is the closest archipelago destination and it offers both beautiful countryside and bustling town life. Here you can explore traditional handicraft, sample beer at the local brewery, try handmade sweets at the chocolate factory and indulge in delicious ice cream from Systrana Degens Glassstuga. Once you’ve tasted what the town has to offer, why not stroll along the beaches, take a dip in the sea and spend the evening unwinding with a glass of wine and fresh seafood at one of the many restaurants? Life could be worse.
Waxholm is without a doubt the capital of the archipelago. Complete with its own castle, built in 1549 to defend King Gustaf Vasa, this historic old town comes with pastel-coloured houses, art, shopping and good food. It’s a great option if you want to mix nature with culture and it is also accessible via car or bus, should you prefer getting around on land.
Grinda sits at the heart of the archipelago and is an island that, located about an hour from Stockholm, just epitomises serene Swedish countryside. Step back in time as you step off the boat and find yourself in a nature reserve decorated with idyllic, old-school red and yellow houses, wild nature and beautiful beaches. The art nouvaeu style Grinda Wärdshus restaurant is open weekends and holidays and you will not struggle to find a blissful place to picnic on the rest of Grinda. Just lush.
Möja is the spot for the active traveller. Ideal if you want to do more than just chill by the beach, this large island is well suited for bike trips and day hikes — and do make sure you climb to the top of Vårdkaseberget and enjoy a stunning view of the surrounding scenery. Beaches are less accessible here, so it’s not necessarily one for swimming, but you can eat freshly caught seafood at Wikströms Fisk, a tavern run by the archipelago’s only professional fisherman.
Sandhamn is a well-known, idyllic harbour and popular destination for big yachts and their owners. Located about an hour from Stockholm city, Sandhamn offers sandy beaches (as indicated by the name — it literally means Sand Harbour), bike trails, kayaking and spa, not to mention plenty of restaurants and bars; this is without a doubt the party central of the archipelago.
Finnhamn is your destination if you want to see more of the archipelago as part of your trip. Getting here takes about 2.5 hours by boat so you want to set off in time — but what a journey it is. Expect plenty of photo opportunities on board, and do try to get a good seat outside if the weather is nice; there are few things as peaceful as tanning on a boat gliding through skärgården. (Though it can get windy so do pack a jumper in case.) Bring a picnic blanket, snacks and bikini for a day of ultimate relaxation — once on the island you will find perfect trekking conditions and many a private bay to picnic, tan and swim. Just don’t miss the last boat back, though if you do you can always stay overnight at the local hostel.
Utö, meaning Outer Island, sits farthest out in the Southern part of the archipelago and so offers a very wild, natural experience. A visit here is all about enjoying the elements. Renowned for the many hours of sunshine that it gets, the island serves up white sand beaches, cliffs and various sporting opportunities including canoeing, biking, tennis, beach volleyball and boules. Hike around the island and get the best view from the 18th Century windmill.
As you can tell there is plenty of option in the Stockholm archipelago, but regardless of your choice, you will find yourself unwinding with every breath of fresh sea air — and returning back home you may just find yourself singing about your love for Stockholm…

Freedom is scary.
That is the thought I left you with last time.
As much as we want freedom, getting there requires that we sever the umbilical cord that connects us to the lies and limiting beliefs that we have come to rely on from day to day.
And that is scary.
I believe this is why people cling so tightly to their guns and their religion and their political affiliations.
Fear.
The thing about fear, though, is that, in most cases, it is not based in tangible reality. It is not the result of something that has actually happened to an individual. But, rather, it is centered in some kind of what-if or hypothetical scenario.
Fear finds its sustenance in the straw man.
Let us take guns for example.
People cling extremely tightly to their guns and their right to own them. So much so that they are unwilling even to restrict other’s access to them, even if those people legitimately should not be allowed that responsibility.
Even at the expense of other’s lives, these people will defend their guns.
Why?
Because of a perceived need to protect themselves from a tyrannical government or from the off chance that a fully armed intruder will break in to their home. Neither of these things are terribly likely to happen in the grand scheme of things.
But the fear is there. And someone has told them that the solution for these fears is a gun.
And so their beliefs about the world have become restricted and limiting. And therefore how they view the world has become warped.
And that distorted view of the world creates more fear and therefore a tighter grasp on what is perceived as the solution to that fear.
And so on and so on it goes.
Fear causes us to believe only the most limited of things about the world and ourselves. And these limiting beliefs act to keep us chained to a radiator in the dark basement of our souls.
And there we believe we must stay, no matter what.

Nashville. Seattle. Detroit. London. New York. London. Stockholm. All of these are key cities in the music of the 20th century.
But hang on a minute. Stockholm??
Yeah, I wouldn’t have thought so either. Aside from the obvious example and a few bands from the early 2000s, like Eskobar and Kent, still in my record collection, I never would have associated the Swedish capital city with music.
That changed when I spent some time there in the summer of 2024.
Like any good trip to a city I’ve never been in, my initial walk in the neighbourhood in which I’m staying revolves around tracking down record stores.
“But aren’t they all the same as the ones at home?” someone might ask. “Don’t be silly” is the only logical answer.
I walked out of the first one with two Charlatans records that I’ve never seen at any other store anywhere in the world. The fact that one was their second album…

I’m sitting on my favorite aircraft, Delta Air Lines A330–900 Neo, headed to a place that I also love to visit. Amsterdam. Although it’s not our final destination, it’s a fantastic location for a layover in the KLM lounge, a Delta Air Lines partner, where services are also top-notch.
There’s plenty of space to find a wonderful temporary home for relaxation, sleep, meals, reflection, or anything your spirit craves related to your travel desires.
Okay, I’ve skipped a little too far ahead because, in the meantime, we’re still sitting in my favorite seat, Delta One, on my favorite airline. If you haven’t experienced D-1, well, let me give you a sneak preview. In this seating configuration, my desk is to the right, with a plug-in for my laptop, and a convenient port for headphones to listen to entertainment options, including music, movies, TV Series, and family entertainment.
If you’re feeling a bit tired and need to catch some z’s, there’s a pillow, blanket, and comfortable eye mask available. The most fantastic feature is that the seat converts into a lie-flat bed, making it easy to find your comfort zone.
Passengers must wait until the plane reaches the appropriate altitude and the pilot gives the okay to move about the cabin…

When I was in ninth standard, I first came across him. He was from another school. People called him Andrew. He was not the tallest, but was the strongest. He was unbeaten at arm wrestling. There was a certain charm about him that all the boys flocked around him. They all looked forward to be with him. To be in his company, was considered privilege by clueless fourteen-year-olds. He would influence major decisions, dictate terms, bring in new trends and wore the best clothes because his father was a rich man. He always had at least half-a-dozen boys hanging out with him. After school, he would form a circle with those boys and pick two of them and made them fight. Like a referee, he would signal the start of the bout and wait until one of them was completely on the ground, and gave up. He enjoyed while the boys fought and after the fight, both of them would continue to walk around him, like nothing happened. They were just following orders and it didn’t affect them emotionally, although I’m sure physical pain lasted.
One day at school, Andrew was caught copying in the English exam. And in those days, punishments were ruthless. Especially, in that school, they had a public-shaming vice-principal who would beat the shit out of the kid in assembly if the crime was grave enough. The next day, before the start of the Maths exam, the vice-principal called Andrew out and announced to the whole school that he had copied in the English exam. And he began to hit him with a cane. After seven or eight blows, the stick broke and the beating continued by hand. There was hair pulling and ear pulling and unlimited supply of swearing. After about five minutes, the beating stopped and everyone was allowed inside the exam halls. After the exam, all the seven or eight boys who hung around him, returned to their duty — standing beside him. And the first thing Andrew said to them, ‘I didn’t get hurt at all. In fact, the stick broke!’ and everyone hailed him as a legend. That was my introduction to blind followers.
Now extrapolate this story to the current crisis in North India. Everyone knows that their chief has been convicted of rapes without any reasonable doubt and still, they continue to take his side. And they will defend to death, their leader, who is their only sense of self-worth and identity. Young, old, men, women and even young girls have come out in his support in lakhs and they think he is innocent. They don’t just think, they believe the whole thing to be a conspiracy against him, perpetrated by the state.
In psychology, there’s a concept called the ‘Stockholm Syndrome’, where the hostages start liking their kidnappers and form a psychological alliance with them. Sometimes, very strong emotional develop between two persons where one person intermittently harasses, beats, threatens, abuses, or intimidates the other. In this case, although it is legally proved that the so called saint is a rapist, somehow it puts into question, the years of dedication they have displayed towards him. It is like you pet a snake since the day it hatched and one day, it grows big enough to bite you, the the only person who loves it. But then, you like the snake so much that you are ready to die by its poison.
In 2010, I was working with a film director helping him complete a paranormal/horror movie script. During those sittings, we happened to discuss a god-man from Andhra Pradesh who charged about five lakhs for a darshan. That is, you have to pay that money just to see him. And there is a long queue of people willing to do that. In fact, people wait for months for their turn. Then, I asked him, what about poor people, don’t they have access? He said, ‘If you can’t afford him, you can pay two lakhs and see his wife.’
His answer blew my mind. Then, I asked him, what is so special about meeting him? Why should one pay that kind of money? To which, he said, ‘I have a friend who pays five lakhs every now and then. He says, it is his aura. The moment you enter the room, you can feel his aura. And if he touches you, his aura stays with you for a long time and it will attract all the positive things, makes you rich, literally and mentally.’
To an extent, I believe in the concept of aura and positive vibes. But people willing to pay for it? That was a new. An eye-opener. So while we’re at it, if you go and tell this friend of the director, that the god-man is a fraud and that he’s been exploiting the vulnerabilities of gullible disciples, what do you think will happen? He will tell you to get the hell out.
That’s what cults do. When a person gets indoctrinated into a belief system and start following a guru, or a god-man, what actually happens is that they build a strong, unbreakable bridge with them. And in the process of building that bridge, they shut off all roads toward rationality and ability for freedom of thought. It’s a tunnel with no other outlets. And that liberates people, because this sense of belonging to that cult, it’s better than their current life. And what looks like liberation, is actually, a long, endless, incarceration of the mind.

Hello and Hi!
This is the first dataviz challenge for the Data Visualisation Stockholm (DVS) Meetup group. We’ve been discussing holding a challenge for at least a year and FINALLY we’ve finished the first one!
DVS was founded two years ago when the two original organisers started their own two dataviz Meetup groups just a few days apart in Stockholm, Sweden, but then decided that Stockholm was a one-dataviz-Meetup-group town and joined forces. We both wanted to create a space where we would gather enthusiastic designers, developers, artists, statisticians, journalists, and all kinds of amazing people interested in data to network and get to know each other. We also wanted our members to have the opportunity to grow as data designers.
We have discussed holding challenges for a while now, but it took an enthusiastic member asking us to stop procrastinating (Thanks!) and get on with it. But the discussions were not fruitless; they got us talking about the types of dataviz challenges we liked and the kind wanted to run. We determined that a fun and engaging challenge, one that we would want to participate in, had two equally important parts, an interesting theme and a design constraint. The theme would attract participants and the design constraint would challenge them to be creative.
This first challenge was all about Stockholm winters. The dataset had data on snow depth and temperature in Stockholm stretching from January 2021 all the way back to the beginning of the early 20th century.
I must say that I was quite impressed with the variety of submissions we got!
So in no particular order lets go through the charts and see all submissions. Descriptions were written by the respective authors.
WhoMatthias Stahl. Freelance data visualisation designer with a history in bioinformatics, passionate about the combination of data, code, art and design to craft beautiful and impactful visuals.Twitter: @h_i_g_s_c_hLink to the interactive viz
CommentI wanted to go for a spiral layout as this enables the year-wise comparison of this periodic data. I then transformed the temperature and snow data into binary variables — fitting to the overall black-and-white theme. Is there snow: yes/no; and is the temperature higher than 10 °C: yes/no. The best way to encode the temperature turned out to be the spiral line thickness. The circles for the snowy days are apparently inspired by snowflakes. In order to make it clearer that circles represent snowy days, I added a snowing animation.
Tools: Sketch on paper, then Svelte and D3
WhoAlenka Gucek. Postdoc at Uppsala University, studying diabetes and cell biology. I’ve always enjoyed doing visualisations for research and now I’m looking for ways to change career to dataviz.Twitter: @alenka_gucek
CommentOriginally I was planning for a gif with falling snow, but it looked like too much of chart junk. Then I switched to do something simple and informative, inspired by Evelina Judeikyte’s talk [at one of the Meetup events] on simplicity, annotations in The Economist and spark lines by Edward Tufte.
Tools: Excel, Origin and CorelDraw
WhoNina Lindell. Data visualisation engineer at Telia, building products based on mobility data.Twitter: @ninatsutsLink to the code
CommentI wanted to make the data look like piles of snow, and finally create a ridge-line plot (aka joy plot). I have recently started learning D3 and the challenge seemed like a good opportunity to try out my skills on a real dataset. I decided to keep the last 50 years of data and only look at the snow depth. There are still some things I would like to improve upon — highlight interesting data points with annotations, mark the scale, and make winters continuous so that at least November — March are on the same row. That is something for the next iteration.
Tools: Tableau for prototyping, D3 for the final chart
WhoTyler Wolf. Data visualisation specialist at King Games.Twitter: @tylernwolf
CommentI thought about the question “what does a month look like?” And then broke it into the two pieces of data we had in the dataset: temperature and snowfall. But then I wanted to give it context and look for patterns, specifically thinking of the question, are days getting hotter? — obviously thinking of climate change. So I ran a moving average on temperatures to break the temperature component into above or below average for that month. I did this because we can conclude that it’s cold in the winter and hot in the summer already, so a relative comparison gives more context. That made three pieces of data. Finally, I thought about how much I like it when it snows, so it would be nice to get an idea of how many days it was actually snowing in each month. So with those pieces of data and the limitation of black and white only, I experimented with rectangles and lines until I arrived at something that felt right and could condense the data, making each month look unique and allowing their elements to interact with each other. The aesthetic was inspired partially by some of giorgia lupi’s work.
Tools: D3 to draw the graphics, observablehq to get up and experimenting quickly and Figma for early sketching and to draw the legend and title.
WhoPatrick Wojda. Data visualisation and front-end engineer at Aftonbladet, Swedens largest online newspaper.
CommentLooking through the data I realised that there were too many years in the dataset to visualise without losing the personal perspective so I filtered the data on a personal question… were my childhood winters snowier than what my kids get to experience? I did all of the data cleaning and formatting using Javascript (lodash and D3). The most fun aspect of the challenge was figuring out the design, but I spent almost all of the time on data processing. I iterated over the design multiple times, both hand-drawn and in code before I got to where I wanted.
Tools: Javascript, lodash, D3, Svelte, Paper app on IOS for sketching.
That’s a wrap!
Stay tuned for more challenges, we will be announcing them on our GitHub repo (https://github.com/Dataviz-Stockholm/challenges).
Take care and stay safe.

According to Wikipedia, there are four components that comprise Stockholm syndrome:
I was never a huge Javascript guy. I’d use jQuery from time to time. Sometimes, I’d use it to make some AJAX calls and maybe change an element or two on a Rails app I was working on. Life was simple, with jQuery doing most of the grunt work and me doing nothing at all. I didn’t need to know much about Javascript at all and that was the way I liked it.
I was eventually asked to develop a desktop application for authoring media-heavy multi-language content. Not wanting to descend into the waking nightmare that is Java Swing that I had learned to hate in graduate school, I quickly picked up Angular (1) and Electron. It was magical.
I loved how simple everything was. I could write to disk as often as I wanted using Node’s NON-BLOCKING IO (very web-scale). Callback hell was a little difficult to deal with, but then I learned about Promises and entered Promise hell. The fires in this hell were a little less intense, so it was all good. Even better, I now reside in the promised (haha get it) land of Async Await.
Anyhow, Angular truly felt like magic the first time I used it. I would change the application’s state and things would just appear! I didn’t have to use selectors or iterate through DOM elements like some sort of neanderthal. I didn’t understand how the lifecycle worked at all, but who really wants to? Not me. I want to keep the magic alive.
Nobody wants (Angular) sausage after they see how it’s made.
— a very wise person
Of course, this quickly bit me in the ass. My completely unoptimized code was slow sometimes (all the time). So, like any responsible and capable developer, I arrived at an obvious conclusion: Angular was the problem and there was nothing I could do to fix it. I needed to switch frameworks, to use something faster, more performant, and most importantly, with better benchmark scores.
I moved onto React. With React came stage-0 proposals, Babel, Webpack, boilerplates, functional programming, great hair, Redux, GraphQL, CSS in JS, and much more. I now spend my time away from work preparing for work, reading about the hottest new packages, jumping on every bandwagon I can. Maybe I should use Parcel, it’s zero configuration and probably knows what’s best for me. I’ve abandoned all non-Javascript languages for the backend. How else am I going to get my SSR-game on? Javascript is all I need.
I think Javascript is a pretty good guy. You can iterate SO FAST. Compiling? What’s that? Think of all the time you’ll save not waiting for stuff to compile. Sure, there’s essentially no native type system and all sorts of dangerous type coercions can happen, but hey, that’s what Flow and Typescript are for, right? Transpiling is fine and very fast! There are no problems here.
Sure, bugs in the original Javascript implementation have become part of the spec. But look, Brendan Eich had to hack together all of Javascript in a few days. Can you blame him? No. Nobody’s perfect. Except for Javascript. Javascript is perfect.
Javascript is very human. Most teams I’ve worked with are fluent in Javascript. Look at all of the NPM packages. I’d wager that it encompasses all of human knowledge. If there was to be a language to transcend all languages and bring all of humanity together, I would bet on Javascript. Is there a Babel transform for Esperanto? That’d probably be a good start.
To Javascript is human.
— Alexander Pope
I feel this point about ‘belief in humanity’ is somewhat tenuous. You can tell I’m really stretching. Javascript isn’t a human being. Although, Javascript is pretty weird and unpredictable, as are humans.
The local police have been in a standoff outside of where Javascript and I have been holed up for the last 47 hours. I can’t be sure if I’m actually suffering from Stockholm syndrome because I’m not just a very cooperative person in general. But what I do know is that I’m not coming out of the deep, dark hole that I’ve dug myself into.
I like it here. There’s everything I could need or want. I’m very comfortable here. This is who I am now. If anyone is feeling charitable, please throw some food down here if you can. In the meantime, I think I’m going to take a nap. I’m very tired from all of this Javascripting.

This is my 28-day journey of living a temporary life in Helsinki, Tallinn, Stockholm, and Copenhagen.
🇸🇪 August 5, 2019
Look closely at the present you are constructing: it should look like the future you are dreaming. (Alice Walker)
Finding gratitude in small things and injecting a little randomness into my life is one of my 2018 and 2019 resolutions. And a lot of small wonders coincidently happened every day. Because I am in a different country and experiencing different culture? Well, it might be true, but might not.
I went to Gamla Stan and looked around the old town. Sometimes I stopped by souvenir shops to buy a Sweden flag pin because I’m collecting flag pins of countries that I visited. But today I had a bigger mission from my niece. We had a chat on Instagram yesterday, and she told me that she wanted to get a beautiful Swedish style pencil case. Well, what is the Swedish style and where can I find that style? I just went around some shops and found a beautiful pencil case. Surprisingly, it was the same style pencil case as the one that she wanted to have. Today’s small wonder started like that.
While I was looking around, I saw a bunch of people gathering in front of the palace. It seemed like they were waiting for something. So, I joined in the line of people and waited together. Some minutes later, the palace guards riding on horses started marching with music. I never imagined that I could see the Changing of the Guard at Gamla Stan. The second small wonder accidentally happened, too.
I got to a small square and saw old buildings painted with beautiful colors next to the Noble Prize Museum. When I took some pictures and started keep walking, I saw a young boy drawing buildings that I took pictures of just now. I came to him quietly and looked at his painting. It was really beautiful, more beautiful than the original ones. I saw a small donation box beside him, took 20 SEK from my pocket and put it into his box. He looked at me with smile and said, “Thank you.” It was a small donation for rooting for his dream. I prayed with all my heart, recalling his big innocent grin that he will be a great artist who will make our world better with his great ability. That was my third small wonder that I came across in Gamla Stan.
After wandering at Gamla Stan, I bought a cinnamon roll, went to Humlegarden, a park near my hotel, sat on a bench, and read a book, eating the cinnamon roll. If a park like this was near my home in Seoul, I would be really happy. Building a library, a park, and a stage that anyone comes and uses for free — building a free culture park — is one of my dreams, but can I construct this wonder in the future?

For the final project of this 12-week UI sprint, my peers and I were asked to create a passion project based on a travel campaign. This campaign’s deliverables would be executed through a 4 screen website, branding assets, and printed/digital media marketing; all targeted towards a specific demographic to promote possible visitors to visit that location.
I chose to focus my final project on Stockholm, Sweden. Over the last few years, it’s one of the cities I’ve set my heart on. With a deep love for all things Scandinavian design (both interior, industrial, and graphic), it was only natural that I wanted to infuse my personal interests into this project. Although I have never been, I asked myself why I would want to visit this city rich in arts & culture, and what my itinerary would possibly include while I was there. In my younger years growing up, I spent multiple weekends off school and during summer vacations obsessing over museums. My brother and I had no problem wasting away the day exploring each exhibit on display — he loved learning about dinosaurs, I was interested in arts & crafts. Under the same roof, we always found a middle ground.
During the initial research phase of this project, I came across an article that defined Stockholm as a “mecca of museums”. It is home to over 100+ museums within the city limits. Both national collections, and independent institutions that celebrate an array of topics — from ABBA, marine biology, photography, alcohol distillery, etc., Stockholm has a museum that would peak every type of interest for a potential tourist. Here I found the niche demographic I would design for. My goal was to highlight this special collection of institutions (for both museum lovers and those not familiar), and give the general public a streamlined resource for planning their visit in the city.
Moving forward, I created a fictional persona to design for the campaign — meet Joel Pryor. He’s 26 years old, and currently living, working, and playing in the city of Vancouver. He is a recent Architectural Technologist graduate, interning as a junior A/T at a firm. In the evenings he works part time at an East Van cocktail bar, where he connects with other likeminded peers that join his interests in film photography, design, biking, jazz music, and fashion. Listed below is his motivations/frustrations correlating to both travel planning in general, and visiting Stockholm for the first time. My goal was to create a realistic persona with flexible ideals that would be found in his demographic. Joel is knowledgeable in all things niche, and I wanted to create a campaign that reflected that altruistic path.
Before navigating artistic directions for the project, I already knew the route I wanted to take it in in terms of composition in typography. I wanted the project to be an ode to Swiss type, through the applications of poster and print. The Swiss design identity is bold and robust, yet simplified through its modern form and function of sans serif type. Below is the graphic inspiration and composition I collected moving forward in deciding the application of art directions.
Art direction #1: playful, bright, young, quirky, primary
Art direction #2: unapologetic, contrasting, provocative, strong
In the end, I decided to apply the second art direction due to the sensibility of black and white to contrast the colorful imagery that goes along with museums. Looping back to the persona, Joel, it would align with Swedish brands he’d identify with, and the “in your face” and “tongue and cheek” language of the campaign. Museums aren’t the most exciting attraction at the top of mind for people unlike Joel, and I felt that in order for it to resonate with a larger demographic, it would have to be striking.
For the logo, I played on the symmetry of stacked letters within the word “museums” to mimic the level of weights within the site branding. I went through multiple iterations of movement when it came to the letters, and thought that since the site followed a grid system, the logotype should also follow suit.
Circular STD was the singular font chosen for all the branding and application of the campaign. Carrying on with the sans serif typefaces known in Swiss design, it replicates a weighted presence without feeling intimidating. Black and bold is used for all the H1 and H2 headers, with book supplementing body text. All capitals are used on the headers to emphasize the urgency and weight.
As previous mentioned; the art direction I continued with carries a black and white narrative that is minimalistic, modern, and clean. Due to the variety of images hypothetically added by the museums themselves, I wanted a clean slate for the content to speak for itself. The only pattern that would contrast the two tones is a pinstripe; made up of a list of the museums within the city.
For collateral purposes, I chose products that would continue the conversation of the city and the findings at these museums past Stockholm city limits. Travellers would have the capability to carry their discoveries back home with them, and discuss their trip through the points of contact.
Below are the multiple levels of the Design Inception that I created for the campaign. The outer layer describes the environment of all UI assets, and as you go further into the center it breaks down the tone of the campaign through the tone. At the center of the Design Inception is the over arching why; why that target demo would find this campaign useful, and the overall purpose moving forward. My final why is as follows: “Connecting past and present”. Humanity wants to see a visual representation of change through time. Evolution, progression, succession — all documented and on view for the mass public. In the ethos section of the “About”, I created a spiral visual that lists the words “Remarkable. Relevant. Educational.” These three words summarize the levels of the inception on a digestable level.
Before unveiling the prototype, I wanted to outline the primary user flow that Joel, would walk through on the site. From the home page, the user would have the option to click the “About” page, which tells the ethos of the campaign, a “Registry” that lists the filter of museums within Stockholm, and finally, a “Web Shop”. For the sake of the prototype, the user would click “Registry” if they were interested in seeing the hub of locations, then from there their desired topic would filter their results into an event calendar, social media links, or that 3rd party museum site. The black squares are the screens made for the prototype and the white outlined boxes are future considerations.
As a final deliverable for the project, I compiled mockups for how Google Adwords would advertise the campaign. Keeping in mind the persona, I chose 4 different sites that Joel would frequently visit as his choice of media. The exemplary image below showcases the banner on Dezeen (both upper top and right of the navigation) but similar banners would be displayed on sites like Vice and Monocle. In terms of Instagram, I also wanted to imply that my target user frequents social media to see what’s current in the media and the influence it has on day to day. The Museums of Stockholm Instagram would emulate the feel of the site, and update users on new exhibitions, events, and restock of product.

Stockholm doesn’t try to compete with Europe’s biggest tech hubs on volume or visibility. It doesn’t need to. Underneath the surface, the city has built one of the continent’s most efficient and credible early-stage ecosystems, and one that’s already outperforming on density, deal quality, and network speed. But while early-stage momentum is real, there’s a catch: scale is harder. And the late-stage gap is starting to show.
Start with the fundamentals. Stockholm has around 2,500 startups. That may not sound impressive next to London’s 25,000 or Berlin’s 6,000, but raw numbers miss the point. With just 2.5 million people, Stockholm has one of the highest startup densities in Europe. Only London and Amsterdam are higher per capita. The city is tied with Berlin and well ahead of Paris, Zurich, Munich, and Madrid. This isn’t an ecosystem chasing scale for its own sake, but one that is focused on concentration, repeatability, and results. It also produces some of the most successful start-ups, as it ranks #2 in unicorns per capita in Europe (only behind Estonia)
It helps that the basics are sorted. Sweden has one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the EU at 20.6%. R&D incentives are real. The visa process, while imperfect, is smoother than in many neighboring countries. Founders can incorporate, hire, and launch without running into structural friction. That’s not true everywhere in Europe.
But regulation is only part of the story. What really makes Stockholm work is the network. The ecosystem is compact and layered. Founders, angels, VCs, private organizations (like Nordic Angels) and public-sector players operate in close proximity, quite literally. Relationships are short-range and high-frequency. Two intros are usually enough to reach anyone. It speeds everything up: hiring, fundraising, product feedback and decision-making.
Especially the angel community is functioning well. According to the recent Nordic Angels & BCG report I co-authored, Stockholm leads the region in both deal activity and investor depth. Nearly 600 active angels operate in the city, and many of them repeat founders or early operators from companies like Klarna, Spotify, and iZettle. That experience compounds. New teams benefit from old playbooks. Capital comes with context.
VC behavior reflects the broader market shift. Global dry powder is high, but deployment is cautious and conviction-driven. That suits Stockholm. The companies being built here tend to be leaner, more international, and capital-efficient. Local funds like Creandum, EQT Ventures, and Northzone are still writing early checks. And when the metrics are strong, international investors are showing up (like Accel, Sequioa, et. al.). The pipeline is healthy. The bar is high.
But not everything is working.
The late-stage environment hasn’t kept up. Series B and C rounds are regularly led by foreign investors (e.g., recently for Legora), often requiring founders to relocate teams, shift strategy, or change how they operate. When the capital isn’t local, neither is the upside. Value leaks. Talent disperses. Ecosystem effects weaken. Some of Stockholm’s most promising startups are scaling in other geographies. Not by choice, but by necessity. The ecosystem in Stockholm hasn’t quite caught up to this yet.
Capital is one challenge: Unlike in some neighboring countries, Sweden doesn’t have a strong state-backed co-investment model at the Series B and C level (but Sweden does have them in earlier stages). There’s no domestic equivalent to Finland’s Tesi or Denmark’s Vækstfonden. Those institutions actively anchor larger rounds and keep value creation local.
Senior talent is another challenge. While the city has no shortage of strong engineers and early hires, there’s a gap in commercial leadership. Experienced sales, product, and executive operators are in short supply and current stock option tax rules don’t help on retention either (the stock option tax rules are beneficial for early-stage startups, but less so for later stages). It’s workable, but it’s not competitive with ecosystems like London or Tallinn.
Diversity is still lagging. Female and underrepresented founders raise a small fraction of total capital (all-women teams represented 6.1% of all funding rounds in the Nordics in 2022 and 2023, but received only 1.2% of the total capital). It’s not unique to Stockholm, but it’s persistent. Progress is being made, but slowly. It’s an area where the city could and should lead but hasn’t yet. Diversity isn’t just social, it’s strategic. Stockholm risks missing out on market upside without more inclusive capital flows and accessing the full breadth of ideas.
And cost of living is creeping up. For junior hires, early-stage teams, or international founders trying to get started, Stockholm is no longer cheap. It hasn’t hit London levels, but it’s moving in that direction, and that friction is already starting to show.
Still, the early-stage engine is real. Stockholm’s ecosystem isn’t built on noise. It’s built on high-quality inputs: credible talent, disciplined capital, and a regulatory environment that mostly gets out of the way. Founders here are building with focus, and investors are backing with precision. That’s rare in any cycle, and especially in this one.
Stockholm’s AI startup scene is also starting to show depth. Early movers like Sana didn’t just secure funding and traction, but they helped define what AI-native startups can look like in B2B and infrastructure-heavy verticals. More importantly, they trained talent, validated use cases, and proved that it’s possible to build globally relevant AI companies out of Sweden. That groundwork is now fueling a second wave of startups, with emerging players like Legora (legal AI), Lovable (AI-powered app development platform), and others are coming to market with sharp focus and strong teams. The ecosystem’s early bets are compounding. What started with a few AI-first companies is evolving into a broader, more durable platform for applied AI innovation. Stockholm may not be chasing scale at any cost, but in AI, it’s starting to set the pace.
For investors, especially at the growth stage, this is a signal. Stockholm’s early-stage pipeline is functioning. But the gap in late-stage capital creates an opening. Companies that are raising follow-ons are often forced to look outside. That introduces pressure on geography, on strategy, and on exit dynamics. For funds willing to lean in earlier, build local relationships, and back high-quality teams before they cross borders, Stockholm is exactly where to be looking. For funds willing to underwrite scale on local terms, Stockholm might offer an arbitrage in talent, timing, and trust.
What’s missing isn’t ambition or ideas to create the next unicorns, but some infrastructure. And unless more of it develops, Stockholm risks exporting the very companies it helped create.

In the north part of Europe, surrounded by hills, endless forests, and a never-ending coastline lies the city of Stockholm, capital of Scandinavia. The whole of Scandinavia agreed on that name by the way. Technically we didn’t ask Norway, Finland and Denmark if it’s okay that we’re the capital, but we’re like 99% sure they’re okay with it.
I have lived here all my life. I love it here. It’s like being in San Francisco but with fewer unicorns and less sun. Since I'm recruiting people from all over the world and convincing them to move here I get a lot of questions about life here:
“Should I work there?”
“Can I fly to London over the day?”
“Will ABBA ever reunite?”
So here is my experience. I hope I can give an authentic look into what our cold, dark corner of the world has to offer.
My day begins when I wake up in my apartment on Kungshomen. Kungsholmen is one of the three main islands in Stockholm. From there I stroll along the water to work in the city center. It takes about 25 minutes. Unfortunately, the housing market here is a bit of a disaster, so unless you enjoy changing which apartment you sublet every month or have $350k to buy your own place you are stuck taking the bus or a train into the city center like a regular peasant.
Speaking of water, Stockholm is surrounded by it. Anywhere you go you will see water. The water is supposedly clean enough to drink. I have not tried it myself since I value my life, but there are YouTube videos of people doing it.
Nobody takes the car. Thanks to some of highest taxes in the world, cars are expensive, and besides, people here believe that if you drive to work you hate the environment and wish all animals a slow and painful death. Biking to work is a good choice. There are biking lanes everywhere. Apart from saving the planet and giving you daily exercise it also signals that you live inside of the city. Preferably get a colorful bike to maximize the attention as you ride down the city streets.
Your most important decision of the morning is where you stop to buy your café latte. I don’t drink it myself since I do paleo, but the way I understand it, it’s coffee flavored hot milk. If you work at a startup you can buy coffee at any place: both Il Café and Johan & Nyström are acceptable choices.
Our office is based in an area called city center. It’s named so because the people naming it were officially out of ideas. Nearby is the cultural house which was built as a tribute to Soviet communism.
I work out of a startup hub called “SUP46”. SUP is Swedish for “drink excessive amounts of alcohol” and 46 is the country code of Sweden. So the name literally translates to “get drunk in Sweden”. Something many people have taken to heart.
SUP46 is not just an office but also a community since it has an “event space”. During evenings, there is often free food and beer in the event space. Sometimes someone is talking in a microphone and showing powerpoint slides while you eat which can be distracting. But I’m sure people are working on fixing that.
There are a few other startup hubs, the most prominent being THINGS, which as the name implies, gives you free things.
Most people, yours truly included, work in an open office space. Your choice of clothes is important since people will be seeing you walking back and forth to the coffee machine. If you are male you should probably grow a beard.
Choice of laptop also says a lot about you.
Other companies at SUP46 are Fishbrain, which based on the name must be working on creating sentient fish and Sparta which I believe are organizing a live event where they re-enact Sparta the movie.
The most famous company in Stockholm is called Spotify. They play music and collect your personal data. It is also Europe’s most famous startup. If your CV contains the word Spotify it means you can get a job at any company at any level in Europe because you are now an expert in “digital”. There is also a company called Mojang. Nobody knows if it is an actual startup or if it’s just one guy that created a game called Minecraft and sold it to Microsoft for $2.5bn or a practical joke played by the guys behind King. Either way, we’re counting it as a unicorn.
Apart from Spotify and Mojang there are five other unicorns: Mysql, Skype, King.com, Klarna and Truecaller. Technically you could also count Russian auction site Avito.ru which was founded by two Swedes in Moscow. Before starting Avito the founders had started and sold the largest European auction site Tradera to Ebay. As part of the transaction the nice people at Ebay said “look guys, you are on your own now but don’t go start a new company or our lawyers will hunt you down” and they were like “oh but COME ON, we have to do SOMETHING, you guys are not in Russia so at least let us start a company there?”. Ebay went “lol, enjoy Soviet Russia you commies” and the rest is history. It is incidentally also the reason why Ebay’s employment agreements have changed the term “not start a competitor anywhere in the world except Russia” to “ not start a competitor anywhere in the known universe”.
The fact that Stockholm has seven unicorns while London, a city with ten times the population, only has twice the number of unicorns is basically Swedish socialism’s subtle way of giving the middle finger to the British labour party. Some people argue that Sweden has unicorns despite being socialistic not thanks to it, but I digress.
Stockholm is a special place. In the summer we swim in the warm water, in the winter we ice skate on it. We remain a thorn in the side of free market theorists by producing the highest number of unicorns per capita after San Francisco despite offering free schools and universal free healthcare.
We also love everything US and have one the biggest country subreddits to prove it. The most upvoted post last year was a picture of an Ukranian literature professor who looks like Swedish football hero Zlatan Ibrahimovich.
If you want to experience it for yourself several companies are hiring, including myself, that help with relocation. Or as ABBA said:
“If you change your mind, I’m the first in lineHoney I’m still freeTake a chance on me”
If you already work here, stop wasting your time reading this and do something productive like paying more taxes.
(Big thanks to the guys over at Padlet.com for inspiring me to write this. If you decide to work in SF you should probably work for them).

“Stockholmers call their city ‘beauty on water’. But despite the well-preserved historic core, Stockholm is no museum piece: it’s modern, dynamic and ever-evolving.” (Lonely Planet)
14 islands and 57 bridges. But what should I visit?
Before describing my 48-hour experience, let me introduce you to the history of this marvellous city by the hand of localhistories.org:
The great city of Stockholm began in the 13th century. At that time trade and commerce were increasing across Europe and many new towns were founded. In 1252 the regent of Sweden, Birger Jarl founded Stockholm. The new town grew rapidly. In 1289 it was described as the largest place in Sweden, although it would seem very small to us. By 1500 Stockholm was a flourishing town of about 6,000 people.
Then in 1520 came the Stockholm Bloodbath. The king of Denmark invaded Sweden in 1519. In 1520 he captured Stockholm and he had more than 80 Swedish nobles executed for heresy. However the Swede Gustav Vasa recaptured Stockholm in 1523.
During the 17th century Sweden was a great power in Europe. Stockholm grew rapidly and by the end of the century it had a population of around 50,000. Riddarhuset, The House of Nobility was built between 1641 and 1674.
However in 1710–1711 there was an outbreak of plague in Stockholm which killed many people. Yet Stockholm recovered and it flourished during the 18th century. Tullgarn Palace was built about 1720. The Royal Palace opened in 1754. The Obelisk was erected in 1799. Also in 1799 the statue of King Gustav III was sculpted.
In the late 19th century Sweden was transformed from an agricultural society to an industrial one. In 1850 Stockholm had a population of 93,000 and it continued to rise rapidly. By the beginning of the 20th century it had reached 300,000.
However in the mid 19th century Stockholm was an unhealthy place. There were no sewers or piped water supply. But all that changed. Stockholm gained gas light in 1853. In the 1860s a piped water supply was created. The National Museum was built in 1866. Stockholm Central Railway Station was built in 1871. Horse drawn trams began running in Stockholm in 1877. The first electric trams ran in 1901. Meanwhile Stockholm University was founded in 1877. The Swedish Army Museum opened in 1879. Skansen open air museum opened in 1891. The Biological Museum opened in 1893. Stockholm Music Museum was founded in 1899.
During the 20th century Stockholm continued to flourish. The Postal Museum opened in 1906 and the Nordic Museum was built in 1907. The Museum of National Antiquities opened in 1943. Meanwhile Parliament House was built in 1905 and City Hall was built in 1923. Stockholm escaped damage by bombing in the Second World War but in the mid 20th century a program began to modernise the city. Many old homes in Stockholm were demolished and replaced by new ones.
Today tourism is an important industry in Stockholm. The Museum of Dance opened in 1953. The Medieval Museum opened in 1986. A ship called The Vasa sank in 1628 but it was recovered in 1961 and is now on display in a museum. Today the population of Stockholm is 942,000.”

Founded in 1891, Skansen is the world’s first open-air museum. Located on the island of Djurgården and close to the Vasa museum, Skansen offers a fascinating look into historical Swedish life. Recreates the life of the 19th century.
The palace dates back to the 18th century and is one of the most interesting historic buildings in Stockholm. The biggest royal palace in the world with 600 rooms. Changing of the guards take place daily at noon.
Get familiarised with the stunning scenery of Stockholm’s archipelago on a guided 3 hour boat tour. Experience the city from the water, learn about the history and be inspired by the beauty of Stockholm’s natural landscape.
Lovely cafes, restaurants, souvenir and antique shops.
Aifur Krog & Bar
We said yes to the Viking dining experience at this underground traditional live music restaurant. Candle-light warm atmosphere, big shared tables and exquisite Swedish specialities: mussels in a creamy sauce, baked salmon and venison steaks with veggies and potatoes.
Having traditional “Fika”, a Swedish coffee-break with fresh baked cakes and pastries at Vetekatten.
Sunday morning Market at Hötorget (Haymarket Square): fresh fruits and vegetables, new and second hand crafts and clothes.
Yes, again to see the rest of the city and learn some more of its history.
“Alfred Bernhard Nobel

“Known for inventing dynamite, Nobel also owned Bofors, which he had redirected from its previous role as primarily an iron and steel producer to a major manufacturer of cannon and other armaments. Nobel held 355 different patents, dynamite being the most famous. After reading a premature obituary which condemned him for profiting from the sales of arms, he bequeathed his fortune to institute the Nobel Prizes.”
Estimates of ABBA’s total record sales are at least 400 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time.
Time to take off back home…

“Sweden is a country that has taken its culture and turned it into a brand.” – Bjorn Ulvaeus
I am exchange student with Geography background and I had always been fascinated by the unique culture and landscapes of Sweden. In January 2011, I arrived in Stockholm to begin a six-month adventure that would take me through the coldest winter days and the longest nights I had ever experienced.
At first, the darkness and the cold were a shock to my system. Coming from a tropical climate, the idea of walking to class in -20°C temperatures was daunting. But as I settled into my routine and began to explore the city, I found myself falling in love with the Swedish way of life.
One of the things that struck me the most about Swedish culture was the emphasis on sustainability and environmental stewardship. From the public transportation system to the recycling system in supermarkets, it was clear that sustainability was a top priority amongst the Swedes. As a Geography student, this was particularly inspiring, and I found myself incorporating these principles into my own daily life.
Another aspect of Swedish culture that I appreciated was the emphasis on work-life balance. Swedes take their time off seriously, and it’s not uncommon to see people taking a midday fika (coffee break) or leaving work early to spend time with family and friends. This was a refreshing change of pace from the workaholic culture that I was used to, and it allowed me to prioritize my own well-being and mental health.
Of course, as an exchange student, I also had my fair share of funny and memorable experiences. One of the highlights was celebrating Christmas with my Swedish host family, who introduced me to traditional Swedish delicacies like julbord (Christmas buffet) and glögg (mulled wine). I also had the opportunity to explore the city’s many museums, parks, and cafes, and to meet other exchange students from all over the world.
My six months in Stockholm were a transformative experience that allowed me to immerse myself in a unique culture and to learn from the people and landscapes of Sweden. From the coldest winter days to the warmest moments of connection, I will always cherish the memories and insights that I gained during my time here.

Sweden is famous for well-designed furniture, beautiful women and functional socialism. A sub-scale barren country which has somehow produced iconic global businesses like IKEA and H&M. As a tourist destination, I wasn’t sure what to expect, but assumed the place would be easy on the eye.
In early February, the sky is glum and the hours of daylight reduced, but the prettiness of Stockholm remains striking. It was cold, but not intolerable, hovering between -2 and 2 degrees Celsius. The thing to do in Stockholm in winter is drink coffee (fika in Swedish). The locals spend their days lazing in the warm, well designed Espresso House cafes. Think Starbucks with better furniture, a more nuanced color scheme and better coffee. You can’t escape them. “Why are there so many Espresso House cafes, is it a Swedish brand?” I asked the teenager behind the counter. “Yes, there are six of them on this street I think. Some Germans bought the company, and they are expanding into other Scandinavian countries, Germany and the Netherlands, it’s like another war plan” he responded, in a mocking German accent. Funny, but unlikely to be awarded Employee of the Month by his new paymasters.
If you go to Stockholm expecting to see wall-to-wall knock-out barely dressed Shield Maidens, you’ll be disappointed. Stockholm is a very multi-cultural place, filled with practically dressed typically dark haired women. The stereotypical well-tanned blue eyed, blonde, knee-buckling knock-out exists, but they are uncommon.
Stockholm is brimming with museums and galleries, exploring everything from Vikings and Sami culture to design and human rights. A highlight is the Vasa Museum in Galärvarvsvägen, visited by 1.4 million people each year. The Museum was purpose built around the Vasa, a 69 metre-long 17th century wooden ship. A 1,200 tonne war machine, with 64 cannons over two levels, ten sails and 120 tonnes of ballast. A brutal expression of Sweden’s desire to conquer new territories. “F&$k me” I muttered too loudly when I walked into the cavernous museum and saw the ship for the first time. An immense killing machine covered with hundreds of wooden sculptures. “How the hell did they build this back then?” I was thinking as I waited for my free guided tour to start.
The awe in which I held the 17th century ship builders was quickly diminished. The Vasa was a dud. The three year effort to build the ultimate war machine led to a twenty minute maiden voyage of 1.3km before it toppled in a light breeze. A colossal, embarrassing and undoubtedly expensive failure for the King.
The inquest following the sinking, brought to light that many people knew the ship was a dud, but it sailed anyway. The most shocking anecdote involved the captain overlooking the construction ordering thirty men to run back and forth along the deck in front of the Vice Admiral, when the ship was still in the port. The terrified Vice Admiral called a halt to the demonstration, as he thought the ship was going to sink. The ship was top heavy, badly proportioned and sat too high out of the water. Yet, no-one wanted to tell the King that the years of hard work and treasure had all gone to waste. Despite the loss of thirty lives, no-one was punished. The Dutch ship-builder had died during construction, and his widow who completed the project had already been paid. The King just wanted to forget about the debacle.
Swedish food is as basic as the Vasa is impressive. Meatballs and potatoes, plus a bit of fish and a few miniature prawns. Hearty food. Good for plundering, less so for the sedate modern lifestyle. Given the frigid winter and heavy diet, you’d expect the Swedes to be fatter.
The downside to travelling in Sweden is that it is frighteningly expensive. The Arlanda Express, a twenty minute train from the airport to the centre costs US$30. Take the cheaper forty minute bus ride with Flygbussarna and you are still shelling out US$13. Getting a basic meal below US$15 is tough, unless you want to eat hamburgers. I got charged US$3 for a glass of tap water when I ordered a steak.
But don’t let the jarring prices deter you. Stockholm is a must-see destination, even during the winter months.

by Sam Smith — Kiss House
Few things are cooler than tremendously hip Stockholm. Design centre and self-proclaimed capital of Scandinavia.
If cities were boyfriends (or girlfriends for that matter) then Stockholm is a keeper; successful, stylish, intelligent, fun yet super considerate. Marriage material for sure.
I recently spent the weekend here with my husband Ben and discovered that zipping about the city on two wheels like a local is the only way to get about. But I don’t mean on bicycles, I’m talking scooters, electric scooters.
Let’s be clear, we are both well into our 40’s but these are not for kids. Strictly over 18s only (ha!). Our kids had their own “mini-break” to Grandma’s house (happy face).
It is without a doubt the most fun I’ve had since turning adult and simply the BEST way to get the most out of a place. Admittedly, I need to work on my lefts and rights and remember that if you’re heading towards oncoming traffic, a bus is beeping at you and your husband is shouting at you, you’re probably on the wrong side of the road, but it was a great experience and I implore anyone to try it.
You may have seen pay as you go scooters popping up in various European cities. They first appeared in the US but Sweden is an early adopter and you can now find them in most Swedish cities. Never have London’s Boris (Santander) bikes seemed so dull. These are dockless so there’s no hunting around to locate / park, you literally jump on and off. A handy app finds them for you and signs you in and out with a simple scan.
Of course, it works well in Stockholm, with their spacious roads, pavements and seriously impressive route of cycle paths. Whizzing around at 20 kph, you see way more than you would on foot without missing a thing. There’s so much to love here. Where the old meets the new (and some interesting 70’s structures in between). There’s a lot of building work going on. The place is buzzing.
Effortless. Like it comes easy to them. But a city’s worth of cycle lanes takes a hell of a lot of planning and foresight. If we had the same in the UK I’d cycle (or scoot) everywhere and encourage my children to do the same — it’s just too dangerous, so we don’t!
We love Swedish design at Kiss House because so many of it’s values and principles align with ours. Known for its minimalism, simplicity and use of natural materials. The Swedish build quality, placing value on functionality as much as aesthetics with consideration to the environment, surely the cornerstones of all great modern design? They’ve long embraced ultra low energy builds. In fact, the two Professors responsible for developing the Passivhaus performance standard were a German physicist and a Swedish scientist.
Everything feels progressive here, considered. The air feels clean. It doesn’t surprise me that Stockholm is ranked one of the most eco-friendly cities in the world and Sweden one of the most sustainable countries.
Back in 2014, The Guardian reported on an innovative city funded high-rise project in the southern Swedish town of Växjö where two high-rises were built to the Passivhaus standard to help the country realise it’s goal of eliminating CO2 emissions by 2050. “Taking this route works very well for us as a municipality, since we want to become CO2 neutral, and homes account for 30% of energy use” explained Henrik Johansson, the city’s environmental coordinator. He added “even though the city has endured three extremely cold winters since the buildings went up, the apartments have not been cold”.
It’s the city’s most ambitious project but it’s no stranger to Passivhaus builds and even boasts a Passivhaus house style tennis complex built by former world no.1 player Stefan Edberg. Växjö’s city planners now face the dilemma of how to deal with the vast amounts of energy used by poorly insulated 1960’s and 70’s buildings, and how to make them more energy efficient or Passivhaus retrofit them. “Just another challenge to overcome” says Johansson (source: Elisabeth Braw: The Guardian).
The Swedes clearly know how to create great cities. Stockholm is a joy and is testament to their foresight and people centred design.
Whilst there zipping around, we had the benefit of recommendations from locals (because my husband is fortunate enough to spend time there for work). Below is our Top 10 things to See and Do.
2. Check out “The Future Starts Here” exhibition at Ark Des (in association with the V&A London) until 4th August 2019, a fascinating and thought-provoking exhibition about the world of tomorrow shaped by the designs and technologies emerging today.
3. Visit Fotografiska: A centre for contemporary photography housed in an old brick-built customs building
4. Check out Snösätra Graffiti Wall of Fame one of Europe’s largest graffiti exhibitions
5. Take a day cruise and experience the best parts of the beautiful Stockholm archipelago
6. Eat amazingly good Bengali Street Food at Gossip Shanti (be warned when the waiter says it’s hot, it’s HOT!)
7. Sample local cuisine in a Foodhall such as Östermalms Saluhall
8. Visit one of the city’s Roof Top bars such as Tak Stockholm
9. Mooch around cool independent boutiques and homeware stores, plus enjoy a stop-off in one of the eclectic cafes and bars in laidback Södermalm or SoFo
10. Stay in Downtown Camper by Scandic: A new first-class hotel with award winning design, rooftop bar, spa and rooftop pool as well as an excellent restaurant, Campfire.

“Life is always full of surprises”
For an Asian girl who never traveled to any European country before, the fact of moving from Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam) to Stockholm (Sweden) to live was never in my plan. However, life is always full of surprises, there are decisions we have to make, and some decisions are made for us. Moving to Stockholm has opened a brand new chapter of my life. Although I have been living here for just 11 months, there are so many things in Stockholm that I just fell in love with this city at first sight (and I’m sure you will).
After landing from the flight, I took the bus from Arlanda airport to Stockholm city. It took around 55 minutes from Arlanda airport to Stockholm City via Flygbuss with ticket price is 99 SEK (~10.3USD) for 1 round.
Firstly I was really impressed with how the city manages to preserve all the historical buildings. From churches to museums, government offices to schools, and even regular houses, Stockholm’s architecture is stunning
My friends told me that, in Stockholm, it’s very common to see houses which were built in 1900s (100 years old). These houses can survive such long time thanks to the high quality materials as well as careful maintenance. If you want to explore these building yourselves, Gamla Stan should be your must-go of Stockholm owing to its unique Swedish architecture.
My second impression was that I can drink the water from any tap in the city. My landlord proudly told me that “Stockholm has some of the purest water in the world in its taps. It has way better quality than bottled water, so yes, it’s completely safe to drink.”
At first, I did not dare to drink the water directly from the tap as it’s not common for Asian people to do so. However, seeing my landlord tried it himself, I also wanted to try. The result was a big surprise for me. I’d never tasted such fresh water before. I started searching for information about water in Stockholm and here was what I found:
“Every day Stockholm Vatten och Avfall produces 360,000 m³ of drinking water in the two water treatment works of Lovö and Norsborg, and distributes it to 1.5 million people in Stockholm.The water is retrieved in Lake Mälaren. To maintain a high quality of drinking water, measures are continuously taken to protect the source of water supply; Lake Mälaren as well as the reserve water source Bornsjön.”
Thanks to this work, we can save a lot of money on boiling water to make it drinkable. This also helps to reduce the number of plastic bottles consumed. Imagine that travellers don’t need to buy water bottles but can just simply fill the bottle with tap water. Bravo Stockholm!!!
Living in Stockholm, we don’t need to drive miles away to get into the wild because Stockholm is surrounded with a lot of lakes and green trees. There are almost 300 nature reserves around the greater Stockholm area, two national parks, one national city park and plenty of lakes that attract both wildlife and locals. Every suburb has numerous green areas, both small and large, and there are several green parks in the city. In other words, you’re just a short subway or bus ride away if you feel nature calling.
If you are lucky (like me), you might encounter some European hares happily enjoy their grass on your journey. Some of my friends live in the far north of Stockholm sometimes also see moose, deers, or even bears on the train to the inner city. There was a time, my boss nearly hit a moose while driving to Arlanda airport in a gloomy morning because the moose just suddenly jumped into the middle of the street (lucky him). So prepared yourself to meet some surprise friends on your way in Stockholm!
When it comes to air quality, there are many components to measure it including the level of pollutants like ammonia (NH3), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), … and the level of particulate matter (PM) like PM10, PM2.5. However, in this post, I won’t talk about scientific facts but how I feel when breathing the air in Stockholm.
I am living in a small apartment in southern Stockholm, around 12km from the city central so surrounding me are a lot of trees, flowers and lakes. Everyday, as long as I step out of the house, I always look up in the sky, take a really deep breath to get as much cool fresh air as possible to feed my lung. I never feel tired of doing that. Every breath I take, I can feel like the air in flowing in my body and it keeps refreshing my mind. I wish I could pack those air and ship it to my home country so that my family can enjoy it with me.
Fika is one of the most popular keywords you will hear when you are in Stockholm and it is a very traditional Swedish thing people do almost everyday. Fika basically means to meet up for a coffee and a piece of cake. Sweden enjoys a highly developed culture when it comes to baked goods, they are so in love with cake that they even have national days for some cakes.
Semla is two-layer bun made of wheat and cardamom, stuffed with almond paste under a cover of thick layered whipped cream. This is definitely the must-try item in your list when you are in Stockholm.
Every year on a Tuesday that lies on the seventh week before Easter, is where the so-called “Fat Tuesday” or “Semmeldagen” (the day of the Semla) falls.
Princess cake contains layers of light sponge cake, pastry cream, and a dome of whipped cream all covered by green marzipan and marzipan pink roses. You can find it in every bakery store with different variations, in round-shaped or in roll-shaped.
This is my most favourite cake ever! Kanelbullar is made with a perfectly soft and chewy cardamom dough, a buttery cinnamon-sugar filling, and twisted into cute little knots. Every year on October 4th, the Swedes celebrate Cinnamon Bun Day. All you need for a chilling afternoon is cup of coffee and a cinnamon roll. It is the ultimate symbol of Swedish home cooking and, as any Swede will tell you, the smell of newly baked cinnamon rolls is best smell in the world.
I usually warm the bun in microwave a little bit (30 seconds) to feel the smell of cinamon but you can try without heating it. Once you try it, you will love it forever!
— — — — — — — — — — — — —
Yay, there you go, the list of 5 things that made me fall in love with Stockholm. I really hope this list will inspire you to go to Stockholm one day. If you have been in Stockholm before or are living in Stockholm, please let me know what are your favourite things about this beautiful city.
Stay tuned for Part 2 of my top 10 things to love about Stockholm!

It all began with a single goal: to make Stockholm my new home. However, I quickly realized that the key to achieving this dream lay in securing a job in the Swedish capital. With limited funds and a burning desire to make my migration a reality without draining my savings, I embarked on a relentless quest.
For seven months, I tirelessly scoured professional platforms like LinkedIn, navigating through countless applications and attending numerous interviews. But amidst the rollercoaster ride of hope and disappointment, I confronted a difficult decision: should I risk quitting my current job to focus solely on this pursuit? The financial strain weighed heavily on my mind, urging caution when it came to advising others.
Yet, from the depths of my own experience, I discovered a valuable lesson that would shape my journey forever…
Embarking on my migration journey to Stockholm, finding a job became the crucial first step in realizing my dreams without depleting my savings. For seven long months, I tirelessly scoured platforms like LinkedIn, submitting countless applications and attending interviews. It was a challenging period, as I had taken the bold step of quitting my job to focus on this pursuit. Financial strain tested my resolve, making me hesitant to advise others to follow suit.
However, I learned a valuable lesson: once an offer arrives, swift action is vital. Initiating the notice period promptly and commencing the visa application process without delay can help secure a smoother transition, avoiding the prolonged financial hardships I faced. By sharing this experience, I hope to guide fellow migrants toward a more stable and successful path in their own endeavors.
Let us start with the time I started the interview process. As an iOS applications developer, the interview process consisted of IQ tests, coding tests, and several rounds of interviews related to my tech stack and my 10 years of experience in the industry. The interview process started at the end of December 2022, and I was offered a new opportunity to work with them in the first week of February 2023.
With the elation of securing a job offer, I eagerly signed the employment contract, understanding that this was the first step towards my new life in Stockholm. Little did I know that the journey ahead would require additional support. My new employer introduced me to a reputable visa processing agency, a third-party partner entrusted with navigating the intricate procedures involved in obtaining a visa. (Note: Specific names of the employer and third-party agency have been omitted for privacy reasons.)
The first thing they asked me to do was to fill out and sign a power of attorney form so that they could handle the application on my (and my wife’s) behalf. We also provided several pieces of information about us to the agency, such as passport data and marriage certificates. We were provided with two control numbers for me and my wife, which would help us keep track of the process on their website. You can check the status of your application using your control number here.
After waiting for about a month, I was informed by the agency that the Swedish Migration Agency had approved our application! The next process was to get the work permit card from the Embassy of Sweden. In order to obtain this, we needed to submit our biometrics to the Embassy. I swiftly booked flight tickets to New Delhi, where the Embassy of Sweden was located. You can find the details of the Embassy of Sweden in New Delhi here. The allotted time for submitting your biometrics is between 8:30 am & 10:30 am IST.
A few tips for your visit to the Embassy of Sweden:
Once inside, you will need to get a token and wait for your turn. The whole process took about 10 minutes for me and my wife. Afterward, we returned home and patiently waited for someone to reach out to us about the arrival of the permit cards.
Two weeks later, I received an email instructing me to collect the permit cards from the Embassy. The process for collecting the cards was between 11:00 am and 12:00 pm IST, and it was a swift affair, taking about 15 minutes.
As soon as I obtained my permit card, I informed my new employer, and they promptly booked my tickets to Stockholm. The next week, I found myself standing at the airport, clutching my boarding pass tightly. It was a moment of reflection on the incredible journey that led me here.
Part 1 of my migration tale had been a rollercoaster of perseverance and uncertainty, but it was just the beginning. Little did I know that the real adventure awaited me on Swedish soil. With a newfound job, a promising future, and dreams that seemed within reach, I stepped onto the plane with a mixture of excitement and apprehension.
The next chapter of my story, “Unlocking the Essentials,” would take you on a journey through the practicalities of settling in Sweden. From registering for a personal number to navigating the intricacies of the banking system and embarking on the quest for a place to call home, Part 2 reveals the essential steps that awaited me in building a life in this beautiful country.
Join me as we unlock the doors to a new chapter, where dreams become reality and Swedish adventures await. Stay tuned for “Unlocking the Essentials” in the next installment of my Sweden migration blog.

Celebrating the Unsung Heroes Behind Every Great Achievement
I visited Stockholm recently and couldn’t help noticing how much history fills the city.
I wandered through the Vasa Museum, then ended up at Stockholm’s City Hall, that red-brick landmark standing quietly over the water.
Inside, a guide led us through the halls where Nobel laureates have dined.
I stopped at the grand staircase, amazed by every curve and step. Ragnar Östberg, the architect behind it all, was known for obsessing over every detail, not for himself, but for the queen and her royal guests.
Östberg’s attention to detail was legendary.
He made his wife walk up and down different versions of the staircase until every step felt right. He wanted the queen, and every guest after her, to glide down without a stumble. But even as he worked for royalty, he never forgot the people who helped bring his vision to life.
His team — the builders, craftsmen, and artists — were honoured in a way that surprised me.
Instead of the mayor’s own bust above the office, you’ll find the faces of these collaborators, a daily reminder that nobody succeeds alone.

Here are some tips for you, Chris, for your trip to Stockholm.
Stay in Soder. Caffinate at Kaffe in the mornings and have a delicious swedish breakfast bun from across the road at Fabrique.
You will want to explore the shops around Soder, I think you will do some real damage here particularly Aplace, J.Lindberg, Gram, SnS and Cos.
To be converted to the cause of herring, you must lunch at Strommingsvagnen. It is a fish food truck which sounds like the sort of thing you should run from — unless you are in Sweden! I think we ate everything and it was all delicious. Rug up as you can only sit outside on benches.
For culture, I liked Fotografiska the photography museum not far from Soder.
For a fun day out, rent bikes and ride around Djurgården, the garden island of Stockholm’s archipelago and have lunch at Rosendahl’s Tradgard (closed Mondays). It is quite magical having a casually elegant meal in a glasshouse. All the meals are prepared with veggies and herbs harvested in the palace’s kitchen garden. A highlight.
Spend the afternoon at the contemporary art museum on the island.
Check out a gig guide if you can. We saw a great DJ play down somewhere near the water and it was awesome. Swedes know how to party.
That is all that I can remember for now. Enjoy and bring back more tips.

My generation were teenagers in the late 1970’s and thus passionate fans of Sweden since Abba dominated the Top of the Pops (God, how I hated the ghastly Dancing Queen since every girl in high school thought this syrupy pop tune was written specifically for her!) and Björn Borg dominated Centre Court at Wimbledon as the Men’s Champion until the trophy was wrested from him in 1981 in a five set marathon by the awful but brilliant American John McEnroe. As I grew older, I learnt to love Sweden’s amazing social tolerance and cosmopolitan culture, its democratic values, welfare state, its beautiful lakes, ancient cities and effervescent young women whom I met in my fave Hellenic beach resorts like Ayia Napa in Cyprus and Mykonos in the Greek Aegean.
However, in 2025, I have a special reason to love Sweden and it is definitely not the ugly furniture of Ikea my Gen-Z twins adore. The Swedish kroner has been the best anti-dollar FX hedge of 2025 and is up an incredible 17% in the last 6-months. As I expect the Trump Buckeroo to fall 20% before the Big Guy leaves the White house, I hope my Swedish kroner stash rises another 20% and offsets the already exorbitant cost of a Scandi holiday. Since I prefer the Med to the Baltics at any time of the year, why not revert back to the 1980’s watering holes in the Cyclades and meet nice Swedish people in the Scandinavian love shack rather than actually flying to Stockholm Gothenburg or Malmö.
Sweden is also one of the world’s most successful case studies in innovation and entrepreneurial capitalism, the reason Nasdaq’s Old World hub is in Stockholm. This $900 billion economy is one of my favourite countries to invest for the next 5-years as long as Putin does not invade Estonia and try to usurp King Charles XII’s role as the supreme war lord of the North with a blockade of the Baltics. After all, Putin is from St. Petersburg, a port founded by Tsar Pyotr Alexievich to fight the Swedish empire, the superpower of the North in the first decade of the 18th century.
This IT/green tech/export colossus is a goldmine for investors who love corruption free economies dedicated to innovation and talent, a natural for any refugee from Planet Dollar like moi!

Worrying about getting around? getting to and from the airport? want to check out the archipelago but do not want to join an expensive tour?
Public transport is great in Stockholm but it is not cheap. On average, a single ride costs SEK35. As visitor, you can buy a 7 days pass at SEK315 (there are other options if you are staying for only a day or 2, check here for information).
The best thing about this card is, you can actually go to and from the airport with it without paying extra if you do not mind a slightly longer (like 20 mins) commute!
If you go to the train station, they will tell you you need to purchase a SEK120 ticket to go through (which is true). However, we were lucky enough to encounter a staff who is nice enough to tell us the alternative that saved us SEK280/pax (2 more lunches!).
When you are at SkyCity in the airport, go out (and down) from the escalator, you will see a bus stop, get on bus 583 (you can check their schedule here) and ride to the last stop at Märsta station. At Märsta station, you will get on the train that go all the way to Stockholm City.
The bus ride is about 10–15 mins and the train ride is about 30–40mins.
Märsta station is the end of the train line, so you can’t really get it wrong.

Apart from going to and from the airport, you can also go to (some part of) the Stockholm Archipelago with your Travelcard which easily saves you hundreds of SEK.
Stockholm is made up of 30,000 islands (subject to dispute :P), and it is a large part of Stockholm Swedes’ life to go to the Archipelago during summer/vacation. (To hide away and to not talk to anyone.)
If you want to do some island hopping, you can actually do it with the public ferry which is free with the card. Since I was there in autumn (and didn’t have time), I did not explore that. However, if you have any specific island in mind, you should check the website of waxholmsbolaget for more information.
It would be a pity to visit a city without seeing it from the water. If you do not have enough time to enjoy that, a short ride on the public ferry maybe a good way to do that. We took a short ride on the number 80. My only advice is don’t do it after dark. That’s what we did and we didn’t really see much.
Stockholm metro station is renown for its artistic decorations (you can see my Part 1 post for some picture and links to plan your trip ;)).
When we were in Stockholm, weather was not the best. With the card, we can easily hop on the train/metro/bus and kept ourselves from the rain.
You know what I think, a Travelcard is well worth it I will urge you to get it. You can get the card in the train station/convenient store in the airport.
Stockholm card is different from the Travelcard. It is a card that gives you free access/discount to paid museums, sights etc.. Different from visitor pass in many other cities, it does not include public transport (you need to buy a Travelcard) on top of that.
The card comes in 3 options, from SEK 595 (1 day) to SEK1295 (6 days). I ended up not getting it and not regretting it.
As mentioned in Part 1 of this post — most of the museums have free hours, if you plan accordingly, you can easily save a SEK200–300; as for transport (which is the most expensive items on their list), the only offer they have is the hop-on-hop-off for one day. The route is basically covered by public transport, and Stockholm is a pretty walkable city without the rain.
Another draw back about thePass is that you can only get your money’s worth if you plan very carefully. Sometimes, you may end up just seeing everything but paying attention to nothing, not to mention the interesting thing that you might see if you’re not in a rush.
Lastly, when I took a look at the items, a few of them are very similar (tour around similar places), which you probably would not need to do them all.
The Verdict
I do not think it is worth it to get the pass, unless you are dead set to see all the paid museums (potentially giving up on some of the awesome free museums) and is very strategic about that.
Stockholm is not cheap, but definitely not crazy expensive like people say. I did not have a lot of time to research for the trip, and started looking when I was flights/commute, and I still managed to make the whole trip rather affordable. Doing my research, I found these blogs/site super helpful, hope you can benefit from them too:
And remember, Google is always your best friends and ready to help :)
Have a good time in Stockholm. Follow me here or on instagram @eatwithsara for more posts about food and travel!

Here at All About Capital Cities we aim to give you an overview of all the 196 capital cities in the world.
Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, has a history that spans over 700 years. It was officially founded in 1252 by Birger Jarl, a Swedish statesman who sought to protect Sweden’s interior from sea invasions and to control trade along the Baltic Sea. Its strategic location on 14 islands where Lake Mälaren meets the Baltic made Stockholm ideal for both defense and commerce.
The city quickly became a vital trade center, especially during the Hanseatic League era in the late Middle Ages. German merchants and craftsmen played a major role in shaping its early economy and architecture. In the 16th century, under the reign of Gustav Vasa, Stockholm became the political and administrative capital of a newly unified Sweden, marking the start of the Swedish Empire.
During the 17th century, Stockholm flourished as Sweden emerged as a European great power. The city expanded significantly, with grand palaces and government buildings constructed to reflect its growing prestige. However, this golden age was followed by a period of decline in the 18th century after Sweden lost much of its territory.
The Industrial Revolution in the 19th century revitalized Stockholm, transforming it into a modern city with railways, factories, and growing suburbs. It continued to evolve through the 20th century, becoming a hub for innovation, culture, and diplomacy.
Today, Stockholm is known for its beautiful mix of medieval and modern architecture, its progressive social systems, and its role as a leading city in technology, sustainability, and Scandinavian culture.
Stockholm is famous for its stunning natural setting, rich history, and modern innovation. Spread across 14 islands connected by over 50 bridges, the city is often called the “Venice of the North.” Its blend of medieval charm and cutting-edge design makes it one of Europe’s most attractive capitals.
The city is also renowned for its well-preserved Old Town, Gamla Stan, where cobbled streets and colorful 17th-century buildings surround landmarks like the Royal Palace and Stockholm Cathedral. Stockholm is the cultural heart of Sweden, home to world-class museums such as the Vasa Museum, which houses a 17th-century warship, and the ABBA Museum, celebrating Sweden’s iconic pop group.
As the home of the Nobel Prize ceremonies, Stockholm is a global symbol of intellectual achievement and innovation. The city is also recognized for its sustainability and environmental efforts, often ranking among the world’s greenest cities.
In addition, Stockholm has a vibrant food scene, cutting-edge fashion, and a strong tech industry, earning it the nickname “Unicorn Factory” due to its high number of billion-dollar startups. With its mix of history, nature, and modern living, Stockholm stands out as a unique and influential European capital.
Greta Garbo — Iconic silent film actress of the 1920s and 1930s
Avicii (Tim Bergling) — Influential electronic music producer and DJ
Alfred Nobel — Inventor of dynamite and founder of the Nobel Prizes
Ingrid Bergman — Oscar-winning actress (Casablanca, Gaslight)
Benny Andersson — Member of the pop group ABBA, who were formed in Stockholm
Gamla Stan (Old Town) — Historic heart of Stockholm with cobbled streets and colorful buildings
Vasa Museum — Maritime museum showcasing a fully intact 17th-century warship
Skansen — Open-air museum and zoo with traditional Swedish buildings and animals
The Royal Palace — One of Europe’s largest palaces, still in official use
ABBA The Museum — Interactive museum dedicated to the iconic Swedish pop group
Fotografiska — Contemporary photography museum with exhibitions and a top-floor restaurant
Djurgården — Green island full of museums, parks, and family attractions
Stockholm City Hall — Host of the Nobel Prize banquet and home to the beautiful Golden Hall
Moderna Museet — Sweden’s top modern art museum
The Archipelago — Explore by ferry or boat; popular islands include Vaxholm and Sandhamn
If you’re planning on travelling to the city then make sure you’ve got some travel insurance in place. Our partner EKTA offer travelers health insurance for worldwide destinations for all travelers.

Take a stroll through the charming streets of Gamla Stan and visit the incredible Vasa Museum. Don’t forget to explore Djurgården, the lush green island, and indulge in the world of modern art at the Fotografiska Museumet. Get ready for an unforgettable adventure in this vibrant city!
Here are five top tips, from a true Stockholm native, on what to do in Stockholm! Want more tips from me? Feel free to leave a comment!
You should check out Gamla Stan when you visit Stockholm — it is a charming neighborhood with narrow streets and colorful buildings. This historic district is located on the island of Stadsholmen and is one of the best-preserved medieval city centers in Europe.
As you wander through its winding cobblestone streets, you’ll come across beautiful architecture, quaint cafes, and charming shops selling Swedish handicrafts. Gamla Stan is also home to several notable landmarks, including the Royal Palace, Stortorget (the main square), and the Stockholm Cathedral.
Don’t forget to explore the narrow alleyways and hidden courtyards, where you’ll find hidden gems and unique surprises. Whether you’re a history buff, an architecture lover, or simply looking for a picturesque setting, Gamla Stan is a must-visit destination in Stockholm.
Located in Stockholm, the Vasa Museum exhibits a well-preserved 17th-century warship. It is a fascinating destination for history enthusiasts and maritime lovers. Upon entering the museum, visitors are greeted by the majestic sight of the Vasa ship, which was salvaged from the depths of the Stockholm harbor after sinking on its maiden voyage in 1628.
The ship’s intricate carvings and ornate details are a testament to the craftsmanship of the era. As you explore the museum, you’ll learn about the ship’s ill-fated journey and the remarkable efforts made to recover and restore it. The Vasa Museum offers a unique glimpse into Sweden’s naval history and serves as a reminder of the country’s seafaring legacy.
Wandering through Djurgården, the green island, allows you to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and immerse yourself in nature’s tranquility. Djurgården is a true oasis in the heart of Stockholm, where you can stroll along lush green pathways and breathe in the fresh air.
The absence of cars on the island adds to its charm, making it the perfect place for a leisurely walk or bike ride. As you explore Djurgården, you’ll come across beautiful gardens, picturesque waterfronts, and even a charming little village. There are also several museums and attractions to visit, such as the Vasa Museum and the ABBA Museum.
Whether you’re a nature lover or a culture enthusiast, Djurgården offers something for everyone, making it a must-visit destination in Stockholm.

(disclaimer: this post is long overdue, as the trip happened in February. But better late than never!)
Me two months ago: Dear Santa Claus & birthday fairy lady, all I want for my birthday is to experience a white winter for my 30th before I head to Singapore. I’m talking a white winter, with glistening snow as far as the horizon stretches and air so crisp and cold that it takes your breath away. But not so debilitatingly cold that we won’t go outside… Sweden and Iceland, you say? Alright I’m in!
Turns out Stockholm and Iceland were the perfect retreats to get a refreshing dose of true winter before I move to a country with hot, hot, hot and hotter as seasons. The weather was a brisk 0 degrees C/32 degrees F, which was cold, but gave us beautiful flurries of snow every other day. In Sweden, we slowly acclimated to the cold and learned about the viking history of this Nordic country in museum after museum. Then in Iceland, we became outdoor adventurers, summiting glaciers and hiking ice caves. Even for warm-blooded Californians, these two northern spots were the ideal winter vacation.
Sweden highlights:
Iceland highlights (Part 2) is here.
Sweden runs so efficiently. The ARN airport has wifi, the express train that takes you to Central Station has wifi, and the busses run promptly every few minutes. Our Airbnb was in the adorable Old Town district, with narrow cobblestone streets that housed everything from tacky souvenir shops to quaint boutique stores that sold artisan chocolates and fancy wool textiles. It was right next to the riverwalk, where stately old buildings boasted their prowess along the water.
In true American form, we sought out the Swedish things we already knew and loved: Swedish fish, Swedish meatballs, Swedish pancakes, and Swedish massages. Our kind Airbnb host welcomed us with Swedish fish, so we immediately sought out #2: Swedish meatballs. We popped into an adorable cafe on the street corner and ordered meatballs, salmon and soup. The meatballs came in a rich cream sauce but had the appearance of Mexican mole. It was even better than all our Ikea meatball memories combined.
Warning: Swedish food is expensive. Icelandic food is even more expensive. Be prepared to drop $30 for breakfast and lunch and anywhere from $60–100 for dinner, especially if you order drinks. Thankfully (?) the SF restaurant scene has immunized me from sticker shock when I open menus anywhere in the world.
Swedish pancakes were reserved for breakfast the following day at Greasy Spoon (delicious), and it turns out Swedish pancakes are just… pancakes. But when topped with ricotta cheese and pistachios, you really don’t miss the “Swedish” at all. We also ordered eggs benedict and a salmon dish atop what can only be described as chunky potatoes.
And Swedish massages aren’t really a thing. Swedish massages were really invented by the Danish, but misattributed to the Swedish. So we scrapped that idea altogether and found a Thai massage place on Night 2. A warm Thai massage in freezing weather beats a massage in Thailand any day, even if we did pay $50 for an hour :X
Vasa Museum, 5 stars
This was one of the coolest museums I’ve ever been to. Upon entering, you’re greeted by a massive 70-meter ship (225 ft) that’s 95% of its original form. Back in 1621, Sweden was at war with Norway and the king had the ship built in two years. After just 10 minutes on the water, 1.5 km away from the shore, the Vasa ship tipped over and started to sink. She was too top-heavy and narrow in the middle to withstand a gust of wind. Of ~200 people on board, 30 died a tragic (seemingly unnecessary) death. It wasn’t until 333 years later that Sweden had the technological prowess to pull the ship up from the bottom of the ocean. The water was so cold that it was able to preserve the bones, and even the brains and shoes, of the some of the deceased aboard!
Nobel Prize Museum, 5 stars
Exhibit 1 of Swedes being incredibly nice and generous: the Nobel Prize museum was closing in 30 minutes, but the front desk man graciously allowed us in, as long as we promised not to tell anyone (he said with a wink). The museum offered an excellent crash course in all the Nobel prizes, including the Junglebook by Rudyard Kipling for literature, penicillin in medicine, and many other scientific concepts that went straight over my head.
I was frustrated by the US education system that failed to teach us about all these spectacular inventions, but also inspired to read all the Nobel-prize winning literature. Though I had read books by a few of the prize-winning authors (Beloved by Toni Morrison, Lord of the Flies by William Golding), I had barely scratched the surface of authors to read. The museum was also a crash course in learning about Alfred Nobel, a serial inventor, most known for his dynamite and explosive inventions. This was probably more world history I had retained than any class in school :X
Fotografiska Museum, 5 stars
The museum offered three powerful exhibits:
Royal Palace, 4 stars
“Royal” is a bit of a stretch to describe the Swedes’ Palace, but it is a lovely building, and aptly representative of the humble nature of the Swedes. Oddly enough, all the Swedish royalty pictured and ornately framed are brunettes, not at all like the blonde/blue-eyed people I had imagined. There are 3 main buildings — I recommend buying the ticket that gets you into all three. They’re worth checking out.
National Library of Sweden and Stockholm Public Library, 4 stars
Cause we’re #nerds. The bibliophiles in us couldn’t help but make a stop at *both* libraries. The Stockholm Public Library boasted a gorgeous rotunda on its top-level with thousands of books encircling us. As I browsed the shelves, my eyes immediately went to the Isabel Allende section where I saw the exact book I was reading on the trip: Inés of My Soul, but in Swedish. Talk about serendipity! Who needs John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale…
The National Library of Sweden had a slightly more interesting inventory. The library’s basement contained “Codex Gigas”, literally meaning “giant book”, or The Devil’s Bible. It’s the largest known medieval manuscript at 36x20x8.7 inches.
Nordic Museum, 3 stars
The exterior is stunning and looks more royal than the Royal Palace, with its turquoise sheen-ed roof atop sturdy concrete walls and multi-panel glass windows. Statues of imposing men riding horses guard the building to create a sense of awe when you enter the museum. And did I mention free entrance from 1–5pm? Apparently this is the happenin’ place on weekday afternoons with the older Swedes (aka senior citizens..), who comprised 80% of the visitors. And I don’t blame them. The atrium alone provided the most beautiful luncheon backdrop.
Eat in the museum cafe! I ordered the traditional meat and cabbage lasagna-esque dish (no noodles), and Jenn and Jenn got the salmon and mushroom soup. Keep in mind that we all grew up eating family-style, so we had the benefit of getting to try three different entrees at every meal. Plus the cafe provides all-you-can-eat bread, coffee and tea.
The rotating exhibits included Fashion through the Ages and A Nordic History, both of which were an enlightening glimpse into Nordic history through a fun, interactive lens. One exhibit provided paper for us to draw our 2050 fashion predictions and weave a giant tapestry with colorful threads that evoked different emotions.
Sodermalm Square and King’s Garden, 5 stars:
This was a beautiful garden and city center in the middle of Stockholm. There was a giant performance venue plus an ice skating rink decked out in twinkling lights, where parents and their kids swirled around unsteadily and didn’t mind taking a tumble. A small food stand served hot chocolate and even had fireplaces to roast marshmallows. If you could sit long enough in the cold, you could watch the ice sheets float down the river passing by magnificent buildings like the Grand Opera House and International Riviera Grand Hotel. It felt like Christmas in February.
Skansen “Museum”, 2 stars
The world’s oldest outdoor museum is a fascinating microcosm of Sweden. The founder brought or modeled buildings of all trades to Skansen to showcase the different industries, including glassblowing, carpentry, and other crafts. These craftsmen and women were smart and apparently decided to stay home from the cold because most of the shops were closed the day we went. There were outdoor venues, like an ice skating rink, and restaurants that were open, but we skipped. Luckily, the animals were still open for business, and we got to see wolverines (not Hugh Jackman, but honeybadger-like animals), bison, snow wolves, bobcats/lynx, and reindeer! The 2-star rating is a bit harsh, but it was pretty darn cold to spend all day at an outdoor park.
Gondolen Bar, 4 stars
Go for the views, stay for the drinks. We arrived a bit late (30 min before closing so we only had beer and wine offerings available. No matter, I immensely enjoyed my IPA.) We also were able to admire the great views from Katarinahissen, the 12-story elevator that takes you to an outdoor balcony for stunning views of the city.
Sturehof restaurant, 4 stars
Seafood lovers: go here. Again, it was expensive, but worth the price tag. We ordered a seafood platter with shrimp of all sizes, plus crab and Canadian lobster. The shrimp were incredibly tasty. The toast skagen, which is what they’re known for, is mayonnaise-y shrimp on top of toast — a bit overrated in my opinion. However, their scallop appetizer (yes, scallop singular, not plural) was to die for, but will set you back $17.
Grand Escalier, 4 stars
We tried to head to the Spy Bar, which loomed surreptitiously outside the Sturehof restaurant, but we eventually gave up trying to get in. We luckily walked inside the “galeria” (mall) right next to the restaurant and stumbled upon the Grand Escalier bar, which came highly recommended from a friend. Deeee-licious cocktails.
Östermalm Food Hall, 4 stars
I had already had moose medallions, so I was in a meat kick, looking to sample the primest cuts of Sweden’s finest. As we walked around the stalls that offered meats, seafood, pastries, and other goods, we asked a nice gentleman what the most popular meats were. He offered a sampling of their various meat cuts. We had the moose hind, moose salami, and reindeer heart and shoulder. Each had varying levels of smokiness and were all delicious.
When we attempted to pay, the man (Wes) refused and said it was his treat. And the sampling wasn’t just a piece of meat per animal, there were probably ten slices of each meat! Such. Nice. People. For a light lunch, we had their famous cheese quiche and cardamom cinnamon bun with a light hot chocolate. They really love their cardamom in Sweden. Perhaps cardamom is a natural happiness pill??
Slingerbulten restaurant: yummy restaurant. Order the moose medallions.
Da Peppe: If you want a break from Swedish restaurant, check out this very authentic Italian joint in the Old District. They were kind enough to provide free dessert plus a sufficiently embarrassing Italian rendition of “Happy Birthday.”
Didn’t get a chance to visit-

Stockholm ranks high on many queer people’s favourite cities list — and it’s plain to see why. This waterfront city is a hub of fashion, music, food, nature and progressive queer culture. Let me guide you to my Stockholm.
As soon as you arrive, whether it’s at Arlanda or Skavsta airport, you will be met by the views many associate with Sweden; green pine forests, yellow fields and blue lakes, with red little houses dotted all around. As you approach the city (grab Arlanda Express for the smoothest journey) the houses, as well as the vast open waters, grow in size, revealing the unique character of this capital city. Stockholm is where domestic lakes meet the Baltic sea, and whilst this is the centre of the tech, music and fashion innovation that Sweden is well known for, the city also celebrates nature, tradition — and LGBTQ rights. Let’s dive in.
Stockholm is built on 17 islands and as a visitor you simply must make the most out of this unique feature. My first tip, therefore, is: find your sea legs.
There is nothing quite like island hopping in the archipelago. Get on a traditional archipelago boat — or it’s high-speed equivalent – and take it out to Waxholm, Möja, Finnhamn, Utö or any one of the other gorgeous little stops along the way. Here you will be able to stop for a bite to eat, have a dip in the sea, and explore the Swedish forestry. Thanks to Allemansrätten, the Right of Public Access, you are free to roam the land (with only a few exceptions). If bigger boats are your thing you could get a ferry from Slussen, taking you to Finland or Estonia for the day.

Take time to soak in the waterfront in Stockholm. Whether it’s a walk on Djurgården, a stroll along the picturesque Södermälarstrand, or a panoramic tour along Fjällgatan (where my girlfriend asked me to marry her on New Year’s Eve!), I find it is impossible to get enough of the the Stockholm waterfront views. You can count on many a #selfie moment here.
What’s more, on a warm summer’s evening you will find theatre performances in Rålamshovsparken, high profile gigs at theme park Gröna Lund, romantic picnics at Skinnarviksberget, burgers and boules Boule & Berså at Danviksbro, national sing-along at open air museum Skansen and beer gardens filled with Swedes enjoying a well-earned “AW”, after-work. Following a long, dark winter Sweden embraces summer like few others.
Regardless of whether you are visiting in summer or winter, make sure you indulge in a dip. In the warmer months Stockholm’s many beaches fill up with local holiday makers, and during the rest of year (but also in summer) the many bathhouses create a relaxing oasis. Check out well-renowned Sturebadet, situated in the city centre, or Japanese sanctuary Yasuragi, located in the forests outside Nacka, to experience perfect relaxation. For an added twist and a truly Swedish experience, head out to Hellasgården for a dip in the sea — don’t worry, they cut a hole in the ice for you in the winter.
Stockholm is due to co-host EuroPride together with Gothenburg in 2018 and the city celebrates a huge Pride party every summer — but I have found it to be just as welcoming to queer people all year round.
Strolling through the streets of Stockholm I am always struck by rainbow flags, non-conformative design, boundary pushing initiatives and out gay people just being themselves. Last I was over I just happened upon a small yet mainstream jewellery shop proudly advertising rainbow marriage – that’s just one example. Swedes generally don’t even blink at the thought of same sex couples and when the Pride parade comes to town, the streets fill with people celebrating equality.
Worth noting is that the lesbian scene in Sweden is political; outspokenly feminist and trans inclusive. With lots of lesbian artists and initiatives increasingly gaining recognition across Sweden, the scene is growing particular in the Swedish capital — check out artists such as Silvana Imam, Beatrice Eli and Kakan Hermansson and you get the idea.
And whilst holding hands with my girlfriend (now fiancee!) has never caused me any grief regardless of the time of day, it is at night that the gay scene really comes alive…
Stockholm nightlife thrives particularly between May and August, when the sun doesn’t set and the summer rays stretch on into the early hours. Honestly, it’s magical.
One of the most popular establishments during this time of year (and again, one of my faves) is Mälarpaviljongen, a chic waterfront bar and restaurant buzzing with LGBT clientele, DJs, and staff. Worth noting is that the venue works with LGBT charity Regnbågsfonden and employs LGBT refugees.
Trädgården is another summer club hugely popular with the queer community. Set under the bridges near the waterfront by Eriksdalsbandet, this club invites some of the biggest acts and DJs and it is definitely one to visit. Make sure you go early, though, as queues can be long.
There are lots of club nights aimed specifically at a lesbian/bi clientele. Look out for Moxy, Bitter Pills, Hotellgänget, Club Wish (for the kinky) and keep a keen eye on Gunn Lundemo Events — this Stockholm-based DJ regularly does clubs around the world but she often also plays on home turf and her latest project with the L Word’s Daniela Sea looks seriously cool. Speaking of new, SPACE Stockholm is a recent initiative by lesbian icon and longtime Stockholm DJ Pamela, promising house music and underground decadence.
Many of the gay clubs in Stockholm attract a mixed clientele and “queer” is the buzzword here, as exemplified by the brilliant-looking Klubb Hångel, playing retro tunes and serving a no-attitude-pure-joy kind of vibe.
DATE is a club night run by underground music superstars Ji Nilsson and Julia Spada and whereas it isn’t advertised as queer, it’s a night I’d personally always try to make.
Mainstream gay clubs, where I might expect to see more men than women, include King Kong, Wonk and party boat Patricia. Bar/restaurant/club Marie Laveau, which is mixed and has a very cool vibe, puts on a queer party, Club Laveau, every Friday.
Queer friendly but not explicitly gay clubs include Debaser, Berns and Södra Teatern - but then again you will struggle to find somewhere that isn’t welcoming in Stockholm. For the latest queer events, see Visit Sweden LGBT as well as the Facebook timeline of JagVillGåPåQueerFest — the information is in Swedish but it gives a good idea of new upcoming nights. You might also want to check out Facebook’s list of gay bars here.
Say Swedish music and one band will come to mind regardless of where in the world you are. And now, finally, we have a museum dedicated to their greatness! Whether you are a huge fan or not, the ABBA museum is a Stockholm must as it lets you step back in time and rediscover pop history. Record your own song, perform in your own music video and (my favourite) learn about the music history that followed on from these super trooper dancing queens. Go, go, go!
Music thrives in Stockholm and the list of hits created here, thanks to producers such as Denniz Pop, Max Martin, RedOne, Nijs and Ji Nilsson, is endless. Spot some of the stars, including Zara Larsson, First Aid Kit and The Cardigans, live in Stockholm this summer — and do consider heading over for Popaganda, Stockholm’s coolest pop festival held early September at outdoor swimming bath Eriksdalsbadet. Years and Years and FKA Twigs were incredible last year.
Fans of modern art head to Moderna Museet or Liljevalchs, where each spring their exhibition Vårsalongen showcases the latest artists and pieces for a small entry fee. Fotografiska, the photography museum, is another must as they never fail to put on incredible and thought-provoking exhibitions, often by queer artists.
It is no secret that Swedes love IKEA as much as the rest of the world, but there is more to Swedish interior design than that. On a trip to Stockholm make sure you check out the Svenskt Tenn and Svensk hemslöjd in the city centre and discover the origins of Scandi hygge.
Stockholm Fashion Week takes place twice a year but this city breathes fashion 24/7. Home to brands such as ACNE, Stutterheim, Dagmar, Whyred, Swedish Hasbeens, Anna Holtblad, Filippa K, Hope, Nudie, Happy Socks, COS, Polarn O. Pyret as well as high street hits Weekday, Monki and of course, H&M, Stockholm makes for great shopping, especially as many of these big names actively challenge both hetero and gender norms. “Normkritik”, norm criticism is an important concept in Sweden, not least in fashion.
For high street fashion head to Drottninggatan and the city centre area between tube stops T-centralen, Hötorget and Östermalmstorg. Whilst you will find specialised (and very good!) H&M stores on almost every corner, Monki and Weekday are other Swedish-owned high street brands well worth checking out. Department store Åhléns has a good fashion department with many Swedish designers and Nordiska Kompaniet, a five minute walk from there, is excellent for your high end shopping. MOOD department store around the corner serves up a cool hipster vibe (with incredible toilets) and Biblioteksgatan, Sturegallerian and Sturegatan is where you find your luxury shopping. Do pop into Efva Attling jewellery shop on Biblioteksgatan — Efva is without a doubt one of Sweden’s biggest lesbian icons.
On Södermalm I would recommend a stroll along Åsögatan where you can discover smaller boutiques by Swedish designer stars such as Acne and Stutterheim but also nip into the shop and studio of Caroline Hjerpe, an up and coming jewellery maker with a great Instagram following. Her work has been spotted both on pop star Tove Lo and Sweden’s biggest vlogger Clara Henry (who, btw is openly bisexual and well worth checking out — YouTube here) and for good reason. If you’re lucky her adorable little dog will come say hi, too.
For vintage fashion check out Beyond Retro and Myrorna, the latter is essentially our version of Oxfam but with huge fashionista status.
There is more to Scandi cooking than meatballs and the capital of Scandinavia is well known for its culinary flair. Regardless of your budget, you can eat very, very well in Stockholm and here are a few of my favourite eateries.
Urban Deli — serving local, organic, proper classic Swedish food in a relaxed atmosphere. They have several locations but the Nytorget one is my favourite — possibly because it co-functions as a food shop and also happens to be a big queer hot spot.
Paradiest — a combined organic food store and food court where local produce is at the heart of the operation.
Green Queen — Mälarpaviljonen’s green little sister. This restaurant/deli focuses on “clean” eating, serving up delicious rainbow salads, juices and raw snacks.
Nalle o Kroppkakan — for something very Swedish and rather different, head to this restaurant near Telefonplan. They serve traditional Swedish “kroppkakor”, robust potato dumplings with different fillings. Served with lingonberries and a cold beer, it hardly gets more Swedish than this.
Vigårda — gourmet burgers at budget cost. With an ever changing menu and at least one mean veggie burger at a time this small scale burger chain is the bomb.com. (I will say that mainstream burger chain Max isn’t bad either — they do not one but six veggie options.)
Södra Teatern/Mosebacke — with one of the best views of the city, this classic Södermalm establishment serves Swedish tapas, small courses making the vegetable the star of the show (worry not, you may add meat or fish if you so wish).
A Swedish must is the tradition of fika, meaning coffee or tea with a small snack (preferably a cinnamon roll if you ask me). Your fika options are endless but these are some of my favourites:
The classic fika: Vetekatten
The posh fika: Wienerkonditoriet
The healthy, soulful fika: Koloni
The LGBT tourist fika: Chokladkoppen (ideal for an Old Town sightseeing stop)
The hipster fika: Vurma
The political, vegan fika: Femtopia
The raw fika: STHLM RAW
The Instagram worthy fika: Pom & Flora
The mainstream fika: Wayne’s
And on that sweet note, it is time to round this guide up. Do leave your favourite Stockholm tips in the comments below and hit me up on social media if you have any questions about queer life in Stockholm.
Last but not least… the practicalities.
The main inner city areas to bear in mind are Södermalm/SoFo (for a relaxed and very cool hipster vibe), Östermalm (high end shopping and first class food), gorgeous old town area Gamla Stan (the cobbled streets see you literally step back in time – make sure you visit the castle), down to earth Kungsholmen and green museum island Djurgården.
When I visit I try to walk as much as possible, just because it means I get to see more of the city, but getting around via public transport is easy. The Oyster-like SL card gives you access to the tube, bus, tram and boat — all of which feel safe and clean. Many of the tube stations are decorated with lovely bits of art and a recent addition is that the escalators are lit up by rainbow lights. You can plan your journeys here.
SAS, British Airways, RyanAir and Norwegian all fly non-stop to Stockholm from London. If you fly into Arlanda I would recommend going via Arlanda Express, Flybussarna coach or Taxi 020 — beware of individual taxi drivers trying to grab your attention at the rank and instrad pick the big taxi names, asking for a fixed price.
Stockholm Pride is taking place 31 July — 6 August 2017. See you there?

This was written by me and my spouse, Yoav Luft.
This summer we didn’t want to use planes, busses, or trains, due to the Corona. So we decided to go on a bike trip in the Stockholm archipelago.
We planned 5 days of biking and one additional day to rest on our final destination. We booked everything through an agency called ResGladh, that we’ve found through Sweden By Bike. We could have rented through ResGladh the bikes, but we wanted to keep them, so we purchased two bikes with 8 gear at Decathlon.
We received a map from Sweden By Bike with official bike paths, and prepared our riding plan according to recommendations from them and different attractions (like museums) from Google Maps. In the maps below, each square is 5 km. When planning our route, we wrote down when we will have access to restaurants and supermarkets.
We took two instant rice bags with us and some sandwiches and fruits for the first day, as well as energy bars, nuts, knäckebröd and tahini for the entire trip. We also took two bottles of water, 1 litre each.
We had one backpack of 35 litres, and one bike bag of 40 litres. We switched them during the trip according to our physical condition.
We took a ferry from Stockholm to Väsbystrand, Ljusterö with the bikes. On Summers and weekends queues start early, there is limited space for bicycles (11 on bigger ferries) and its first arrived, first served. We arrived some 45 minutes ahead of time and there was already a queue. We sailed for 2.5 hours.
Before the trip we were sure we’re going to cycle on pastoral gravel paths, so the first day was a bit shocking — although we used official maps for cycling, pretty quickly we’ve found ourselves cycling in a road for cars, without dedicated bike lane, nor shoulders. I haven’t been training recently because of the Corona, and Yoav hasn’t cycled since childhood, so cycling next to car driving 70 kmh wasn’t ideal for us. Luckily all the drivers were very careful, and waited behind us if another car was coming from the other direction.
We ate lunch after crossing from Ljusterö to the main land. We crossed on a floating road, this ferry doesn’t cost money and there’s no visible personnel on it, so it was a bit weird because we didn’t know exactly what to do, so we just went on board together with the cars, and then got off on the other side.. it arrives every 20 minutes. We ate lunch on the other side in the all ubiquitous Swedish “pizza-kebab"".
We continued cycling and stopped at Wira Bruk, a 17th century forge and weapons smithy. It’s a free open museum that we enjoyed, and we also filled our water bottles there and used the toilet. There’s also a coffee place there that we haven’t tried.
We started cycling at 11:30 and arrived at our B&B at 4:30. The owners recommended go bathing at Underskug, but we were exhausted and even missed the supermarket which closed at 18:00. So we went to eat yummy middle-eastern food at Cafè Bergshamra & Pizzeria.
In the morning we ate breakfast with Margaretha and Bosse from Carlberg B&B, chatted with their other guests, and started our longest day of the trip. In Bergshamara there was a bike lane, and next to Karl-Ols we took the side road and finally cycled in the woods on a gravel path. We then continued through Grovstanäs, which is really beautiful. We paused there for a short break by the water. We also got lost there a bit and it added 1–2 km to our original plan.
We paused for lunch at Spillersboda, were there is a café by the water, and we also filled water there, used the toilet, and purchased soap and some cans at the small supermarket there. At all the places we stayed there were towels, but none had soap or shampoo.
We continued then north and had a coffee break at Rådmansö Bakery Shop. The way from Nänninge to Björköören was again pretty intense with the cars of many people coming back to Stockholm on the last weekend of the last vacation week of August. We started to cycle in route (1) that’s marked in azure in the above map, but were stopped by a family arguing that it’s a private way that is blocked. So we switched to 2 and ended the day at STF (Svenska Turistföreningen) Kapellskär hostel in Riddersholm. There is a kiosk there with some microwave dishes, but we cooked some of the food we’ve had with us. At that point we were very sour. Our thighs muscles as well as butts hurt from cycling for two days and we decided to take it easy the next day — planning based on satellite images rather than only the map, and walking uphill instead of paddling.
We’ve decided to go through (4), (5) and (6) in the Södersvik map above. There’s a cycling path parallel to E18 that is unfortunately not marked in the map. It wasn’t very inspirational, but it was safe and easy. Around Insjövägen we got on to the official path again, which was very beautiful. From there it was very fast and nice to get to Norrtälje, and we arrived at noon, which was nice because we had time to enjoy the town.
We stayed in Berglings B&B, which was really nice. We ate at Looi sushi and Ed’s burger, and walked to the pier. In the morning we got ourselves more comfortable bike chairs at Cykelservice i Norrtälje. We also got knee elastic band for Yoav. Yes, we still suffered from the second day’s effort. We had a discussion whether we should come back home or even get a ferry to the final destination with the bikes and then get buses between the places we were supposed to stay for the nights until then. But we decided to give it another chance — and it was worth it, because the fourth day was the most beautiful.
It wasn’t supposed to be Mälby. It was supposed to be Wik B&B in Soderby-Karl, but a few days before the trip something happened and they cancelled all the reservations.
ResGladh found us a place further north, and we thought it’s going to be very tiring, but the road was really nice and quick, and there were four wonderful pauses on the way.
The first break we took was at a church in Roslags-Bro, which was pretty and re-charging.
The second is marked with (1) on the map was a really nice public bathing area with grass, sand and beautiful lake. There were a few people there except for us and it was also nice to see them because we rarely saw people on the paths in this trip.
The one marked with (2) was a coffee place we really enjoyed and also a cool store where I got lovely earrings and neckless, which made me feel much better :D.
The last leg of this day, marked with (3), was a big and nice surprise, cycling along a beautiful artificial canal.
And then we got to our night destination — Livsuniversitetet. This is a special place that we appreciated, and we were almost alone here, similarly to the situation on the second night. Lena Kristina helped us to settle down and then gave us a ride to ICA. She told us a little about this place and about herself — a pioneer psychologist who’d researched and developed methodologies around breathing. They have different retreats for groups of adults and youth. The farm is very cozy with a large kitchen and yoga room, and many secret fun corners.
In the evening we went to Ortala bathing park, which was amazingly beautiful with crystal clear water which were also too cold for us to get in.
Finally we were on our last cycling day. Feeling refreshed and excited about the rest day we planned to spend on Arholma, we started our way south-east.
We stopped at Barnens Ö for a short break, and then at Simpäs. We took the ferry in the afternoon after eating a delicious Thai lunch at the pier.
In Arholma there’s a small supermarket and a couple of restaurants that require reservation. We stayed at another STF hostel that was wonderful (and with lots of fun stuff for kids).
The best decision in preparing this trip was to take a resting day in Arholma. We toured the island, booked an hour at the sauna (private, including the water next to it), and had a really nice dinner at Arholma Dansbana. There weren’t many animals on the island, except for cows and tiny frogs. We were surprised to find a cold war bunker on the island that is now a museum with tours. The day after we hiked in the forest in the north, which was full with blueberries and linden berries, and then took a ferry back in the afternoon, a 4.5 hours trip directly to Stockholm.

There are three amazing things about Stockholm: its history, people, and cuisine. It is the capital of Sweden, a Scandinavian nation with centuries of heritage and thousands of coastal islands and inland lakes. Connected by more than 50 bridges and built on 14 islands, Stockholm houses 2.3 million people in its metropolitan area. It was settled during the Stone Age and was founded as a city in 1252. When I got the chance to visit, fueled with excitement and curiosity, I ventured on without knowing what was waiting for me.
My first stop, the Stockholm City Hall, is the building of the Municipal Council for the city. Famous for its grand ceremonial halls and unique pieces of art, City Hall is most well-known for hosting the Nobel Prize banquet each year. The guided tour is a must, and be sure to check out the Blue Hall (which is actually red), the Prince’s Gallery (with the mural pointed by Sweden’s Prince Eugen), and the Golden Hall (which is decorated with over 18 million mosaic pieces of glass and gold).
My next destination, the Royal Palace, was equally mesmerizing. The tremendous palace, built in the 1700s and painted pastel brown and yellow on the outside, holds more than 1,400 rooms. Even without a guided tour, the Palace still offers an irresistible chance for a taste of royal life. Two unique features of the palace which differentiate it from other grand palaces in Europe are the exhibition dedicated to royalty’s ceremonial outfits and a chamber furnished in 70s styles. Both share insight into the life and duties of the modern royal family.
One good thing about sightseeing in Stockholm is that a lot of the famous architecture and historical sights reside near one another within the city. Coming out from the backdoor of the Royal Palace, I was directly facing Gamla Stan, the medieval old town. Ochre-colored houses sit close to one another while busy restaurants, cafes, boutiques, and souvenir shops occupy the aged, cobblestone streets.
Just as I ventured into Gamla Stan, jet lag suddenly hit me. Unable to keep my eyes open and my body properly functioning, I needed a good, strong coffee americano to continue my journey. And that was when the “accident” took place.
“Can you pass me my wallet in the bag?”
“Yeah, sure. Just one second. But wait…where is my bag?”
“What do you mean, ‘where is your bag?’ You put it right under the table.”
“It’s not there anymore…”
After resting a bit in a small café in Gamla Stan, while going through the photos I had taken throughout the day, my mom and I noticed that our bag, which I had left under the table, had disappeared. Yep, that’s right, I lost the entire backpack on the first day of travelling. Deprived of wallets, travel documents, sunscreen, sunglasses, and basically everything needed for travelling, we were left with the one credit card that I had kept in my pocket.
Though upset at the situation, I was nevertheless surprised and comforted by the warmth of the locals. After hearing about what happened, the owner of the café ran out to comfort my mom and communicate with the local police. As I was running around the medieval alleys, circulating back and forth between fountains, statues, and small churches, looking into trash cans to see if our travel documents were at least thrown out, two shop owners sitting along the streets joined my search and started digging through the trash cans as well. However, our effort was futile in the end.
Frustrated and tired, we wandered aimlessly from Gamla Stan to the city’s central port. It was already around 6 PM, but the sunshine showed no trace of dimming, and it cast a golden tint over the entire cityscape. With an average height of five stories and a unified yellow-orange color theme, the buildings, which were mostly constructed in the 17th century, resembled each other in architectural style. Between the buildings, cobblestone paths ran across the city plane while locals immersed themselves in thoughts and conversations alongside the river.
Suddenly, upon spotting a group of people dressed in suits and gowns congregating in front of a tour boat, we decided to find out what was happening. One of the crew members explained that this was a weekly cruise tour that served fresh shrimp and seafood platters but also required a reservation at least one month in advance. Disappointed and ready to leave, we were once again surprised by “fate.” Another crew member who overheard our conversation called us back and told us that one couple had canceled their reservation last-minute due to an emergency, and that we could hop on if we wanted. Without a second of hesitation, my mom and I advanced.
After boarding the ship, we were welcomed by an ivory tablecloth, crystal wine glasses, and a sweet floral aroma in the air. The waiters soon seated us along the window and displayed the menu, which included shrimp scampi, salmon, and champagne. It was around 8 PM when the cruise sailed out of the port and started roaming gracefully through the islands during golden hours. Surrounded by fresh seafood, sunset, and nature, the lost bag was already out of my mind. From the reflective river, to the cottages hidden in nature, to the modern luxury apartments, everything seemed like an impressionist painting under the violet-blue infused sky.
Ever since I came back, I have been wondering what was so mesmerizing about Stockholm. What made me want to revisit again and again, even after my little “accident”? The answer is clear to me now, as I am recalling the memories and images in my mind: it’s the infinite possibilities one can encounter in this magical city.

Everyone will tell you eating out in Stockholm is expensive, but is quite manageable if think more about how locals eat. After exploring some great free activities, this part of the post will be more focused on the affordable eats :) :
As a foodie, I did not go all the way kebab and sandwich (like I did when I first traveled in Europe 10 years ago). You can also see my reviews about restaurant (actually, pretty affordable, even feel cheap from my Hong Kong perspective) and eating tradition (fika ❤) in my other post here with a map of restaurants that I ate at.
Lunch is the main meal where locals would eat out, and for a good amount of them, it is the main meal for them (eat more at lunch, and skip dinner… this reminds me of my parents). All-you-can-eat are actually not an uncommon option for them and available around the city and decent price (from SEK100 to mid SEK range if you’re eating during the lunch time; some places have discount for early diners).
We went to two all-you-can-eat and one of them we just love! (The other is very good for value, too).
As mentioned in Part 1 of this post, I found this place a heaven on earth! It has also come top in most of the (English) reviews. This is the first buffet where I could taste the difference in each dish and within each dish, each ingredient!
My brother and I are both picky eater, and it is the only place where we love everything (my brother hates pickle and I dislike beetroot in general, but we enjoyed them there). They do have some interesting combination of spices that I would not have thought about but turned out well.
My personal favourites are the lasagna (they made me break my low carb diet a bit), the curry and their BUTTER (I mean margarine).
Apart from great food, you can also enjoy a great view of the city from Hermans, they are pretty popular, so good luck in finding a good table.
After a day being a vegetarian, we went back to our meat lover mode. We went to another highly rated all-you-can-eat that specialized in grilled meat for lunch. Everyday, they will have 3 mains (on our day, it was beef, lamb meat loaf and fish). with a salad selection.
Taste wise I’d say it is not as flavourful as Hermans. However, you can taste the meat (it is not a rare thing here in HK where you can’t taste what you eat). I like all the 3 mains, but like the fish the most. Among everything there, my favourite is the grilled carrot and the mushroom sauce.
I read that the food is prepared from a charcoal grill. I honestly couldn’t tell, but then, they definitely deliver a good meaty, hearty lunch in the CBD at a low price.
For more options (especially if you wouldn’t mind Asian), you can take a look at this and this.
If a sit down lunch is a bit out of budget or simply out of time, you are lucky. Stockholm is a great place for street food with a lot of good roadside grills, food stand and food trucks offering American, Mexican, Middle Eastern food and more.
If you’re determined to look for the food truck, I will definitely recommend you to follow this article and download the apps. We did not do it, and have wasted like an hour’s time to search for truck that are not out on the day.
After one hours’ walking we decided to go for the stand. Our original pick was Nystekt Stromming; however it moved (damn you Google) and we did not know the new location was actually very close… (like across the bridge kind of close). Just walking across the bridge to the old town and you’re there.
Instead of walking across the bridge, we walked to the metro and went to Ostermalms Korvspecialist.
Although not our first choice, this small hot dog stand where chef eats did not disappoint. It has a generous amount of freshly grilled and tasty sausage, but the best part is the bread.
Unlike your regular hot dog, the bread wrap the sausage like a pocket. It makes it easier to eat and also easier to eat both bread and sausages together. The baguette is rightly toasted, very crispy on the outside and still soft on the inside (however much that’s left for the inside).
Another thing that I like about them is their sauerkraut does not taste too strong and would not overpower their sausage.
One hotdog is around SEK50–70, and is enough to feed one adult of reasonable appetite. The staff is quite friendly and I would recommend you to ask for recommendation.
Apart from the fried herring burger, some other fast food that I planned to eat but missed this time are kebab, kebab pizza and falafel. I will be back for you guys (waving)!
This one I can only contribute a little bit, as I did the research but didn’t try that our myself.
There are 2 types of food halls in the world — expensive one and affordable ones. If you go to a food court not because of price but the variety or experience, you could go for more upscale food hall like Östermalms Saluhall.
It might be a good idea if you are planning to buy some fresh food to cook at home.
For the rest of us who are looking for cheap in food halls, the following comes up in my research (in order of popularity):
Ok, if you are really on a budget, picnic is a great idea when the weather allows it.
There are plenty of beautiful green area and parks in Stockholm and you can leisurely enjoy your food in a park. Go for a cheaper supermarket and some of them, like urban deli, also have hot food for sale (if you don’t have anywhere to cook).
Essentially, afterwork is like happy hour, except that some bar would have a small (free) buffet of food. Check out the bars on your way!
For every city, there is definitely places that are affordable if you search for it. Generally, Middle Eastern food (check out my post on my Turkish dinner!), and Asian (which I did not take) would be cheaper. Bar maybe a good options, too. I had 1/2 kg of reasonably good mussels at around SEK165. Also, not to forget you always have your beloved IKEA as an option (although it’s a bit out of the way… who cares with the free shuttle?).
One thing I notice is that, do not follow Tripadvisor (and Yelp!) as most of the reviewers are from a few countries (unless you are their fellow country people), and most of the time, the price tag and review is skewed. I skipped all the results from Tripadvisor.
Another interesting find is Facebook does make decent recommendations! I actually discovered 2 of the places I like through them!
On to the next and last part of this series: how to get around Stockholm cheap (apart from walking and swimming).
Feeling full just from reading? You can also go back to the first part to take a look at all the free activities :)
Just to let you know, I relied on the following posts to gather idea on food :) :

Björn Ståhl, Founding Partner, Uncommon Stockholm said: “We will focus on brands that people in the real world are glad exist. These brands are uncommon and they can make a difference like never before. I’ve admired what Nils, Lucy and Natalie have been building at Uncommon for some time and we can’t wait to continue their impact and partner together in Stockholm.”
Natalie Graeme, Co-founder at Uncommon Creative Studio added: “Björn, Mia and Max have the perfect balance — they each bring a unique quality and their collective experience is impressive. They see the world the same way we do and match our ambition at Uncommon. We’re thrilled to welcome them into the fold and couldn’t think of better partners to venture into Stockholm with.”
Six years in, the studio continues to make awarded and stand-out work winning its first Grand Prix at this year’s Cannes Lions for its groundbreaking campaign with British Airways.
Notably work also includes creating the most recognised mental health initiative in the UK with ITV, to creating a globally infamous free suit hire initiative for H&M — The One Second Suit, to help young men find work, to redefining what the Nike Jordan brand means today launching during the 23’ NBA All-Star Weekend through the eyes of an aspiring female baller.
The studio has always believed in creativity — applying its founding principles of building brands that matter — acts rather than advertising. The studio has built successfully portfolios across experience, CX, design and production — with Uncommon producing its first feature documentary with renowned director Andrew Dominik for Nick Cave and Warren Ellis’ ‘This Much I Know To Be True’ premiering at Berlinale and SXSW and achieved critical acclaim including The Guardian’s Film of the Week as well as being listed in NME’s top films of the year. Its second feature ‘In Camera’ is in the running for Best First Feature at the upcoming annual BFI London Film Festival.
Though the Studio was set up with a clear point of view and purpose, it also wanted to explore a new business model. Rather than just working for clients, if the studio saw a concept that deserved to exist, it would back it. So far the studio has launched the world’s first fully compostable coffee capsule Halo Coffee, a sexual wellness brand SEX BRAND launching with the UK’s most sustainable condom and most recently Communion — a new money saving app on a mission to unlock the freedom associated with the act of saving.
Uncommon also invested in the purpose-driven accelerator Unrest — to support diverse and sustainable businesses. Since its launch two years ago, it has helped 47 startups, raising £7.2M with a total valuation of £110M.

( This piece started in February, finished in June.)
Day 34. It has been more than a month since the experiential heat in the Lion City.
I don’t quite miss home yet, but it’s long enough for me to see stark differences between both cities and culture.
Facial features. Architecture. Museums. Weather. Snow. Winter.
2. Transportation
Metro. Subway. T-bana. Pendeltåg. Train. Escalator. Reliable. Not reliable. like SMRT? And not everyone has a car.
3. Working culture
Fika means put down your stuff and gather for Coffee Break. Phone-usage is a no-no, Socialising is encouraged.Lunch is Lunch. Work is Work. Party is Party. Work-Life Balance. And we take out our shoes when we are in office.
4. Social norms
More reserved. Strangers rarely say Hi. Yet seemed nice after the ‘ice has been broken’. Cashiers are the friendliest.
5. Standard of Living
Singapore is expensive. Deal with it. Stockholm is expensive too (including student hostels). In fact one of the most expensive in Scandinavia/Europe. High taxation. High expenditure on food, drinks, party. Then again, their wages are high as well.
I have met a couple of Singaporeans who got married and settled/is settling in here at Stockholm. Their stories are pretty amazing.
The city is beautiful, Swedes/locals lead less stressful lives, welfare and happiness are never taken for granted.
Perhaps Singapore can learn more from them.If I do have some form of political/social power, I will attempt to change some things back home. Change, is the only constant.

Stockholm, basically a town that is built across little islands at the spot where the fresh waters connect with the salty waters, is, in a way, soaked to the bone with olden tales. That starts from those brave Viking settlers going on, through to big posh palaces plus tales about brave actions at critical times; the Swedish main town gives you that grabbing feel for times of old. Instead of plainly peeking around at sites — why not set out on an immersive day of delight taking one the various history-based days out that Stockholm has available. With many things to select, where should one begin, you could be asking? But don’t stress about this at all! I kinda made this brief rundown of great historical picks found inside Stockholm that, in a way, promises super good times will be had! Let’s ready that travel kit, step on way-back ride machines, let’s get the facts popping coming directly outta those really superb aged settings this grand locale stores carefully! Find the untold experiences of Stockholm simply visit Stockholm’s historical insights just for fun.
So a top choice whilst coming to check the cool times long ago stored in Stockholm definitely asks one see the Vasa boat gallery spot, too! That impressive building protects bits associated to Vasa which stayed surprisingly sound for getting the facts regarding that battleship sinking really fast since making her initial trip going back during 1628. What is rad pertaining that boat could possibly not even revolve ‘round great scales, let’s imagine skilled carvers instead that outstanding piece concerning conserving works after its rescue efforts occurred! Try sensing yourself taking time backwards plus sensing, too, specifically what took ground by taking warships reaching day break for awful occasions took possession. Seeing vast details becomes heart tugging. Certain group programs highlight key bits like politic schemes King Gustavus pushed forward since they also check ship design actions occurring as factors created wreckages plus sunken depths arose also. Give yourself space with watching special booths and rooms particularly renovated cottages or fun playing installations. By really saving change be wise looking at packages visiting all areas offered alongside some guided Vasa Museum tour.
“In every way gaspingly gorgeous! Okay I might have seen news around this one, I just never pictured real views arriving live this! Those specialists presenting, I believe spoke super intelligently and seriously produced vessel memories alive now that felt actually pretty awesome that date! High fives going their means for good experiences!” — Sarah M., History Lover
I tell you those advisors guiding through it basically pour over solid background with interesting tiny tidbits going directly adding charm once drawing images considering existences sailing by sea while onboard ships constructed throughout these days old. I kinda have this sneaky feeling you begin falling breathless as quality happens then also think humbled in knowing tragic ending of some naval thing meeting oceans however having sailed a mile basically; try sinking deeper alongside oceans heritage that instant. Next watch details like they concern themselves uponVasa shipbuilding legacy, hopefully increasing brains inside.
Just that little by slowly disappearing alongside the cuteness found scattered around this town named Gamla Stan basically an area Stockholm says the earliest chapters of lives occur across all these streets is possibly interesting when thinking of the things discovered in all those cool walks during a time of sunshine filled play that takes days really! Paths of rock go spinning close all sides amongst structure of long-lasting nature and paints looking lively inside shades combining that old style mustard yellow alongside reddish exteriors everywhere! That point probably makes something feel beginning directly now across where tales speak around marketers living long ago beside monarchs plotting also not overlooking turns concerning the events inside days of country of Sweden that is her homeland there, specifically now. Person leading usually starts slowly bringing everyone close while discovering alleys almost secretive inside some part, going with gardens unseen generally alongside some gateways never spotted solo now. I’m very very likely that a feeling passes where all footstep has knowledge on this land when that moment arises strolling beside that grand Royal build plus market center Stortorget then possibly not skipping this grand gallery place linked to a guy called Nobel, definitely! Try thinking of crazy trading happenings going wayyy down here across that district as carriages horse guided echoes resounded, hearing quietly all communications hidden. Dig close on past occurrences using this fantastic one to choose alongside me: ahistoric walking tour.
It is cool cause just above what sights pop at eye glance level this place beats full life basically; something seems alive inside that district while moments tick right across history’s grand clock that feels nice and something that might be needed across someone thinking where adventure waits generally; watch some very very cool settings when considering that journey. Know a wide array via a Gamla Stan sites then get shown across paths found created as a pattern thanks a guru showing those points! Basically give yourselves freedoms traveling far time where every uncovered bit plus gripping accounts show themselves out the earliest areas forming spots in capital of Sweden..
In order for a shift for what Stockholm stores by days from long previous: consider watching Sodermalm something pretty awesome discovered toward land reaching off through southern spots past that territory called Gamla. The setting has gradually transformed spanning times right from district reaching at laborers where right now hip elements shoot into show at boutiques created through owners individually or restaurant innovators! This time probably should work seeing together its past history and cool happenings occurring at current that everyone would go through. Next watch the place speak the story beside spots tourists watch plus take that route athidden gems of Stockholm and more.
FeatureBrief Talk Over Here:Times Older!Look out closely how previous times got formed alongside that location known also how events got switched spanning each age for information really?Cooler WaysSeriously taste all feeling known while there really that communities existing art besides some occasions at night having wild nature maybe?Artwork Design!View things that combine little tiny shelters built vintage style versus a few building towers or fun sketches seen through street roads you probably should understand!.Tastes!Really eat meals together those ones known plus various international type you’ve spotted!.
Then walk down avenues at places having good skyline views whilst tales about those big influencers appearing at that area begin sounding now! Maybe just maybe you’ll begin passing some very boho alleys known really also known toward the “SoFo”. Now after hard job hours became stories: one regarding transformation where today the site stores culture those two things make one say one thing “strength”. View way existences have expression inhistoric Sodermalm charm: what richness is being created upon her soil.!
I bet going off that loudness that forms the town and try taking trips going smoothly onboard moving river vessels is a brilliant way how someone visits”Drottningholm,” something awesome that world watches through a protection association!. This impressive place appears really like that district”Versailles” through parts throughout Stockholm that protects the king, as a normal event. View wide space insides but wander down to sweet outside spots whilst something big concerning heritage plays there. A few times those presenting moments bring up happenings belonging at crown persons around that location-parties seen here? Think super persons making places exist, as artwork and something adorning her style! See it there maybe alongside: Swedish royalty and you can do more..
Regardless if people grasp parts regarding royal persons around that spot or others liking forms formed inside spots plus a spot silent arriving by, land with those Palaces offer you moments remembered really! Next take moments guiding yourself where insights start becoming real upon palace grounds Stockholm since moments begin arriving over ground where events play regularly really really..
After reviewing these picks above; comes time we watch place making local residents feel Stockholm is “theirs” (sort off, kinda)? This thing there becomes a place they watch as local authority area still also a piece holding values throughout ground: how prizes that person “Nobel” gets will get honors in days occurring here at a moment year for year. Through showing moment tours occurring here? Through these times begin people watching space appearing huge or art-full or something appearing metallic too- scenes created through all through area as the mother territory stands, known as Sweden! Be open learning things in area- but look how area stands out as strong from plans throughout the long era since then too!!! For spots known building big from history try booking: Stockholm historic buildings ahead and maybe go now.
Making those memories here feels maybe nice through one thing: see those booking occurring containing spot climbing to great levels, too probably. Look up all round location where beautiful events might just knock feet from floor when something plays up there as one watches!
Now those people who begin that part (those tourists) in soil that keeps culture- then the colors looking so attractive becomes super in area they enter really then that moment really forms really awesome sensation. So after times getting big meanings next feelings form right on then next someone getting tours together feels maybe okay through seeingswedish national heritage really!?.

I take the blue line, change to the green one in T-Centralen, and go down in Slussen. I glance through the windows of the galleries while walking through Hornsgatan. I was planning to watch the sunset from the viewpoint at Skinnarviksparken but the weather is not on my side and by the time I get there, dark clouds fill the horizon. I sit down on a bench to watch the snowflakes descend.
At five twenty, I go down and walk along the empty sidewalk next to the water. At some point, it stops snowing and I decide to continue my stroll to Gamla Stan, the old city in the center of Stockholm. The view of the Kungsholmen shore is gorgeous. It has been about a year and a half since the last time I passed through here. One gets too caught up in the routine and life goes by fast.
I continue walking to Rådhuset to take the blue line back home. By the time I am halfway, the dense dark clouds completely erase the lights of the Södermalm district. I can barely see the tower of the Stadhuset next to me. A blizzard covers the city on a white veil. My footprints don’t last more than a few seconds and I stop several times to clean the ice from my glasses.
I finally make it to the blue line and I am back in the warmth of my room a few minutes later. The snowstorm continues outside as if it was to last forever. I sit down in front of my desk and find refuge in the pages of my journal.
I like to write. I have been compiling journals for fifteen years. I write to put my thoughts into words and bring structure and clarity to my mind. I write to immortalize my memories, my beliefs, my stories. We are storytellers after all. We need stories to communicate, to give meaning to the world, and to make sense of our existence.
I leaf through the soft ivory paper of my journal and realize how the last months have been embedded into just a few pages. In contrast, when I go further back to my time as a traveler, several pages are needed to capture a single day of wander: the things I do, the places I visit, the colorful streets, and the different tastes and aromas of a new city, and the conversations I have with the people I meet. Paragraphs pile up and my hand write deteriorates as I rush to capture these experiences before they are altered or, even worse, forgotten by my fragile memory.
I look through the window as the ephemeral snow particles dance to the sound of the wind. I don’t want my days to go by helpless, at the mercy of the wind of life. I fear the moment I wake up and realize that decades have passed and I am still the same person.
I think about Memoirs of Hadrian, a novel by the Belgian writer Margarita Yourcenar. On his deathbed, Hadrian writes a letter to Marcus Aurelius, his future successor. The text recounts the wisdom the Roman Emperor has accumulated throughout different episodes of his life. Particularly, Hadrian declares that there are three ways to learn about human existence: through our own experience, through the experiences of others, and through books.
As a travel enthusiast, I cannot help but relate Margarita’s words to traveling.
By traveling, we leave behind our comfort and dive into the unknown. We expose ourselves to different environments and diverge from our beliefs, values, and prejudices. By traveling, we interact with the people we meet. We engage in conversations and dive into their stories. We learn to see the world through their eyes and add their experience to our own. By reading, we travel to different narratives. We learn from the stories of those who lived in distant times. We are entrusted with their stories to make them our own.
And yet all these perspectives remain incomplete. We see the world from the narrow lenses created by the conditioning our environment has provided. Even books carry the prejudices of the pen. Nevertheless, a rich life is born out of the combination of these incomplete stories.
Life is about feeding our stories through new experiences, rich conversations, and good books that change our narratives. To lead a life that cannot be reduced to just a few pages.

Stockholm, Sweden….A few weeks ago I hopped aboard a plane and headed to Sweden for the weekend. The truth is that Sweden has never been high on my wish list radar, as a destination, so I just have been skipping it year after year. However, living in Poland, Sweden has a huge advantage as a holiday destination. It is located so close to my homeland that it is easy to visit. I only need to cross the Baltic Sea and I’m there. The plane tickets to Sweden are usually bloody cheap … if only the weather there could be better.
Weather is always a strange thing. Every time I visit the Polish coast and look North, it seems that Sweden has better weather, as there are usually no clouds on the horizon. But the reality is far different. The weather in Sweden is cold and windy most of the year, except in summer. I didn’t want the Scandinavian weather to deceive me as I booked my ticket. I hoped that the sun would have mercy on me and would appear in Sweden during my stay. Sure enough, the weather had its way! I left sunny Poland and landed in quite a cloudy Sweden. During my stay, the sun tried to defeat the clouds but failed. My consolation was that it did not rain.
My motto is “like the places to which you travel and appreciate that you can visit them, no matter what”. Seems to me, as a traveller, that we should want to go everywhere and find something interesting anywhere. Consequently, I always try to see the best in each country I visit. Before going to Scandinavia my number one wish, while there was to experience the fjords! But that’s in Norway. Thinking which Scandinavian city would be my number one choice, I had a feeling it would be Stockholm. Now, after returning home, I can confirm 100%, that to me, Stockholm is absolutely the number one city in Scandinavia.
Nordic cities in my opinion are hit or miss. You love or hate them. They don’t have many landmarks, are very expensive and at first glance, they look just boring. Nordic cities such as Oslo, Helsinki, Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Reykjavík share one thing in common. They are coastal cities. I usually love cities bordering on a body of water, as a relationship with water adds a whole new dimension to city life … and Stockholm has lots of water!
People say that Stockholm is the Venice of the North. The city is spread out over 14 islands, that are connected by 57 bridges, with an eye towards my beloved Baltic Sea to the East. There’s something incredibly soothing about almost always having water in sight and that makes Stockholm a nice destination to explore on foot. It is pleasant to stroll when you are never more than a stone’s throw away from the water. There’s so much water everywhere that sometimes it seems like there’s more water than land. Hence, it may seem that there are more boats than cars, in the city. They are moored to the shore and sway on the gentle waves.
But such a picturesque location has also cons. A few times I found it slightly annoying to not be able to get somewhere, located just a few meters away from me, just because there was no bridge exactly where I needed it, and I had to walk around a channel, that made the way much longer.
All in all, I think that water is what makes Stockholm charming. It makes the air feel fresher and clearer. Waterworks for Stockholm especially when the day gives way to the evening. Sunset in Stockholm is a magical time. It is so nice to be near the water when the sun is setting and see Stockholm in its magic hour.
The second thing that struck me the most about the city was the colour. Everywhere, from the gems of the Old Town to more modern architecture, colour seems to be present on every surface. I think that the colours are Stockholm’s heaviest weapon against gloomy and cloudy weather. There is no logic or scheme to the colours of buildings, as they would have never been treated as a wholeness, but as individuals.
It’s more expensive than Paris and London, but it’s not as expensive as people expect. I spent most of my money on food. I’m glad that I had a hotel breakfast at the price of my room because going out for a meal more often than once a day would have ruined my budget.
The silence in Stockholm really hits you when you arrive. The cars seem to move in a silent mode and there is almost a hushed feeling everywhere.
Sweden’s capital city is a 700-year-old European city. It attracts many visitors each year looking to experience Sweden’s largest city, however, there were fewer tourists than I expected. Thanks to that Stockholm has a very relaxed feel. There are not many people on the streets and sometimes it seemed to me, that I had Stockholm, just to myself.
The city has an atmosphere that is very calm compared to other European capitals. Perhaps it is the people living here. Most Swedes seem patient and quiet. Maybe it’s because there are so many open spaces and of course water. Maybe it is because of the history felt in the air. Or maybe because the buildings are so colourful and in some way, they force you to stop and stare at them. Maybe it’s all of this put together…..

I just got back from my two-week trip across most of Northern Europe. This is my third trip back to Europe. (My first was a summer abroad in Italy nearly 8 years ago and my second was another two-week trip in 2014 where we explored Dublin, London, Amsterdam, and Paris.) I daresay this was the best so far! Thom and I visited Stockholm, Copenhagen, Berlin, and again, Amsterdam this time around. In order to share our experience and to create a living record of its details, I’ve decided to write across a few posts on each city and its adventures. This first post serves to detail our overall travel plans, information on flights/places to stay, tips on light packing, and general advice for good travel. I should mention that I’m not an expert on any other these things but it’s worth sharing the little knowledge that I gained before, during, and after this trip.
To begin with, here are a few starting facts about our trip:
Let’s begin by discussing budget flights. Nine months before this vacation even happened I found some non-stop flights from Oakland to Stockholm for $600 a person. These flights kicked off the entire trip and made everything possible. I recall the very first time I ever flew to Europe. (Which was 8 years this summer!) It was to Genoa, Italy from Buffalo, NY. That flight had three stops (Buffalo to NYC, NYC to Frankfurt, and Frankfurt to Milan) and one train (Milan to Genoa) in order to get to my destination with a total of over 20+ hours at a hefty price of $1500. (Thanks Aer Lingus! 🖕) So to come across a flight that was only 10 hours and non-stop to my choice destination, it felt like fate...
Doesn’t that last sentence feel so inspiring? Statements and facts like those are the gold and shiny wrapper on the cheap bar of travel chocolate. Here’s the nitty-gritty of budget flying:
With some of the add-ons and extra taxes, our $600 tickets actually came to $711.30 a person. Our in-between flights from city to city were around $50 a person. (As compared to a train from Berlin to Amsterdam which was $120 a ticket.) In the end, you have to deal with the minor annoyances for that 💰deal.
Let’s move on to transportation.
Thom and I took public transit for the most part. (I’ll discuss the bicycling and Uber rides a bit later in some of my city posts.) For us, it’s a fun challenge learning a new city’s public transit. And unlike American public transportation, European public transportation is fast, convenient, and very, VERY reliable. Upon arriving at the Arlanda Airport, which is located just outside of Stockholm, we took the Arlanda Express Train that runs directly to the city center in just 20 minutes. (As compared to my 1.5 hour MUNI and BART trip to Oakland International Airport. 😑) Out of the four cities we visited, Berlin boasted the fastest and most reliable transportation (dat German innovation) with Amsterdam coming in at a close second. (Trams, trams everywhere!) All the trams, trains, and buses that we took were clean and clearly marked. My only complaint was the summer heat which was especially felt in the enclosed and non-air conditioned trains.
I plan to discuss each Airbnb in detail for each city post but in general our decision to use this service came from a few points:
Finally, let’s talk about packing. Much like my last Europe trip, I took a single backpack and personal bag with me. That was it! Now that this trip is over, I can say, quite proudly, that it was the best decision that I made for packing. After each city we visited, Thom and I both got a little better at packing our bags. It was a very efficient way to travel, IMO.
Here are some pros:
I admit that there are some cons involved with this kind of packing. While I can pack a mean bag, it doesn’t exclude the fact that the weight gets to you…no matter how light. If you’ve ever landed at an airport and took public transit into a city, the transfers mean a lot of walking between terminals and stations. The weight of the bag can cause a lot of stress on your neck and shoulders. Even this year, I packed a bag that weighed about 8 lbs total and after a while, say 20 minutes of walking, it can really push down on you. I should mention that my bag isn’t meant for hiking or true backpacking and therefore isn’t super ergonomic. I’m sure if I had chosen a small hiking backpack, my experience would be different. The bag that I took is just an everyday backpack for commuting which is why long walks with a lot of weight can easily become a small burden.
Backpacking can also force you to make some crucial decisions as to what you pack. One small error (should I bring a bathing suit?) and you’ll be forced to carry that item throughout the entire trip with much resentment. The last time we were in Europe, it rained for most of the trip. Thom brought an umbrella this year. He never needed it! 😂 🙃 Lessons learned.
A few surprising things that we did bring this year are:
I’ve only really traveled internationally in the summer months so packing has always been dictated by the warmer weather. I took mainly dresses with a single pair of jeans and shorts. A few shirts to mix it up and a hoodie with a jean jacket for cooler evenings/days. I took a pair of black flats since they’re so versatile and my Keds for comfort as I walked/biked everywhere. I kept toiletries to small sizes and bought anything else that might have run out.
Thom and I failed to exchange any currency prior to the trip. But I would recommend making that order with your bank if possible since ATMs abroad will charge you a fee for any withdrawals. Also, make the obligatory call to your bank letting them know that you are traveling abroad so that they don’t lock your card and account.
A kind co-worker provided us an extra SIM card and we had another already from past trips, so this year we both had data/service for our phones. Thankfully our SIM cards were both purchased in the Netherlands with Vodaphone. These cards worked in all the other countries we visited and we didn’t need to purchase new cards along the way.
Finally, I’ll add that we obtained Global Entry prior to the trip. It made entering the US very easy and fast when going through customs. If you are a frequent international flyer, consider getting Global Entry. Global Entry includes TSA PreCheck. So if you fly around the country frequently (which I do), it’s very convenient and handy for jumping those long security lines.
This post is a part of a series based on my recent two-week trip to Europe.

3C for describing Stockholm: cold, cool, culture. Its historical background, architecture, fashion, style, traditional foods, and of course ABBA, all make it so cool! It can be also called ‘North Venice’ because of the 14 islands.
We went to Stockholm by Flixbus departed from Copenhagen. It was night and long ride, besides I spent the night awake because of my flu and I really terrified about the journey. The road was empty without lightning… Also, our bus was moving fast. Uh, terrifying…
We started the city tour with Riddarholmen Church which has a thousand years of history.
We sat on the benches around the church, watching Stockholm architecture.
We watched the iconic Södermalm view. Like a postcard…
Gamla Stan: best for the time traveling…
Narrow streets, yellow colors, cinnamon smells… It makes me feel like I am in a different zone.
Me and my friend exploring the city by walking, climbing hills and from the beginning of the city tour, we constantly arguing about which city is better… Copenhagen or Stockholm? We are counting the pros and cons. However, it is an inconclusive debate. After wandering around the Gamla Stan’s old streets, another debate… Does it look like Florence? Then, we are sitting on a bench watching the Baltic Sea, talking about how can we do more efficient things, and be successful in our aims. I guess, this is Stockholm energy. Not syndrome… but this city has effects on people.
I ticked eating Swedish Meatballs in Sweden and going to Ikea in Sweden off on the bucket list. It was the first time I’ve eaten meatballs with sweet lingonberry jam (it was great). I also had Kladdkaka, Kanelbulle and irrelevantly, fortune cookies. All of them were delicious…
We passed through the Øresund Bridge which is so impressive, like diving into the middle of the sea. We are surrounded by only blue: sea and sky. Furthermore thanks to our Flixbus Driver, he was playing the Swedish Eurovision song: Loreen — Tatto. It was pretty unforgettable for me since I listened to this song hundreds of times and never thought I would be listening to this in the main country. (I know the photo is not very good, but I recorded videos and enjoyed the moment.)
Overall
Stockholm is so suitable for a student budget. I was expecting extreme prices, but I was wrong. Especially the souvenirs’ and Ikea’s food prices were acceptable. I want to visit Stockholm again with a rich budget and at that time I must stay at least 3 nights, attend to Stockholm Ghost Walk and Historical Tour, go to the Skansen Open Air Museum and ABBA Museum, appreciate subway art, go to Birka the Viking city, having Fika in a warm, cozy place with enjoying the Northern snow.
Regards, Ozlem.

To be honest, I wasn’t too pleased when I saw the temperature in Stockholm was going to be -5 degrees celsius. But I’m not one to turn down an opportunity to experience different cultures and meet new people. The view from the plane window pretty much confirmed that I was in for a cold couple of days. Sweden from the sky was pretty much blanketed in snow, with forests, motorways and buildings adding speckles of colour to the pure white landscape. Stockholm’s temperature was as expected — FREEZING — but admiring the beautiful architecture as we walked to the office made me temporarily forget this fact.
One of the great things about using Slack at Manifest is how it renders borders immaterial. It’s not perfect and working in different time zones does present its challenges, but being able to meet up with a colleague in a different country and pick-up where you left off on Slack is a great plus.
We like to believe everything is better in Sweden, and while that’s mostly true (I say mostly because the weather ain’t better) I have to say, the coffee machine at our Stockholm office is straight out of Star Trek. To hell with cafetieres and capsules, this baby uses an iPad touchscreen to brew you some of the best tasting Americanos I’ve ever had. We need to figure out a way to set one up in London too. It might even make me do a tea round….once or twice.
Our short time in Stockholm was spent darting from meeting to meeting. We had a couple of new business meetings interspersed with meeting existing clients. I’ve got to say, the half day we spent with Houdini was probably the most inspired I’ve been in my five years at Manifest. It’s not often you sit in a room where everyone is extremely passionate about what they do and where they want their company to go. I’m proud to be working with such a visionary brand, and you can bet you’ll hear a lot more from them in the coming months.
I cannot write a blog about Sweden without mentioning delicious Swedish meatballs and aquavit. Aquavit (literal meaning: water of life) is an important part of Scandinavian drinking culture. We were treated to a Swedish folk song by Anna and Josefine before downing a shot of the drink. Much to the surprise of the Swedes, Alex and myself did not seem at all perturbed by the 37% ABV beverage. We both have strong constitutions, and attempting to drink us under the table is never wise.
After meetings were done, I had the opportunity to explore more of Stockholm over the weekend- it’s truly a stunning city, one I hope to be visiting often… during warmer months.
Manifest has offices in Stockholm, London and New York and we’re recruiting. So, if you fancy joining our international family check out our careers page.

I belong in a gang of 4. Four colleagues, friends and something more than that. Anna, the 1/4 of our gang, spent (and she still has a month there) this semester in Stockholm, Sweden, as an Erasmus student.So the rest of us decided to visit her, have some fun all together in Stockholm and discover this Scandinavian city.
I have tons of stories to tell you about that trip, so I’m gonna keep it simple and write about the most important stuff in bulletpoints and also post along some photos we shot so that I give you a better understanding of what was going on.
A typical limo you see in Stockholm
With Faviana, in Greetify HQ
Finally, I have to say that it was an awesome trip overall! Of course this was special for my and my mates, because we were all together, but I bet you’re gonna love this city no matter what!

I’m a US expat living in Stockholm since 2018. Originally lived in central Stockholm, now living in the burbs. A co-worker once asked me for tips on what to do when they were coming over for a visit. I typed up something, and later another and another person asked, each time I pulled up the old doc, and maybe made some additions. On the most recent instance of this, I realized I could probably just publish this for anyone to find.
If I had to narrow it down to 3 easy things, I’d do Moderna Museet (free), Fotografiska (~$20), and a walk through Gamla Stan.
Quick list of things to do:
Museums:
Sightseeing:
Restaurants:Swedish food
Really good sushi
Mexican
Steak
Choose Uber over cabs when in the city (seriously might be faster to take a scooter though 🙃). If you must use a cab only use these companies: Taxi Stockholm 150000, Taxi Kurir, Sverigetaxi. Most of the others will rip you off (my wife got charged $50 for a 8min ride). For getting from the airport, the Arlanda Express is a direct train to central stockholm, that only takes 18 minutes; you can buy the tickets online or at the airport, and you get a big discount for buying them as a group. A cab to/from would be ~30-40min depending on traffic.

Designing with AI: Reflections from a Night with Miro’s CEO in Stockholm,https://medium.com/@ajithachellam/designing-with-ai-reflections-from-a-night-with-miros-ceo-in-stockholm-c5e94f35b368,"Sign up

On Tuesday, 24th of June I attended an intimate fireside chat in Stockholm with Miro CEO Andrey Khusid, alongside Armin Catovic (Head of AI at Aloi and Vice Chair at Stockholm AI) and Elena Verna, Head of Growth at Lovable. Andre spoke about creativity, product leadership, and what it means to build with purpose in the age of AI. This blog is my attempt to capture that moment: for myself, for other designers navigating similar questions, and for anyone trying to make sense of where we’re all headed next.
“It’s a dance. A dance between humans and AI.”
I liked how Andrey used the word dance and not collaborators. It blew my mind when Andrey introduced the new AI features of Miro and introduced this concept of Canvas as a prompt.
“Some of us think in text. Some think in tables. Some in images. Some in handwriting. AI can translate between all these formats.”
It made me reflect on my own process. How often do I get stuck on one way of seeing things — one visual, one narrative, one iteration. This new dance invites us to explore the edges, to try “what if” scenarios we might not have considered. That’s not just productivity. That’s power. It’s not about outsourcing creativity. It’s about augmenting our intuition with speed, synthesis, and scale. And maybe, just maybe, creating space for more meaningful work.
This night wasn’t just about Miro. It was about the larger wave of transformation pulsing through the city, and one of the clearest signals of that was from Lovable. It was exciting to hear from Elena Verna about how Lovable as an entire company is AI-first, not just the product, but the tooling, workflows, culture, and even mindset.
They recently ran a weekend hackathon where anyone could use Lovable’s tools to build with three major LLMs. More than 2.5 million people created something just in a weekend. It was a strong message to startup founders to scale to the top. And simply, people are looking for a simple and easy product when it comes to digital experiences. Lovable is simple and people love it.
And perhaps that’s what makes Stockholm special right now: it’s not just building tools; it’s building momentum. Hmm, what a great time to be here at the center of tech innovation!
When I was working on the book Catch the Feeling, we discussed a lot about ‘sameness’. With AI-generated content, there is a general play of sameness in designs, products and content that is out. With this thought in mind, we had a question from the room,
What happens when everyone uses the same tools, the same AI models, the same prompts? Will we all just end up building the same thing?
Andrey replied,
“What makes the difference, is human empathy, point of view, and taste.”
It can accelerate your process, suggest alternatives, and synthesize patterns, but if you don’t show up with a strong perspective, it’ll just give you more of what everyone else is getting. In a world of infinite output, originality comes from the courage to have a point of view. Being human!
My friend Jaydatta is doing his Master's Thesis about decision making in Swedish startups. We were having a brief discussion about his findings and how actors and factors influence a major decision in a product. Later in the evening, MIRO CEO touched on his decision-making and leadership style.
“I was scared of adding complexity. I didn’t want to overwhelm the user.”
His vision in 2011 was to build the first browser-based whiteboard, and he kept the product as simple as possible. Andre shared how his leadership style had shifted over the years.
From top-down decision-making in the early days, to bottom-up ownership where teams shaped features based on user needs. He held back a key feature, not because they couldn’t build it, but because he believed simplicity was more important. But when the pandemic hit and MIRO was used heavily, he made a drastic shift, focusing on synchronous collaboration.
And now, as Miro matures again, they’re returning to a model where teams can own and shape their areas. But what stays constant, Andre said, is the need for a strong product vision, otherwise, you end up with 25 products inside one. This was a really powerful insight.
There was a question about what are the emerging skills and the right mindset to survive in a transitioning face in tech.
“The companies that thrive will be full of T-shaped people. Those who go deep in one craft, but also know how to connect the dots across disciplines and prompt machines to get the job done.”
That means being a designer who understands marketing. An engineer who thinks in UX. A PM who can sketch a landing page, run a prompt, and launch it in hours. And increasingly, these people won’t be full-time hires. They’ll be fractional experts, brought in for short bursts of high-impact work.
Lovable is already ahead of this curve. With under 50 full-time roles and revenue approaching $100 million, they’re proving what’s possible when AI augments the builders and everyone is trusted to own more.
Andre even predicted something that caught the room off guard: “Compensation will look different. In a few years, the same job title could pay 5x more to the person who brings exponential impact.”
Not because of tenure. But because they know how to leverage tools, think across domains, and ship value fast. The more impact you create in the company, the more compensation!
With big giants in the picture, someone asked a question,
“What if OpenAI builds your product tomorrow and destroys your business?”
Andre simply smiled and said something that brought a lot of hope and smiles in the room.
“We’re not building because we think OpenAI won’t do it. We’re building because we love what we do.”
A truth that often gets lost in metrics, frameworks, and the pressure to always be future-proof. It reminded me that the joy of creation doesn’t disappear just because the landscape changes.
“We might all be a little f**ked,” Andre joked, “but we’re in it together. And we’re still building.” And that, to me, is what this night in Stockholm was about.
Hope it inspired you too, dear reader. Connect with me on LinkedIn to follow my journey.

After many years of choosing busy beach destinations for our summer holidays, this year we decided to embrace the ‘coolcation’ trend and look for an alternative holiday focusing on cooler climates, scenic landscapes, and opportunities for relaxation and mental wellness. If you are also seeking this kind of holiday, then Stockholm should top your bucket list.
Stockholm, the capital of Sweden is a city that beautifully blends innovation, with its rich historical charm. The summer season truly accentuates its allure with extended daylight hours, festivities, nightlife and a bustling ambiance.
We visited Stockholm in June and were fortunate enough to experience some fantastic weather. We chose to stay at the Grand Hôtel, strategically positioned along the waterfront, providing views of both the Royal Palace and Gamla Stan. It served as an excellent base for us to explore all the city’s attractions, the highlights of which are listed below.
What impressed us the most, coming from a Mediterranean country, was the Scandinavian phenomenon of long days. The sun stays up until late into the evening, creating a sense of endless daylight and extending the feeling of a truly prolonged holiday.

The Incredible story of the Vasa and the lessons it teaches us,https://siddharth-ram.medium.com/the-incredible-story-of-the-vasa-and-the-lessons-it-teaches-us-9d7070d5d328,"Sign up

On 10th August, 1628, the Swedish navy launched the maiden voyage of the Vasa .The Vasa was part of the military expansion and an expression of Swedish naval power: It was explicitly built at the order of the King of Sweden Gustavus Adolphus, and was richly decorated to show off Swedish might and wealth. No expense was spared. One of the rooms was made to look like the royal palace. There were numerous Roman statues on board, — King Adolphus was sending a message that ‘hey, Sweden is the modern Roman empire’. Upon completion, it was one of the most powerful armed vessels in the world.
August 10 was a calm day, perfect for a launch, with a light breeze from the southwest. It passed the Royal palace, and the gun ports were opened for a Royal salute. When doing so, a gust of wind -nothing crazy — filled its sails and it heeled to the port. It passed some bluffs to the south (Södermalm, for those familiar with the geography). A little later, at Tegelviken, a stronger gust caused it to again heel to the port side — and went past the point beyond which the ship could right itself. The gun ports were open because 1300 meters past its launch, the Vasa sank, and about 30 people died (it included women and children as well, since it was a ceremonial trip around the harbor). It took all of 5 minutes to sink, and a major reason was the lower gun ports were open and water poured in as it heeled. But more on this later.
The Vasa lay on the bottom of the Stockholm harbor for 333 years, before it was successfully raised and the Vasa museum captures its stunning story of mismanagement, in a fashion eerily similar to mismanagement as seen in some modern software companies. I was lucky enough to have a tour through this museum while on a work trip to Stockholm. I would visit Stockholm again just to go back to the museum (though Stockholm has so much to see and do)
The Vasa’s story serves as a powerful metaphor for modern software companies, particularly in how organizational dynamics can lead to technical disaster. Just as Vasa’s builders continued with a fundamentally flawed design due to royal pressure, software teams sometimes proceed with architectures or technical decisions they know are problematic due to executive mandates or market pressures. The tragic part of Vasa’s story is that it was known that it was unlikely to survive its launch. In 1628, the captain arranged for the Vice Admiral to demonstrate its stability. 30 men ran back and forth across the upper deck, and the ship started to roll. The Admiral stopped the test because he was afraid the ship would capsize in the harbor. Does this sound familiar to anyone?
Consider how often we see software projects that are “too big to fail” — platforms or products that have had so much investment and executive attention that stopping to address fundamental issues becomes politically impossible. Like the Vasa’s gun ports being open for a royal salute (a political requirement) directly contributing to its sinking, we often see technical compromises made for business optics that ultimately undermine the product’s stability.
The parallel extends to modern engineering organizations where technical experts — much like the shipbuilders of the Vasa — might recognize fundamental flaws but feel unable to effectively raise these concerns up the chain of command. In both cases, the culture of deference to authority and the pressure to deliver can override technical wisdom. Today’s “royal demands” might come in the form of arbitrary deadlines, feature requirements that compromise system stability, or architectural decisions made to align with executive presentations rather than engineering realities. There is a tendency to ‘drift to failure’ in organizations that show up only when it blows up in their faces.
Most tellingly, just as the Vasa’s builders had proven experience with smaller ships but ran into trouble when scaling up to a larger, more complex vessel, software companies often face challenges when scaling from successful smaller systems to more complex platforms. The same principles that worked at a smaller scale can become catastrophic liabilities when applied without adaptation to larger, more complex systems.
This is a standard practice in product development (my writeup on it can be read here). Well, certainly at every place where I had influence over the process. It is entertaining to turn the 5 Why’s framework on the Vasa to get to root cause: King Adolphus was furious, of course, and the loss of his statement piece, and the loss of the many cannons that were on the Vasa (2 gun decks that can be seen in the photo above — it had 64 cannons). There was a royal inquiry, and no one was found guilty — it would be foolhardy — deadly — to point the finger at the king, who was responsible for the tragedy.
So what would the 5 Why’s for the Vasa look like?
The ship capsized and sank about 1,300 meters into its maiden voyage in Stockholm harbor on August 10, 1628. A light gust of wind caused it to heel (tilt) severely to port. Water rushed through the open gun ports, which were only 1.2 meters above the waterline, flooding the ship and causing it to sink within minutes.
The Vasa was dangerously unstable due to its top-heavy design. The ship carried 64 heavy bronze cannons, mostly on the upper gun deck. More critically, the ship’s ballast (72 tonnes) was insufficient to counterbalance the weight of the upper structure, guns, and heavy decorative sculptures. Stability tests before launch showed the ship was dangerously unstable — it heeled severely when just 30 men ran from side to side.
Despite shipbuilder Jakobsson noting the stability problems during construction, and despite a stability test where the ship dangerously heeled, no significant changes were made. Admiral Fleming, who oversaw the test, feared reporting the full extent of the problems to the king. The shipbuilders and naval officers knew of the issues but proceeded with the launch anyway.
In Swedish society under King Adolphus, challenging royal authority was unthinkable. (Note: This is of course not particular to Swedish culture). The king had personally ordered multiple changes during construction, including the second gun deck and additional heavy bronze cannons. He was deeply involved in the design, viewing the Vasa as a symbol of Swedish naval power. No one, including the shipwright, dared question the kings demands.
Sweden in the 1620s operated under absolute monarchy where the king’s word was literally law. King Adolphus had transformed Sweden into a major military power, leading successful campaigns in the Thirty Years’ War. The hierarchical culture of 17th-century Sweden, combined with the king’s reputation as a militant leader, created an environment where professional expertise was subordinate to royal authority. There was no cultural framework for “speaking truth to power” — the concept itself would have been alien to most 17th-century Swedes.
The fundamental issue was a cultural environment that prioritized deference to authority over technical expertise and safety concerns. This cultural dynamic made it impossible for technical experts to effectively challenge decisions that compromised the ship’s safety, even when they recognized the dangers.
The tragic irony is that Adolphus, despite his direct involvement in the ship’s design changes, never saw the Vasa — he was away on campaign in Poland when it sank. The culture of absolute deference to royal authority operated even in his absence, preventing necessary corrections to a fatally flawed design.
Well, that is the Vasa. And we have many modern day examples. I’d love to hear about your experiences!

Stockholm. A city I had heard of since childhood.
I associated its name with major international agreements, particularly the Stockholm Declaration of 1972 — the very first large-scale world conference to make the environment as a major global issue. It marked the beginning of international environmental governance and laid the foundation for what would later become the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This conference shaped the world’s approach to sustainability and climate action, yet I never imagined that one day, I would walk its very streets where such historic discussions took place.
Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would experience this city firsthand. It still feels surreal that I am here.
What struck me the most when I arrived was the contrast — the weather, the atmosphere, the way of life. Coming from Indonesia, where temperatures soar to 35°C with high humidity, adjusting to Stockholm’s crisp air and freezing winters was a challenge. Even in summer, I find myself trembling while Swedes enjoy the sunshine in shorts and tank tops. The shift from tropical heat to below-zero temperatures was an entirely new physical adjustments and rhythm of life.
But despite the cold, I fell in love with this city. There is a sense of calm, an unspoken rhythm that blends modernity with nature. Stockholm moves at its own pace — not too fast, not too slow.
And then, there’s Fika — the Swedish tradition of taking a break over coffee and pastries. At first, I thought it was just a casual coffee break, but I soon realized it’s much more than that. It’s a moment of pause, of connection, of simply being present. In a world that constantly pushes us to be productive, Fika is a reminder that it’s okay to slow down. This ties into something else I admire about Sweden — their emphasis on work-life balance. Here, taking a break is not seen as laziness but as an essential part of life. People respect their time off, and there is an understanding that rest is just as important as work.
The other thing that fascinated me was the language. The moment I heard Swedes casually chatting in their melodic Swedish, I felt a strange excitement. It was unfamiliar yet intriguing.
But, beyond the language, what truly inspires me about Sweden is its commitment to sustainability. Swedes don’t just talk about being environmentally friendly; they integrate it into their daily lives. Recycling, efficient public transport, and waste reduction are not just trends but ingrained habits. It’s no surprise that the world’s first environmental conference was held in Stockholm in 1972, leading to the establishment of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).
One of the biggest realizations I had was about landfills. My perspective on landfills was shaped by what I had seen in Indonesia, where waste management remains a major challenge. Landfills there often emit a strong odor, appear overwhelming, and lack proper handling. But here, it feels different — the landfill doesn’t smell as strong, the area is well-managed, and waste is systematically processed.
I also learned a lot about organic waste. If we truly want to combat climate change, organic waste should never end up in landfills. Food waste releases methane, a greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide. This realization made me see how small actions — like composting or waste sorting — suddenly felt much more significant.
Living in Stockholm has made me reflect on many things. It has challenged my habits, reshaped my mindset, and broadened my perspective. I’ve learned to embrace silence and to enjoy solitude without feeling lonely. I’ve come to appreciate the power of simplicity — how less can be more and how slowing down can actually bring more meaning.
Nonetheless, this is just the beginning of my journey in Stockholm.
— Fingers crossed for what the future has in store! ❤

Report of the Go Global Mission to Stockholm (25 - 28 October 2017)
As an entrepreneur, it is important to broaden your perspectives and keep an eye out on the world, even more so in this digital world we live and work in every day. Hence, I was very excited to join the Go Global Mission to Stockholm, an organization of startups.be and Jong VOKA Oost-Vlaanderen.
Sweden has been an inspiration for me ever since I became involved with technology and startups. The country has an impressive track record: after Silicon Valley, Sweden has the highest number of unicorns per head of population in the world. Iconic companies like Skype (sold to Microsoft), King (the maker of Candy Crush, IPO), Mojang (the company behind Minecraft, sold to Microsoft) and Spotify (you know Spotify), have all been founded in this Nordic country.
How is this possible? What are the reasons behind Sweden’s overwhelming success? Is this story future proof? 3 days in the country’s lovely capital Stockholm would provide all the answers.
A 2 hour flight from Brussels led us to Bromma, a cozy airport about 20 minutes from downtown Stockholm. Hard to imagine this is the main entrance to a European capital where so much value has been created over the past decade.
First stop on our trip was the Stockholm Fintech Hub, a huge co-working space located conveniently above Stockholm’s central train station. Besides the fancy decoration, I noticed a couple of interesting things here:
Off to a good start!
Our visit to Invest Stockholm gave us a lot of insights on the success of Stockholm. The seeds of the Swedish tech boom were planted in the 90s, when the government subsidized the required infrastructure for the digital age.
First, every household in Sweden was granted a personal computer. Every successful tech entrepreneur of today grew up with a PC! Digital natives avant la lettre.
Second, almost every household in Sweden has fiber internet access. Hard to imagine in Belgium, where to this day the public and private sector are still arguing who is going to make the required investments.
It is clear that government initiatives in the nineties have laid the foundations for the incredible success of the past decade.
The impact of these exits cannot be underestimated. As often happens with successful entrepreneurs, they do not rest on their laurels. After selling Skype, Niklas Zennström went on to found Atomico, now one of the most famous venture capital firms in Europe. Same goes for the founders of King with their fund Sweet Capital.
As a result, there is plenty of capital available to invest in promising startups that might become the unicorns of the coming decade. Success often creates even more success. The future of the Swedish tech ecosystem seems bright.
Some (fun) facts about Sweden:
Day 2 started with the highlight of our trip: a visit to Spotify. The music streaming service has over 50 million paying subscribers and is valued at 16 Bio USD in the private markets. Even though it is still making a loss, it is reportedly preparing its long-awaited IPO for somewhere mid 2018.
Spotify is one of those iconic tech companies of this age. The company, led by the enigmatic founder Daniel Ek, has proven to be an exceptional innovator on multiple levels:
1) Business model innovation: in the wake of illegal P2P networks like Napster and Kazaa, Spotify sought to find a legitimate way to revolutionize the music industry.
2) Technical innovation: the secret sauce to Spotify’s early success was the incredibly fast loading of songs. This was an engineering challenge of enormous size and difficulty. The majority of people at Spotify are still deep tech engineers working to make sure load times stay at this amazing level, even at such a huge scale.
3) Organizational innovation: much has been written and said about Spotify’s organizational model. The concepts of autonomous teams (grouped in squads, tribes & alliances), the agile way of working, the flat organization, … have been widely documented and copied by other tech startups. Many attribute the success of Spotify to this special culture of continuous experimentation and improvement, cultivated by the founders from day 1.
It will be very interesting to see what happens to this culture when Spotify goes public. Not making a profit yet, investor pressure might force it to tighten reigns and start cutting costs.
Later, we paid a visit to Detectify, whose founder notoriously hacked Google and got access to a huge amount of customer data. He received a bounty of 10.000 USD and went on to start a successful company in ethical hacking.
I arrived at the hotel at around 10 pm. Having some energy left in the tank, I put on my running shoes. I really enjoy jogging in big cities. Since there is always something new to discover, you hardly notice you are running after a while.
I ran to the Gamla Stan island where I accidentally bumped into the changing of the guards routine at the royal palace. Quite hilarious and way over the top if you ask me!
This run wasn’t only for sightseeing, though. Last week, I decided I am going to run my first marathon in 2018! There you go, the word is out, no coming back to it now. I couldn’t really miss the second training on my schedule, right…
Day 3 started at Klarna, another Swedish unicorn, active in online payment processing. A couple of years ago, it also received a banking license. We got a presentation about the major branding exercise this company had undertaken earlier this year. The result was fascinating: from a dull banking brand to an extravagant colorful identity. Klarna wants to be a bank focused on the consumer’s experience, not on its own payments product. It definitely stands out in its sector with this bold and brave move I can only applaud.
Next stop was the Goodbye Kansas Gaming Studio. Stockholm has an enormous amount of talented gaming engineers, resulting in big hits like Minecraft, Candy Crush Saga, Angry Birds 2 and a host of other console and PC titles. We were told the long dark nights might have something to do with this.
Final stop was at EQT Ventures, one of the top tier venture firms in the Nordics. EQT Ventures is owned by Sweden’s wealthiest family, the Wallenbergs. Over the past century (!), the Wallenbergs have accumulated an enormous portfolio of global industrial players, including Electrolux, Atlas Copco, ABB, SEB, SKF, … to name a few. Add Volvo, Scania and IKEA to the Sweden’s list and you get a sense of how many successful international corporations this country produces. Same goes for its music industry: ABBA, Roxette, Ace of Base, Europe … and more recently Avicii, Robyn, Swedish House Mafia. Due to the small internal market, anyone aspiring a big entrepreneurial or artistic career just has to move abroad as soon as possible.
EQT Ventures is the venture capital firm of the Wallenberg conglomerate. Besides funding (with its 565 Mio EUR investment vehicle), it also offers active guidance to its entrepreneurs (growth, engineering, marketing,…).
EQT Ventures invests in scale-ups that have reached product market fit and about 100k MRR. It sweet spot investment size is between 8 and 10 Million EUR.
EQT gave us a demo of their internal data processing tool called Motherbrain. This platform gathers all publicly available data on technology companies (e.g. Crunchbase, Pitchbook data,..) and enriches them by adding trends in social media activity, number of followers, press coverage, … EQT believes this gives them a competitive advantage in discovering promising startups earlier and getting into deals faster.
4 startups had the opportunity to present their company:
The trip ended with a nice dinner in the city center of Sweden’s lovely capital.
My key takeaways from this Go Global Mission to Stockholm:
Looking forward to getting back into the action at Hyperlane on Monday, fully energized and inspired by 3 awesome days.

This is not just a political reckoning. It is a personal one.
I come from survivors — not only of the Holocaust itself, but of the moral disorientation it left behind. My father escaped Nazi Germany on the last Kindertransport to London. He later carried messages between generals after landing on Normandy Beach, speaking the languages of both the oppressed and the empire. My grandfather survived by finding refuge in Sweden. My lineage is braided with escape, resilience, and silence.
And now, I speak to honor them. To wrest history from the hands of fear.
To advocate for a universalist, justice-rooted Judaism in today’s climate is to invite pushback — from within our communities. These pushbacks do not always come from cruelty. They often come from heartbreak. They come from those who believe they are defending Jewish life, when in fact they may be protecting Jewish trauma from healing and perpetuating animosity worldwide.
To walk into this conversation, we must understand the language of fear — not to be manipulated by it, but to meet it with truth.
Here are five of the most common arguments used to reject a Judaism of shared humanity and prophetic conscience. Then we will reconstruct the machinery of propaganda as it is deployed, in order to disarm it with truth. Then a short and printable “pocket guide” to help us return to our core teachings.
They are not caricatures. They are cries. And if we are to become the choosing ones — not merely the chosen — we must listen with clarity, respond with compassion, and never forget: Again and again and again, Never Again must mean never for anyone...for everyone.
Let us begin where our ancestors survived — but refuse to end there.
Understanding the counterarguments made by fear-based ethnocentric voices — particularly those within Jewish communities that resist universalist interpretations — is essential for both refining your own position and preparing for meaningful dialogue.
Here are five of the most common arguments used by fear-based ethnocentrists to dismiss or dismantle the kind of covenantal, universalist Judaism I advocate:
1. The “Survival First” Argument
Claim: Before we can worry about others, we must secure the survival of the Jewish people. We are always one catastrophe away from annihilation.
Key Points:
Response:
This argument exploits trauma to justify ongoing preemptive dominance. It conflates existential threats with political criticism and flattens time, as if Pharaoh, Hitler, and any current dissenter are interchangeable. It demands eternal victimhood even when Jews wield state or institutional power.
2. The “Particularism is Not a Sin” Argument
Claim: Every nation puts itself first — why should Jews be held to a higher moral standard?
Key Points:
Response:
This argument deliberately ignores that Jewish ethics — rooted in Torah, prophets, and rabbinic tradition — do demand more. It erases the prophetic voice of justice. It also neglects the fact that being a light to the nations (Isaiah 49:6) is not optional in Judaism — it’s core.
3. The “You Don’t Understand Realpolitik” Argument
Claim: Your argument is philosophically interesting but politically dangerous. The world is not a yeshiva or a seminar. We must protect ourselves with strength, not sermons.
Key Points:
Response:
This response uses cynicism to neutralize ethics. It assumes power and moral courage are mutually exclusive. In reality, prophetic leadership has always been a countercultural phenomenon. Moses, Isaiah, and Heschel all spoke into power from a place of moral clarity, not political comfort.
4. The “We Tried Peace, It Didn’t Work” Argument
Claim: We gave land for peace. We made offers. We withdrew. And what did it get us? Rockets. Stabbings. Terror. You’re asking us to endanger our children.
Key Points:
Response:
This is trauma talking — but selectively. It collapses decades of failed diplomacy, settler expansion, and blockade into a single defensive narrative. While security is valid, it cannot be divorced from justice — and justice requires that we confront the history we created, not just the history done to us.
5. The “Self-Hating Jew” Accusation
Claim: Jews who criticize Israel or prioritize universal ethics over Jewish solidarity are internalizing antisemitic narratives. You’re aiding our enemies.
Key Points:
Response:
This is emotional blackmail disguised as community protection. It conflates dissent with betrayal. In truth, ethical critique is an ancient Jewish tradition — from Abraham arguing with God to Jeremiah lamenting corruption in Jerusalem. To speak truth to Jewish power is not betrayal; it is fidelity.
If one were trying to design a manipulative, propagandistic narrative in support of a fear-based ethnocentric worldview, one would need to activate collective trauma, moral inversion, and identity loyalty. The goal is not truth, but emotional certainty, enemy construction, and justified power.
Here are 10 potent narrative devices — some are outright lies, some half-truths, and all are repeated enough to feel self-evident.
They may sound familiar.
1. “We are the eternal victim.”
No one has suffered like us. No one ever will. We are history’s permanent target.
2. “They all want to kill us — again.”
Scratch any critic, and you’ll find a hidden antisemite.
3. “Survival justifies anything.”
If we don’t do this, we won’t exist tomorrow. That’s just how it is.
4. “Our power is only defensive.”
When we act, it’s because we were provoked. When we strike, it’s because we had no choice.
5. “There are no civilians among them.”
They are all complicit — every man, woman, and child. They elected terrorists. They cheer death.
6. “We already tried peace. They spat in our face.”
We offered everything. They gave us rockets. What more proof do you need?
7. “Anyone who criticizes us wants us destroyed.”
You say ‘human rights,’ but you mean ‘our extinction.’
8. “We are the West’s last line of defense.”
Support us, or terrorism wins. We are your moral outpost.
9. “We speak for all Jews.”
If you oppose us, you’re not one of us. You’re self-hating or brainwashed.
10. “History has absolved us.”
After what was done to us, we’ve earned the right to do whatever is necessary.
Repetition and Ritual
These ideas are not just said. They’re:
The Manipulation Goal:
Make it emotionally intolerable — even existentially traitorous — for someone to:
In case you want to have a conscious way to reject manipulation here’s a pocket-sized pamphlet — concise, powerful, and portable — designed to interrupt propaganda in real time and rekindle moral clarity when fear-based ethnocentric messaging is heard. Copy and print it and put it anywhere you want to remain a thinking and feeling human being, grounded in Judaism's highest teachings.
Spotting Propaganda. Reclaiming Conscience.
WHEN YOU HEAR:
“We’re the eternal victim.”
ASK YOURSELF: Is this invoking history to justify current harm?
“They all want to kill us.”
REMEMBER: Fear paints everyone an enemy. But fear is not truth.
“Survival justifies anything.”
TRUTH: Freedom without ethics is just a new kind of Pharaoh.
“They don’t value life like we do.”
DANGER: That’s dehumanization. The oldest lie used to justify violence.
“We tried peace. They gave us terror.”
PAUSE: Did we try peace — or control disguised as peace?
“Everyone’s a terrorist over there.”
FACT: Blanket blame is genocide’s gateway.
“Critics are antisemitic.”
NO. Ethics ≠ hate. Dissent ≠ betrayal.
“We’re defending civilization.”
WATCH OUT: That’s colonial language. That’s empire talking.
“We speak for all Jews.”
YOU KNOW: No one speaks for all of us. Judaism is not a monolith. Never was.
“History has absolved us.”
NEVER. No past horror gives license to inflict one.
INSTEAD, REMEMBER:
“We were slaves in Egypt…” Not to become Pharaohs, but to never be one.
“You shall not oppress the stranger…” Not once — but 36 times. That’s covenant.
“We are not free until all are free.” That’s Judaism at its best. That’s how you know.
Carry this not as a weapon, but as an anchor. So when fear speaks, you remember:
“Justice, justice shall you pursue.”
(Even when it costs. Especially when it costs.)

This is my 28-day journey of living a temporary life in Helsinki, Tallinn, Stockholm, and Copenhagen.
🇸🇪 August 4, 2019
It’s very lucky to have a friend who lives in Stockholm. Jimmie was one of my classmates when I was in San Francisco. He is a writer and a freelance journalist. After leaving San Francisco, I’ve kept in touch with him on Facebook. And luckily I had a chance to visit Stockholm and saw him again.
Thanks to Jimmie, I could visit a beautiful island, Vaxholm in Sweden. It is not far from Stockholm, but it is not easy to get there by public transportation. We went outside of Stockholm by car, arrived at a town with a small dock, and waited for a public ship that moves cars from islands to islands. Because there are no bridges between islands in some places, so the ship plays a role as a bridge. We got on a ship, crossed a bay and got to Vaxholm.
Vaxholm looks like a small town in the countryside. It was a military fortress in the 16th century like Suomenlinna in Finland, but now it is one of the tourist attractions for hiking, camping, or just relaxing. We stopped by a small cafe and had Swedish Fika(coffee) and cinnamon rolls. They tasted really good. We looked around the island by driving and walking.
Vaxholm, this is the place that I have been looking for!! A calm and peaceful place. There are some stores for convenience but not many. There are some people, but it was not crowded. I can go hiking, sailing, fishing, swimming or camping. Or I can just take a walk along the coast. It’s the best place to relax. I wanted to stay more, but I should go back to Stockholm for tomorrow’s new adventure. I just left my heart in Vaxholm.
The more I stay, the more I like Sweden, maybe more than Tallinn. Sorry, Tallinn.

At first glance, it looked just like any suburban street in Sweden. The houses were similar; compact but well-designed with sharp corners and adorned with perfectly manicured lawns. The sidewalks did not have a crack in them and the cars parked next to it were modestly luxurious; not flashy Ferraris but rather fully accessorized Audis.
As we rounded a corner, we came into a small outdoor shopping complex akin to an American strip mall but without the decadent vibes. There were a multitude of real estate agencies, including Skandia Mäklarna, showing off the latest hot properties on the market with pools and staggeringly high prices on the corner of the posters.
The local branch of Handelsbanken was closed but its ATM seemed to be functioning, although nobody lined up because cash is essentially extinct as far as Swedes are concerned. A hip brunch spot — the type where you overpay for a cortado, complain about it but continue going to be seen — was also already closed but we noted it for our next breakfast.
On the other end of the complex was a small independent supermarket called Spisa with…

Thinking about traveling to Stockholm? Here’s the only guide you’ll need to avoid the notorious taxi scams that have tripped up even seasoned travelers.
I’d like to say I’m a savvy traveler, with 35 years of globetrotting experience under my belt.
I know the usual tricks — check prices online, avoid unsolicited “cheap” rides, stick to the designated taxi zones, and confirm the fare in advance.
I had done my homework, read all the guides, and felt confident about getting around Stockholm safely.
But what should’ve been a routine taxi ride quickly turned into a high-stakes lesson in navigating travel scams.
The moment I stepped into that “official” taxi queue, I had no idea I was about to become the latest victim of a meticulously organized setup.
I’m sharing my story to help you avoid the same trap and keep your Stockholm adventure as memorable as mine should have been.

Stockholm is arguably one of the world’s most beautiful capitals. It is built on 14 islands around medieval city center and is located where the freshwater Lake Mälaren flows out into the Baltic Sea. Stockholm is the most populous city in the Scandinavia, with 2.2 million people living in the metropolitan area. Running in Stockholm is a treat, given the water, unique geography, and well laid out pedestrian and recreational paths. The Stockholm Marathon is claimed to have one of the most beautiful marathon routes in the world.
The best running routes in Stockholm are defined by scenic paths along the waterfront, across bridges to the islands, and some lovely green spaces. We also have some routes that combine some of the main Stockholm sights with some pleasant parks and urban highlights. Stockholm has an excellent public transportation system consisting of bus, tram, local train (pendeltåg) and subway (tunnelbana; look for a T-sign).
One of the defining elements of running in Stockholm is its latitude. In summer, running late at night is a particular treat due to 18+hours of daylight. In winter, Stockholm makes up for short days in part by providing good lighting along most of its paths. Despite its northern location, Stockholm has relatively mild weather compared to other locations at similar latitude, or even farther south — receiving more sunshine per year than Paris or London, but also precipitation on about half the days through the year. It can snow from November to April, and winter running will likely involve snow or ice so bring your Yak-Traks. Summers are mild but rarely warm. You’ll almost always need an extra later for morning runs, even in July.

5.5-mile loop. Accessible any point in downtown. MAP
This route covers some of the main sights of the city, with lots of folks out walking and running. Much of the route is along the water and over bridges to two islands. Start your run at Gustav Adolfs square, next to the Royal Opera House. Head to Gamla Stan (Old Town) and pass Riksdagshuset where the Swedish Parliament is situated, as well as, the Royal Palace — His Majesty The King’s official residence. Enjoy the views of the idyllic Gamla Stan while you run south towards Södermalm island. Head west along the waterfront all the way to Långholmen, which is a former prison island, and currently one of Stockholm’s green oases. Cross the bridge to Kungsholmen island and head back east. You will pass another main sight, Stadthus (City Hall), which is also the venue of the annual Nobel Prize banquet. Complete the loop at Gustav Adolfs square.
7.2-mile loop. Access: several subways or buses to Slussen stop. MAP
Södermalm, or Söder as locals call it, is an island in south Stockholm. The vibe in Södermalm is relaxed and trendy, and it was selected as the coolest neighborhood in Europe by Vogue magazine in 2014. Running a loop around the island is a treat. Start your run at Södermalm market square which is easily accessible by public transportation (Slussen stop). Head west and enjoy views in Montelusvägen — a walking path looking over the waterfront to Kungsholmen. Continue further west and climb to Skinnarviksberget, a hill offering another breathtaking view over the city. Run to waterfront and make a loop around the island. Probably the most scenic parts of the loop are a path from Tantolunden in the west to Eriksdalsbadet in the south, and northeast area of the island when you run along the waterfront with Gamla Stan on your right.
5.2-mile loop. Start: Djurgårdsbron Bridge. Access: Bus 76 from downtown. MAP
Djurgården is a green and idyllic island close to central Stockholm, offering a beautiful setting for running. Its official name Kungliga Djurgården means Royal Game Park and it is one of the most popular recreation areas of the city. Start your run at Djurgårdsbron bridge and head east along the canal all the way to Lilla Sjötullsbron bridge. Cross the bridge to south and enter Djurgården island where you will pass scenic green areas and several historical buildings and monuments, the Vasa museum, art galleries, and the popular amusement park Gröna Lund. In the interior of the island is Royal Djurgården, which has gravel, more forested paths that can be a nice add-on.
8.1-mile loop. Access: bus 515 MAP
Hagaparken — a lovely green park about 5km north of the city — is a popular running destination any time of year. The park offers several scenic running paths. The best option is to make a loop along around Brunnsviken lake. Hagaparken is Sweden’s purest version of an ‘English park’, and the surrounding area contains three royal palaces. Probably the most famous building is Haga Palace where Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden, and her husband, Prince Daniel, Duke of Västergötland, moved shortly after their wedding in 2010.
5.6-mile loop. Access: any bus, tram or subway to Central Station MAP
Kungsholmen is a residential island where also the most prominent building of the Stockholm skyline and the venue of the annual Nobel Prize banquet, City Hall, is located. It is also another great running location. A good option to start your run is near Central Station. Head south and you will see Gamla Stan on the other side of waterfront. After passing the City Hall, continue west along the waterfront. Other highlights are a beautiful park called Rålambshovsparken and the inner city beach Smedsuddsbadet on the south side of the island, and Hornsbergs Strand on the north side. Most of the run is along the water.
Hellasgården is a nice recreation area offering several running trails in the woods and along the Källtorpssjön lake. It is located about 20 minutes by bus from downtown Stockholm — take bus 401 from Slussen to the Hellasgården stop in Älta. There are also excellent refreshment possibilities after your run, or options for a sauna or enjoying a sandy beach. See our 5.1 mile route here. Some of the trails have lights but note that in winter season, some of the trails are kept clean from snow while others are used for skiing, thus not suitable for running. See additional information here.
Stockholm has a wide selection of hotels in the downtown area and all of our iconic routes are located within a few mile radius. To have a fast access to the Stockholm Highlights loop, Djurgården and Södermalm routes, look for hotels in Östermalm and Gamla Stan areas. If you want to stay closer to Hagaparken route, then the Vasastan is a good option. It is still very close to Central loop and Södermalm routes, but a bit further from Djurgården. In addition to big international chains see also the following options:
Radisson Blu. Chain of well equipped hotels. Several locations in downtown.
Scandic. Another chain, several locations in downtown.
Nordic Light Hotel. A nice hotel with great location.
Runner’s Store is the biggest running specialty store in Sweden. Located downtown.
Löplabbet is another running specialty store with knowledgeable staff.
XXL. Price-driven big box retailer which has disrupted Scandinavian sporting goods retailers recently. One location in downtown on Hamngatan, another in Bromma airport.
Asics Flagship Store located in downtown on Hamngatan
Run With Me Stockholm offers a variety of private guided running tours covering main sights and attractions of the city. Has free group runs, too.
Stockholm Running Tours is another group combining sightseeing and running.
Nike+ Run Club offers several group runs to runners of all speeds.
Hash House Harriers is a Stockholm chapter of this globally spread “Drinking club with a running problem”. Meets every Wednesday night and every second Saturday afternoon for running, beer and fun.
Stockholm Frontrunners is running and walking group for LGBTQ people and their friends. Meets every Tuesday for group runs.
Stockholm Marathon is the main marathon race in the city, taking place annually late May or early June. Consists of two loops around the city and the finishing line is located on track of the Olympic Stadium.
Stockholm Half Marathon. September. This race has been in its current form since 2007 but its roots date to the 1920's.
Midnattsloppet. August. The “midnight run”, is a 10k race which has been run in Stockholm since 1982. As the name suggests, around 20,000 runners hit the streets of the city after the sunset. The same event is organized annually also in Malmö, Göteborg and Helsinki.
Women’s Health Half Marathon is the biggest half marathon exclusively for women in Europe. Offers also a possibility to run as a pair and split the distance with your friend. Website available only in Swedish — to learn more in English, contact whhm@marathon.se

Who do so many employees fall in love with their companies and practices, even the most terrible ones?
If you’re not familiar with Stockholm Syndrome then you’ve either never been held captive by an agile cell of fervent evangelists, wielding a full set of colourful whiteboard markers, in the company boardroom, you’ve never encountered a technical problem so difficult that you considered bailing out doing a PMP¹ course instead, or perhaps you’ve never had the financial pressure to keep a job you absolutely hate.
And, fellow player in the Grand Game of Software Engineering, even if you did, I have total faith that you wouldn’t give in to your captors.
You see, it’s survival of the fittest out there on the board — meaning it’s those that are technically competent, don’t have a strange love of garments woven from man made fibres, and those who know that management means having an irreversible frontal lobotomy (with a laminated certificate to prove it) and inevitable crossing to the other side of the board that will survive.
We all encounter those that have been summarily brainwashed every now and again in the Grand Game. Whether they’re seen to be repeatedly donning company merch unnecessarily², whether they spend their time organising (i.e. micromanaging) others unnecessarily, or just won’t have a word spoken against…

Stockholm syndrome is often defined as when a hostage develops an empathetic psychological connection with their captor. The reason this happens (as clearly, the hostage is the victim) is that the hostage subconsciously figures out, as seems reasonable, that if they are nice to their captors, they will receive better treatment in exchange. And that’s true.
An easy reference to this is the trope of the “Uncle Tom” in African American slave life during American slavery. During American slavery, certain slaves were mentally trained that if they accepted their slavery, and willingly worked with their master, they would receive better treatment in exchange. And said slaves bought into this, and cooperated in exchange for said better treatment. The African American community now refers to such slaves as “Uncle Toms”.
I propose that the process by which Stockholm syndrome sets in subconsciously, is a tool that ministers of faith use consciously to trick those in their congregation into becoming ardent followers of their own supposed volition.
I’ll explain. When a person enters a church community, they are usually doing it simply for the community at first. A community is a small society. And the smaller the society, the more socialist the society. This is why socialism works well in small countries. The…

My trip started from Turku to Stockholm via the Viking Glory, which is a cruise ferry that runs between Turku-Åland and Islands-Stockholm. Before arriving in Stockholm, I strongly recommend buying a Go City Pass (Stockholm Pass). It includes 50+ attractions, ranging from Museums, Skansen, and Boat tours. You can buy a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5-day pass from SEK 824 (71 €) to SEK 1,899 (162 €) — depending on the validity period. Once you bought the pass, download the Go City app, and you can show the QR code to attractions that are included in the pass to explore the city.
The Go City Pass includes: (More on the official Website) 📱
…
⚠️Not all the attractions are open all year round, for example, the Drottningholm Palace was closed from December 11th — December 30th, 2023, so you may not be able to get in if you go there during the Christmas Season. Same for the Stockholm Winter Tour by Boat, of course, it is only available during the winter season, but there is another boat tour available at other times of the year as well. (I highly recommended the Winter Boat Tour 🛥️)
💰Compile attractions that can be accessed free by the pass in two or three days to save money.
Note that the Go City Pass does not include public transportation unlike the Oslo Pass, so please remember to buy Travelcards if you want to explore the city without limitations. (You can get a discount if you are over 65 years of age, a student holding a Swedish student ID, or if you are under 20 years of age😊). The Travelcards are available on the smartphone app “SL-Journey Planner Ticket” and you can get on the tram, subway, bus, or commuter train within the validity period. 🚌
When you hop on a bus, you need to show the code to the driver, and you need the code for the subway (Marked as Ⓣ) as well. However, for the tram, you can just simply hop on and off!
I would say the subway and the tram are the most common transportation that I used during my stay.

By MATT PUSATERI
Five years ago, my brother sent me a link to a YouTube video. “This is awesome,” he texted. When I clicked it, I was baffled: it was a clip of a song-and-dance number on a football field from Fox’s series Glee (2009–15).
I didn’t get it: why he loved it, or why he was sharing it with me. After all, this was my brother — a first-born, take-charge, cut-the-bullshit engineer, and he really, really wanted me to see a clip from Glee? Maybe, I thought, he accidently pasted the wrong link?
What I didn't appreciate back then was that he was living at home with two teenage girls. He was outnumbered three-to-one by women. His view of the world, pop culture, and entertainment was distorted day after day to the point where he didn’t realize what had happened. He was a victim of Parental Stockholm Syndrome.
Classic Stockholm Syndrome refers to “a psychological phenomenon in which hostages express empathy and sympathy and have positive feelings toward their captors, sometimes to the point of defending and identifying with the captors.” It was inspired by a Stockholm bank robbery in 1973, during which hostages inside the bank gradually came to defend the criminals who took them hostage.
Parental Stockholm Syndrome is the same thing, except instead of being victims of a bank robbery held at gunpoint, it applies to parents held captive to shows like Glee as well as TV channels like Disney Junior and PBS Kids.
This is a real condition. I know, because I suffer from Parental Stockholm Syndrome.
I've actually said these things in the past year:
If I didn't live with two little girls — ages seven and five — I wouldn't be able to distinguish Periwinkle, a brave Winter fairy, from Rosetta, a plucky gardening fairy with a classic Southern accent. I also wouldn't have strong feelings about the sharp decline in the writing of Dora the Explorer (2000- ) after season two. And I never would have walked around the gym humming to myself the national anthem of Enchancia.
You can resist, but it’s inevitable. When you become a parent, you don’t just bring children into your world; they pull you into theirs.
Try as I might to get them to love things I love — DC Comics, Chicago-style pizza, Texas Hold’em, and North Carolina basketball — they want me to sit with them and enjoy the things they love: Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood (2012- ), Pinkalicious, and almost any movie about mermaids.
I might fight it, clinging to the adult world I left nearly eight years ago, struggling to maintain the illusion that I'm not captive to the passions and imaginations of two little girls. Or I can sit back, let go, and allow myself to tear up when Rapunzel is finally reunited with her parents at the top of the castle.

So, I realise as I write this that my last blog post was about an ECR event at the University of Stirling, arranged by the British Society of Gerontology’s Emerging Researcher’s in Ageing group (ERA). Ironic then, that I am writing this blog post in a former prison in Stockholm, on an ERA Writing Retreat at Långholmen!
The writing retreat, which I’ll write up in a separate post, was scheduled for Wednesday to Friday, so my brain quickly went into planning a research trip around it. Who might I be able to speak to at museums or universities in Stockholm about my research and practice at the Fitzwilliam Museum? And what might I learn about Nordic practice? I did some desk-top research, wrote some emails, and before I knew it, I had conjured up a plan for a research trip! And again, I was visiting a place I hadn’t been to before, so this was exciting…
Arriving on Saturday afternoon, I was able to spend the weekend strolling around the city (which was freezing!), being a tourist in a new city. I took an archipelago boat tour on Sunday morning, followed up by a visit to the Vasa Museet — the museum that I was told was one not to be missed! It was here that I was reminded that I am now unable to visit a museum without stepping into research mode…
The museum is vast — with many floors, and a lack of clear navigation route. Whilst the ship itself (if you’re interested in the story, you can read more on the museum’s website) is impressive, I felt immediately overwhelmed, not knowing where to start, or where to go. I found myself looking for somewhere to sit!
I saw a station where you could collect a map (which was available in numerous different languages), as well as clicking on a QR code to access a FREE audio guide. A map on the wall showed the location of all the stories in the audio guide, which was helpful (although they were not shown on the paper map which you carried with you). I looked around me, and found a theatre style set of wooden steps, where I could sit, look at the ship, and listen to the audio…
The audio was quite interesting, but then I quickly became frustrated by the imitation waves that were added in for effect. Time to move on!
There were lifts, but often with a group of people already waiting, so I chose to use the stairs. I found it quite confusing to navigate my way around, and it was too dark to read the map, so I stopped trying!
The museum is very interactive, with a wide variety of displays, ways to engage, and a LOT of information. I realised I was finding the displays a bit overwhelming, and so decided to focus on the ship itself — actually, as I write this, it’s probably how I usually navigate a museum. Focus on the object of interest!
This was the start of my trip, before I even intended to be focused on research. I’ll add further blogs to this series (links to be added, as I write them):

This is not your romantic cruise! But a beer-soaked “The Love Boat” episode ala Viking style version with hard liquor and long parties.
We decided one weekend to celebrate family birthdays on the ferry trip from Helsinki-Åland-Stockholm. Two good, highly competitive lines, Viking Line and Tallink Silja, the Tallink Silja Viking Line connects Sweden’s capital with Finlands.
We took the Silja Line Promenade for 1–4 persons plus breakfast and grande buffets for each person during the trip. The promenade room is located in the middle and offers a view of the boat’s hallway.
In my honest opinion, Tallink Silja is more upscale and Viking Line is the less expensive one but also a popular one. The Helsinki to Stockholm cruise or vice-versa has a 2-nights and 3-day cruise and is one of the popular ferry trips.
For Finnish people, having a ferry ride from Helsinki to Stockholm is just as common as having a train ride between cities. One of the most popular routes between Sweden and Finland is the Stockholm-Helsinki ferry.

This article originally appeared on Confessions of a Boy Toy
Stockholm is a truly magical city. This spring, we traveled to Sweden’s capital to experience the fairy tale magic for ourselves. From getting lost through the cobblestone streets of charming Gamla Stan (Old Town) or boutique-hopping in the city’s super-hip SoFo neighborhood, Stockholm has enchanting surprises at every turn.
Here are some incredible places you’ll be delighted to stumble upon shall you find yourself in Stockholm.
The clothes and furniture at Grandpa embodies everything we love about the SoFo district: Casual, super-cool and contemporary, despite its name. Grandpa focuses on highlighting Scandinavian fashion and furniture designers with a reputation for making things that are eco-friendly and sustainable, with materials sourced locally, organically or through fair trade.
Another quintessential SoFo shop, Coctail is like a Pedro Almodovar movie that’s come to life. No wonder it’s so popular with film location scouts. While most of Stockholm is still enamored with minimalism, this tiny shop aims for “maximalism” — everything here is just the most, from the luchador masks, the Dia de Los Muertos figurines, the Frida Kahlo mugs, and other colorful, authentic trinkets shipped from Mexican street vendors.
Located in Gamla Stan since 1864, E.Torndahl is a tiny, family-owned boutique featuring the work of local Scandinavian designers and artists. Here, you’ll find fascinating gifts in the form of jewelry, wallets, metallic hair-trimmers shaped like exotic birds, coasters with a bearded man illustration, a portable phone charger shaped like a river rock, and more.
Photography lovers should spend an afternoon — especially if it’s raining — perusing Fotografiska, a for-profit center for modern photography. This place is not afraid to exhibit controversial and provocative photos, so make sure to wear your open-minded goggles. During our visit, we saw work by African artists Samuel Fosso and Rotimi Fani-Kayode, as well as a special exhibition on French fashion photographer Bettina Rheims.
There’s no inch of Stockholm that’s not drenched in history and culture, even down in the subway. The city’s public transit system is said to be the world’s longest art exhibit, with 90 percent of the subway stations decorated with sculptures, mosaics, paintings and public installations by over 150 artists. Some of the most eye-grabbing subway art can be found at the following stations: Kungsträdgården, T-Centralen, Rådhuset, Solna Centrum and Tensta.
If you find yourself in Gamla Stan around noon, check out the changing of the guard at the Royal Palace. It takes place at 12:15 p.m. daily during the summer and on weekends year-round. The Royal Palace itself is a sight to see. You can take a tour of the inside and check out five museums, including the royal treasury, home to the crown jewels, an armory with knights’ gear and the royal stable with coronation carriages and intricate coaches.
Are you a fan of Game of Thrones or Harry Potter or Star Trek or E.T. or Marvel superheroes or Buffy the Vampire Slayer or all of the above? You’re bound to find a book, graphic novel, or other gift for all your geek-related obsessions at this sci-fi mecca in Gamla Stan. Let’s just say this shop has everything you could ever possibly need to decipher every reference in Stranger Things.
If it’s sunny out, this lively terrace at the top of Sodrateatern, an iconic theater in the heart of Stockholm, has to be on your to-do list. And if the weather is not cooperating, Sodrateatern offers plenty of indoor festivities as well, including jazz-fueled dinners that turn into full-blown dance parties.
If you’re traveling to Stockholm during the summer, from early April to late September, make sure to catch the sunset at the hyper-scenic Mälarpaviljongen. This high-spirited, straight-friendly restaurant and outdoor bar is located on the waterfront barges along the Riddarfjärden bay. You can even arrive by boat after a day out on the bay to cap off your cruising adventures.
A gay-owned coffee shop painted mustard-yellow in the heart of Gamla Stan, Chokladkoppen serves delicious hot chocolate in a bowl. If you really want to indulge — and why wouldn’t you? — they also have chocolate cake that’s to die for. During the summer, enjoy the people-watching in the Nobel Museum plaza from one of the cafe’s outdoor tables.
Pharmarium Cocktail Bar
Located in Gamla Stan near where Stockholm’s first-ever pharmacy opened in 1575, Pharmarium serves a different type of modern remedy: exquisite craft cocktails. The Roses of Gold, the Pharmarium’s version of a French 75, was just what the doctor order, made to perfection with vodka, lemon, champagne, and just a sprinkle of gold powder. As if a champagne cocktail needed that extra flair.
You will find plenty of treats in Stockholm’s hip SoFo district, but nothing like the sweet-buttery deliciousness that can be found inside Pärlans Konfektyra. This quaint confectionery looks like it’s from another era. It makes classic, organic caramels and caramel sauce in Scandinavian flavors like lingonberry and salt licorice.
You’d expect this Medieval-themed restaurant would be a tourist trap, but we were the only Americans there. Medeltidskrogen Sjätte Tunnan is a little hidden hotspot to find in Gamla Stan. Once you find the door you have to walk all the way to the back before going downstairs to a cavernous restaurant serving a menu inspired by 1300 A.D. cuisine. A feast perfect for a Viking king.

Captivity and manipulation are two intricate aspects of human psychology that have fascinated researchers for decades. One phenomenon that sheds light on this complex interaction is the Stockholm Syndrome. As discussions around the topic intensify, it becomes imperative to delve deeper into its causes and explore the role that Russian propaganda plays in shaping public opinion.
The Stockholm Syndrome refers to the psychological condition where hostages develop an emotional bond with their captors. Originating from a 1973 bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden, the term has increasingly been used to explain instances of individuals identifying with their perpetrators and paradoxically defending their actions.
To truly comprehend this phenomenon, it is crucial to understand the dynamics at play during periods of captivity. When individuals find themselves in situations where their freedom is severely limited, they become vulnerable to the influence of their captors. Fear, uncertainty, and isolation create an environment where the captors can exercise power and control over their prisoners.
Interestingly, these circumstances can lead to a survival strategy known as “identification with the aggressor” or the Stockholm Syndrome. Victims might unconsciously develop empathy and positivity towards their captors as a means of self-preservation. This psychological defense mechanism aims to reduce perceived threats and increase the chances of survival within the confines of captivity.
However, it is important to note that the Stockholm Syndrome is not limited to scenarios of physical captivity alone. It can also manifest in situations involving emotional manipulation and psychological control. This is where the role of Russian propaganda becomes significant.
Russian propaganda, with its sophisticated tactics, aims to manipulate public opinion and control narratives. By leveraging psychological vulnerabilities, such as the fear of the unknown and the need for security, they can shape people’s perceptions and beliefs. This can lead to individuals sympathizing with and defending actions that align with the propagated narrative, despite their better judgment.
Exploring the complexities of captivity and manipulation, especially in the context of the Stockholm Syndrome and Russian propaganda, highlights the profound impact that external influences can have on the human psyche. By understanding these dynamics, we can develop greater awareness and critical thinking skills to navigate the intricate world of information warfare.
The Stockholm Syndrome serves as a harrowing testament to why societies need to punish criminals to deter crimes. Its intersection with Russian propaganda highlights the need for vigilance in assessing information sources and maintaining a healthy skepticism in an increasingly interconnected world. Only by questioning and seeking the truth can we break free from the invisible chains of manipulation.
Stockholm Syndrome is a psychological response observed in captive situations, where the individual begins to closely identify with their captors and even starts to sympathize with their agenda and demands. It is a complex phenomenon that has been studied and analyzed in various psychological research.
The term “Stockholm Syndrome” was coined after a notorious bank robbery and hostage situation that took place in Stockholm, Sweden in 1973. During this six-day ordeal, the hostages developed a strong bond and emotional attachment to their captors, which baffled both the authorities and the public. This case became the unprecedented reference point for understanding the psychological dynamics of captor-captive relationships.
According to Britannica, the Stockholm Syndrome is a psychological response that occurs when hostages or abuse victims develop an emotional connection with their captors or abusers. This phenomenon is named after a bank robbery that took place in Stockholm, Sweden in 1973, where the hostages ultimately expressed sympathy and loyalty towards their captors.
The syndrome is thought to be a survival mechanism that kicks in when a person feels powerless and threatened, causing them to form an attachment to their perpetrators. In these situations, the victim’s survival instincts kick in, and they begin to identify with their captors, often developing positive feelings toward them. This may be due to the captors intermittently showing kindness or providing the hostages with small acts of compassion during their confinement.
This emotional connection can be perplexing to outsiders who fail to understand the intricate dynamics at play. From an outsider’s perspective, it may seem illogical for the victims to develop positive feelings towards their captors. However, it is important to remember that these individuals are enduring a traumatic experience that distorts their perception of reality.
The Stockholm Syndrome is not limited to physical captivity alone. It can also manifest in situations of emotional manipulation and psychological control. In these cases, the victims may find themselves trapped in toxic relationships or cult-like environments where their thoughts and emotions are manipulated to serve the interests of the abuser.
In such instances, the victims’ identities become intertwined with their captors, leading to a loss of personal agency and an overwhelming sense of dependency. Breaking free from this psychological entanglement can be incredibly challenging, as the victims may fear retribution or believe that they are incapable of surviving without their captors’ support.
One of the factors that can contribute to the development of Stockholm Syndrome is the captor’s ability to instill a sense of fear and helplessness in the victims. By controlling their access to basic needs such as food, water, and sleep, the captors can create a cycle of reward and punishment, fostering a state of emotional dependency. This dependence, coupled with intermittent acts of kindness or compassion, further deepens the victims’ connection to their captors.
Furthermore, the victims may experience cognitive dissonance, a psychological phenomenon where conflicting beliefs and emotions create a state of mental discomfort. To reduce this discomfort, the victims may reinterpret the captors’ actions in a positive light, creating a narrative that justifies their bond with their captors. This cognitive restructuring allows them to maintain a sense of coherence in their worldview, despite the abusive circumstances they find themselves in.
The intersection between the Stockholm Syndrome and Russian propaganda unveils another layer of complexity. Russian propaganda, utilizing sophisticated manipulation techniques, aims to shape public opinion and control narratives. By exploiting psychological vulnerabilities, such as the fear of the unknown and the desire for security, they can sway individuals’ perceptions and evoke emotional responses.
In this context, victims of psychological manipulation may exhibit signs of the Stockholm Syndrome by defending and sympathizing with the propagated narrative, even if it contradicts their original beliefs or goes against their best interests. This underscores the immense power of psychological manipulation in shaping individuals’ thoughts and behaviors, turning them into unwitting prisoners of false ideologies.
To combat the toxic influence of propaganda and break free from the grip of manipulation, it is crucial to foster critical thinking skills and media literacy. Developing the ability to analyze information objectively, question sources, and consider multiple perspectives can help individuals resist the allure of manipulative tactics.
By shining a light on the intertwined concepts of captivity, manipulation, and the Stockholm Syndrome, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex mechanisms at play within the human psyche. It is through this understanding that we can strive to create a society that values freedom, autonomy, and the pursuit of truth, free from the shackles of psychological captivity.
Note: The term “Stockholm Syndrome” is used to describe a specific psychological response and should not be used loosely or trivialized.
One of the most infamous examples of Stockholm Syndrome is the case involving Patty Hearst, a newspaper heiress who was kidnapped in 1974 by the radical group Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA). Initially terrified and coerced, Hearst eventually joined the group and participated in their criminal activities. This case generated significant media attention and captivated the public’s interest, sparking widespread discussions about the psychological mechanisms underlying Stockholm Syndrome.
The study of Stockholm Syndrome has provided tragic insights into the complexities of human behavior and the power of psychological manipulation. Researchers have attempted to unravel the underlying factors that contribute to the development of this phenomenon. Some proposed explanations include the captives’ perception of kindness from their captors, trauma bonding, and a survival instinct that leads the captives to adapt to their circumstances.
While Stockholm Syndrome remains an obscure crime, its impact on the understanding of human psychology cannot be understated. By analyzing and comprehending the intricacies of such situations, psychologists and researchers hope to shed light on the various psychological and emotional processes that individuals may experience when faced with captivity and coercion.
It is crucial to note that each case of Stockholm Syndrome is unique, and individuals’ responses can vary significantly. The understanding and treatment of this phenomenon remain areas of ongoing research, aiming to provide support and guidance to individuals who have experienced such traumatic situations.
The study of Stockholm Syndrome has also highlighted the role of empathy and the human need for connection in captive situations. In some cases, victims may develop a sense of empathy towards their captors, seeing them as complex individuals rather than solely as perpetrators. This empathy can create a bond that reinforces the captive’s identification with the aggressor.
Furthermore, the Stockholm Syndrome can have long-lasting effects on the psychological well-being of the victims. Even after their physical captivity ends, they may continue to struggle with conflicting emotions and a sense of loyalty towards their captors. Overcoming these psychological challenges requires a supportive environment where victims can receive appropriate therapy and support to reintegrate into society.
Cultural and societal factors also play a significant role in shaping the dynamics of the Stockholm Syndrome. The cultural norms and values of a society can influence individuals’ responses to captivity and manipulation. For example, in societies that prioritize authority and obedience, victims may be more likely to develop the Stockholm Syndrome as a means of survival.
The media also has a responsibility in portraying and discussing the Stockholm Syndrome phenomenon accurately and sensitively. Misrepresentation and sensationalization can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misunderstandings about the condition. Therefore, it is crucial for media outlets to approach the topic with empathy, ensuring that victims’ experiences are heard and understood.
It is important to remember that Stockholm Syndrome is a complex psychological phenomenon that arises in captive situations, where victims develop an emotional bond with their captors. This response stems from a survival instinct and the psychological mechanisms of identification with the aggressor. It is crucial to continue studying and understanding the Stockholm Syndrome to provide support and guidance to individuals who have experienced such traumatic situations. By doing so, we can strive to create a society that values compassion, empathy, and freedom from manipulation.
A study conducted by Douglas Wilbur, a visiting scholar in the UTSA Department of Communication, sheds light on an important issue regarding the influence of Russian propaganda on popular alternative media sites. Wilbur’s research, which involved analyzing over 600 articles, provides valuable insights into the correlation between Sputnik, Russia’s state-owned media, and these alternative media platforms that are believed to present favorable coverage of Russia and its allies in the United States.
The study, “Propaganda or Not: Examining the Claims of Extensive Russian Information Operations within the United States,” provides a comprehensive content analysis of articles published in four websites that were labeled by Prop or Not as working on behalf of the Russian government. While Prop or Not faced criticism from major U.S. mainstream media for its methodology in labeling 200 sites as vehicles of propaganda, the research conducted by Wilbur demonstrates the strong credibility of the claims made by Prop or Not regarding Russian interference.
In 2017, Prop or Not alleged that Russia was manipulating U.S. public opinion through online propaganda, but their failure to provide compelling evidence left doubts lingering in the air. However, Wilbur’s research has now validated this claim, shedding light on the extent of Russian interference and its impact on U.S. public opinion. The study delves into the manipulation tactics employed by these targeted websites and explores the strategies used to influence the American narrative.
One of the key findings of Wilbur’s study is the strong, positive correlation between Sputnik and sites like Zero Hedge, a Wall Street-focused website. The analysis suggests that these alternative media outlets echo Russian propaganda, aligning with the claims made by organizations like Prop or Not. This raises concerns about covert manipulation of the U.S. news agenda, posing a potential threat to national security.
Wilbur researched articles published on several websites: Zero Hedge, New Cold War, Global Research, and The Daily Sheeple. The outlets were chosen using a random number approach. Published articles on those sites between January 2019 and July 2020 were then selected for examination if they contained the following key terms: Russia, Syria, Ukraine, Iran, Venezuela, and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). These terms were chosen because they highlight important foreign policy issues for the Russian government. Once the articles were selected, their tonality was rated on a positive or negative scale according to how the news stories described Russia and its allies versus the U.S. and its partners.
Wilbur’s analysis offers a valuable contribution to the ongoing debate surrounding the role of Russian information operations in the United States. By meticulously examining the content of these websites, the study provides insights into the methods employed by Russian actors to shape public discourse and sow discord among the American population.
This research serves as a call to action for organizations and individuals alike, highlighting the importance of critically evaluating the sources and information we encounter online. It underscores the need for improved media literacy and the development of strategies to combat disinformation campaigns that seek to undermine democracy and public trust.
In essence, the study conducted by Wilbur offers compelling evidence to support the claims made by Prop or Not regarding Russian interference in the United States. It provides a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and the general public, deepening our understanding of the evolving challenges posed by digital propaganda and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of information in the digital age.
In an era where information is easily accessible and influences public opinion, it becomes crucial for the U.S. media to be aware of and address these propaganda efforts. As Russia creates and utilizes propaganda as a weapon, it is vital for the U.S. media to have effective countermeasures in place, ensuring that accurate and unbiased information prevails.
By highlighting this issue, Wilbur’s research underscores the importance of media literacy and critical thinking. It reminds us that staying informed and discerning in the face of propaganda is integral to safeguarding the integrity of the news and protecting national interests.
Awareness of the existence and potential impact of propaganda is the first step in combating its influence. The findings of this study emphasize the need for continued research, collaboration, and awareness among media professionals, policymakers, and the general public, as they strive to ensure a vibrant and trustworthy news landscape that upholds democratic values.
Understanding the parallels between Stockholm Syndrome and Russian disinformation and propaganda sheds light on how psychological manipulation can shape public opinion and influence individuals’ beliefs. By drawing this comparison, we can gain insight into the mechanisms at play in both situations, revealing the power of manipulation in shaping individuals’ thoughts and behaviors.
Both Stockholm Syndrome and Russian propaganda involve psychological manipulation and the distortion of reality. In cases of Stockholm Syndrome, captives develop an emotional bond with their captors, defending and identifying with them despite the harm they may have suffered. Similarly, Russian propaganda aims to manipulate public opinion through sophisticated tactics, distorting information and narratives to align with their interests.
In both scenarios, fear and uncertainty play a significant role. In captivity situations, victims experience a sense of powerlessness and dependence on their captors, which can lead to the development of Stockholm Syndrome. Similarly, Russian propaganda preys on individuals’ fears and insecurities, manipulating them through emotionally charged content designed to evoke strong reactions.
Another common factor between the two is the psychological defense mechanism of cognitive restructuring. In the case of Stockholm Syndrome, captives may reinterpret their captors’ actions in a positive light, creating a narrative that justifies their bond. Similarly, victims of propaganda may engage in cognitive dissonance, modifying their beliefs to align with the propagated narrative, despite contradictory evidence.
The role of empathy, albeit in different contexts, is also crucial. In Stockholm Syndrome, victims may develop empathy towards their captors, seeing them as complex individuals rather than solely as perpetrators. In the case of Russian propaganda, individuals may sympathize with the propagated narrative and defend actions that align with it, due to the emotional appeal and manipulation employed.
By comparing Stockholm Syndrome with Russian disinformation and propaganda, we can recognize the underlying psychological mechanisms and vulnerabilities that contribute to individuals’ susceptibility to manipulation. This understanding serves as a reminder of the importance of critical thinking, media literacy, and the ability to question and analyze information from diverse perspectives.
Ultimately, by raising awareness of the tactics used in psychological manipulation, individuals can develop resilience against manipulation and make informed decisions based on reliable information. This empowers individuals to navigate the complex landscape of information warfare and mitigate the impact of psychological captivity induced by manipulation and propaganda.

In 1973, there was a huge bank robbery attempt in Stockholm, Sweden. The robbers held four bank workers hostage for six days. On the sixth days, the police broke inside, trying to arrest the robbers and save the hostages but the said hostages tried to protect the robbers from the police. Later on, the hostages refused giving testimony against the robbers and they even started collecting money to defend them. Within six days of captivity, the hostages had started developing a deep sympathy for the robbers.
As a result, the incident in which captives start developing positive feelings for their captors was named Stockholm Syndrome. This intriguing and paradoxical bond between captors and captives was also found amongst prisoners of war and those being kept in concentration camps as well. But in time, it’s seen that Stockholm Syndrome is not all about literal captors and captives. For example; Stockholm Syndrome can be found between parents and children or spouses as well as in narcissistic relationships, which is the main topic of our article.
In what conditions do we see Stockholm Syndrome?
Stockholm Syndrome requires four important elements:
Judging by the first one, you might think that Stockholm Syndrome happening in a narcissistic relationship is very unlikely. You might feel like a narcissistic relationship cannot exactly be life threatening. After all, not all narcissists resort to physical violence. On the other hand, living with a narcissist can mean that your life is indeed in danger. This danger can be physical, emotional, psychological or spiritual. Besides, narcissists can throw violent temper tantrums when they can’t get something they want or when they’re losing control over someone (narcissistic rage). People on the receiving end of this rage (even if their partners have never abused them physical in the past) may find themselves fearing for their lives or well-being in general.
And the second case is about isolating the victim. Isolating the victim is a typical abusive behavior. In some cases, the victim can practically turn into a hostage due to being completely alienated from the outside world. And in some others, the victim avoids the point of views of other people when under the influence of feelings such as jealousy, paranoia and fear fueled by the narcissist. The isolated person fails to notice the abuse they’re being put through due to not being able to consult to other people, and they also feel like this small, artificial kindness shown by the abuser is all they have now so they cling to it.
Another reason is that the victim is unable to escape, or so they believe because they were convinced by the abuser. In the Stockholm robbery, it was found out that one of the hostages got a chance to escape and yet she did not. The reason to that may be the fact she believed she could not succeed, perhaps she was simply afraid of the danger this attempt might bring. In this situation called “behavioral despair”, the victim feels so hopeless that they resign to their fate. In narcissistic relationships, if the victim is financially abused as well, or if they’re in a relationship where there are children involved, they can be convinced that there’s no way out for them. And if the abused person also has a narcissistic parent, it’s quite likely for them to show signs of behavioral despair. Babies are dependent on their parents in order to survive. But when it comes to children who grow up in problematic environments where their needs are not met; the fact they feel dependent and not strong enough as well as the “small favors” granted by their abusive parents every once in a while may cause them to develop a sympathy for them.
In our last condition, in order for the Stockholm Syndrome to emerge the abuser should display a certain amount of kindness. A desperate and hopeless person who’s already in a life threatening situation and utterly at the mercy of the abuser can start trying to rationalize the situation when they’re shown some kindness by the abuser. These attempts at rationalizing the situation may start with “it’s not that bad!” and end in deeply positive feelings for the abuser in time. After a while, the abuser stops being a bad person in the eyes of the victim, they’re simply misunderstood and turned into what they are today due to certain circumstances.
At this point, the abuser clings to the exaggerated versions of the few good memories they had with the abuser and starts seeing them the way they want them to be, not the way they actually are today.
Reasons of Stockholm Syndrome
Stockholm Syndrome is a product and natural result of systematic abuse, and it’s practically a survival mechanism. People try to save themselves from dangerous situations with “fight or flight” instincts. But running away or fighting it may not always be possible. If we consider the Stockholm robbery, the hostages cannot really overpower armed robbers, and their chances of getting shot are pretty high if they try to run away. As a result, the victim experiences stress and wants to protect themselves, but that doesn’t seem possible. Also, our brains and bodies are not fit for long-term and continuous stress. Therefore, eventually people tend to focus on the “positive aspects” instinctively in an attempt to reduce the stress they’re experiencing. This is practically something that protects them from going utterly insane and it helps them cope with the trauma. People suffering from Stockholm Syndrome have faced something so traumatic that the only way to reduce it was to do this.
The first instinct of the hostages might have been to pretend like they’re on the robbers’ side in order to avoid angering them rather than “focusing on the positive”. They can try to please the abuser to avoid violence. In bilateral relationships, if one of the parties is prone to violence and sudden, aggressive outbursts; the other party may instinctively try to keep them satisfied just to avoid their wrath. But after a while, once the hope for escape has completely faded, this situation goes beyond just pretending and the victim can find themselves feeling a genuine sympathy for the abuser.
Long story short, when there’s no hope for escape and that there’s no other options (or so you think), you try to fit in and adapt to the new conditions in order to survive. Besides, once you embrace the abuser’s point of view, you’re no longer a victim. This situation makes one feel less inferior and more in control of things. As long as the danger of maintaining the relationship isn’t much higher than the risk a breakup might bring, it’s quite hard for the victim to acknowledge the situation they’re in.
All these situations serve the abuser well, because then they’ve successfully created a voluntary victim. Especially for the emotional manipulators, keeping the victim completely under their control is not enough; they want the victim to be willing as well.
Despite all this, you might still find Stockholm Syndrome illogical. You might be having trouble understanding a hostage getting attached to their captor, or a child loving their abusive parent, or a person being unable to leave their violent partner. But do not forget that people who have suffered traumatic things cannot always make reasonable choices. Traumatic incidents are exceptional conditions and desperate times call for desperate measures.
What to do in order to get rid of Stockholm Syndrome in narcissistic relationships?
Breaking the trauma bond on your own might be too difficult, so it would be wiser to get psychological help if possible. You need to make sure the person you’re consulting to has enough knowledge and experience about narcissistic personality disorder, codependency and narcissistic relationship dynamics.
You need to cut all ties with the narcissist for good and follow the “no contact rule”. In this way, you’ll be able to establish yourself a safe zone.
And in relationships, you should always focus on the big picture rather than small details. These “small favors” other people grant you may cost you much bigger things in the long run.

24–25 Sep remembered on 8 Oct
Writing memories is like racing with time. From the Hong Kong 18 days ago, to the Bangkok 16 days ago, to the Copenhagen 13 days ago, theoretically, I am catching up with time, but as I caught up, I found remembering what happened harder and harder. Shouldn’t it be another way around? Or just the memories of Skövde, as a new place, are replacing the old ones faster? Or simply, I am tired of remembering?
“I arrived at Stockholm airport at about 0:30am, in the dark of the new moon, on the coldest day of the year. The Swedish officials had been notified of my arrival, and I had no travel documents on me. I did not use the Japanese passport to avoid committing the offence of forgery and waited for all the other travellers to clear customs before I went to the officer, telling them that I had no documents. A young officer guided me to his office to talk, and I cleared customs in about ten minutes. At the airport, Mrs. Gawell and seven or eight other members who were in charge of my case at Amnesty International came to pick me up. The temperature was -25 degrees Celsius, and they brought a jumper, long boots, gloves, a scarf, and a leather hat for me. They probably thought that I came from the subtropics, that I must have been wearing only a flimsy southern jacket. They insisted that I wear all of these things on the spot. I am sure that I must looked ridiculous. The police simply took my name and then asked me to return the next day back to the airport to complete the formalities. I felt that I was truly in another world.” — “A Perfect Escape” by Peng Ming-Min
Here we arrived at a city without memories.
I had never been to Stockholm. This was my first time. I arrived at the Arlanda Airport in the evening. Since I was travelling from Copenhagen, I did not need to go through the border control. The public transportation was easy. I managed to reach the hotel smoothly.
The name of the hotel was Hotel Expo. It was slightly out of the city centre, around 30 minutes by public transportation. However, for someone who used to live in London, anywhere that can reach the centre within 30 minutes, is included in the concept of centre and considered convenient. In conclusion, I love the hotel, and I would recommend it to anyone who’s visiting, especially if you’re on a budget. It’s right in front of a commuter’s train station, Älvsjö. (Like you can literally see the hotel as you leave the station.) I spent 1250 SEK for 3 nights. It was the friendliest price I found. What I booked was a single room with shared toilets. The room was small but with everything one would need, including a clean towel and extra movable spaces (unlike the room F and I stayed in Hong Kong). The toilets were clean and close to the room. My favourite part was the breakfast, which was included in the price. And not only it was included, it was fancy, with everything one could expect from a four-star hotel breakfast buffet — various cold cuts, cheese, breads, coffee, juice, milk, yoghourt, eggs, fruits, oatmeals, cereals, jams…etc., I can continue listing. And what was crazier was that the gym on the ground floor was also included, that as a resident of the hotel, I could use it for free. Free laundry was also available. The surrounding environment was not massively exciting but convenient, with a huge supermarket, Co-op (I almost tried with my old British membership, wondering if it worked.), along with Subway, restaurants, bars, Chinese food…etc.
The checking process was slightly odd. The man behind the counter checked me in, but said I hadn’t paid for the room. I checked the booking record, and made sure that I had. And then he said, “Oh, then don’t worry about it, I will check it again tomorrow.” That was it. He didn’t come back to me afterwards.
After my joyous breakfast the next morning, I started visiting my long list of places related to Peng or Hedin.
My first stop was Norr Mälarstrand 66. The seemingly ordinary address was where Sven Hedin used to live. The walls of the entryway were covered with murals of a world map, as well as a Chinese-style temple to honour him. I was dying to go in, so after taking some photos from the glass door outside, I decided to sit on the staircases, hoping to bump into someone leaving or entering. After 15 minutes or so, I realised that the day was not my lucky day, so I moved on to what was next on my list, Adolf Fredriks kyrkogård, where Hedin was buried, with a 30-minute walk from where he used to live.
On my way there, I realised that I was in need of a toilet. This might be something to confess — I believe that I had this “pink bubble” filter when speaking of Scandinavia. I was imagining public toilets everywhere, clean and free, public Wifi, water cooler, power outlets, free at every corner. However, a free public toilet seemed to be harder to find than I expected. It was almost 11:00am. It took me a while until I found one, an isolated one on the street. It was free, so, hurray! However, it was not as clean and well-maintained as I expected. But well, that was on me. I am the one who chose to wear the pink goggles, and to be honest, comparing it with the ones in London or Paris, it was a tiny heaven on the street. I happily finished what I needed to do, and moved on with my day.
When I arrived at the Adolf Fredriks kyrkogård, it was around 11:15am. I realised that the church was closed. (It was closed between 11:00am — 11:45am daily.) Luckily, the garden, where the cemetery is, was opened. It was a small yard, with, I would say, a bit more than 100 tombstones as far as I could see, which means, it shouldn’t be difficult for me to find the one of Sven Hedin, especially him being a famous figure. I started to stroll around, one side at a time, one roll at a time, carefully trying to locate his name. Unexpectedly, I failed. I kept wondering why and how, thinking probably Hedin did not want me to find him, that probably he did not not approve of my project, or my criticism towards the concept of explorers and what he did.
Do you remember my internet drama? So, once I arrived in Stockholm, I changed my sim card from the British one to the Taiwanese one, and bought some credit so I can have internet access here in Europe. It was slightly more expensive than usual, so I decided that I was not going to use it unless it’s necessary.
After almost half an hour of trying to locate Hedin, I gave up. I sat down on a bench, turned on the internet on my phone, googling the images of the tombstone of Sven Hedin. From using the housing in the background as a clue, I found it. Turned out that it was covered by a van, the only car parked inside the cemetery. I stood in front of him, explaining the project, and apologising, hoping to have his approval. I told him that I am aware that I am not in any position to judge, and I know it was a different time. The project is not about him, not personally at least. Through talking to him, I started to ask myself why I wanted to do this project. What is it for? I suddenly realised that in a way, migration can be a privilege, even for the ones who were forced to. Peng had to escape, otherwise he would have been killed or imprisoned, but again, how many activists at the time couldn’t, ended up in jails or some random cemeteries in Liu Zhang Li. Refugees had to leave, but again, we all know that more of them didn’t make it. So, it’s a privilege, but it doesn’t mean it’s not hard. It doesn’t mean living in a foreign place, learning a new language, facing unfamiliar environments is not something hard. If I can offer something, some sharing, some talks, so we can feel a little bit better, with our lives, with our choices, probably the whole thing would be worth it? That there could be some meanings in all these?
After talking to him, I looked at my phone, it was 11:45am. The church would be opened by now. I suddenly realised, probably he did it on purpose. If I found his tombstone easily at 11:15am, would I have the patience to sit for 30 minutes to wait for the church to open? I might have decided to move on with my day. Feeling grateful at the coincidence, I walked into the church. It was beautiful. I was the only visitor in the church, however, someone started to play the organ. Not sure if it was a regular performance, or the person was practising, it was magnetising either way. I found a bronze plaque dedicated to Sven Hedin on the wall. I guess probably that was the reason he invited me to come in. I also found a LGBTQIA+ friendly rainbow pin at the souvenir store. How sweet. I guess that would fit in the pink bubble goggle that I was wearing. After a short stay, I moved on to my next spot — Historiska Museet.
I actually can’t remember why I put Historiska Museet on my list. I guess probably at some point I read something saying that part of Hedin’s collection was in the museum. When I arrived, I noticed that on Wednesdays, which was the day I visited, tickets were half priced after 5pm. So I decided to come back later.
Where I went next was the US embassy in Stockholm. This was where Peng applied for his US visa. Even though it sounds like an insignificant part of the story, he actually visited a number of times, detailedly remembered and documented in his book. It was also kind of the turning point for him to move on with his journey from Sweden to the USA. From what I found online, the one I visited should be the same one Peng visited. It was launched in 1955.
I was surprised when I arrived. I was expecting a house, or a building at most, like most of the embassies are. The US embassy in Stockholm took up the land of the size of a university campus, composed of buildings and a huge yard. And as expected, it was barricaded. I started to take photos of the entrance, and of course, caught the attention of the security guard. He gestured to me to go over in a friendly manner, and I believed it was time for me to play the innocent, Asian girl, the tourist card. I said, “Oh, I am not here for anything. I just want to have a look, is it okay if I take some photos?” He gave me a positive answer with a smile. And without anything else to do, or could do, I moved on soon after.

Earlier this year I quit my job as the VP of Platform at SoundCloud and moved back to Stockholm. Working at SoundCloud was a hell of a ride which began back in the summer of 2009. At the time, I’d just graduated from KTH and was doing some work at Propellerhead. I was dreaming about starting my own company after falling in love with entrepreneurship during my time at SSES. Through SSES, I’d also met Eric who’s the SoundCloud co-founder and CTO. We have a lot of shared interests and became great friends.
Knowing Eric was a good reason to frequently visit Berlin where SoundCloud is headquartered. I fell in love with the city and was lucky to experience one of the legendary rooftop parties in SoundCloud’s first office. The team was starting to grow and eventually I got an offer to join. The opportunity was perfect; a chance to join a music tech startup I really believed in, work with people I really liked, and finally make the move to Berlin. We agreed over the phone on a Wednesday and started working the week after.
When I joined SoundCloud, we were less than ten people in a scrappy office and the whole company was doing daily stand-ups together. My job was to build relationships with other companies, mainly music software makers, and get developers to hack on our API. There was so much to do and so much to learn. I loved it and was so excited about getting stuff done that I was almost running to work every day.
We thought we were the coolest thing since disco, but in the beginning it was really hard to convince other companies to partner with us. After all, we were just a small startup from Berlin with rapid growth but uncertain future. However, sending thousands of emails, doing hundreds of calls, taking tons of meetings, and traveling to as many conferences as possible, eventually started to pay off.
As we got bigger, things got a lot easier and eventually we reached a point where we couldn’t even handle all the incoming requests from potential partners. I learned the hard way that it takes time to build good relationships and get people to buy into your ideas, and that timing is super important when it comes to closing deals, so you have to be patient and persistent.
Since I was doing partnerships with other tech companies, I traveled a lot to the US. At a certain point, we needed to establish a permanent presence in the Bay Area, and it was natural for me to make the move to San Francisco and setup our new office there. I was of course stoked about the opportunity to work in SF and get a chance to build a small office from scratch.
It took some time to get things in order, but eventually we got the paperwork sorted, found a great space, and started bringing on new people. I got to obsess with things like office furniture, culture (introducing Friday fika), finding the right people, maintaining the connection to our other offices, and evangelizing SoundCloud in the bay area. It reminded me how naturally passionate I am when I get to coordinate things and craft them down to the details. In the end, things worked out great and I’m really proud of having brought the SoundCloud culture overseas and established so many great relationships in the US.
Over time, we expanded the platform team and scaled up our efforts, and over time we managed to connect the vast majority of music apps and a ton of different web services. We launched partnerships with companies like Apple, Twitter, and Facebook, and created a big developer community who built hundreds of hacks on the API. I was also part of the management team and an active contributor to the overall company strategy work.
Starting a company has always been close to my heart, and as things were running smoothly in SF, I felt the timing was right to leave and build something new. I can’t help loving to build things from scratch and I’m constantly looking for new challenges. In addition, taking some time off would give me a chance to charge my batteries and think about my longterm goals in life.
I’m super proud of having contributed to building a such a great company. Building a startup is an amazing experience that I really recommend. I don’t think there’s a better way to try and learn new things. I’ve learned so many great startup lessons along the way and now I want to take that experience and create something on my own.
A massive thanks to Alex and Eric for giving me the opportunity to support their mission and the freedom to do a great job, and to all the awesome people I’ve worked with along the way! I’ve had so much fun and learned so much.

Before I go on with these holy thoughts, I must mention — Everything in KFC is overpriced. I think they are doing child trafficking for the chickens they serve their customers. So small, you start to wonder if they even allowed the chicken to walk before cooking it.
I even battled a bit of food poisoning in the end. What a way to start the week.
That said, if we stretch it far enough, it’s not hard to see how the whole Stockholm Syndrome narrative could be pushed into some rather unholy territory. I find myself thinking about how people grow up loving the very parents who used to beat the living daylight out of them.
If you’ll allow me the looseness, it doesn’t feel like a huge leap to draw a parallel with those who stay in abusive relationships, covering bruises with excuses and clinging to the people who hurt them.
Few things unsettle me more than watching a person tenderly unpack the logic behind getting brutalized by the very hands that claim to love them. It feels like a kind of demonic possession — something ancient, cruel, and crawling beneath the skin. And if we’re ranking horrors, this one isn’t coming in second.
I think it's Stockholm Syndrome, just nuanced a little.
I’m beginning to understand that there are some gentle themes to healthy living, and it…

Home to the famous pop band ABBA and furniture giant IKEA, Stockholm is the second most visited Nordic country. Built across fourteen islands, the city is known as Europe’s first “green” capital and boasts the longest life expectancy on the continent. “Fika”, the afternoon tradition of indulging in a coffee and pastry break, might also be contributing to the high life expectancy. Be sure to participate in this ritual during your time in Sweden.
This guide outlines a possible itinerary for a long weekend in the city. Below is a quick overview of the proposal:
Most US phone companies do not enable free European service. Check with your phone company before leaving to confirm your plan’s allowance.
Debit/Credit Cards are widely accepted everywhere. I never used cash. No need to take out any Swedish kronor (SEK), but if you feel so inclined, visit your local bank before you leave to get the best conversion rates.
It is important to note that Sweden (along with all of the Nordic countries) is an expensive country to visit, so plan to spend more here than other places in mainland Europe.
Stockholm experiences mild annual temperatures, with lows in the winter around 30 degrees Fahrenheit and highs in summer around 70 degrees. Its sunlight hours, however, are more interesting. During the winter, the sun rises around 9am and sets just after 3pm, making it a long, dark span of months. The summer is drastically (and thankfully) different, with the city averaging around nineteen hours of sunlight per day. Unless you plan to visit up north for winter activities, visit Stockholm from May through September for ideal temperatures and light.
The city offers numerous hotel, Airbnb, and hostel accommodations based on price. STF af Chapman & Skeppsholmen Hostel is a budget friendly, clean hostel on a quieter island conveniently in between Gamla Stan and Djurgården (the museum island, as I affectionately call it). Instead of walking (which is still very convenient), take the Skeppsholmen ferry that leaves every twenty minutes to visit main points of interest.
Gamla Stan, the old town section of the city, is another great area to stay in. The Collector’s Lady Hamilton Hotel in this neighborhood is a Victorian-style hotel with modern updates. In addition, Hotel Tegnerlunden is an affordable option in the Norrmalm District, a busy downtown neighborhood home to many iconic landmarks.
To get from the Arlanda Airport to downtown (near Gamla Stan), skip Uber and take the Arlanda Express. Purchase a ticket at the airport for $27 USD one way and arrive at the Stockholm City stop within twenty minutes. The ride includes WiFi and clean bathrooms. A walk to Gamla Stan from there takes another ten minutes.
Once in the city, utilize the SL ferries for an easy and quick system that locals and tourists alike enjoy. Purchase a ticket at every ferry station for less than $2 USD one way. Walking between each island via bridges tends to take time, so this is a better option, especially when going from Gamla Stan to Djurgården.
We got lazy and ended up Ubering to further neighborhoods like Sodermalm from our hostel (with prices averaging that of mainstream US cities). However, we wish we had taken advantage of the metro system. Clean and accessible, it holds the title of the “world’s longest art gallery” so I’m kicking myself for skipping it.
Start your day with fresh squeezed orange juice and a deliciously lite breakfast at Café Schweizer in old town Gamla Stan. This neighborhood is one of the best preserved historic districts in Europe, so take your time sipping coffee while wandering the cobblestone streets in the early morning.
Next, experience a free walking tour to better understand the history of Gamla Stan. The guide will point out key points of interest such as the Stockholm Royal Palace, Stora Nygatan (a lively street with music), and the Swedish Parliament where environmental activist Greta Thunberg began her global protests. If time permits post-tour, stop by Tasty America for a good laugh at a large collection of the over-processed foods popular in the United States. This grocery store was both intriguing and embarrassing, as it really outlines the absurdity of American food culture.
For lunch, pop over to Restaurant Tradition to taste traditional Swedish and Nordic fare. The Hairy Pig, a pub, is another great option for good food and beer. Try the Swedish Meatballs — you won’t regret it. If not quite hungry yet, take the ferry from Gamla Stan to Djurgården and head straight to one of the most popular museums on the island, the Vasa Museum.
At only $18 USD/adult, this is arguably one of the coolest museums I’ve ever been to. Vasa displays a well preserved warship from 1628 that sank twenty minutes into its maiden voyage, drowning all but thirty people out of its 300 passengers. It took 333 years for the Swedes to retrieve the ship from the bottom of the harbor. Visitors can now view the ship from four different stories, along with numerous artifacts and skeletons from the wreckage. The experience typically takes one hour. Do not miss this.
Stockholm has numerous other museums scattered throughout Djurgården and the city in general that you could hit after Vasa. The Viking Museum showcases 9th century Viking ships and artifacts along with a Disneyworld-like Viking ride. The ABBA Museum, a well marketed but somewhat superficial excursion, outlines the rise and success of the famous band. The Nobel Prize Museum highlights key Nobel prizes and laureates. The one museum I would NOT recommend, however, is the Skansen Museum. Although it is the world’s oldest open air museum and is supposed to showcase Sweden pre-industrial era, it completely lacks signage and guides to teach and clarify what you’re looking at. Skip this.
If you plan on visiting several museums, consider purchasing the All-Inclusive Stockholm Pass which will give you discounts and ‘free’ access to many city landmarks and galleries.
End the evening with dinner at Restaurang Kryp In back in Gamla Stan for more traditional Swedish fare and a great espresso martini. Then, head to Winstrom’s Pub or O’Connell’s Irish Pub for drinks and live music.
Stockholm is home to a massive archipelago with over 24,000 islands. These island chains create plenty of options for fun day trips. Stora Fjäderholmarna, Grinda, and Vaxholm are all small islands within a 90 minute boat ride from the main city center.
I had a really hard time determining which island to visit. Stora Fjäderholmarna is charming and only thirty minutes by boat, but does not allow one to truly experience life deep in the archipelago. Grinda takes approximately 90 minutes and has gorgeous views with many adventure sports to take part in, including kayaking and swimming. I’m a bit regretful that we didn’t stop here. The island we did select, however, was Vaxholm and I am both happy and disappointed in our choice.
Considered the capital of the archipelago, Vaxholm is known for idyllic roads and quaint fisherman cottages. To get there, choose from one of two main ferries. The cheapest option utilizes the public ferry, Waxholmsbolaget. Located next to the Grand Hotel and operating year round, the ferry does not allow pre-purchasing tickets so simply purchase on arrival. The trip lasts an hour or so.
The second option, and the one we selected, involves the Cinderella ferry and a history tour. With a restaurant, bar, and guided cruise, this ferry is a bit nicer and lasts approximately 90 minutes each way. It leaves from a different location (Strandvägen berth no 14) and only runs from May through September. If planning to visit Vaxholm and appreciate history, choose this option.
One can also drive or bus to the town as there is a small bridge connecting it to the mainland — but you’d be remiss to skip exploring the archipelago via water.
On land, explore the little town for an hour or two with its boutiques and waterfront parks, especially Johannesbergsparken. When ready for food, indulge in a tasty burger on the docks at Winbergs Kök & Bar or down the road at Vaxholms Hembygdsgårds Café. The latter was closed when we visited, but we stopped by to sit on the picnic tables and enjoy the view. I would have loved to eat here — the location was idyllic and the menu looked delicious.
If you have time, take a quick water taxi to the Vaxholm Fortress Museum, a site that was once the Citadel for Swedish defense in the 19th century.
My day trip to Vaxholm was great, though I wonder what it would have been like to explore a different island with perhaps more to do. The tour allowed for four or five hours on the island, which was too much for what the island offered for activities. I would have preferred to take the Cinderella ferry there for the history and the public ferry home so we could have returned faster and on our own time.
Alternatively, discover additional island tours through Get Your Guide or simply get out on the water with a RIB tour.
Once back in Stockholm, spend the rest of the evening exploring Norrmalm, a modernized downtown neighborhood next to Gamla Stan. Be sure to walk through Kungsträdgården, the city’s oldest park, and Hötorgshallen, a local food market. Grab drinks at the Lydmar Hotel outdoor pop up bar, then dine alongside locals at Restaurant 1889 Fast Fine Pizza. Known for its ritzy decor yet laid back atmosphere, this restaurant simplifies ordering with a QR barcode and no true waitstaff.
Spend the last day in Stockholm choosing from a handful of excursions:
Regardless of what you decide, enjoy the afternoon/evening in Sodermalm, the “Brooklyn” of Stockholm. Visit Söderhallarna, a modern shopping hall with gourmet food stalls and restaurants, or try Mosebacketerrassen, a beer hall with gorgeous views of Stockholm’s skyline. Skinnarviksparken, a park with hills overlooking the city, is another great place for views and people watching. For a casual dinner, head to gastro-pub Honey Honey. We visited during the Eurovision competition and had a great time watching countries compete while chowing down on pork schnitzel and Swedish meatballs with lingonberry sauce. Later, stop by Häktet for lively drinks with a younger crowd.
After four nights in Stockholm, my next stop was Helsinki, Finland. I purchased a one way flight for $200 USD that was quick and easy. However, I wish I had taken the overnight ferry with either Viking Line or Tallink Silja that would have allowed me to see more of the archipelago and saved the cost of a hotel for a night.

The first museum I visited in Stockholm (I am a museum enthusiast) is the Nordiska Museum, also known as the Nordic Museum, located in Djurgården, an island in central Stockholm. This museum mainly displays the traditions and lifestyle of Scandinavians from the 16th century. It has over one and a half million pieces! The exterior of the museum is fascinating. It was designed in the Dutch-Danish Renaissance style by Isak Gustaf Clason. Founded in the late 19th century by Artur Hazelius, a Swedish scholar and museum director, who also founded the Skansen open-air museum in Stockholm.
💰Free admission with Go City Pass
Regular admission: SEK 170 by 2024 and free admission for children
Opening Time: Almost open every day, even on Christmas from 10:00–17:00
Once you enter the museum, get your tickets with your Go City Pass and you will see an enormous sculpture of King Gustav Vasa. Gustav Vasa (born Gustav Eriksson of the Vasa noble family, also called Gustav I) was King of Sweden from 1523 to 1560 and the founding father of Sweden. He brought Protestantism to Sweden and outmaneuvered the power of the Catholic Church. Every year on the 6th of June, Gustav’s name day, is celebrated as the Swedish national day to honor the electron of King Gustav Vasa.
Besides the sculpture, there are multiple exhibitions you can explore in the museum including:
The Arctic (Arctic Traces: Nature and Culture in Motion), exhibits the tools used in the Arctic and how people have lived in the Arctic through the years. It also brings up the topic of climate change and global warming. Notably, this exhibition is based on 3 years of research under Lotten Gustafsson Reinius, a visiting professor at Stockholm University.
On the right side of the lobby, you can see another exhibition: Strinderg vs. Youssef. It was created by an artist Daniel Youssef with inspiration from August Strindbuerg’s autobiographical novel Inferno. Inferno was written in French from 1896 to 1897. The book talks a lot about Strindberg’s obsession, e.g. occultism, alchemy, and shows signs of paranoia. The story behind the exhibition is interesting, but I am not going to lie, I indeed find the exhibition confusing and hard to interpret the display.
Worth mentioning that there are audio guides available in multiple languages for free!
Another exhibition is called British — Ever So Nordic. It displays the Nordic fashion, clothes style, and lifestyle that was influenced by Britain. One exhibition that I found quite interesting is the “Traditions” located on Level 3. The exhibition constructs the scenes and details of how Nordics celebrate Midsummer, Christmas, and Easter, and the history behind it. Next to this exhibition is the “Table Settings”. Basically, this exhibition shows the interiors and the table setting from the 16th century to circa 1950, including coffee and tea parties, tables for aperitifs, aquavit, and banquets. (You can also see a “Swan” in the exhibition).
The last exhibition that I went to was on Level 2 (Lobby) right next to the Children’s Playhouse. It demonstrates the setting of a traditional Nordic family and most of the displays there are interactive. However, I did not see any description on the official website, but it is worth taking a look!
Before leaving the museum, go to the museum shop and see if there is anything that you want to get as a souvenir and maybe have a real Swedish “fika” in the cafe on level 2.
Recommendation: 🌟🌟🌟/ 5
A must for those who love Nordic history!

I just finished my 5 km run. The sky was grey the whole time, but it didn’t start raining until the moment I stopped — like the weather had been holding back, waiting for me. As the first drops landed on my skin, I stood there, catching my breath, and suddenly I was somewhere else entirely.
Do you remember that day in Stockholm? Outside the Vasa Museum, the first snow of the week had started to melt into rain. We didn’t have an umbrella — of course we didn’t — and we just walked, laughing at how unprepared we were. I was giggling the whole time, remember? It was my first time experiencing snow. I must’ve looked ridiculous — eyes wide, hands out like I could catch the whole sky. But you just smiled and let me take it in. It was cold, but you didn’t complain. I think we were too caught up in the quiet magic of it all.
I closed my eyes today in the rain, and for a second, I could feel your hand in mine again. That desperate little run we made, slipping on cobblestones, trying to find shelter — we never really cared if we found one. Just being there, soaked and smiling, was enough.
I miss the way you looked at me like you wanted to say something, but didn’t. Like the silence between us held more than words ever could. I miss how we didn’t need to explain anything. Everything felt full already.
It’s strange how the body remembers. A cold wind, a wet sleeve — and suddenly I’m there again, with you.
Where are you now? Are you somewhere it’s raining too?
Always,Me

If I have to sum up 2024 it has to be ‘adventure’!
In the quest of making a pivot in my life, I made more than hundred new contacts this year. Every time I spoke with someone, I was looking for a match of vibration. And it actually worked like a story!
I clearly remember the morning when I stood outside a building in central Stockholm, inquisitive about what to expect in the meeting that was about to happen. The door opened, I was welcomed in. A nice lounge, then a kitchen with bananas on a plate. I asked if I can have one. I ran in the morning after breakfast and was exhausted of energy. The urge to have a banana overpowered my self-consciousness. Exchanging a few more sentences, it felt like here I am welcome to be who I am. It was encouraging to leave self-consciousness at the door.
The interaction with a group of people running this new AI firm was particularly positive. I met them again in a few days and it felt like they are brimming with passion to make something work. They have just started a venture and they are looking for someone sharing the vision. And it felt good.
They were fast, it took 3 weeks from the first meeting to the decision. They said this was one of the longest process! I had many questions in my mind, but positivity the company protruded overpowered it all. I matched their vibe, I felt genuinely welcome. The CTO promised me a laptop by the end of my first day. Little did I know that he literally meant it, in the evening while I was out running, I got a call from him, he was standing outside my door.
Working at an AI startup means quite a lot of new information to process everyday by everyone. We don’t have time to sit an ponder over frictions. We chase a common goal and try to resolve issues fast, that means talking more, opening up and showing earnest interest in the goals, finding what will make it work without triggering each other. Feedback loops are faster, tighter and effective. We are always learning and sharing.
There is a high intensity of external communication. We reach outs to people across the industry, write articles, active on social media, give credit to one another. My colleagues were happy to act as photographers, editors and writers to engage with the public, creating a strong thought leadership that draws visitors to our website without any external marketing help. And we pick up the phone and call! We gather most of our leads through our contacts, we make sure to present ourselves as who we are and present the strong determination to make AI agenda work, and our enthusiasm is contagious. There is a touch of genuinity in our proposals, we are a young company, innovative, ready to work, flexible. And we keep those promises that we make. No BS.
Some days are full of self doubt, prospects disappear suddenly, makes one feel small. The internal chat channels are saviors, its a lively space with messages, memes and regular business updates. We keep track of each other, not chasing hours, rather than putting in efforts to collaboratively build the brand. Its rare to have a day without a roller coaster of emotions from ‘Yayyy’ moments to existential doubts. Our salaries includes a fat portion of ‘Resilience’ which is unmatched in numbers. And it just grows, and the best part it I can cash out in any situation of my life, the ‘Resilience’ is the best fund to invest in, it will be with me through thick and thin and will be passed on in generations!
A startup business requires scaling down on lot of aspects. Conferences are silent time eaters, the more you go, the more time you need to process the information and to realign the offset it brings in schedule is weighed by the impact it brings. We don’t ditch it altogether but we are extremely choosy on what to attend. Post work gatherings on the other hand are so exciting and lively! We look forward to it, take turns to organize, sit and talk passionately about our lives and challenges. The conversations fuels the energy needs for the next couple of weeks, reloaded with laughter.
Its been 6 months, the company has grown more than a 100%. Its a dynamic environment yet quite simple, non-pretentious. Everyone brings their own self at work, with their creativity and ideas flowing beyond their roles and titles. If you work at a startup or know anyone working at one, verify if my claims. I am all ears for ‘adventures’ !

Following on from part one of my Stockholm trip at the Vasa Museet, this post reflects on my visit to Nationalmuseum — Sweden’s museum of art and design — and a conversation with Lena Eriksson, Head of Education.
Unlike my earlier visit to the bustling Vasa, this experience offered a quiet contrast. I met Lena on a Monday, when the museum was closed to the public. So instead of wandering the galleries, I had the chance to sit with Lena over coffee for a visit filled with insights rather than artworks.
Nationalmuseum is not just a museum, but also a government authority. Our mandate is to preserve cultural heritage and promote art, public interest in art, and knowledge of art. This mandate is set out in an annual letter of instruction from the Swedish government.
We want to put social development in perspective and be an active player in contemporary society.
This made me wonder: how different is a government-funded museum like this from a university museum? One key difference Lena highlighted was how shifts in government can directly impact priorities, including decisions around accessibility and entry fees. At the time of my visit, admission was 160 SEK (around £12.50), free for under-20s, but with no concessions for older adults or disabled visitors. Navigating such changes with each new administration must be complex, especially when core principles like accessibility can shift with political tides.
Lena also shared insights into the museum’s education programme, which, like many institutions, focuses heavily on children, families, and schools. Their website features a dedicated page for families, with free studio sessions every Sunday, the Oculus Walk — a self-guided family tour — and Villa Curiosa, a playful, sensory exhibition designed to spark curiosity and philosophical questions in children.
Naturally, my own research interests led the conversation towards older audiences. I was curious about the museum’s engagement with older adults and community groups.
As is so often the case, Lena explained that while some great work has been done — including sessions for people living with dementia, inspired by Meet Me at MoMA — these projects are often reliant on short-term external funding. Engagement with older adults still isn’t widely seen as a core part of museum work, despite Sweden’s super-ageing population.
One standout project during the pandemic connected older adults in Sweden and Japan through creative online dialogue — a beautiful example of how digital innovation can support inclusive, cross-cultural exchange.
Before wrapping up, I took a moment to check out Nationalmuseum’s accessibility information online. I was pleased to find it easily — just one click from the homepage — and even more impressed by the friendly, human tone of the opening message:
“We want Nationalmuseum to be open to everyone and are always working to improve our accessibility. If you have any questions or suggestions, we would be happy to hear from you.”
A small but meaningful sign that the museum is open not only to visitors, but to conversation and change.

With my other daughters occupied by their own half-term adventures, I opted for a city getaway to Stockholm; the bargain £29pp return flights played a huge part in my decision. When I’m on the lookout for affordable flights, I make it a habit to browse Skyscanner daily. Despite having to drive from the Midlands to Stansted Airport, the journey proved financially viable as we got cheap flights. Thanks to clear skies over Northern Europe, the flight itself was a mere two hours.
Stockholm in February unfolds like a fairytale, its cobblestone streets dusted with snow and its historic buildings adorned with twinkling lights. For travellers seeking an affordable escape, surprisingly this Scandinavian gem can offer a treasure trove of experiences without breaking the bank.
Embarking on a Winter Boat Trip
No visit to Stockholm would be complete without experiencing its beautiful winter scenery from the water. Despite the cold, a boat trip around Stockholm’s archipelago allows you to capture stunning views of the city draped in snow. Wrap up warmly and sip on hot beverages from the onboard café as you, immerse yourself in the tranquillity of Stockholm’s winter wonderland.
Discovering Stockholm’s Cultural Marvels
Delve into Stockholm’s rich cultural tapestry with visits to its renowned museums, including the ABBA Museum and the Vasa Museum. Dive into the pop phenomenon at the ABBA Museum, where interactive exhibits and karaoke booths bring the iconic band’s music to life. The Abba silent disco was hilarious, and my daughter and I made lasting memories. For a more educational visit then, journey back in time to the Vasa Museum, marvelling at the remarkably preserved Vasa ship that sank centuries ago in the harbour on its first voyage.
Indulging in the Culinary Scene
Stockholm’s culinary scene offers something for everyone. Don’t miss the chance to savour meatballs, a Swedish classic, paired with lingonberry sauce and creamy mashed potatoes or fermented herring. I follow a vegetarian diet, but there were plenty of delicious alternatives available. From mouthwatering vegan meatballs to falafel wraps and the comforting tradition of Fika — a hot drink paired with something sweet for a boost in cold weather — Stockholm offers an abundance of tasty dishes that won’t break the bank.
Unique Accommodation Aboard the Red Boat Hostel
For an unforgettable stay, book a room aboard the Red Boat Hostel, a floating haven nestled in Stockholm’s heart. Enjoy cosy rooms and breathtaking views of the city skyline or tranquil frozen waters surrounding the boat. With its budget-friendly rates, the hostel is the perfect choice. Plus, it’s impeccably clean, cosy, and offers a fantastic buffet breakfast.
Embracing Free Attractions
Maximise your budget with free activities, such as the brilliant and informative walking tour of Gamla Stan, Stockholm’s captivating Old Town. Wander through narrow alleyways and picturesque squares as your guide shares stories of the city’s medieval history. The knowledgeable guides generously volunteer their time, so show your appreciation by tipping them at the end of the tour. Sweden is a cash-free society, even the guides accept card for their tips.
From exploring world-class museums to indulging in culinary delicacies and embarking on free walking tours, there’s no shortage of affordable experiences awaiting you in this Scandinavian gem. Pack your bags, wrap up warm, and prepare for a memorable excursion filled with culture, cuisine, and adventure. #stockholm #citybreak #budgettravel #wintercitybreaks #copysella

Because it strikes the chord between kidnapper and captor for meeting the needs.
The primal pangs of hunger are often the driving force of human bonds. Hunger for us, is more than growling stomach.
Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs explains that a humans are motivated by five basic hungers.
a) Physiological hunger for air, water, food, shelter, and sleep.
b)Security hunger for health, property, employment.
c) Connection hunger for family, love, intimacy, friendship.
d)Psychological hunger for esteem, respect.
e) Metaphysical hunger for self actualization.
Being the head of the community vocational program designed for providing employment opportunities to girls, I’ve come across some baffling cases of marriages. No matter what the degree of abuse, these women never fail to patronize their husbands.
After listening to few girls, I decided to take an inventory to write and see that NEEDS can be irrational and self-deprecating at times.
I talked to more than 10 women from abusive marriages apparently. And to my utter shock they were point blanc unwilling to walk out of the marriage because they thought that however barbaric, they were protected from outer terror-fueled world.
Besides safety, they had one more thing in common – strong attachment.
Just like the victims of Stockholm syndrome. As they fell for their captors and develop a soft bond of connection with them. Because mostly the captors are the one’s who fulfill their basic needs like food and medicine and often physical intimacy when the require to process the trauma of being hijacked or kidnapped.
This is not very common, to fall in love for your kidnapper or captor but happens with people with low self esteem and history of abuse.
When I talked to these women, they were rude and said – better worship one man than be a raw piece of meat to wolves out there.
One of the girl who’s hardly 25 years, told me that her husband after thrashing her hard, treats her with sex and restaurant food. After beating the shit out of her when she is in pain, he doesn’t allows her to cook food. Even takes her to the doctor for treating all the bloody bruises. In this situation when she is being treated so well, she thinks of him as an emergency God. Especially when there is no support from the family.
Psychologists says that terror-bonding and feeling empathy rather than rage towards your captor is the classic example of Stockholm Syndrome. It can also develop between abusive parents and children. Where the child may feel protective toward the parent and try mending the ways to keep the parents happy, unsuccessfully.
When I tried to educate these girls on the psychology of the syndrome, they were reluctant to understand.
As they feel that bonding with their captors( read husbands) after years of intimacy is their survival strategy and looking for normality within the framework of chaos and distress.
What’s wrong in choosing bad when you have the worst? Saying this one of the girl slaps her butt and walks off to stich a new pattern of dress she’s learning under the program.
Psychological abuse is much deeper than we can imagine. It becomes the way of life when the victims have never seen the other side.
Listening to some of the girls – and coming from non-psychological background – there were times I was compelled to see their POVs.
No financial independence and emotional part of the brains shackled tightly.
I believe in rewriting these narratives women needs exposure, life skills, and independence of all nature.
Education on self-esteem, respect. But on top of all education on self-discovery, non-reliance and then finances.

In January of 2019, I started at a new company, which has its headquarter in Stockholm. It was clear that I would — at some point — travel to the capital city of Sweden to pay a visit to the main office. The first opportunity for this was an internal two-day-workshop. There were several options for the date I could choose from. I decided for the Wednesday and Thursday directly after Easter. This way, I could do use the public holidays plus only two additional vacation days to have a ten-day-travel. Two of those days, of course, for the workshop. The remaining days were free for visiting Stockholm. But with eight days at disposal, I decided to spend the first few days (Good Friday until Easter Monday) in the Norwegian capital instead.
As my company also has an office in Oslo, the idea was to meet up with some colleagues for a coffee or lunch. What I wasn’t aware of is that the Easter days are used by the Norwegians usually to spend their time skiing in the mountains. So nearly no one was even in the city and my plan to meet the local colleagues didn’t work out as planned.
20.473 steps.
To get from Oslo-Gardermoen Airport to the central station, there are basically two options: the Flytorget express train (196 NOK; 22 min) and the regional trains operated by NSB (105 NOK; 23 min), such as the R10. I chose the latter. Due to the cancellation of the flight by EasyJet I had intended to take to Oslo, I had to travel a few hours earlier than planned. Which also meant to arrive more prior in Oslo. But as the hotel I booked only offered check-in from 15:00, I had to come up with something to kill time. Unfortunately, this also meant to carry my backpack around the city as well, weighing about eight kilograms. During my first walk through the town, I already visited the Munch museum, but the famous scream was not on display, unfortunately.
One of the things I usually try to do is having a walk around the neighborhood of my hotel on the first day. This gives me quite a good feeling about the area, and I can check out where I can get some snacks for the evening and more importantly: bottled water. It’s not about not trusting the hotels tap water. But when I’m walking around the city for sightseeing, I avoid buying food or drinks in places crowded with tourists, as the prices are a bit higher there. My recommendation is to walk the narrow, little side streets and try to take a different route each time. I usually start in a general direction and find the path as I go depending on which way look more appealing. This method will give you a better picture of the city, and you will find the restaurants where the locals eat. These typically serve good quality for more reasonable prices compared to the restaurants located directly at the usual tourist routes.
28.984 steps.
For the first full day in the city, I decided to book the Oslo Pass for 24 hours using their Android app, which was very convenient. This pass already included public transport. Using this, I took the bus 30 to the peninsula of Bygdøy for visiting the Viking Ship Museum, the Holocaust Center, the Norwegian Maritime Museum, the Fram Museum, and the Kon-Tiki Museum. The Fram Museum got built around the ship of the same name, which was used for polar explorations and the museum included many stories of exploratory expeditions for the north and south pole. All of the mentioned museums had excellent exhibitions and are also suitable for tourists as items are mostly labeled in Norwegian as well as English. I originally planned to include the Norwegian Museum of Cultural History while being in Bygdøy, but instead decided to take the ferry back to the central city. After leaving the boat, I headed for the Akershus fortress, where I wanted to visit Norway’s Resistance Museum and the Norwegian Military History Museum, but both were closed for Easter. Continuing the tour of museums, I took a streetcar to Frogner Plass, to visit the Vigeland Museum about the work of sculptor Gustav Vigeland. Oslo’s city museum is just around the corner, displaying the history of Oslo or Christiania, as the city was named between 1624 and 1924. After I had to leave (as they were closing), I went back with the streetcar and having my last stop for that day, the Nobel Peace Center. This museum was designed very nicely and worth a visit.
After being afoot for more than ten hours that day, I arrived back to my hotel. Although I already knew there was a high rate of electric cars in the Nordic countries, I was still really impressed by seeing at least one Tesla in every single street. There were electric cars of other brands as well but less prominent. Furthermore, there are also quite a lot of electric scooters in the city. Problematic in this context is that they seemed to be allowed on the sidewalks, which I think is pretty dangerous. In fact, Austria just banned them from the sidewalks for this reason, and France plans to do the same.
20.236 steps.
For Easter Sunday, I booked a boat tour around the Oslofjord in the week before traveling. This tour lasted about 2 hours and might have been one of the main factors for my sunburn that I took from Oslo as a souvenir. This tour also included some facts about the buildings at the shores of the fjord and some local history. The Oslofjord is distinctive among the fjords of Norway, as it is one of the oldest, and was not formed by a moving glacier but being part of the Olso rift. After returning to the harbor, I headed to the Royal Palace, as the changing of the guard was going to happen at 13:30.
Although the park around the royal palace is quite lovely and open to the public, I went to Vigelandparken afterward, to see the sculptures, of which I had only seen the models in the museum the day before. I wasn’t the only one with this idea that day. The sun attracted a lot of people, who wanted to enjoy the beautiful sunny weather in the park. There were also some people around which seemed to me as they would be geocaching. And after looking at the map of caches around, I also started to visit some of them in the park as well as outside, while walking back to the city center. The downside was I got so distracted with geocaching, that I left my DSLR camera on a bench next to one cache. As James May would say: C**k!
C**k!
— James May
So I walked back the route I just walked as I was trying to remember when the last time was I had the camera in my hands. Fortunately, a Norwegian couple walked towards me, while I was approaching Vigelandpark again. The guy is carrying a DSLR camera around his neck. Hm, that looks exactly like the one I just lost. It even has the bubble level on it. Wait. Is that mine? It was. He handed it over and explained that they left a note where I lost it, stating they would bring it to the next police station. After having a short chat, I thanked them again, and we split up. As this was enough stress for one day, I decided the next thing I would do is to have a burger and a beer. For this, I stepped in at “The Scotsman.” Like other Norwegian places, you have to get a table first, remember the table number, and then walk up to the bar for ordering. In the background, I could watch the Premier League, as Everton vs. Manchester United was ending, followed by Cardiff vs. Liverpool. A friendly way to end this day.
8.563 steps.
On Easter Monday it was already time to leave Oslo and get on the plane for Stockholm. Somehow, I thought my flight would take off at 10:30 in the morning. Therefore I tried to be at the airport at 9:00, which worked. But somehow I had the wrong time in mind, as my flight was actually scheduled for 12:40. Well, time to find a seat and continue reading my book. But first, let’s find a pharmacy to get something to treat my sunburn. As I don’t speak any Norwegian, I took some time and was switching between shelves back and forth. In the end, I settled for a product which seemed suitable and was small enough to take on the plane. At the cashier, I didn’t have to pay anything. I was confused. The clerk pointed to a sticker on the product, which explained (in Norwegian of course) that I just found an Easter egg. This kind of ‘hide and seek’ seems to be a common thing in some Norwegian shops. It reminded me of some chocolate hidden in the Akershus fortress I noticed when I was there two days before.
After arriving at Stockholm central station, I looked for a supermarket to get bottled water and some lunch/dinner to eat in the hotel. I found a coop with a nice salad bar. And as I was in Sweden now, I couldn’t resist buying about two kilograms of Swedish candy which I emptied over the next couple of evenings at the hotel.
26.940 steps.
As the hotel I stayed at in Stockholm is named “Hotel with Urban Deli,” you can imagine that the breakfast you get here is not standard. Italian-style salami, fresh bread, fruits, yogurt, smoothies, a good selection of loose tea. There was nothing I missed and nothing I could complain about. Everything was fresh and of high quality.
After the great breakfast, I walked a bit around the neighborhood, without a specific destination in mind. While walking towards Gamla Stan, the old city, I came by the Mediterranean Museum. It has a broad selection of items from different cultures around the Mediterranean Sea, including Egypt, ancient Rome, etc. It mainly showcased the evolution of beliefs for life after death and corresponding funeral rituals. After a short stop for a chat and coffee at my company’s main office, I visited the Swedish Army Museum. Showing the history of the Swedish military equipment in the context of the timeline of wars Sweden fought.
As it was already too late for visiting the Swedish History Museum or the Royal Armory, I decided to have a short break at the hotel, before attending a 1,5 h guided tour through Gamla Stan. The tour named “The Ghost Walk” explained some of the darker aspects of Stockholm’s history and was presented by a guide, who was loving his role and tried to send chills down our spines. If you do one guided tour in Stockholm, do this!
Combined: 13.259 steps.
Here it comes, the reason I planned to travel to Stockholm in the first place. A two-day-workshop about communication and personalities. There was a lot of input I received here and lots of things I have to recap after the travel. We were eleven people in this workshop including the facilitator, most of which Swedish. Apart from having fun during the workshop doing some role-plays, we also got to know each other during joined breakfast, lunch and dinner on both days.
17.878 steps.
As the workshop days were a bit exhausting, I started this day a bit later. The breakfast in the hotel was again a great way to do this. But I passed on coffee at the hotel, as I had an appointment for coffee with someone at the company’s office again. Even though this was during my official vacation days, I took to opportunity to have coffee with some colleagues I usually would not meet (as we work in different cities).
While walking to the Royal Palace, I already noticed military marching music playing somewhere. The royal music corps was already on the way to the palace half an hour before the changing of the guard would take place (scheduled for 12:30). I wasn’t the only one having the idea of watching this today. People flooded the area in front of the palace, barely being contained by a few guards to secure the ceremony would have enough room to take place. Although I didn’t understand a single word they said via the public speaker system, it was still quite a show to experience. As the same ceremony in Oslo didn’t contain a music corps, a comparison would be unfair.
One of the most famous landmarks of Stockholm is the city hall though, the Stadshus. The Nobel prizes are awarded here, except for the Nobel Peace Prize which we spoke of before. And there are also some geocaches around. After having spent the majority of the day in parks, I headed back to the office, where an event for new hires was going to happen including Swedish student’s drinking songs, occasionally interrupted by some 15-minute talks. Another opportunity for mingling with colleagues I usually wouldn’t meet.
26.420 steps.
All the things that usually would cost an entrance fee were left for today. Firstly, because I planned to use the Stockholm pass this day, which even gets cheaper if you buy it online and then use the QR code from the mail. Secondly, because of the Stockholm Kulturnatt. Between 18:00 and midnight, a lot of museums and other places were free to visit and offered special tours or exhibitions. But the first thing I had planned for this day was to take the ferry from Klara Mälarstrand to the Royal Domain of Drottningholm to visit the palace and its surrounding park which are part of UNESCO’s world heritage list. The richly decorated palace and its park are worth a visit. In contrast to my boat tour in Oslo, I was prepared with some sun blocker this time.
After arriving back to Klara Mälarstrand, I walked towards Gamla Stan to revisit the Royal Palace. This time also from the inside. With the Stockholm pass, I could directly walk up to the entrance without the need to buy a separate ticket at the desk located in a side wing. At the admission checkpoint, you will be asked to wear your backpack in front of you. I forgot to ask why. In nearly every room, there is a little sign explaining the purpose and history of that room, from bedrooms to audience rooms. As the monarchs introduced a few different orders of chivalry over the years, there are also some rooms dedicated to them. There is a room for the Order of the Polar Star, another room for the Royal Order of the Seraphim, and so on.
Maybe the most prestigious award in the world is the Nobel Prize. Apart from the Nobel Peace Prize, the Nobel Prizes are awarded in the city hall of Stockholm. In 2001, the Nobel Museum opened in Stockholm, which was the next place to visit for me. In here you can find the history of the inception of the Nobel Prizes and temporary exhibition about Martin Luther King Jr. who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, one year after his famous speech.
The probably most popular museum in Stockholm though is the Vasa Museum. The Vasa was a ship built in the 1620s by order of Swedish king for demonstrating the great power of his empire. As he was continually changing his mind about the design of the vessel and demanding to include a higher number of cannons every time, the ship’s buoyancy was put in danger. In fact, after being hit by a mild gust, she sank during her maiden voyage while still being in the harbor of Stockholm. 333 years later, she was recovered, and the museum was built around her.
As the museums had to prepare for the Kultunatt, they all closed at 17:00. During the one hour wait for them to reopen again, I went to eat real Swedish Köttbullar with mashed potatoes and lingonberries at Sjöcafeet. Afterward, I was fit again to continue with the Kultunatt, starting back at the Vasa Museum, as I didn’t manage to see everything on the first visit. Of course, there was quite a queue for the museum building up. On the same island, there is also the Spritmuseum showcasing alcoholic beverages in the context of culture and society. It also included a temporary exhibition about food consumption and consumer behavior in general. Just a few meters further, the Nordic Museum waited to be visited, showing the history of Swedish culture. The focus for the Kulturnatt was put on how Swedish people dressed throughout the decades.
4.500 steps.
Two days before, I coincidentally read a mail from SAS stating that strikes might occur due to ongoing negotiations with their pilots. As my flight wasn’t booked with SAS directly, but via a travel agency, I had to talk to them for asking what was going to happen now. But my flight was not officially canceled yet. So I had to wait. On the next day, I rechecked the status of my flight and saw that it was canceled now. After talking to the agency again, they couldn’t book an alternative flight for me, for organizational reasons. So I had to see for myself how I would be traveling back home. I found a flight operated by a company I never heard of before, with a stop in a city I have never heard if before. And I started at Stockholm Bromma Airport now, instead of Arlanda, which in the end didn’t make any difference in my travel time though. But the 2,5 h stop in Växjö did.
Unfortunately, the Växjö Småland Airport didn’t have a transit area, so after having walked from the aircraft to the airport building, I was already out of the security area. So I had to go through another security check for getting to the gate. THE gate. There was exactly one. As only five flights departed from that airport in total on that day, they don’t need more. It’s the smallest international airport I ever visited. But it was relaxing as well. I used the time to continue the book I was reading, and soon enough it was time to board the same aircraft again for the flight to Berlin. In the end, I landed safely at Berlin-Tegel Airport and was happy to be back home.

So, it’s taken a bit of time to get this blog up… but, in this forth blog post in my #StockholmSeries, I reflect on visits to two neighbouring museums in Stockholm — ArkDes and Moderna Museet…
I came across ArkDes — the Swedish Centre for Architecture and Design — while I was exploring places to visit on this research trip.
I saw that “Admission to ArkDes is free throughout 2025” which was fantastic, but I was also really intrigued by a project they’re running — Unboxing, which runs every day for two hours enabling you to meet and chat to one of the museum’s curators.
Unboxing is the place where you, together with the museum’s curators, unpack and explore never-before-seen items from the museum’s underground archives.
I was interested by the concept of bringing the collection into a different space, giving visitors the opportunity to see behind the scenes, and the museum’s commitment to this being available to everyone, everyday. It blurred the line between exhibit and experience — a quiet but clever way to shift how people relate to the space.
I went straight to the space, which was easy to navigate to from the front of the gallery. Unboxing provides the opportunity for the museum to engage with visitors in a different way, gives curators the chance to talk about their passion, and for visitors to experience objects from the collection — for me, this was seeing architectural drawings — in a different way.
Next door at Moderna Museet, the invitation to engage was everywhere: tables with drawing paper, sketchbook stations, scattered books and varied seating. Each space offered a different kind of welcome, always with a gentle prompt to pause, reflect or create. I loved the moments of rest — especially a bench by a floor-to-ceiling window tucked behind a door marked “staff only” — an unintentional but beautiful in-between space.
I also met with staff from both museums, who spoke about the challenges (and small wins) of increasing access and inclusion, from updating signage to navigating funding and policy shifts. It was a reminder that innovation doesn’t always come from big gestures — it often lives in the details.

More than 100 miles north of the Arctic Circle, our Vy train to Narvik climbed an other-worldly landscape of lakes, rivers and waterfalls, dotted with cabins painted in Scandinavia’s iconic Falu red with white trim.
I was thousands of miles from home, and I felt as if I were on another planet.
Population and vegetation were sparse as we climbed in latitude and altitude, crossing through the Scandinavian Mountain range that forms the border between Sweden and Norway.
I have logged more than 40,000 miles by rail, and love trains so much that I’ve made slow train travel the subject of my master’s capstone. I have always been intrigued by the Arctic, drawn to the northern reaches when looking at maps. And for 24 hours in mid-October, I had the privilege of bringing these two interests together with a 637-mile train trip from Stockholm, Sweden, to Narvik, Norway.
After 48 hours in Stockholm with our cousins, my brother Michael and I arrived at Stockholms Centralstation — a 151-year-old transportation hub that draws 200,000 visitors every day — with about 45 minutes to spare, my bags a little heavier than when I first arrived in the Swedish capital.
Our sleeper train would take us through Swedish forests, over steep mountains and down to the Norwegian port city of Narvik, where we would catch a 4-hour bus ride even farther north to Tromsø, the third largest city above the Arctic Circle.
I grabbed one last cardamom bun at Stockholms Centralstation — my fourth in 48 hours — before we boarded. I had always associated cardamom with Middle Eastern food, but Sweden and Norway consume 18 and 30 times more cardamom than the global median, and cardamom buns were everywhere in Stockholm. Not knowing where I would find one again, I couldn’t resist one more.
When the train rolled in to the station, we found our car and boarded, joining a crowd of passengers from other parts of the world. I heard Italian, Chinese, and a lot of non-native English.
We had booked a couchette, a small space for six people, two benches facing each other by day, three beds on each side by night. I was hoping we’d have the space to ourselves, but we had the next best thing: just one other passenger, a quiet youngish man in a striped t-shirt and a baseball cap who had a bunk at the very top.
Mike and I didn’t stay long in the couchette. As soon as the attendant checked our tickets, we headed to the dining car, where we could sit at a table and enjoy some Bottenvikkens brews from northern Sweden and be around other passengers.
For dinner, I couldn’t pass up the most unique dish — reindeer stew with potatoes, mushrooms and lingonberries. Other offerings included folded flatbread with fried egg and Jokkmokk-sausage, and classic Swedish shrimp sandwich. Each boxed dinner bore the words “We proudly serve food made from scratch in Luleå.”
After dinner, I broke into the sampler pack of aquavit that I had purchased at the liquor store in the Åhléns department store in Stockholm.
One after another, we split four tiny bottles, each one with a different combination of flavors, including dill, caraway, rosemary, citrus, cumin, anise, sherry and cinnamon.
I split each between two glasses, and as we would do throughout our weeklong trip, Mike and I toasted with the Scandinavian “skål” first tapping each other’s glass, then tapping our own glass to the table as a toast to the house before taking the first sip.
Back at the couchette, we made our beds as quietly as we could, knowing that someone else was above us. I would have hated to be in his position, so close to the ceiling. I slept relatively well, waking up every so often to peek outside, in vain, to see if I could see the Northern Lights.
I knew that the restaurant car would open at 5 am and, wanting to be among the early risers, I got up at 5:30 to head down there.
The train was stopped at the Älvsbyn station, and as I made my way to the restaurant car, I found an open door and stuck my head out for fresh air. There I met a train attendant who told me we were stuck for a bit, awaiting information on when we could proceed. I sat and had my tea, texting with my mom and waiting — and waiting — and waiting.
I had oatmeal with cardamom, granola and lingonberries, and we waited some more.
After an hour of “we will know soon,” we were told that due to track problems ahead, we would have to take a bus to Boden and board a new train there, not arriving in Narvik until after 5 pm, long after our bus — and a final subsequent bus — to Tromsø would have departed.
At around 9:30 am, a bus arrived to take us to Boden. It meandered through Swedish forestland, the first of many, many, many miles of it that we would see in the coming hours.
I was disappointed to learn that the train we would board at Boden was a day train, lacking many of the amenities of our night train, namely, my favorite one, the restaurant car. We could buy food and drinks, but with no communal place to eat, we would have to take them back to our seats. We were assigned two window seats, one behind another.
The portion of the trip north of Boden is on a stretch of track known as the Iron Ore Line, which connects Luleå, Sweden, on the Gulf of Bothnia, with Narvik, Norway, on the North Sea.
The line was completed in 1903 to bring iron ore from Sweden to Narvik. Trains on this line have run on electric power since at least 1923 (while the vast majority of track in the United States remains non-electrified a century later). The line still transports iron ore from Kiruna, Svappavaara and Malmberget, as well as shipments of food, to the north, and fish to the south.
Watching the forests pass us by, I tried to detect changes as we moved north into a different climate. Most of the route seemed to be a dense mix of birches that were losing their leaves — a few weeks ahead of the brilliant yellow trees in Stockholm — and conifers.
As we neared the Arctic Circle, the birches had lost all their leaves, and they seemed to be fewer in number. The conifers, too, were fewer, as the dense forests grew more sparse.
What was also sparse here — noise. I like to chat with other people on trains, but this car was silent. We seemed to be the only Americans on board. Other passengers included a young British couple, a middle aged Scottish couple that we would bump into outside a pub in Narvik later that night, a group of about eight Asian people, and the rest seemed Norwegian, Swedish or German.
A walk to the coach area adjacent to the bistro was a much different story — a group of Italians were talking loudly and fast. I loved to hear it and wished we were seated with them.
Crossing the Arctic Circle was not as eventful as I expected. I had marked the spot on my Google maps a couple weeks prior to the trip so that I would know the exact moment we crossed. We passed a sign marking the spot — Polcirkeln — just before the mark on my phone. In any case, I had never before been above the Arctic Circle, so it was an exciting moment — and we still had miles and miles and miles to go.
Most of my long-distance train travel has been in the United States, where I marvel at the vast expanses of open space. With an average density of 35 people per square kilometer, the United States is half as dense as Europe, which has 73 people per square kilometer. However, for this trip, I was traveling through countries far less dense than even the United States: Sweden has 23 people per square kilometer, and Norway has only 17, about half the density of the United States. The land here was wide open.
As we pressed farther north, the train did not take on many new passengers, meaning the train, too, was not densely populated. We mostly discharged passengers, especially at Kiruna, a mining town in Swedish Lapland with about 23,000 inhabitants.
The landscape continued to change. The forested hills of southern Sweden were replaced by flatter land, shorter trees, and lots of lakes. In the distance, we could begin to see the Scandinavian Mountains, the range that runs the length of the border between Sweden and Norway, which we would soon be crossing.
After Kiruna, we could really spread out, which for me meant that I could move from the left side of the train to the right to take photos and video. It was here that we engaged in conversation with some fellow passengers.
Lars, from Bavaria, was going to Abisko, where he planned to take two 20-km hikes before continuing on to the Lofoten archipelago for a few days, and then down to Bodø by bus, and by train farther the south, to be possibly followed by a ferry to Denmark. He was clearly a fan of traveling by land and sea — and had the time to do so.
Ann, from Aarhus, was now living in Tromsø, traveling back north by land because of the detrimental effects air travel has on the climate. She was frustrated by how long and expensive the ride was, and how governments fell short of making it easier for people to make the right choices. Our delay would make her long trip longer and more costly for her. I shared her frustration, but reminded her that much of Europe is light years ahead of the United States when it comes to climate-friendly travel options.
I can’t say enough about the last few hours of that train ride.
After Abisko, the train began to climb the Scandinavian Mountains, reaching a height of about 1,700 feet above sea level, alongside mountains that towered much higher.
The word tundra always connoted to me some distant exotic landscape, something one finds in a nature book or a textbook. Now, I was riding through it, seeing it with my own eyes.
Mosses, lichens and low shrubs offered some color against the rugged, exposed rock. Birches that had long lost their leaves appeared here and there. If not for the sporadic red and gray cabins, I would have thought that a wildfire had recently wiped out this area.
To be more specific, we were crossing through a biome known as the Scandinavian Montane Birch Forests and Grasslands, a tundra ecoregion that spans much of Norway, as well as parts of northern Sweden and Finland.
Though I couldn’t identify them at the time, I later learned that many of the low shrubs I was seeing was likely a mix of crowberry, reindeer lichen, cloudberry, bilberry and wolf’s bane.
The trees were largely downy birches — I could easily identify birches by their white bark — that would grow no taller than 2 to 3 meters, but also may have included aspen, Scots pine, juniper, grey alder, rowan, goat willow and bird cherry.
We passed many alpine lakes that would soon freeze over under the coming polar night. Under the surface likely swam char, trout, tench and minnow.
In Sweden, the lakes all ended in -jávri (Báktájávri, Loktajávri, Vássejávri) the word for “lake” in the Northern Sami language. Once we crossed to Norway, they ended -vatnet (Brudeslørvatnet, Hansenvatnet, Telegrafvatnet) Norwegian for “the water.”
The sun hung low near the horizon, and I was grateful that despite the delay, we were not passing through this stretch in darkness. As I publish this in mid-November, sunset in Kiruna is 1:57 pm. On December 10, the sun will set at 11:48 am, and not rise again until 11:25 am on January 2.
In our destination of Narvik, the sun remains below the horizon from December 6 to January 7.
As we continued westward toward Norway, we hugged the side of mountains, going through several tunnels and snow sheds. Across the valley, I could see waterfalls, like ribbons spaced out on the side of the mountains. I spent much of the last hour or so in the back of the train, where I had space to myself to open and close windows on either side, and take video out of the left, right and rear of the train.
We made several stops in remote towns I could neither pronounce — Låktatjåkka, Vassijaure, Katterkåkk, Riksgränsen — nor imagine living in.
We crossed the Sweden-Norway border inside a tunnel, with the colors of the Swedish flag painted inside, changing over to the colors of the Norwegian flag.
The rail line from the border to Narvik is known as the Ofoten line, and it brought us from an elevation of 1,700 feet down to sea level over the course of 27 miles, as we made the final stretch to our destination.
Soon, we could see a body of water below, the Rombaken, a 12-mile long fjord that was the site of several naval battles during the 1940 Battle of Narvik. The fjord branches out from Narvik’s Ofotfjorden.
As we passed the massive suspension bridge that connects Narvik to Øyjorda across the fjord, we knew it was time for us to gather our bags, say farewell to Ann — with the chance we might see her on our predawn bus ride 12 hours later — and disembark, 637 miles from Stockholm and 130 miles above the Arctic circle.
At Narvik, we walked a half mile through a cloudy mist to the Scandic hotel. At nearly $200, it was the most expensive place to stay, but it was also closest to the bus station, it had a sky bar, and I was fairly confident it could be reimbursed by either the rail company or my credit card insurance.
It didn’t disappoint. The sky bar was amazing, with a nearly 360-degree view of the city. I can’t imagine being there to see either the Northern Lights or the midnight sun. But in our case, it was a cloudy and drizzly night, without much to see in the sky, but the view of the town was nonetheless fascinating.
After a drink and a massive charcuterie board, we left for Narvikguten pub, making a small loop up a hill to see what we could of the full moon. As we entered the pub, we ran into a Scottish couple from the train. I felt bad that they didn’t stick around, saying the prices were “too dear” for them, and that their pounds were especially weak these days. They were in Narvik just to check out the Arctic, heading back south soon and continuing on to Spain after.
We took seats at the bar, realizing quickly that not food would be served there. Into our second beer, we decided that dinner was not entirely necessary after the charcuterie board. We struck up a conversation with the guy next to me, Gus, originally from Oslo and now living in the north with his fiancé. He was a bartender at the bar, drinking there on his day off, stepping out occasionally for a hand-rolled cigarette.
It was interesting — and refreshing — to hear his impressions of Americans. He saw a disconnect between Americans’ personalities and what he reads in the news. We are a welcoming people, he said, based on the conversations he had with Americans on all sides of the political spectrum. But if you judged us based on what you saw in the news, what would you think, I asked? I’d think you were absolutely out of your minds crazy, he said.
During our conversation, our bartender handed Gus two buttons, meant for Mike and me. They bore the name and logo of the pub. They said it was their stamp of approval on us as visitors, and that they welcomed us back any time.
After three or four or more beers, we called it a night, returned the to sky bar for a nightcap and a bag of chips — and then turned in, alarms set for 4:15 am to make our 5:30 am bus ride, an additional four hours to the North.

Have you ever found yourself sympathizing with a known racist person or group of people? If so, this article will provide you with a lantern to make it out of the mental fog. Racism is a form of abuse. While most people do not develop Stockholm Syndrome during an abusive encounter, some do. They produce a psychological response that causes them to develop positive associations with an abuser.
You’ve probably heard about examples of Stockholm Syndrome in bank robberies, kidnappings, and domestic violence circumstances. However, there is no reason why we shouldn’t analyze how race factors into abusive relationships. I suggest that Black people and people of color who develop positive feelings about racists actually suffer from Racial Stockholm Syndrome.
Consider Uncle Ruckus from The Boondocks animated series. He is a dark-skinned Black man who often denies his Blackness, praises white people while condemning Black people. For example, Uncle Ruckus sang, “Colored folks talkin’ about ‘Save Me!’ / Wasn’t nothin’ wrong with slavery! / At least we got good food back then — uh huh, uh huh! / White man sho could be yo friend.”

In Los Angeles, the suburbs would always grow boring- a boredom similar to the tiring feeling of hearing the same song played over and over. At Princeton, you feel like you’re living in Neverland- nothing seems to change, and you always have this warm sense of quiet comfort. In Beijing, the weekends are occupied with sight seeing and night life, and the weekdays always seem to be moving in some direction.
Stockholm, Sweden is the most stable place I have ever lived. It’s also one of the most beautiful. Here’s a quick peep of the fountain right outside of my apartment:
Whenever I need a break from life, I always take a few minutes to sit by the water. Every few seconds, the wind blows the mist in your direction and you feel a momentary, gentle spray. It feels nice, like a cool, refreshing blanket that wraps around your shoulders. This is especially comforting when I think about home and the happier, safer days at Princeton.
And here’s a little view of the bridge connecting the main island with Gamla stan, the “old town” of Stockholm that’s apparently a tourist trap:
During breaks and weekends, my friends and I would take short strolls around the city, and since the majority of Stockholm is built on water, the beautiful views are never-ending. Occasionally, I would find time to walk around the city on my own. As much as I hate being alone, I could explore this place for hours, aimlessly wandering and appreciating the bits and pieces of Europe.
For those of you who don’t know, I’m here interning for a company called Nova Global, a top-talent network that finds talented people around the world and yada yada yada. Work has been amazing, and I absolutely love my coworkers-they’ve been a family to me.
But oddly enough, the memories that I’ve appreciated the most belong to the little lessons of the day-to-day life. Every single morning, I find time to go to the gym and exercise before work. And every single afternoon when I get back from work, I do the same. I’ve cooked nearly every other meal (Nikita, my friend/roommate, cooks the other half), and when the sink looks a little messy I’ll hop right on the dishes. Thanks to Nikita (he used to be a Latvian pro swimmer), I’ve learned how to prepare huge meals that are so healthy, you’d definitely have plenty left over unless you see the guy next to you scarfing down each last bit. I’m really grateful he’s here- he’s been like an older brother to me.
After reading this over, part of me wants to cringe at how spoiled I probably sound, but I don’t think I’ve been this happy for months. The first week was hard, but I finally feel like the background noise is subsiding and I’m regaining clarity and focus again. I’m finally back in my own skin.
Part of me will always be a little sad that I can’t return to the naive, safe-haven of my Sophomore year at Princeton, but I’m happy, and I’m remembering what it means to take life in strides. Week one has done me well, and I know that I’ll always find some way to appreciate each day.
A few notes about Stockholm:
Yesterday, my friends and I decided to take an impromptu cycling trip through Lidingö, a nature reserve slightly northeast of where we lived. Within half an hour, our surroundings transformed from high-rises and busy city intersections into miles and miles of forest and greenery.
Needless to say, it didn’t take long for a group of foreigners to get unbelievably lost on a never-ending trail of that. And every time I shouted to Nikita and asked if he knew where we were, we just laughed and shrugged. It was pure exploration, with no direction and no destination. It’s really been quite some time since I’ve felt so free.
Saturday afternoon, a day prior to the three hour excursion through “fucking” Lidingö (sorry folks, it’s an inside joke), Lucy and Tara convinced me to explore parts of Söldermalm with them. Similar to my little cycling adventure, most of our trip consisted of aimless wandering, letting our minds digest all the “new” that was around us.
For some reason, the entire time I wouldn’t stop chirping about how I wanted to walk along the water. Söldermalm was beautiful- arguably the most beautiful area of Stockholm I’ve seen yet- but part of me was drawn so strongly toward the water. And somehow, we eventually found ourselves standing near a cliffside that held the most breath-taking view I’ve ever seen. There was something special about the sight that restored that warm, comforting feeling that I’ve felt lacking for a while. It’s probably the happiest moment that I’ve had since I’ve landed in Stockholm.
That was when I decided that I wanted my summer to be characterized by serendipity. Week One was characterized by routine and stability, and it’s done me well. But weeks Two through Ten are going to be filled with aimless exploration and travel. I’m booked to fly off to some new country nearly every weekend, and I’m searching for something “new” everyday. It’s almost like I’ve grown an addiction to novelty.
If there’s anything I’ve learned from “fucking” Lindingö, it’s that it’s OK to get incredibly dehydrated and lost in a forest for three hours. We made more than a few wrong turns, but everyone made it out (more-or-less) alright.
Here’s a list of “new” things I’ve checked off or have yet to check off:
Part of me wishes that my mind read like a book, and that it would scribble down every moment I encountered just as it happened- a Carpe Diem recorder of some sort, I guess. But it doesn’t and it can’t, so I’ll do my best to capture how important this weekend in Amsterdam was to me.
Better yet, let me clarify: I’ll do my best to capture how important this burger-loving fiend is to me (sorry JD, but the picture’s gotta go online):
On July 15, 2015, JD Case touched down in Stockholm, and that’s when the (stupid decisions) adventures of Nathan in Europe really began. Europe, or at least the small portion of it I’ve seen, is great, but there’s always this thin cloak of nostalgia for the lazy, naïve days of year two at Princeton. There’s plenty I miss- the spontaneous trips to Starbucks, the 3 AM League games, the Papa Johns, the 3 AM Papa Johns- and I couldn’t have been more grateful that a part of that was able to visit me halfway around the world.
Last week, I surrendered my summer to serendipity, and the aimless exploration continued when we landed in Amsterdam. We hadn’t booked a place to stay until the day of, but JD was able to nab us a few nice spots for a really good price. Here’s a glimpse of the view outside of the aptly named “RoomMate Hotel”:
If Stockholm’s a stable, structured meeting where everyone in the room is prim, proper, and on time, Amsterdam’s a massive, rambunctious bar where everyone’s intoxicated by early evening. Perhaps it was the company, but the city of bikes and beer is definitely one of my favorite places to be. For those of you who don’t know, JD’s spending this summer traveling the entire world. During our conversations, he mentioned that he never missed home much because with every new place, there was always something new to see and experience. And in Amsterdam, that statement couldn’t be any more true.
Wherever you go, the bright lights that reflect off the canal waters always seem to follow you- it really makes the city feel alive by night. When we weren’t lost or eating massive amounts of food, we were in some interesting bar sipping on beers or fancy cocktails. At Vesper Bar (a place that James Bond would go to for cocktails, and with good reason), I noticed their genius motto written on the blackboard after a few drinks in: “Summer is a time when you drink triple, see double, and act single.” It’s been a few days since I’ve been back, and I think I can speak for both of us when I say that we respected that quote quite well.
Of course, the trip ended exactly as any adventure with JD Case and Nathan Lam would: food poisoning. The burger place we ate at above was great, but for some stupid reason we decided to hike twenty minutes to this other place called “Burgermeester” to grab dinner before I left, and that decision absolutely killed us. After an hour of (puking) lying on our beds in the room, we stumbled outside to enjoy a bit of Amsterdam minutes before I had to leave.
We sat by the water and talked about the “strange corners of life,” tossing little pebbles off the edge to see ripples across the surface. Moments before my Uber arrived to take me to the airport, a little lady bug landed on my hand.
They say that’s supposed to be a sign of good luck, and I sure hope it’s true. I’ve got eight weeks left to do and see everything.
A few things that serendipity brought us:
P.S. Don’t worry Chris and Jerry, there’s no way we forgot about you guys:
Here we have Chris 2Changz, shirtless as ever and with us in spirit and Snapchat. Don’t worry buddy, I’ve collected a few bottle caps, and JD and I have something way better for you when we get back to campus. Jerry, you lucked out. I couldn’t find any embarrassing pictures, but I’ll fix that up soon. I can’t wait to see what happens next year in Brown 423.
As you can see, it’s well into week five, but I’m going to do my best to do last week justice. Life in Europe hasn’t grown any less interesting, but it’s been raining lately, and the days in Stockholm feel as though they’re growing shorter and shorter. It’s not a bad thing — rather, it’s as though time has simply lost the weight that it held weeks prior, and that I’ve stopped counting the days. Novelty is always perfect for tying your mind to the present, and when you travel, you become fixated on exploration. It’s addicting, really.
Copenhagen, unlike Amsterdam, was peaceful, and I often found myself subsumed by random thoughts and musings about all the things that’ve happened the past few weeks. Even though it really hasn’t been long, I think it’s fair to say that I’ve matured a considerable amount. The bulk of the trip was spent with Lucy and Tara, but there were pockets of time where I wandered off, as usual, and stumbled upon those little treasures that make traveling worthwhile.
But I’ll get to that later. First, I want to share all the weird things that happened. I feel like that’s more fun.
“It’s like a theme park, and the theme is weed.” — Tara Ramdonee
Last week, JD and I stumbled into the Red Light District. This week, Tara, Lucy, and I discovered the Green Light District. Taking Nikita’s wonderful advice, we made it an obligation to explore Christiania, the “most ghetto, but safe” place in Copenhagen. Two things ran through my mind when I heard that statement. First, everywhere is probably safe for Nikita (the Latvian White Bear), because nobody in their right mind would threaten him. Second, if it was a ghetto, safe place, I imagined that Nikita probably was talking about some hipster hangout.
What we found was exactly as Tara aptly described above. I would’ve taken a few photos, but there’re signs posted everywhere that have a cancel sign over a camera, indicating that I would probably be badly harmed if I let the camera whore inside of me take over. There was weed. Everywhere. If you bought two burgers, you’d get a joint for free. I could probably count the number of people who weren’t high out of their minds on my hand. Don’t worry mum, we didn’t smoke. We did, however, grab a few beers and have a pretty great conversation. However, the rest of the night wasn’t exactly noteworthy. While looking for some clubs in the area, we somehow stumbled upon some eighteen year old’s Danish birthday party where they played Soulja Boy Tell ‘Em.
On Sunday morning, Lucy recommended that we go to this nice little cafe called Bankeraat for lunch. She kept talking about these “stuffed animals” and how these things were dressed up, and knowing the Hello Kitty die-hard that Lucy is, I expected something similar to Sanrio. What we found was this:
Going to the restroom was an even more interesting experience. First off, the rooms with toilets don’t have lights. Second, they have jump scares like this around the corner when you go down this steep, curled staircase into the secluded basement that houses the restroom that people use on a day to day basis:
But other than the fact that I felt like I’ve just stumbled upon the set of American Horror Story, the food was good.
All of these experiences were humorous and interesting, in a way, simply because they didn’t align with expectations. What I’m learning from all this traveling is that the world becomes unbelievably exciting when you escape expectation and let yourself float off in any direction you feel is right. I’ll talk about one last experience, and it’ll be the more sentimental of the three. Ready yourself for the strange abstractions.
Lucy was convinced- absolutely convinced- that the Little Mermaid Statue would be one of the prime tourist attractions of København. And she was right, but not for the reasons she thought were right. Here’s a picture of the Little Mermaid and all its glory:
That’s it. A dinky boulder with Ariel chilling up top. I think my friend Eric Sohng actually would’ve made a much better mermaid than the statue itself. In fact, I have photographic evidence (Warning: Adult Content). What was amazing about it was that heaps and crowds of tourists huddled around the rock, fighting for a prize spot with the star of Copenhagen.
However, there was value there, and it was in the water. I think I’ve slowly come to realize that if I were to belong to any element in the world, I belonged to the water. Right next to the statue, there was a small, unassuming strip of land where the water met Copenhagen.
For a good while, I sat there alone and retreated far beneath the surface into my thoughts. The water felt so vast and immense, and it kept me entranced during the entirety of Lucy’s photo-op (probably thirty minutes). And somehow, something unexplainable in me clicked, and I felt a pull from the world to explore everything. By that, I mean parts of South America and the rest of Asia sometime next year, etc. You can’t really explain moments like these, but they shape you and change you, and they grant you new freedoms that slowly become part of your basic human needs.
Quote of the trip:
“Shall we summon an Über?”
- Tara Ramdonee, our British friend
Perhaps it’s that I’ve grown too busy with work and travel. Perhaps it’s that I’ve really just stopped counting the weeks as I have the past month and fully adopted that Carpé Diem lifestyle. Perhaps it’s both (it’s probably both), but for some odd reason, I have been finding it so much more difficult to sit myself down to continue documenting my trip here. But I’ve started it, and I wouldn’t be proud of myself if I stopped it mid-way. Old Nathan would be fine with that. New Nathan is too, but for some reason there’s a bit more guilt attached to quitting midway.

Berlin is fucking rebellious, and I love it. In Stockholm, if you act slightly out of place in a public setting, you’ll probably be arrested shortly afterward for disturbing the peace (of course I’m exaggerating, but you get what I’m saying). So being in a city where there’s graffiti on every building, drug dealers at every metro stop, and amazing street performers scattered throughout sidewalks was especially refreshing for me.
Story time: As short-lived as the trip was, it was full of unexpected encounters, and not in the same respect as the other trips have been. Because rather than encountering beautiful vantage points and little local treasures, I shared some odd coincidences with people who I either met or, more or less, shared ‘peculiar’ ties with.
These coincidences happened a few times, but I’m only going to talk about the mind-blowing one because, well, who the hell wants to hear about anything else. On the last night I was staying in Berlin, Ray decided to stay at home. Makes total sense for him, because he doesn’t enjoy going out all that much. But for me, staying in would have been a crime because, well, I was in Berlin. And Berlin’s insane.
So I had a two options. I could try and make friends with strangers at the hostel and venture through the night with them, or I could go solo and pray that I would have fun and not look like that creepy lonely rando that you make a conscious effort to avoid on a night out.
Option One failed miserably, because everyone I spoke with in the hostel was 30+ years old and talking about heroine/death metal. Left with Option Two, I went off in some random direction and, as per the advice of my brilliant friend Stefan, just followed crowds. When I got off the metro, I saw a group of people speaking English with pretty strong American accents (yes, we have accents), and my first reaction was “Those kids are definitely in high school.” My second reaction was “Those kids are definitely from California.” I was completely off with the first guess, but spot on for the second one.
Ironically, when I passed by the group, I overheard one of the girls whisper to her friend that I was definitely from California. I guess cut-off tank tops and joggers throw you right in that bucket. And effectively, me being the desperate, lonely rando looking for friends, I turned around and, well, made friends.
Two of them were from Orange County, and all of them were juniors at Northwestern. And the crazy part is that they’re all relatively good friends with the group of Northwestern students that I met in Beijing last summer. Details aside, we had a pretty fun night, and I’m meeting up with a few of them when I get back to California in September. Despite all the wanderlust I’ve been feeling lately, there was always this anxiety attached to the thought of traveling alone. But that night helped me realize that when you’re more or less screwed with no friends, you’ll find ways to meet people.
—
Other than that, most of the trip consisted of photo-ops and (even more) aimless wandering. You could probably get the gist of the trip by scrolling through my album, since I upload enough photos to irritate the majority of my friends list, but I’ll skim through a few highlights.
Bonanza Cafe. Cool place. It’s where I wrote the Week 4 post, so if I seemed over dramatic/sentimental, it’s because they were playing in Nils Frahm in the background.
I always have these recurring nightmares where I either get hit by a car or drive off a cliff. So, being the grim and morbid child that I am, this photo’s actually pretty important to me.
For some reason, this section of East Side Gallery made me so happy I almost cried. Not entirely sure why, but I guess it was a short reassurance that even if things go to shit, everything will more or less be OK.
Random Notes:
The thing with counting is that people usually count what they’re not all too fond of. We count push ups, the minutes of a long, boring meeting, the number of days before we can see a loved one again- we count because, in those few moments, our mind becomes fixated on the passing of time.
And quite frankly, when I first landed in Stockholm, I started counting. I counted the few hours I slept each night when getting accustomed to the early rise and late shine of Stockholm Sun. I counted the number of weeks until JD arrived, and the number of surface-level trips to various countries that I used as superficial fuel to rejuvenate myself. And, by nature of this blog, I counted the weeks. Each week was tinted with its own ordeal that made me mildly uncomfortable at best, and to compensate for the discomfort, I wrote. Every point in your life- even the dry bits- can seem so much more interesting when you put pen to paper and document it all in story. Unfortunately, when that happens, you run the risk of living for photographs and “serendipity,” while casting everything else off as mundane. Trust me, it’s a pretty miserable perspective to have on life. Happiness becomes short-lived.
Roughly two weeks ago, I had a conversation with Nicole (Andrea’s Girlfriend! Go Andrea :D!) about how we’re both restless souls- the way four walls can transform into prison bars if too much time is spent at home. Eventually, we also spoke about how ridiculously unsustainable that is. And thankfully, when I started complaining about the the ‘vanilla-ness’ of Sweden and ranting about my wonderful wanderlust and need for novelty, she called me out on, well, how ridiculously unsustainable I was. Well Nicole, you got through to me pretty well, and I am infinitely grateful for that.
Recently, I haven’t written much, and I think it’s because I’ve stopped counting. I still love seeing the world and exploring and wandering, but it’s no longer what keeps me afloat. It’s been a process, and I can’t deny that, but I’ve really learned to find joy in the bits and pieces of life that I would have otherwise disregarded as ‘boring.’ Here’s a short list to give you an idea:
Come Friday, and I’ll be in London with my supposed ‘fiancée’, and come September 4th, I’ll be home. I can’t say that I’ve emerged a completely different person, but I can say that right now, I feel happy- sustainably happy- in the way that almost seems infectious enough to drown out the white noise.

“If life were as simple as a day in July, would we honor it so?” — P. J. Gordon
Can we honor the act of doing nothing more often? Would we tire of the nothingness? This reminds me of what some people picture retirement as, and I’ve witnessed many who tire from nothingness; they yearn for regimented days of rules and restrictions. They worked all of their lives to be free, and now that they’re free, they miss their cage. It reminded me of Stockholm Syndrome. When someone has been held captive, they develop a psychological bond of trust and belonging with their captor. In my poem, I put the captor as our life’s occupation.
Stockholm Syndrome is what retirees fear.
We worked all our lives waiting on the year
“What will we do with all the extra hours?”
“Guess we can finally tend the flowers.”
“What will become of the position I held?”
“Will they remember me? All I regaled?”
Years gone, time spent being fully engaged,
Almost free, but it’s hard to leave the cage.
~ P. J. Gordon
Retirement can be likened to graduation from high school. You worked hard for it, you’ve done it, now what?

Most of the human suffering in the modern world boils down to our fear of death. This is not surprising, since modern mythology stipulates that matter is primary and basically all there is.
If nothing exists beyond, above or beneath–whichever spatial metaphor you want to use–the physical universe, every physical and practical expression within its confines appears to be very important, such as gender, age, nationality, organizations, career, money, politics, laws, hospitals, formal education, formal science and titles.
Until it is not, because we all die. How unfair.
The good news is that death is merely a transition from one state to another, just like birth is. Death and birth are exactly the same kind of event, only experienced from opposite angles. We come in and we go out. It is like a long breath.*)
Suffering and the idea of an ultimate death both stem from the illusion of time.
The above means that when we are afraid to die, we are actually afraid to go home. We desperately hold on to this temporary existence, as if a temporary sojourn could ever be a true home. We persuade ourselves that the stage play we are in, this video game, this boot camp, is all we have. We anxiously pay attention to the sergeants of the boot camp who shout out their orders
One might even describe our predicament as a prison we fear leaving. This is actually a pertinent analogy, since this phenomenon is well documented — the psychology of it is well described in the wonderful film The Shawshank Redemption.
We desperately hold on to this temporary existence, as if a temporary sojourn could ever be a true home
When I look at our nonacceptance of death and unconscious rejection of home from a spiritual perspective, I see a collective Stockholm syndrome. A Stockholm syndrome on a species level, basically.
We have developed an understanding, even sympathy, for our prison guards, who constantly lead us to believe that this physical world with its societal structure, is all there is, and if we want to make the most of life, we’d better get out there and seize all the goodies we are able to lay our hands on and reach for as desirable a position in the structure we possibly can.
Of course, we can’t all acquire the same amount of things, and not everybody will be able to gain the most coveted positions. We learn this early on, and with that lesson comes another hard ”truth”: Life is not easy. Who said life should be easy? Some win, some lose, but hey, you just have to learn to bite the bullet and do the best of your situation.
But here is the truth: the essence of life is actually very simple. Life is a continuum.
Deep within, underneath the constant chaos of thoughts and feelings, you can sense that you simply are. You are conscious — you are consciousness itself. You experience — you are experience itself. Hence you exist, and you cannot not exist, because that is not an experience. This is all you can ever really, truly, know for certain is real.
Life unfolds from there, and that is all there is to it. All else are temporary mental or emotional constructs.
This physical experience is no doubt immensely important and in many ways a marvelous adventure. But it is not the whole story. Not even close. The best way to approach earthly life is with equanimous curiosity and joy. Not as if it were dead serious. When we open the door to our infinity, a weight is lifted from our hearts.
When we dismiss this simple and self-evident inner knowing life appears complicated. That is when we get the false idea we lack something, and we feel miserable and anxious. Neuroscientists have tried for decades to locate where in the brain consciousness is produced, to no avail, of course. It is in that futile physical search for meaning we become depressed, whether we try to find it in the brain or by hoarding things.
A basic prerequisite for upholding this elaborate matrix is the idea that humans are at the core selfish
We all come into this strange and wondrous place with the inner truth intact. An inkling remains for a few years, but we gradually forget who we really are. We identify with a name, a skill, a position, a story.
For thousands of years a plethora of societal structures have been imposed on us. The guardians of these structures — teachers, doctors, politicians, civil servants, lawyers, soldiers, journalists, researchers, priests, parents — are themselves involuntary pawns in the game, at least the vast majority of them.
A basic prerequisite for upholding this elaborate matrix is the idea that humans are at the core selfish and unreliable, which is why a structural order is needed. We learn that rules and regulations keep this flawed species in check to the benefit of us all. This is a tragic deception. This is, quite frankly, a big lie.
This big lie operates side by side with — and is fueled by — the widespread fear of death.
Someone might object that people were even more scared of death a few hundred years ago, before the introduction of a physicalist worldview, when almost everybody was religious, at least formally.
This might be true, but the difference would be in degree, not in kind, because that ”religiosity” was a very integral part of the matrix. In some ways the Church, for instance, was more materialistic than modern day atheism, whose proponents emphasize humanism. The Church was deeply in cahoots with the secular powers. Priests told people that God needed them to obey the lords of the world as well.
Adhering to a dogmatic, old-school religion is all about pleasing an external God and acquiescing to the hierarchy of His representatives on Earth. And if you don’t, you know which place you will be sent to.
The realization that we are all eternal sparks of God/Source/The One Consciousness is the most forbidden knowledge of all in the traditional Abrahamic religions.
We used science to drag us away from a system of outer oppression to a system of inner oppression
Wait, didn’t we liberate ourselves from all that when science broke with religion? It certainly looked like an attempt. But did we use our new scientific approach to find our way back to our true essence, our core of natural happiness? We did not. We used science to drag us in the opposite direction, away from a system of outer oppression to a system of inner oppression, called materialism.
Either your life is miserable because you are tormented by the constant condemnations of God and the Church, or your life is miserable because you feel the meaninglessness of being a randomly assembled flesh robot. In both cases you feel unfree. Imprisoned.
In the latter case, you may find temporary relief in embracing the system and its rulers, who tell you that all will be well if you just adjust a little bit more to fit into the intricate societal structures. So you try, once more, to do that. And to make the process smoother and less painful, you choose to sympathize with your prison guards.
This is psychologically very understandable as long as you don’t know that there is an alternative. But imagine the sea change in your perspective on life when you realize you can break out of it whenever you want. That all you have been told, and told yourself, about your identity is a chimera. That the essence of you is completely free.
If we all went there, no one would be afraid of death, and no one would want to control anyone or be controlled. The matrix would dissolve itself. It would be obvious there is no need for it.
*) I assume most readers of this essay are with me on what I state about a non-physical reality. However, if any readers are skeptical, simply imagine for a moment that there is a realm we temporarily leave when we are born into physical bodies and go back to when we leave those bodies, i.e. die. It may help to look into the well-documented accounts by people who have had near-death experiences, which by now count in the thousands; practically all of them say that the realm they have visited during those experiences feels very much like their real home and appears far more real than this physical one. New cases are being documented all the time. And then there is the research at the University of Virginia which, believe it or not, seems to confirm young children’s memories of previous lives. There is also other research pointing to a verifiable non-physical reality.

I wasn’t going to write about the election since it gets exhausting. But if you’re like me, you find it increasingly difficult to understand how some of your friends, co-workers, and family members continue to support President Trump. Not because of policy disagreements over everything, although there’s plenty to go around, but because of who Trump is.
Stockholm, Wisconsin is a town of 88 people last time I checked. Almost 70% of them voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012. But most voted for Trump in 2016.
Four years later, it’s time to take an audit of this president before you vote again.
It’s not that everything Trump’s ever done is horrific, although there’s plenty of that to go around, too.
I’m not oblivious to the fact that he got NATO to pay their fair share of expenses defending Europe, despite decades of American presidents asking deaf European nations to pay more. Trump defeated ISIS in Syria. I mean, when’s the last time you even heard of that group since Trump. He brought Israel and numerous Arab countries together. UAE and Bahrain to start, but I have no doubt that we’ll see another four or five peace agreements follow soon. Maybe more.

Many years ago, I used to belong to an online community which is mostly made up of young women in their early twenties. A lot of folks usually send in their questions, queries and stories seeking clarifications and often times, advice.
On a particular day, a lady sent in a long message which signaled that she was pathetic to her abuser and was also very mindful of hurting him.
There were several comments but there was a particular comment which got my attention, the commenter said’ She is suffering from Stockholm’s syndrome.
I was taken aback because the only Stockholm I knew at the time was a city in Sweden and my curiosity got the best of me. I really wanted to know what Stockholm's syndrome meant.
I decided to dig in and do a thorough research and discovered the following;
Stockholm syndrome explained
Stockholm syndrome is an emotional response which happens when an abuser develops positive feelings towards their abusers or captors.
The name came about by a man due to an incident which happened in Stockholm in the year 1973 It’s a story which depicts the loyalty of hostages to their captors.
This illness was named after a bank robbery that occurred in Stockholm, Sweden in 1973.Many of the imprisoned bank employees got sympathetic to the bank robbers during the six-day standoff with authorities.Following their release, some of the bank employees went as far as refusing to testify against the bank robbers in court, and even raised funds to defend them.The term “Stockholm syndrome” was coined by a criminologist and psychiatrist(Nils Bejerot) examining the incident to characterize the affinity some bank staff had for the bank thieves.
What causes Stockholm’s syndrome
1. Overdependent
When you’ve been dependent on your captor/abuser for basic needs, there’s a high tendency of emotional reliance on them.
2. Fair treatment
When hostages have not been threatened or when they’re being treated nicely. It becomes a dent of STOP IT, I LIKE IT
3. When hostages haven’t been dehumanized in any form.
Stockholm Syndrome and children
For situations involving children such as child abuse, there could be an emotional imbalance where the child sees the abuser as a protector especially if the abuser is a close ally or a family. Abuse in this form can be confusing for children because most times, abusers tend to intimidate and threaten their victims from speaking out. At the same time, the abuser also shows love and care to the child. This creates a confusing scenario and can also breed Stockholm syndrome where the child grows up believing the abuser to be a protector rather than a molester.
Stockholm Syndrome and tutors
In the same vein, people who have abusive coaches, tutors and teachers might develop a deep emotional connection with them and rather than see them in the light of the abuse, they create and give excuses for them thereby defending and sympathizing with them.
For Emotional, physical and mental abuse, The victims tend to develop an emotional connection with the abusers because emotional abuse on its own can make a victim develop a trauma bond with the abuser.
A trauma bond is a deep seated bond between an abuser and the person they abuse.
Stockholm Syndrome and sex trafficking
In the movie Gangubai Kathiawadi, which told the story of a young woman who was lured into prostitution and sold off to a sex trafficker, the lady refused to join in the venture because she considered it to be immoral and dishonorable. Day after day, she was subjected to series of inhumane treatment and she knew that in other to survive, she had to join them.
This goes to show that people who are captured and sold off into sex trafficking tend to rely on their dependents for survival. This can create a form of dependence on their abusers.
Is Stockholm Syndrome a mental health disorder?
Even though Stockholm’s syndrome isn’t listed as a formal mental health disorder but rather an emotional response to abuse.
However, there are common symptoms for people who have been victims of abuse such as;
1. Withdrawal
They tend to withdraw from people because most of the time, they find it hard to trust others and tend to believe that every other person is out there to hurt them.
2. Post traumatic stress disorder
PTSD is characterized by failure to recover after a traumatic event or in this case, abuse
3. Sleeplessness
4. Denial
5. feeling of hopelessness, failure, helplessness and often times
6. Depression.
If you or anyone you know is suffering from the Stockholm syndrome, please see a therapist as soon as possible so as to curtail any further imminent serious mental disorder.

25–27 Sep remembered on 8 Oct
After another 12-minute walk from the US embassy, I arrived at Etnografiska Museet, where everything converged.
This was where Peng worked during his time in Sweden, also the home of most of Sven Hedin’s collection. I spent 150 SEK for the ticket. The size of the museum is slightly smaller than I expected, but of course, it wouldn’t be fair to compare it with the British Museum or Musée du quai Branly. The first exhibition I encountered on the ground floor was Yokai, an exhibition about the Japanese Yokai culture (something ghostly or monstrous, but not exactly ghosts or monsters). It was well-curated, informational while entertaining. I was not sure if the credit should go to the Etnografiska Museet or other institutions who co-curated it. However, it was recommendable.
Despite its good quality, for a Taiwanese, Yokai culture is not something unfamiliar, and it also wasn’t the reason of my visit. So I quickly browsed through, and moved upstairs to continue my search.
When I was at the entrance, I saw one of the current exhibitions called “We are Seediq”. I thought to myself that “Oh, there is an indigenous group in Taiwan also called Seediq. What a coincidence.” Turned out that the exhibition was about the indigenous group in Taiwan. The exhibition was small, but again, well-curated and informational.
It is hard to describe how moved I was. I believe that it was the first exhibition that I’ve ever liked in any ethnographic museum. I am sure by now you can imagine, as someone like me, it’s impossible to be completely comfortable, seeing how these items were raided by Eurocentric collectors, explorers, or let’s be honest, colonisers, in the past, and seeing how the cultures were interpreted, as if there weren’t, or aren’t, any actual human beings attached to the said culture. It has always been something fascinating while irritating for me to visit ethnographic museums.
The curatorial concept of this exhibition started with a number of mysterious items as part of the museum collection, from an unsurprisingly problematic source. (What I love about it was also that the “problematic source” was clearly stated in the exhibition.) The reason I said “mysterious”, was because it was actually wrongly labelled as items from Atayal originally, instead of Seediq, due to the mis-categorization from the Japanese colonisation.
“We are Seediq” was co-curated among a number of institutions, including the Seediq National Assembly, and the Indigenous Cultural Heritage Master’s Program of Providence University in Taiwan. The involvement of the “subject’ themselves could be seen everywhere.
First, the title, the “we” implies the existence of human subjects, instead of merely culture or items. It was coming from the mouth of the subjects, not observers. And all the texts written were in three languages — Swedish, English and Chinese. (I know it’s not Seediq, but at least it’s a language that most of the Seediq nowadays can understand.) The interviews of Seediq people were presented as one of the major elements in the centre of the room. The faces and voices were unavoidably seen and heard. What moved me the most was that one of the weaved fabrics in the collection was considered the oldest, documented Seediq weaving pattern preserved in the world. And the museum is working with the organisations in Taiwan to study the pattern in order to recreate them. Even writing about these is making me emotional.
The “collection” here is no longer some “dead” items lying inside a glass vitrine. The “culture” has become alive, moving, working, involving. Then there is a meaning. There is a reason for all of these to happen. I know one might say that the museum should return the stolen items to Taiwan for good. (The texts mentioned that the items were in Taiwan for a time being before being returned to the museum.) I understand it’s not perfect. But honestly, despite the problematic, upsetting source, can we, as Taiwanese, be confident that the items would be well-stored forever, in a professional context on the island? And just reading the texts in the exhibition of a culture that somehow I found adjacent to (I wouldn’t dare to say that it’s mine) in my native language, already gave me goosebumps, which is something I can never dream of seeing in places like the British Museum. I haven’t even started to mention how Taiwan, as a country, as an island with adjacent islands, was being presented correctly in the exhibition, which is again, something I can not dream of in a European context.
After seeing the exhibition, I couldn’t help but make an Instagram story, recommending it, tagging the museum. I received a kind message from someone who runs the account. I genuinely hope that all the exhibitions in ethnographic museums could make me feel this way. I also heard that there is someone from Taiwan working at Etnografiska Museet at the moment. I am sure that helped with what I saw.
Finally, at a corner on the 2nd floor, I found something from Sven Hedin, titled Golden Temple. It’s a model temple he commissioned to make, identical to a temple he encountered in Chengde, China.
I was surprised about how little collections from him were on display, so I asked the friendly staff at the information desk in case I missed anything. She explained that on the ground floor, where the Yokai exhibition is, was Hedin’s collection. but it was removed for the Yokai exhibition. I asked if the collection will come back after Yokai ends. She replied, slightly awkwardly, with a no. I was curious about her reaction, so I googled afterwards. Turned out that the Swedish historian Tommy Lundmark published a book recently, criticising the display of Hedin’s collection in the museum. He believed that the way the collection was displayed touched only lightly, perhaps too lightly, on Hedin’s support of Nazism. Despite that Hedin being a Nazi supporter was not a news anymore, the book seemed to stir more controversies than there was. And the museum, using the coming exhibitions as a cover, removed all the Hedin’s collection, with only the temple left.
It’s a complicated issue. I don’t feel like I have any position to judge. As a researcher, of course I would like to see his collection. However, I also believe that before figuring out a proper way to deal with the problematic history, removing the collection for the time being, was more than understandable.
After the conversation with the helpful staff, I moved on with my day.
The next stop was Hedinsgatan. After I arrived, I found out that “gatan” means “street” in Swedish, instead of “garden”, as I originally thought due to its pronunciation. So, Hedinsgatan, is a street named after Sven Hedin in Stockholm. It was just an ordinary street. I couldn’t find anything special. I also couldn’t figure out the reason why this street in particular was chosen to be given the name. It was not specially close to where he used to live, or the cemetery, or the museum. It remained a mystery to me till this day.
Finally, it was five. We were back to Historiska Museet. I couldn’t find anything from Sven Hedin here, however, after knowing what happened to Etnografiska Museet, I doubt if the museum would want to point out which items were actually from Hedin anyway.
A cute anecdote happened was that, when I arrived, there was a celebratory event of the independence day of Armenia. A lady downstairs asked me to sign on the RSVP list, and I was confused, saying that I was only here to see the exhibition, so she let me pass. After going upstairs, witnessing the champaign and catering of the party, I wished I had signed so I could join. I thought about blending in, however, with my cheap, slightly torn out jeans, and the oversized jacket as a charity from my friend in Berlin last year after losing all my clothes in a luggage, I had a feeling that the plan of blending in naturally would fail. So, I tearfully walked away from the champaign and the finger food.
After the museum, I stopped by a supermarket to grab some bread, cold cuts, spreads and a light beer (which had a significant meaning that I only understood in a few days). I sat down by a beautiful harbour, and started my dinner. I was surprised that I couldn’t see anyone else doing what I was doing. The view was stunning. I remembered sitting by the Seine everyday with friends, enjoying wines and picnic-made sandwich in Paris. After a while, the wind started to blow into my bones, and despite the sunny weather during the day, my fingers started to freeze, and suddenly I realised why I was the only person sitting on the floor at this harbour, picnicking.
The next day, I visited the Konstmuseet in Skövde by train, to drop my large suitcase, so I wouldn’t have to travel in Europe inconveniently while paying for the overpriced luggage fee charged by the budget airlines (and not to mention the fear of losing it again). The trip took me almost the whole day. The 10:30am train was delayed for half an hour, so I arrived at Skövde at around 1pm. After a pleasant chat with David, the technician of the museum, who is also someone from Goldsmiths Fine Art, I went back to the station for my 14:28 train, which was again delayed for 45 minutes, and I ended up arriving at Stockholm Central after 5pm.
With some not-so-worth-mentioning anecdotes happening on the train, I arrived back at the hotel with a sense of relief, since everything I needed to do for work in Stockholm these days was done. To celebrate, I decided to take advantage of the gym downstairs. After spending 30 minutes on treadmills and other machines that I can not name, I felt like a human again. I know the ecstasy was all psychological, as a relief from the anxiety of aging and weight-gaining. Gym is a middle-class fantasy of a healthy life. When I was running on the treadmill, I believed that I was no longer the girl wearing the torn-out jeans, having cheap sandwiches and light beer sitting by the harbour, freezing, fantasising about the free champagne at other people’s parties. Whatever that was, it helped. I loved going to gyms, delusional or not.
I decided to spend my last day in Stockholm (this time) with art. After my last luxurious breakfast at Hotel Expo, I sadly said goodbye to it, and took a train and a bus to Karolinska Institute. It was where Carl Gustaf Bernhard, the host of Peng during his stay in Sweden, worked. I took some photos, and moved on to the Moderna Museet. Moderna Museet is a modern and contemporary art museum in Stockholm, connected to Arkdes, a design and architecture museum. Luckily, Arkdes offers free admission throughout the year of 2024, so I visited both museums in the afternoon, before heading to the airport, taking my 19:45, SAS flight to Heathrow, London.
I guess it’s about time to face this.

Aftab
We begin with Aftab (Persian for ‘sun’s beautiful rays). Let’s send Aftab to a school friend you’ve lost touch with and would like to reconnect to.
How do you send Aftab — close your eyes for 10 secs and send the suns rays to those you have in your heart. And add to this “<name> may you be at peace, may you be happy” and turn that to yourself “may I be happy, may I be at peace”
For the past 2–3 years, I’ve had the privilege of coaching a tremendously talented former colleague on and off. Our most recent engagement concluded last Friday, and I’ve come to realize that one of the most valuable words she needs in her life right now is “No.”….and that too for turning clients away who are no longer a match for her. This message is for her and for any of you as it may offer guidance to some of you in similar situations.
No, Nada, Nee, Nej, Non
“Really successful people say no to almost everything.” — Warren Buffett
What perhaps got you to the level of success you’re at today is saying YES to almost every opportunity. What will get you to your next level of success is saying NO to almost every opportunity.
Which is why I’m going to share with you the single most powerful tool to take your life, career and…

During my recent trip to Stockholm, I was working remotely on New York hours. I ended up loving this weird working schedule. I would explore the city from 9am-3pm, work 3pm-12:30am, and then sleep 1am-9am. Since I working during dinner hours, I decided to orient my trip around a daytime delicacy — pastries. Each day, I explored a new part of the city in search of the best cardamom bun.
I’ve always been a huge fan of cardamom, so I was excited to learn how ubiquitous cardamom buns (aka kardemummabulle) are in this city. They were all delicious, so it’s really about finding the one that meets your taste — they ranged from bready to buttery and from sugary to spicy. Many bakeries were closed for summer break, but these were the favorites I tried:

Ever had the sneaking suspicion that the corporations you hate have trapped you in an endless buying cycle?
You’re confronted with sobering stats about the effects of smartphone addiction on mental health, but your phone’s the first thing you reach for in the morning. You’ve watched that documentary about the true cost of fast fashion to the environment, but you can’t resist those $10 yoga pants. You’re appalled by the piles of waste generated by single-use plastic, but you still get your coffee to-go in disposable cups and your food delivered every day. You fully understand how algorithms are designed to harvest your attention online for profit, but you feverishly refresh your Instagram feed.
Why does the captive start falling in love with the captor, who suddenly seems so indispensable and necessary for survival? Why do we hate how brands use and treat us, but keep going back for more? Consider this: your brand loyalty and relationship with monolithic corporations might actually be a version of Stockholm Syndrome.
First, big brands lure you in with the product and create the illusion of scarcity, making you feel like doing without it isn’t an option. And then, when you’re finally held hostage, even the slightest act of generosity will get the company in your good graces (see: corporate social responsibility and activist ad campaigns). In time there’s some scandal or controversy with clear evidence that the brand is causing unnecessary harm to reap immense profits — but you remain loyal through it all, even feeling friendliness where there should be fear, admiration where there should be contempt.
This is one of the most despair-inducing aspects of Stockholm Syndrome: in the end, even after being released, the captive defends the captor.
Various scholars and experts have tried to put a finger on why. A book on surveillance capitalism by Shoshana Zuboff here, an explosive Medium article on Capitalist Stockholm Syndrome by Umair Haque there. Trouble is, we often don’t even realize we’re being held hostage. The recently viral, user-generated “10 Year Challenge,” where people post then-and-now photos of themselves on social media, is actually an astroturfed meme to train Facebook’s facial recognition capabilities, speculates Kate O’Neill from Wired. In 2009, you logged into Facebook. In 2019, Facebook logs into you.
Worse yet, brands themselves admit they aren’t good for us — it’s one of the ways they keep us in line, so to speak. Apple wants to help curb your iPhone addiction with Screen Time, a new feature that breaks your smartphone usage down to the specific apps in the hopes of motivating you to spend your time differently. Cigarette conglomerate Philip Morris International just embarked on an anti-smoking campaign as part of their vision of a smoke-free future. And in what sounds like a headline from The Onion, Coca-Cola and other junk food giants in China have successfully been funding the narrative that exercise — not cutting down on sugar — can fight obesity. They use their role in creating “solutions” to problems in which they, themselves, are complicit to generate positive PR, reeling us right back in.
Why, despite all this, do we remain brand-loyal? In the 2018 dark comedy Sorry To Bother You, union organizer Squeeze explains, “If you get shown a problem but have no idea how to control it, then you just decide to get used to the problem.”
There’s also nobody else for us to go to. A protest sign spotted at the 2019 Women’s March highlighted the fact that that there’s more public trust in gas station sushi than in President Trump, which isn’t a total exaggeration. Amazon and Google beat political parties and the state government as some of the most trusted entities in an American Institutional Confidence Poll conducted online by YouGov in 2018.
In recent years, capitalism’s sheen has (finally) started fading. Today only 19% of Americans ages 18 to 29 identify themselves as “capitalists”, and the trend goes hand-in-hand with the rising popularity of the Democratic Socialist values espoused by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.
This week marks the start of the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting, attended by hundreds of the world’s most powerful leaders. The United States’ Trump, France’s Macron and Britain’s May could not make it because they are busy tending to crises at home with big economic implications — the partial government shutdown, Yellow Vest protests and Brexit. It behooves the meeting’s attendees to acknowledge that our economic systems are in serious disrepair, and that rapidly rising income inequality is a feature, not a bug, of late stage capitalism.
So how do we ensure that we don’t fall prey to Stockholm Syndrome yet again, making new excuses and justifications for the next generation of brands as we wrestle free from the mega-corporations that control so much of our lives today?
As we enter the fourth industrial revolution, we need to reconsider the role and purpose of the corporation on our planet, and weed out the put-up-or-shut-up variety of consumerism. In his new book Prosperity, Colin Mayer of Oxford’s Saïd Business School offers a new definition for private companies: “Producing profitable solutions to problems of people and planet.” Will we keep condoning the harm that some corporations inflict on society and the environment, or will we demand that they do more, do better? It’s time for the captive to thwart the captor.

Long time no see, or at least on English. I have started to write a bit more on Swedish and more company and It-security focused articles. The reasons behind it is somewhat because of i have started a company! Finally i have teased about it for some time now, am i right?!
So https://lysellssecurityandtech.com aka Lysells Security And Tech AB is live and up and running as a fully working company with stocks and CEO and management and so on, “only” me and my wife still but it is a real company :D
Therefore i will move and probably write a bit more on my new website, with a bit more focus on Security parts and what is happening within security, more focus on companies and Enterprises. But fear not i will write more here on Medium but probably a bit more like write-ups, personal thoughts and stuff that maybe not is compliant with company blogs and stuff.
So as of 12th of august i am traveling to Stockholm, Solna to be precise, every Sunday i take the train up and Thursday i travel home again, it is a lot of time being spent in Stockholm where i am work as an It-security Architect for a financial company and during the nights i try to be busy writing articles, Talks and trying to get a bit more customers where i can help out with Security work. Just to keep busy and i love to work with Security so it is a win-win situation, and if i can work as much as i want to on the evenings when i am in Stockholm that means i can focus fully on Wife, Dogs and Family when i am home, i may even not need to work on Fridays either, so that means i will have 2.5 days home with family and wifey.
But the thing is because i am working and travelling that much i have setup some timeplanning as well, so Sunday and Saturday is full family time the phone is “off” and i focus on private time, Fridays will be a mix, i will often sleep in a bit because i often get home at midnight or even later but then on Friday i will be available for calls and some work-meetings, i do have planned some talks and lunch meetings often on Fridays so often half days.
That is one thing i recommend, plan your time so you get recovery and quality time with the loved ones, for me as a workoholic i work best to do some work on Fridays just for my own sanity and that is the time i have NOT being on other assignments so it is the right thing for me do some work and often many clients wind down on the afternoon of a Friday so friday until lunch is a way to get some stuff done.
But then be able to have the Friday evening, Saturday and Sunday off and get that quality time is golden. I will probably do some every other week in the future not doing it every week as i am doing now, because it costs a lot of money living at hotels and being away from family is tough. But for now it is a fun adventure and the travel home 5–6 hours is often a good way to wind down even if the way home is the worst one, you just want to get home and you cannot get there fast enough!
This was just a word blob, basically a brain dump of my thoughts and some tips and tricks.
But until next time! Be safe on the internet and be safe!

Disclaimer: My story tackles racial prejudice, not to downplay the seriousness of the issue but to highlight its absurdity. So grab your fika or popcorn, and let’s discover the absurdity of racism.
This is my story of how an unpleasant incident had an influencing impact on my life forever.
In 1980, in Stockholm, Sweden, two Swedish colleagues and I decided to walk to the harbour for coffee. We chatted about work, Swedish girls, and beer, matching our quick steps down the lane.
Suddenly, out of nowhere, a white stranger started shouting, “Du, svarta hund, försvinn från min stad.” We froze!
My two colleagues realised that the racial slur was directed at me since I was darker than them. The stranger noticed I didn’t speak Swedish and shouted, “You, black dog, get out of my town!” Those words were sharp and hurtful. It was the first time anyone had called me a black dog.
I felt angry and sad about what had happened.
I was enraged at the ignorance behind the words and sorry for the man who said them. It made me realise that some people will…

The only thing worse than being taken captive is sympathizing and bonding with your captor. But what if our captors are our own beliefs and aspirations?
A friend sent me a blog post that stopped me in my tracks. After reading Chip’s Wounded Entrepreneur post, I immediately went to LinkedIn to reach out to him.
His lived experience and deeply personal message resembled the lives of so many of the founders and entrepreneurs I work with. Touching upon the topic of suicide, that post was a wake-up call.
That’s the driving energy behind Founders Thriving. I wanted to create a space for entrepreneurs and founders to begin developing a healthier relationship between themselves and their companies. A place to build and grow your company but be happy doing it.
The Cult of Ourselves
We all need to begin addressing the cultish beliefs that make up the abusive relationships we so willingly endure with the companies we run. What these stories represent is how easy it is to be held captive by the companies we run; physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.
Most entrepreneurs launch their endeavor with dreams F-R-E-E-D-O-M. Financial freedom, schedule freedom, and the freedom not to report to a boss.
At least those were their original north-star goals.
But ever-so-slowly we silently mortgage away that freedom until we’re caged in by the one thing we thought would free us from the trappings of a normal 9 to 5.
Then like many long-term hostage situations, we begin to bond and sympathize with our captor. Gradually abandoning the people who love and support us in our greatest times of need.
Vicious Cycle
Unfortunately, after launching startups for freedom, what usually happens is entrepreneurs slowly trade in these opportunities to assert our freedom for personal ultimatums: “I’ve gotta do this to [insert infinite to-do-list here]” scenarios. Before they know it they’re reporting to employees and investors, working more hours, and making less money than many of their own staff. #founderseatlast
Version 1.0 of our early programming usually has two hard-coded beliefs. First, putting ourselves first is selfish. Second, our self-worth is largely dependent on our net worth.
If we get good grades we’ll go to a good school. If we go to a good school, we’ll get a high-paying job. If we get a high-paying job, we’ll simply acquire everything we need to be happy.
Now layer on the toxic startup tropes of kill it, crush it, hustle, and struggle and you have a perfect recipe for an emotional or mental meltdown.
I can’t count the number of founders I work with whose goal is to “make their first million.” I call this the “Miserable Millionaire Fallacy.”
Rarely do these founders know where this thought comes from. It’s simply always been there. It’s like a hidden feature that was included in Version 1.0 and bug fixed and patched to fix our current life circumstances.
It’s not until they’ve gotten everything they dreamed of, and are still unhappy, that they begin exploring other means of happiness, purpose, and fulfillment.
Exorcise Exercise
One good way to assess this in yourself or an entrepreneur you’re working with is to have them visualize their company as a real person. Then imagine having an intimate and honest conversation with that person.
Are they kind, encouraging, and supportive? Or are they negative and condescending; taking every opportunity to remind you you’re an imposter?
When you use this personified entity approach and add a dollop of psychology you’ll find that many entrepreneurs begin to sympathize with their captor and have begun to develop deep feelings of codependency with their personified company.
When the company is successful, they are well. When the company is suffering, so do they.
The beauty of this simple exercise is that once an entrepreneur recognizes the pattern, the turn-around can be incredibly fast. The first step is acknowledging your company is not human; therefore it is not capable of taking actions for or against you or making you think or feel anything.
The second requires an acknowledgment that you are wholly responsible for your thoughts and the resulting emotions that come from those thoughts. Based on those two steps, it is 100% within your control to change the relationship you have with your company.
To unwind the default programming of our formative years we need to encourage founders to normalize new behavior and make it ok to prioritize their needs first; essentially, an upgrade to Founder Version 2.0. By prioritizing their needs above the needs of the business, their co-founders, and their investors, business owners regain the agency needed to heal the relationship with their business.
The mission of the MEA is to reframe midlife — from a crisis to a calling. And if that calling is to share your wisdom with up-and-coming entrepreneurs then let’s create a safe space to meet in the middle.
My dream is for Founders Thriving to help prepare those entrepreneurs to work with all of you. I believe that if we take care of ourselves first we can show up more fully resourced for our teams, our families, and our community. Then together, we can all Build Something Better!
If you know a business owner stuck in their own Startup Stockholm Syndrome or someone ready and willing to prioritize their needs first, please send them over to Founders Thriving and join the movement.

Ahh Disney.. The corporate machine that’s been printing money by selling your dreams back to you is a .. tale as old as time.. you could say.
But while I’m always ready to engage in good faith and justified criticism of this behemoth marketing machine, I’m not in love with criticism that points the finger at problems that don’t exist.
Today, I had a conversation with a dear friend who brought up one of the original criticisms of Beauty and the Beast that I haven’t heard mentioned in years. This friend brought up the belief that some people have alleging Belle was suffering from Stockholm syndrome, that she didn’t have enough agency in the film, and that the story is problematic in the world that exists in 2021.
Since this friend of mine is in the process of producing a live theatrical production of Beauty and the Beast, it immediately became my highest priority to disabuse her of this belief.
I, of course, sent her some rambling messages to get my point across, but after making my point, I still wasn’t satisfied. So here I am.

I love Chigozie Obi’s artistry and I love her personality even more, so it made so much sense that I desired to have a conversation with her.
Two failed attempts at meeting and a birthday pool party after, Chigozie and I finally linked, and we had a conversation about everything — from love to relationship dynamics, fitness, friendships, work and her love for Lagos that may suggest she has Stockholm syndrome. The conversation was so good that we planned a second date.
I walked into Basilico — where Chigozie had been working all afternoon — some minutes before 4pm. I scanned through the floor but couldn’t find her until she popped up from the lounge in a corner, wearing a smile so wide and looking so good, as ever, in a lovely dress. She was excitingly taller than I pictured or, if I’m being honest, I was probably shorter than I thought.“Oh my God, you look so beautiful in person,” I said. Chigozie is more beautiful in person.“You too!” She exclaimed in a smile. “I love your top,” she said.“Thank you!”“I’m so sorry I dressed down. Had a crazy gym session,” she said, walking in a limp. Chigozie has been in the gym for a year now and is notorious for tweeting about the woes of exercising, whilst showing up everyday.“That’s so true! I should have worn slippers,” I said, looking at my flat heels and then back at her pair of white slippers. “Sorry about your pain. You’re really trying o. I’ve attempted the gym twice and I’ve quit twice,” I said, chuckling.She laughed. “How?”“I didn’t have a trainer and thought I could wing it like people say. Although the first time, a friend was my gym partner until she moved. The second time, I was checking out YouTube and stuff for routines. So both were sort of epic fails. I think I lasted two weeks for both,” I said, chuckling.Chigozie laughed. “I have a trainer though.”“Yea, I saw. How has that been for you?”“I really like it. I like that I can just go in there without having to think of what I want to do, and just let someone else think for me and instruct me. My only job is to just show up.”I giggled. “I like that.”“Yeah,” she said. “I see you have a new hair done,” I said, looking at her black braids.Chigozie’s eyes beamed. “Yea, I did it yesterday,” she said, excitedly. Her excitement was so real, it was contagious.“It’s really pretty,” I continued in admiration.“Thank you. I like your beads too. You look like an African Queen.”I chuckled in excitement. “Thank you!”Compliments are ten times better when they come from women.
“How are you? How has Lagos been for you?” Chigozie asked, looking at me.“It’s been okay, it’s been chill. I miss my family sometimes though,” I replied.“Where’s family?”“My family home’s at Ekiti.”“Oh okay.”“What?” I asked chuckling.“No, Ekiti is very chill.”“Yeah, it’s very slow too, and then Lagos is pretty fast. Too fast.”“Yeah, I really love the mountains as well. It’s very serene.”“Have you been?”“Yeah. I went in secondary school to…”“Ikogosi,” I finished her statement and we burst out laughing.“Exactly, exactly,” she said in a smile. “Then I went again for an Art Bootcamp. I think that was when I really explored. I went to Ikogosi again, but I also went around town and stuff, and I was a bit older. It wasn’t like a school thing, so we had more freedom. It’s a really beautiful place.”“Lots of mountains everywhere.”“Yeah. When I travel outside of Lagos I discover we’re not chilling here at all. It’s so fast-paced and so chaotic.” Chigozie laughed.“Very chaotic.”“But the thing is that I feel like I have stockholm syndrome. Anytime I leave Lagos, I get homesick and want to come back almost immediately.”“Really?”“Yeah. For example, when I went to Abuja, I was homesick in the first couple of days. It was pretty slow and I was shocked because I thought Abuja was like the ‘next Lagos’ or something, but nah.”“Abuja is actually so dead, not gonna lie,” I said, chuckling.“For real, but apparently, the people who live there like it so much.”“And when they come here also, they want to go back. They basically can’t stand Lagos either,” I said.“Exactly. When we tweet about Abuja, they’re usually like, “No, don’t come o. We don’t want you here.”I laughed. “For real.”“I want to go back again though; just to chill or relax.”“How many times have you been?” I asked.“Once.”“Me too.”“It’s crazy how I got really home sick when I traveled to London last year for a residency, too. I think the best time to travel to London is summer, maybe June or July, when everywhere is bright. It’s very beautiful then.”“When did you go?”“I went in April. There was a lot of rain and the weather was so gloomy,” Chigozie said, irritated at the thought of it. “I get. I hate gloomy weather so much. It’s such a mood dampener.”“Exacly! I made a lot of friends though, but depression was really… was really hitting. I was like ‘Ahahn.’” It felt like she was recounting a traumatic experience.I laughed. “I was so happy on the night I got back to Lagos,” Chigozie said, shaking her head.“You were like ‘freedom at last!’” I exclaimed in a chuckle.“Yes o. Lagos is very chaotic, but it’s still home.”“If you could live in anywhere else asides Lagos, where would you live?”“I think Ghana.”“Yeah? You traveled there earlier this year right?”“Yeah, I did,” Chigozie said. “Ghana is kind of like Nigeria in some sense. Asides the borders being close, there’s a lot of similarities between us in some ways, with the people and culture.”“Yeah. That makes sense.”
We continued our talk about how chaotic Lagos is and how comfortable it is to take walks in Abuja compared to how abysmal it is to do so in Lagos without being catcalled or enraged by drivers who threaten to hit you with their cars. Chigozie then tells me that she would love to move to a place large enough to ride a bicycle in.
“Oh you can ride a bike?”She puts on a slightly judgmental look. “Yes I can. Funnily enough, whenever people tell me they can’t ride a bike, I’m like how?” she asked squinting in disbelief.“What do you mean?” I was almost ready to fight.“What were you doing when you were younger?” Chigozie asked, confused.“Not riding a bike, I guess?” I giggled. “When did you start riding a bike?”“I can’t really remember, but I was pretty young.”“Do you have a bike?”“No I don’t have a bike right now,” Chigozie said. “Bikes are so expensive now, so I’ve heard.”“Yea, I heard too. Me, I was thinking maybe it was like 100k or something.”“Me, I thought it was 30k o, I swear.”We let out a laugh. “Even bikes are expensive right now. Everything is so expensive”“For real. Funny thing is that I made a tweet one time; something in the line of ‘How come you don’t know how to ride a bicycle?’ That’s how some people took it personally. I was like please nau.”I chuckled. “You were like ‘Sorry, I didn’t mean to.’”“See. One person said I was classist or something.”I laughed out loudly. “How did we get here?”Chigozie chuckled. “It was crazy because my friends and I would joke about it and we’d laugh, you get? After I gave the girl my reply, I just blocked her. That’s alright, that’s alright.”I chuckled.“It was obviously a joke, you know? Me, I don’t know how to swim and I’m 26 right now.”“I can’t swim either. I attempted one time and I almost drowned,” I said.“Me too! I’ve almost drowned as well,” she said in a knowing tone. I gasped like I had just made a fun discovery of shared trauma. “It was a terrible day. It was very scary.”“Exactly. And you wouldn’t be able to do anything.”“You’re just there!”“For real.”
We spoke for a while longer about swimming, the injury she sustained on her knee — that led to the failure of our first attempt at meeting— and how random events can make efforts on skincare futile.Chigozie also told me about how she had initially planned to have a birthday pool party at the restaurant we were, until she was told that there was a minimum spend of 500k.“That’s so crazy because you didn’t even know what you were going to order for yet,” I said with a surprised look on my face.“Thank you. It didn’t make sense at all. And I was so disappointed because the guy who initially told me it was okay didn’t apologize for the inconvenience or whatever. I felt bad about it until a friend linked me to another location. It’s called 37 Lagos, and it was so good! Plus their pool is way larger than the one they have here.”“Oh real? Lagos restaurants are really coming up with this minimum spend thing and it’s so annoying,” I said, recounting my own experience.“It’s unnecessarily classist and annoying. I almost cancelled my birthday plans, but a friend linked me to another location.”“Do you have pictures from that day? I don’t think I saw them.”“Oh real? Are you sure?” “Yea. I think I only saw the pictures where you said you had a good day.”“Let me show you,” Chigozie said, opening her Twitter app and scrolling through her media. I spotted a viral video of Trevor Jackson covering Tyla’s Water — Chigozie had posted the video earlier that day, and we laughed about it, knowingly.“You’re such a menace,” I said in a giggle.She laughed. “That video is so funny. I laugh every time I think about it.”
“How did you have a pool party without knowing how to swim though?” I asked on a lighter note while looking through the videos of her pool party, but I was genuinely curious. The pool was truly large.Chigozie chuckled. “So I basically just stood in the shallow end and was kicking my feet. I don’t know how to swim, but I love water. I love being in water.”“Interesting.”I found it even more interesting because she loved something that she almost drowned in.“Yeah.”
“So how are you right now?” I asked.She hesitated. “I’m just here. I’m okay. Turned a new age.”“How does that feel for you?”“In my head, I feel like I’m still 22, to be honest. Or 23. Every time, I’m like ‘Wow, I’m 26.’ Obviously, I don’t behave like a 22 or 23 year old, but in my head I feel like a baby. Like I’m still quite young.”“Like you’re just a girl,” I said amused.Chigozie smiled. “Exactly! Like I’m just a girl,” she said. “It doesn’t feel that much different, to be fair, but next year, especially with my work, I want it to be more successful. I feel like this year was calm, basically for resting. It was easy, more about figuring stuff out. I’m slowly getting into work mode already though, but next year will be awesome.”“Were you excited about your birthday?”“Yes, I was, actually. Usually, I’m not necessarily excited for my birthday, but this year I decided to be. Even when the plans for my birthday location fell through and I was sad, the next day, I got up and decided to be happy,” she said. “You only get one day to truly celebrate yourself — one day that’s for you, so I believe we should try to really enjoy those special days.”“Yea exactly. You’re not lying.”
Chigozie got a call that lasted for about a minute. A call that started with “Hi baby…” and sounded pretty intimate too.
“Are you in a relationship?”“So I got into one recently,” she said.“Oh so you’re new,” I said chuckling.She smiled — or blushed. “Yeah. I feel like I’ve known him for a while though. Like I’ve known him for the longest, which is really great because we kind of like eased into it.”“Yeah. I feel like going into relationships slowly makes a lot of sense; instead of just rushing into it.”“Exactly,” Chigozie said. “So it’s really nice. I feel like it’s one of those things that make life less difficult and crazy.”“I feel you. Having someone to text on those crazy days can be very sweet.”“For real,” she said. “Are you in a relationship?” “No,” I replied almost immediately and we both burst into a long laugh.“It’s the way you replied so fast for me,” Chigozie said in a laugh.“Oh my God. I didn’t know it came out so fast either,” I said, still laughing.“Are you like searching or something?”I hesitated. “I don’t know. I don’t think I’m actively searching,” I started. “I enjoy having crushes though,” I continued in a grin.“Crushes can be fun,” Chigozie said.“Yeah. I’m so done with situationships though. Like it’s enough.”“Thank you please!” She exclaimed in alliance.“I want something really sweet.”“You’ll find it.”“Were you looking for love when you found it?”“Not necessarily. I had gotten out of a thing when it happened.”“Oh you got out of a relationship this year?”“Yeah.” Chigozie paused. “Well, no.” She smiled. “We were pretty much undefined.”“A situationship?”She laughed. “More or less. Exactly.”I chuckled. “How was that?”“Never again o!” Chigozie exclaimed.We burst out into a laugh that said a lot about the crazy experiences we’ve both had.“Literally never again. I tell everyone I know not to go into situationships. Unless you’re both really okay with it, it’s fine,” Chigozie said.“Yeah.”“I think I’m a lover, to be honest. I’m a very big lover girl. So situationships are not my thing. I’ve not had a lot of them so when people talked about them, I was like ‘I can’t relate,’ until I related and was like ‘Omo, this thing is crazy o!’ I can’t be doing this please.”I laughed.“And I feel like situationship breakups hurt even more than relationship breakups. With relationships, you had that person, you experienced that person, but with situationships, it’s just something that never was.”“Exactly. It didn’t even happen, but like it was so exciting.”“Yeah, like so much impact still. So I don’t recommend for people who love love and are very soft because they’ll definitely fall in love. It’s even more risky when sex gets involved.”“For real. There’s this bond that’ll be created. A bond that might only be in your head. Like it’d be only you catching feelings.”“Yeah. So I think it’s best to just save yourself while it’s still early because the deeper you fall into it, the more hopeful you get and the more tragic the end is,” Chigozie said.She made a lot of sense.“I saw a video one time and it described how, with men, loving occurs in a process, but with women, they most likely have feelings for a man before they even start dating. There’s this rush already.”“Yeah! That’s so accurate. I think we get too emotionally connected and sometimes we don’t even know how connected we got until much later and we’re like ‘Wow. This thing really impacted and affected me.’”“Another thing I don’t like about situationships is how you can’t hold the other person accountable for the stuff they do that may have offended you, but with relationships, you can sit your partner down and explain in detail,” I said, tapping on the couch we were sitting on.Chigozie chuckled. “You would even have the right to have the conversation. Honestly, I feel like I can be so self aware with people, so I always like to check in. I never want to overstep my boundary or feel like I’m doing too much, so I always try to be clear. That’s not something I can enjoy doing in situationships.”“Yeah, for real.”“And when you get into healthy relationships, you realize you wasted so much time holding on to half-assed love,” Chigozie said.“Right?”
We talked further about how relationships hold so much weight and how important it is to be with someone who, according to Chigozie, would not be one of your 99 problems and would love communicating with you, even during fights.“The worst thing is when you’re an overthinker and you’re not with someone who loves listening to you and is interested in validating your feelings. Every action weighs on you,” Chigozie said.“Yeah, that’s so true,” I said. “I think that when somebody raises an issue or talks about a weird way you treated them, it’s not because they hate you. I think that if they tell you that you did this, it’s because they like you enough to talk about it and they still want you to be in their life.”“Exactly.”“And most times, how you see things might be different, but it’s so important to validate those feelings still. They’re not talking about what you meant or your intent, instead, they’re talking about how you made them feel.”“Yeah. And I feel it’s so important to be considerate in expressing your feelings too. I also believe it’s important to lay your feelings down on the table and talk things out — my friends have really helped me with this. You know, you might even end up apologizing, but at the end of the day, your connection grows stronger and that’s better than any ‘win.’”“For real. I really feel you on that.”
We talked more about conflict in relationships — be it romance or friendships — and how important it is to address issues with the other person in mind. We also talked about knowing when to let go of certain people when issues keep recurring and there’s no potential of a better relationship with them.
“So I want to ask a question about your artistry. How come all your paintings look like you?” My question was almost accusatory.
“It’s not even intentional,” Chigozie replied, giggling. “I’m not even doing it on purpose all the time. A lot of my paintings speak on things concerning me, so yeah those ones, but I actually don’t do it on purpose.” She paused. “Yeah, maybe I know my face so well and the way I paint sometimes reflects that, but I don’t mind it though because at the end of the day, a lot of the things I paint speak to me, so I feel like in that way, I’m just sharing pieces of myself with people and then, even though it’s unintentional, it makes my art more recognizable. So whenever people see my painting, they know it’s Chigozie that did that.”I smiled. “Yeah like ‘That’s Chigozie Obi’s art!’ I think that’s unique.”“Yeah.”“So have you ever had a solo exhibition in Lagos?”“So I had one at the Art X Lagos Fair. That was my first, but I want to have one next year. One that isn’t attached to an organization or body or something. Just completely mine. So hopefully that goes well.”“Yeah, it’ll go well. I’ll come.”“Yes, you have to come!” Chigozie exclaimed. “I have so many ideas I want to bring to life. Four fingers crossed that it goes well.” She chuckled, crossing her fingers.I laughed.
“So you’re a first daughter. Did you see those tweets about first daughters and pieces of advice for them?” I asked referencing a Twitter trend.“I saw a few and there was one I saw that said ‘Learn when to detach from people,’ and it really hit me,” Chigozie started. I feel like I hold on to people and give them multiple chances and I feel like that may have stemmed from my experience as a first daughter. I’ve learnt that I have to learn how to be myself first, and when I lost my Mum, I think it became a thing of ‘You’re the Mum now and you have to take care of your brother and your Dad,’ but eventually, I was like I still have my own life whilst still checking in and making sure they’re good.”“When did you lose your Mum?”“2019.”“Oh really?”“Yeah,” she paused. “After my Mum died, it sunk in that you can literally die at any moment, and when you die, nothing matters. Not the money, nothing at all. And even if people celebrate you on Earth, you’ll never know. So I find enjoying myself a big deal. It’s so important to me. I might not do it in the most extravagant way because money is so important, but I always try to find pockets of joy.”“And I think you have a lot of fun too,” I said.“Yeah, I try,” Chigozie said. “I think the misconception people have of me though, is that they think my life is so soft, like I have people who will dm me and be like ‘Chigozie, you just dey chop life o,’ but I’m like, I’m out here busting my ass o. I might not just show all the processes, but underneath all of that, it’s still work,” she said. I chuckled. “Yeah, I feel you.”“I take and post a lot of pictures though. When my Mum died, we only had about three pictures together.”“Oh my God.” That was sad.“I know right? So I told myself I want to start documenting everything, from my friends, to what I’m doing, places I visit, everything actually.”“Yeah. I’ve seen your Instagram page dedicated to pictures of places and things too,” I said, referencing Le Journal De Gozie. “Yeah. Sometimes, when I’m feeling down, all I need to do is scroll through my Instagram accounts, and it’s pretty easy to document on Instagram and Twitter too.”“I think that’s very intentional. It’s really nice and I love the concept of it.”“Thank you,” she said, smiling.
“I think you’ve really hacked your style too. I notice you love clothes,” I said.“Yeah, I do.”“Your outfits are pretty.”“Right? Thank you. I think that I’m evolving too. One thing I don’t want to do is feel like I can’t wear certain outfits because I’m growing older. I want my style to remain like this forever. One day, I’m wearing ashewo clothes, the next day, I’m dressed like a boss lady. The next day, I’m doing office worker. The next day I’m doing stripper.”“Does it depend your mood?” I asked before realizing the last thing she mentioned, and I laughed.“Sometimes,” she said, laughing. “I notice that when I’m feeling down, I wear black a lot.”“Now I’m going to be on the lookout for you in black,” I said, joking.She laughed. “No no, it’s not all the time. I’m wearing black tomorrow for my birthday dinner.”“Okay. After tomorrow, I’ll be on the lookout for you in black.”Chigozie laughed.
“So you mentioned earlier how expectations have shaped you in some way as a first daughter and how you’ve managed them. Are there childhood events or trauma that you feel have, in some way, affected your current view of the world or how you relate to people?”Chigozie hesitated for a second. “Hmmm not particularly, but I know that growing up introverted, it took me having female friends to open up to certain things. I grew up with so many boys around me and I didn’t really lean into my feminine side while growing up as well. I think I was a late bloomer too. Growing up like that didn’t make me feel so great or feminine in a way, but my female friends have helped me to open up more and appreciate my body more. It’s also much easier to talk to them about topics like sex. I had to become more confident with saying how I feel and sharing how I certain things affect me too,” she said. “I did like a 180. Is it 180 or 360?” Chigozie asked. She was trying to describe the turning point in her life and I found it hilarious.“You sha did something,” I replied, laughing. My brain was not processing that either, to be honest.She laughed. “I sha did something,” she said. “I feel like younger Chigozie would be happy with where I am right now.”“I’m sure she is.”
I listened to Chigozie tell me about how growing up introverted made her self aware, and maybe a little too much in some cases, as she has now grown to be more calculative of the things she says, who she says them too and where she says them. It’s not exactly a problem though because she would never be silent when she needs to speak. It was then I realized that I hadn’t ordered for a drink or food yet.
“I think I’m ready to have a drink now,” I said. “You should have the chapman. It’s really good.”I was staring at the menu. “Oh really?” “Yeah. People say the pineapple juice is good too though.”“Nah, I’ll have the Chapman. What’s their pizza like?”“It’s so good, but disclaimer: It’s really simple. There’s nothing much happening with it.”“I love my pizza like that though. Is it flat?”“Yeah, it is. I usually have the pepperoni,” Chigozie said. “My boyfriend’s not a fan of it like I am though.”I chuckled. We had two pepperoni pizzas to go and the Chapman was really good. I tried not to finish it in one sip. Chigozie said I did a good job for not finishing it all at once.
“I really like this space,” I said, scanning through the restaurant.“Yeah it’s pretty chill. Have you been to Godaïf?”“Nah I haven’t.”“We should go there next.”I squealed in faux excitement. “Is that a second date?” Chigozie laughed.“You know those moments when you go out on a date and you get excited when they start planning a second date before the end of the first?” I asked.“Yeah,” Chigozie replied, smiling.“That’s how I feel right now.”

Perhaps I should have been more compassionate towards the Stockholm inflicted ones. I tried. Not hard but I tried. I couldn't do it. I couldn't look into the inhuman eyes of the corporate bot and feel anything but loathing.

Stockholm Syndrome, a perplexing psychological phenomenon, has captured the attention of experts and the public alike due to its intricate interplay between captive and captor. This psychological response, which was first observed during a bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden in 1973, continues to raise questions about human behavior under duress.
When individuals find themselves in situations of extreme vulnerability and captivity, they may develop a peculiar bond with their captors. This bond appears counterintuitive, as one might expect fear and aversion to predominate in such scenarios. However, Stockholm Syndrome highlights the complexity of human coping mechanisms, shedding light on the psychological mechanisms that drive these unexpected emotional connections.
Victims of Stockholm Syndrome often display empathy and loyalty towards their captors, perceiving them as protectors or guardians rather than aggressors. This psychological shift can be attributed to several factors, including perceived dependency on the captor for basic needs, isolation…

We are at our best when we establish authentic connections with one another, lifting each other up. Two incredible highlights this week: ⭐Helping a dear friend securing an interview and watching him shine bright after listening to him painfully talk himself down for months; ⭐My call with Giulia Fiorista has become a weekly opportunity for me to brainstorm, be inspired, and inspire. This time around, I shared some input that might’ve turned out more useful than I expected. And that’s why it’s usually a good idea to share your knowledge: you might be sitting on someone’s goldmine taking it completely for granted.
I posted about it on LinkedIn earlier this week: I was sorting some ancient papers and documents and unearthed one of my first CVs ever! The “good old days” when: 1) You printed and handed your CV in person wherever you wished to apply; 2) I didn’t realise I could be creative and make up a format of my own (and remove the headshot altogether); 3) LinkedIn wasn’t really a thing. So much has changed in 10 years uh?!
Talking with colleagues in tech, it seems there’s a pattern of communication issues between Product and Commercial across the industry. How many opportunities is this incommunicability costing us? Something to think about…
My final thought is coming from a place of distrust. Some weeks ago I reached out to a popular pre-employment testing company with some questions about what steps they take to make your their timed logics test is “neurodiverse-friendly”. For example, people with dyslexia are known to underperform on timed tests, is there an option for a time-extension? It’s something simple that can make a huge difference for a candidate. I reached out to them through 4 different sources and was ignored for the most part until I was told someone would get in contact. So far, it’s only been silence on their part… If this lack of response equals to a “no”, wouldn’t these tests be highly discriminatory?
Thanks for reading, happy weekend! 👒

No trip to Stockholm is complete with a visit to the archipelago. Let me guide you to some of my favourite spots…
“Stockholm i mitt hjärta, Stockholm in my heart — a city of islands, that is you.” Those are the words by Lasse Berghagen that fill the air every Tuesday summer night as thousands of people, gathered at open air museum Skansen for the popular singalong TV show Allsång på Skansen, take tune. As their words travel across the bay below, the cameras pan over the stunning water landscape and one wonders if the melody manages to reach all of the 14 islands that make up the capital of Scandinavia — or indeed the patchwork of 30,000 islands that spread out beyond that.
Stockholm is beautiful any time of the year, but the magical, seemingly endless, summer light sees the capital come to life more than ever — and at this time of the year there is only one place to be. Outside.
Whether it’s a walk through the national park and museum island of Royal Djurgården or a stroll along the picturesque Söder Mälarstrand, a run along Årstaviken or a panoramic tour of Fjällgatan, the inner city waterfront views are breathtaking. However, a summer trip to Stockholm is not complete without a trip to skärgården, the archipelago.
To explore the 30,000 islands that make up the Stockholm archipelago (all accessible thanks to the Swedish Right To Roam), simply hop on a traditional white, wooden boat from Waxholmsbolaget or a speedier Cinderella ferry from Strömma. Once on board, the archipelago world is your oyster.
Where to go? Here are a few suggestions.
Fjäderholmarna is a good start. Located 30 minutes from Stockholm’s Nybrokajen, this cluster of islands is the closest archipelago destination and it offers both beautiful countryside and bustling town life. Here you can explore traditional handicraft, sample beer at the local brewery, try handmade sweets at the chocolate factory and indulge in delicious ice cream from Systrana Degens Glassstuga. Once you’ve tasted what the town has to offer, why not stroll along the beaches, take a dip in the sea and spend the evening unwinding with a glass of wine and fresh seafood at one of the many restaurants? Life could be worse.
Waxholm is without a doubt the capital of the archipelago. Complete with its own castle, built in 1549 to defend King Gustaf Vasa, this historic old town comes with pastel-coloured houses, art, shopping and good food. It’s a great option if you want to mix nature with culture and it is also accessible via car or bus, should you prefer getting around on land.
Grinda sits at the heart of the archipelago and is an island that, located about an hour from Stockholm, just epitomises serene Swedish countryside. Step back in time as you step off the boat and find yourself in a nature reserve decorated with idyllic, old-school red and yellow houses, wild nature and beautiful beaches. The art nouvaeu style Grinda Wärdshus restaurant is open weekends and holidays and you will not struggle to find a blissful place to picnic on the rest of Grinda. Just lush.
Möja is the spot for the active traveller. Ideal if you want to do more than just chill by the beach, this large island is well suited for bike trips and day hikes — and do make sure you climb to the top of Vårdkaseberget and enjoy a stunning view of the surrounding scenery. Beaches are less accessible here, so it’s not necessarily one for swimming, but you can eat freshly caught seafood at Wikströms Fisk, a tavern run by the archipelago’s only professional fisherman.
Sandhamn is a well-known, idyllic harbour and popular destination for big yachts and their owners. Located about an hour from Stockholm city, Sandhamn offers sandy beaches (as indicated by the name — it literally means Sand Harbour), bike trails, kayaking and spa, not to mention plenty of restaurants and bars; this is without a doubt the party central of the archipelago.
Finnhamn is your destination if you want to see more of the archipelago as part of your trip. Getting here takes about 2.5 hours by boat so you want to set off in time — but what a journey it is. Expect plenty of photo opportunities on board, and do try to get a good seat outside if the weather is nice; there are few things as peaceful as tanning on a boat gliding through skärgården. (Though it can get windy so do pack a jumper in case.) Bring a picnic blanket, snacks and bikini for a day of ultimate relaxation — once on the island you will find perfect trekking conditions and many a private bay to picnic, tan and swim. Just don’t miss the last boat back, though if you do you can always stay overnight at the local hostel.
Utö, meaning Outer Island, sits farthest out in the Southern part of the archipelago and so offers a very wild, natural experience. A visit here is all about enjoying the elements. Renowned for the many hours of sunshine that it gets, the island serves up white sand beaches, cliffs and various sporting opportunities including canoeing, biking, tennis, beach volleyball and boules. Hike around the island and get the best view from the 18th Century windmill.
As you can tell there is plenty of option in the Stockholm archipelago, but regardless of your choice, you will find yourself unwinding with every breath of fresh sea air — and returning back home you may just find yourself singing about your love for Stockholm…

Freedom is scary.
That is the thought I left you with last time.
As much as we want freedom, getting there requires that we sever the umbilical cord that connects us to the lies and limiting beliefs that we have come to rely on from day to day.
And that is scary.
I believe this is why people cling so tightly to their guns and their religion and their political affiliations.
Fear.
The thing about fear, though, is that, in most cases, it is not based in tangible reality. It is not the result of something that has actually happened to an individual. But, rather, it is centered in some kind of what-if or hypothetical scenario.
Fear finds its sustenance in the straw man.
Let us take guns for example.
People cling extremely tightly to their guns and their right to own them. So much so that they are unwilling even to restrict other’s access to them, even if those people legitimately should not be allowed that responsibility.
Even at the expense of other’s lives, these people will defend their guns.
Why?
Because of a perceived need to protect themselves from a tyrannical government or from the off chance that a fully armed intruder will break in to their home. Neither of these things are terribly likely to happen in the grand scheme of things.
But the fear is there. And someone has told them that the solution for these fears is a gun.
And so their beliefs about the world have become restricted and limiting. And therefore how they view the world has become warped.
And that distorted view of the world creates more fear and therefore a tighter grasp on what is perceived as the solution to that fear.
And so on and so on it goes.
Fear causes us to believe only the most limited of things about the world and ourselves. And these limiting beliefs act to keep us chained to a radiator in the dark basement of our souls.
And there we believe we must stay, no matter what.

Nashville. Seattle. Detroit. London. New York. London. Stockholm. All of these are key cities in the music of the 20th century.
But hang on a minute. Stockholm??
Yeah, I wouldn’t have thought so either. Aside from the obvious example and a few bands from the early 2000s, like Eskobar and Kent, still in my record collection, I never would have associated the Swedish capital city with music.
That changed when I spent some time there in the summer of 2024.
Like any good trip to a city I’ve never been in, my initial walk in the neighbourhood in which I’m staying revolves around tracking down record stores.
“But aren’t they all the same as the ones at home?” someone might ask. “Don’t be silly” is the only logical answer.
I walked out of the first one with two Charlatans records that I’ve never seen at any other store anywhere in the world. The fact that one was their second album…

I’m sitting on my favorite aircraft, Delta Air Lines A330–900 Neo, headed to a place that I also love to visit. Amsterdam. Although it’s not our final destination, it’s a fantastic location for a layover in the KLM lounge, a Delta Air Lines partner, where services are also top-notch.
There’s plenty of space to find a wonderful temporary home for relaxation, sleep, meals, reflection, or anything your spirit craves related to your travel desires.
Okay, I’ve skipped a little too far ahead because, in the meantime, we’re still sitting in my favorite seat, Delta One, on my favorite airline. If you haven’t experienced D-1, well, let me give you a sneak preview. In this seating configuration, my desk is to the right, with a plug-in for my laptop, and a convenient port for headphones to listen to entertainment options, including music, movies, TV Series, and family entertainment.
If you’re feeling a bit tired and need to catch some z’s, there’s a pillow, blanket, and comfortable eye mask available. The most fantastic feature is that the seat converts into a lie-flat bed, making it easy to find your comfort zone.
Passengers must wait until the plane reaches the appropriate altitude and the pilot gives the okay to move about the cabin…

When I was in ninth standard, I first came across him. He was from another school. People called him Andrew. He was not the tallest, but was the strongest. He was unbeaten at arm wrestling. There was a certain charm about him that all the boys flocked around him. They all looked forward to be with him. To be in his company, was considered privilege by clueless fourteen-year-olds. He would influence major decisions, dictate terms, bring in new trends and wore the best clothes because his father was a rich man. He always had at least half-a-dozen boys hanging out with him. After school, he would form a circle with those boys and pick two of them and made them fight. Like a referee, he would signal the start of the bout and wait until one of them was completely on the ground, and gave up. He enjoyed while the boys fought and after the fight, both of them would continue to walk around him, like nothing happened. They were just following orders and it didn’t affect them emotionally, although I’m sure physical pain lasted.
One day at school, Andrew was caught copying in the English exam. And in those days, punishments were ruthless. Especially, in that school, they had a public-shaming vice-principal who would beat the shit out of the kid in assembly if the crime was grave enough. The next day, before the start of the Maths exam, the vice-principal called Andrew out and announced to the whole school that he had copied in the English exam. And he began to hit him with a cane. After seven or eight blows, the stick broke and the beating continued by hand. There was hair pulling and ear pulling and unlimited supply of swearing. After about five minutes, the beating stopped and everyone was allowed inside the exam halls. After the exam, all the seven or eight boys who hung around him, returned to their duty — standing beside him. And the first thing Andrew said to them, ‘I didn’t get hurt at all. In fact, the stick broke!’ and everyone hailed him as a legend. That was my introduction to blind followers.
Now extrapolate this story to the current crisis in North India. Everyone knows that their chief has been convicted of rapes without any reasonable doubt and still, they continue to take his side. And they will defend to death, their leader, who is their only sense of self-worth and identity. Young, old, men, women and even young girls have come out in his support in lakhs and they think he is innocent. They don’t just think, they believe the whole thing to be a conspiracy against him, perpetrated by the state.
In psychology, there’s a concept called the ‘Stockholm Syndrome’, where the hostages start liking their kidnappers and form a psychological alliance with them. Sometimes, very strong emotional develop between two persons where one person intermittently harasses, beats, threatens, abuses, or intimidates the other. In this case, although it is legally proved that the so called saint is a rapist, somehow it puts into question, the years of dedication they have displayed towards him. It is like you pet a snake since the day it hatched and one day, it grows big enough to bite you, the the only person who loves it. But then, you like the snake so much that you are ready to die by its poison.
In 2010, I was working with a film director helping him complete a paranormal/horror movie script. During those sittings, we happened to discuss a god-man from Andhra Pradesh who charged about five lakhs for a darshan. That is, you have to pay that money just to see him. And there is a long queue of people willing to do that. In fact, people wait for months for their turn. Then, I asked him, what about poor people, don’t they have access? He said, ‘If you can’t afford him, you can pay two lakhs and see his wife.’
His answer blew my mind. Then, I asked him, what is so special about meeting him? Why should one pay that kind of money? To which, he said, ‘I have a friend who pays five lakhs every now and then. He says, it is his aura. The moment you enter the room, you can feel his aura. And if he touches you, his aura stays with you for a long time and it will attract all the positive things, makes you rich, literally and mentally.’
To an extent, I believe in the concept of aura and positive vibes. But people willing to pay for it? That was a new. An eye-opener. So while we’re at it, if you go and tell this friend of the director, that the god-man is a fraud and that he’s been exploiting the vulnerabilities of gullible disciples, what do you think will happen? He will tell you to get the hell out.
That’s what cults do. When a person gets indoctrinated into a belief system and start following a guru, or a god-man, what actually happens is that they build a strong, unbreakable bridge with them. And in the process of building that bridge, they shut off all roads toward rationality and ability for freedom of thought. It’s a tunnel with no other outlets. And that liberates people, because this sense of belonging to that cult, it’s better than their current life. And what looks like liberation, is actually, a long, endless, incarceration of the mind.

Hello and Hi!
This is the first dataviz challenge for the Data Visualisation Stockholm (DVS) Meetup group. We’ve been discussing holding a challenge for at least a year and FINALLY we’ve finished the first one!
DVS was founded two years ago when the two original organisers started their own two dataviz Meetup groups just a few days apart in Stockholm, Sweden, but then decided that Stockholm was a one-dataviz-Meetup-group town and joined forces. We both wanted to create a space where we would gather enthusiastic designers, developers, artists, statisticians, journalists, and all kinds of amazing people interested in data to network and get to know each other. We also wanted our members to have the opportunity to grow as data designers.
We have discussed holding challenges for a while now, but it took an enthusiastic member asking us to stop procrastinating (Thanks!) and get on with it. But the discussions were not fruitless; they got us talking about the types of dataviz challenges we liked and the kind wanted to run. We determined that a fun and engaging challenge, one that we would want to participate in, had two equally important parts, an interesting theme and a design constraint. The theme would attract participants and the design constraint would challenge them to be creative.
This first challenge was all about Stockholm winters. The dataset had data on snow depth and temperature in Stockholm stretching from January 2021 all the way back to the beginning of the early 20th century.
I must say that I was quite impressed with the variety of submissions we got!
So in no particular order lets go through the charts and see all submissions. Descriptions were written by the respective authors.
WhoMatthias Stahl. Freelance data visualisation designer with a history in bioinformatics, passionate about the combination of data, code, art and design to craft beautiful and impactful visuals.Twitter: @h_i_g_s_c_hLink to the interactive viz
CommentI wanted to go for a spiral layout as this enables the year-wise comparison of this periodic data. I then transformed the temperature and snow data into binary variables — fitting to the overall black-and-white theme. Is there snow: yes/no; and is the temperature higher than 10 °C: yes/no. The best way to encode the temperature turned out to be the spiral line thickness. The circles for the snowy days are apparently inspired by snowflakes. In order to make it clearer that circles represent snowy days, I added a snowing animation.
Tools: Sketch on paper, then Svelte and D3
WhoAlenka Gucek. Postdoc at Uppsala University, studying diabetes and cell biology. I’ve always enjoyed doing visualisations for research and now I’m looking for ways to change career to dataviz.Twitter: @alenka_gucek
CommentOriginally I was planning for a gif with falling snow, but it looked like too much of chart junk. Then I switched to do something simple and informative, inspired by Evelina Judeikyte’s talk [at one of the Meetup events] on simplicity, annotations in The Economist and spark lines by Edward Tufte.
Tools: Excel, Origin and CorelDraw
WhoNina Lindell. Data visualisation engineer at Telia, building products based on mobility data.Twitter: @ninatsutsLink to the code
CommentI wanted to make the data look like piles of snow, and finally create a ridge-line plot (aka joy plot). I have recently started learning D3 and the challenge seemed like a good opportunity to try out my skills on a real dataset. I decided to keep the last 50 years of data and only look at the snow depth. There are still some things I would like to improve upon — highlight interesting data points with annotations, mark the scale, and make winters continuous so that at least November — March are on the same row. That is something for the next iteration.
Tools: Tableau for prototyping, D3 for the final chart
WhoTyler Wolf. Data visualisation specialist at King Games.Twitter: @tylernwolf
CommentI thought about the question “what does a month look like?” And then broke it into the two pieces of data we had in the dataset: temperature and snowfall. But then I wanted to give it context and look for patterns, specifically thinking of the question, are days getting hotter? — obviously thinking of climate change. So I ran a moving average on temperatures to break the temperature component into above or below average for that month. I did this because we can conclude that it’s cold in the winter and hot in the summer already, so a relative comparison gives more context. That made three pieces of data. Finally, I thought about how much I like it when it snows, so it would be nice to get an idea of how many days it was actually snowing in each month. So with those pieces of data and the limitation of black and white only, I experimented with rectangles and lines until I arrived at something that felt right and could condense the data, making each month look unique and allowing their elements to interact with each other. The aesthetic was inspired partially by some of giorgia lupi’s work.
Tools: D3 to draw the graphics, observablehq to get up and experimenting quickly and Figma for early sketching and to draw the legend and title.
WhoPatrick Wojda. Data visualisation and front-end engineer at Aftonbladet, Swedens largest online newspaper.
CommentLooking through the data I realised that there were too many years in the dataset to visualise without losing the personal perspective so I filtered the data on a personal question… were my childhood winters snowier than what my kids get to experience? I did all of the data cleaning and formatting using Javascript (lodash and D3). The most fun aspect of the challenge was figuring out the design, but I spent almost all of the time on data processing. I iterated over the design multiple times, both hand-drawn and in code before I got to where I wanted.
Tools: Javascript, lodash, D3, Svelte, Paper app on IOS for sketching.
That’s a wrap!
Stay tuned for more challenges, we will be announcing them on our GitHub repo (https://github.com/Dataviz-Stockholm/challenges).
Take care and stay safe.

According to Wikipedia, there are four components that comprise Stockholm syndrome:
I was never a huge Javascript guy. I’d use jQuery from time to time. Sometimes, I’d use it to make some AJAX calls and maybe change an element or two on a Rails app I was working on. Life was simple, with jQuery doing most of the grunt work and me doing nothing at all. I didn’t need to know much about Javascript at all and that was the way I liked it.
I was eventually asked to develop a desktop application for authoring media-heavy multi-language content. Not wanting to descend into the waking nightmare that is Java Swing that I had learned to hate in graduate school, I quickly picked up Angular (1) and Electron. It was magical.
I loved how simple everything was. I could write to disk as often as I wanted using Node’s NON-BLOCKING IO (very web-scale). Callback hell was a little difficult to deal with, but then I learned about Promises and entered Promise hell. The fires in this hell were a little less intense, so it was all good. Even better, I now reside in the promised (haha get it) land of Async Await.
Anyhow, Angular truly felt like magic the first time I used it. I would change the application’s state and things would just appear! I didn’t have to use selectors or iterate through DOM elements like some sort of neanderthal. I didn’t understand how the lifecycle worked at all, but who really wants to? Not me. I want to keep the magic alive.
Nobody wants (Angular) sausage after they see how it’s made.
— a very wise person
Of course, this quickly bit me in the ass. My completely unoptimized code was slow sometimes (all the time). So, like any responsible and capable developer, I arrived at an obvious conclusion: Angular was the problem and there was nothing I could do to fix it. I needed to switch frameworks, to use something faster, more performant, and most importantly, with better benchmark scores.
I moved onto React. With React came stage-0 proposals, Babel, Webpack, boilerplates, functional programming, great hair, Redux, GraphQL, CSS in JS, and much more. I now spend my time away from work preparing for work, reading about the hottest new packages, jumping on every bandwagon I can. Maybe I should use Parcel, it’s zero configuration and probably knows what’s best for me. I’ve abandoned all non-Javascript languages for the backend. How else am I going to get my SSR-game on? Javascript is all I need.
I think Javascript is a pretty good guy. You can iterate SO FAST. Compiling? What’s that? Think of all the time you’ll save not waiting for stuff to compile. Sure, there’s essentially no native type system and all sorts of dangerous type coercions can happen, but hey, that’s what Flow and Typescript are for, right? Transpiling is fine and very fast! There are no problems here.
Sure, bugs in the original Javascript implementation have become part of the spec. But look, Brendan Eich had to hack together all of Javascript in a few days. Can you blame him? No. Nobody’s perfect. Except for Javascript. Javascript is perfect.
Javascript is very human. Most teams I’ve worked with are fluent in Javascript. Look at all of the NPM packages. I’d wager that it encompasses all of human knowledge. If there was to be a language to transcend all languages and bring all of humanity together, I would bet on Javascript. Is there a Babel transform for Esperanto? That’d probably be a good start.
To Javascript is human.
— Alexander Pope
I feel this point about ‘belief in humanity’ is somewhat tenuous. You can tell I’m really stretching. Javascript isn’t a human being. Although, Javascript is pretty weird and unpredictable, as are humans.
The local police have been in a standoff outside of where Javascript and I have been holed up for the last 47 hours. I can’t be sure if I’m actually suffering from Stockholm syndrome because I’m not just a very cooperative person in general. But what I do know is that I’m not coming out of the deep, dark hole that I’ve dug myself into.
I like it here. There’s everything I could need or want. I’m very comfortable here. This is who I am now. If anyone is feeling charitable, please throw some food down here if you can. In the meantime, I think I’m going to take a nap. I’m very tired from all of this Javascripting.

This is my 28-day journey of living a temporary life in Helsinki, Tallinn, Stockholm, and Copenhagen.
🇸🇪 August 5, 2019
Look closely at the present you are constructing: it should look like the future you are dreaming. (Alice Walker)
Finding gratitude in small things and injecting a little randomness into my life is one of my 2018 and 2019 resolutions. And a lot of small wonders coincidently happened every day. Because I am in a different country and experiencing different culture? Well, it might be true, but might not.
I went to Gamla Stan and looked around the old town. Sometimes I stopped by souvenir shops to buy a Sweden flag pin because I’m collecting flag pins of countries that I visited. But today I had a bigger mission from my niece. We had a chat on Instagram yesterday, and she told me that she wanted to get a beautiful Swedish style pencil case. Well, what is the Swedish style and where can I find that style? I just went around some shops and found a beautiful pencil case. Surprisingly, it was the same style pencil case as the one that she wanted to have. Today’s small wonder started like that.
While I was looking around, I saw a bunch of people gathering in front of the palace. It seemed like they were waiting for something. So, I joined in the line of people and waited together. Some minutes later, the palace guards riding on horses started marching with music. I never imagined that I could see the Changing of the Guard at Gamla Stan. The second small wonder accidentally happened, too.
I got to a small square and saw old buildings painted with beautiful colors next to the Noble Prize Museum. When I took some pictures and started keep walking, I saw a young boy drawing buildings that I took pictures of just now. I came to him quietly and looked at his painting. It was really beautiful, more beautiful than the original ones. I saw a small donation box beside him, took 20 SEK from my pocket and put it into his box. He looked at me with smile and said, “Thank you.” It was a small donation for rooting for his dream. I prayed with all my heart, recalling his big innocent grin that he will be a great artist who will make our world better with his great ability. That was my third small wonder that I came across in Gamla Stan.
After wandering at Gamla Stan, I bought a cinnamon roll, went to Humlegarden, a park near my hotel, sat on a bench, and read a book, eating the cinnamon roll. If a park like this was near my home in Seoul, I would be really happy. Building a library, a park, and a stage that anyone comes and uses for free — building a free culture park — is one of my dreams, but can I construct this wonder in the future?

For the final project of this 12-week UI sprint, my peers and I were asked to create a passion project based on a travel campaign. This campaign’s deliverables would be executed through a 4 screen website, branding assets, and printed/digital media marketing; all targeted towards a specific demographic to promote possible visitors to visit that location.
I chose to focus my final project on Stockholm, Sweden. Over the last few years, it’s one of the cities I’ve set my heart on. With a deep love for all things Scandinavian design (both interior, industrial, and graphic), it was only natural that I wanted to infuse my personal interests into this project. Although I have never been, I asked myself why I would want to visit this city rich in arts & culture, and what my itinerary would possibly include while I was there. In my younger years growing up, I spent multiple weekends off school and during summer vacations obsessing over museums. My brother and I had no problem wasting away the day exploring each exhibit on display — he loved learning about dinosaurs, I was interested in arts & crafts. Under the same roof, we always found a middle ground.
During the initial research phase of this project, I came across an article that defined Stockholm as a “mecca of museums”. It is home to over 100+ museums within the city limits. Both national collections, and independent institutions that celebrate an array of topics — from ABBA, marine biology, photography, alcohol distillery, etc., Stockholm has a museum that would peak every type of interest for a potential tourist. Here I found the niche demographic I would design for. My goal was to highlight this special collection of institutions (for both museum lovers and those not familiar), and give the general public a streamlined resource for planning their visit in the city.
Moving forward, I created a fictional persona to design for the campaign — meet Joel Pryor. He’s 26 years old, and currently living, working, and playing in the city of Vancouver. He is a recent Architectural Technologist graduate, interning as a junior A/T at a firm. In the evenings he works part time at an East Van cocktail bar, where he connects with other likeminded peers that join his interests in film photography, design, biking, jazz music, and fashion. Listed below is his motivations/frustrations correlating to both travel planning in general, and visiting Stockholm for the first time. My goal was to create a realistic persona with flexible ideals that would be found in his demographic. Joel is knowledgeable in all things niche, and I wanted to create a campaign that reflected that altruistic path.
Before navigating artistic directions for the project, I already knew the route I wanted to take it in in terms of composition in typography. I wanted the project to be an ode to Swiss type, through the applications of poster and print. The Swiss design identity is bold and robust, yet simplified through its modern form and function of sans serif type. Below is the graphic inspiration and composition I collected moving forward in deciding the application of art directions.
Art direction #1: playful, bright, young, quirky, primary
Art direction #2: unapologetic, contrasting, provocative, strong
In the end, I decided to apply the second art direction due to the sensibility of black and white to contrast the colorful imagery that goes along with museums. Looping back to the persona, Joel, it would align with Swedish brands he’d identify with, and the “in your face” and “tongue and cheek” language of the campaign. Museums aren’t the most exciting attraction at the top of mind for people unlike Joel, and I felt that in order for it to resonate with a larger demographic, it would have to be striking.
For the logo, I played on the symmetry of stacked letters within the word “museums” to mimic the level of weights within the site branding. I went through multiple iterations of movement when it came to the letters, and thought that since the site followed a grid system, the logotype should also follow suit.
Circular STD was the singular font chosen for all the branding and application of the campaign. Carrying on with the sans serif typefaces known in Swiss design, it replicates a weighted presence without feeling intimidating. Black and bold is used for all the H1 and H2 headers, with book supplementing body text. All capitals are used on the headers to emphasize the urgency and weight.
As previous mentioned; the art direction I continued with carries a black and white narrative that is minimalistic, modern, and clean. Due to the variety of images hypothetically added by the museums themselves, I wanted a clean slate for the content to speak for itself. The only pattern that would contrast the two tones is a pinstripe; made up of a list of the museums within the city.
For collateral purposes, I chose products that would continue the conversation of the city and the findings at these museums past Stockholm city limits. Travellers would have the capability to carry their discoveries back home with them, and discuss their trip through the points of contact.
Below are the multiple levels of the Design Inception that I created for the campaign. The outer layer describes the environment of all UI assets, and as you go further into the center it breaks down the tone of the campaign through the tone. At the center of the Design Inception is the over arching why; why that target demo would find this campaign useful, and the overall purpose moving forward. My final why is as follows: “Connecting past and present”. Humanity wants to see a visual representation of change through time. Evolution, progression, succession — all documented and on view for the mass public. In the ethos section of the “About”, I created a spiral visual that lists the words “Remarkable. Relevant. Educational.” These three words summarize the levels of the inception on a digestable level.
Before unveiling the prototype, I wanted to outline the primary user flow that Joel, would walk through on the site. From the home page, the user would have the option to click the “About” page, which tells the ethos of the campaign, a “Registry” that lists the filter of museums within Stockholm, and finally, a “Web Shop”. For the sake of the prototype, the user would click “Registry” if they were interested in seeing the hub of locations, then from there their desired topic would filter their results into an event calendar, social media links, or that 3rd party museum site. The black squares are the screens made for the prototype and the white outlined boxes are future considerations.
As a final deliverable for the project, I compiled mockups for how Google Adwords would advertise the campaign. Keeping in mind the persona, I chose 4 different sites that Joel would frequently visit as his choice of media. The exemplary image below showcases the banner on Dezeen (both upper top and right of the navigation) but similar banners would be displayed on sites like Vice and Monocle. In terms of Instagram, I also wanted to imply that my target user frequents social media to see what’s current in the media and the influence it has on day to day. The Museums of Stockholm Instagram would emulate the feel of the site, and update users on new exhibitions, events, and restock of product.

full Travel Portfolio
Stockholm Syndrome, in case you didn't know, is the phenomenon of a captive becoming attached to, or at least developing feelings of trust or affection toward their captor. It was perhaps fitting/ironic/coincidental then, that as we landed in the Swedish capital our only organised activity for the weekend was a game of RoomEscape — a live action, “escape-the-room” puzzle-cum-teambuilding challenge.
However before I digress with this tenuous attempt to fit some sort of play on words into the blog title, let’s rewind the weekend and run things through chronologically.
← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ←
We flew out around lunchtime on Friday. If you book flights an appropriate amount of time in advance you can get from London to Stockholm for as little as £20 return. Which is great, but there are sacrifices to make elsewhere…getting from Skavsta Airport to Stockholm is actually more expensive than the flight (£22 return), and for us getting from Surrey to Stansted was even more expensive than that. But the journey is the destination, right…?
I always loathe arriving in a new place at night-time (or rather in darkness — it was only 16:30) as it totally inhibits one’s ability to soak up the local atmosphere — the vibe. And on a more practical level it makes it just that little bit trickier to get one’s bearings. We had no problem finding our AirBnb though — located one tube stop from the Central station and then barely 100m from the station to our front door.
The Friday night was not entirely different to our typical London Friday night — it was messy. Huge shout out to Helle for curating our insobriety and taking us to the Party Arena. I can confirm, Sweden definitely knows how to get trolleyed. And how to Salsa. I would go into more detail if I my memory would permit it.
Our most impressive feat of the weekend was perhaps waking up in time the next morning to catch Stockholm in the daylight (roughly 08:30 to 15:00). Our cultural custodians, Usman and Jordan (with the aid of Trip Advisor) guided us around the old town, and to Stockholm’s City Hall, the site of the annual Nobel Prize Banquet, which we missed by one day. Invites must’ve got lost in the post.
A pretty cool thing that was going on was this, an artificial “star” hoisted into the Swedish night sky, generated by solar energy from last summer. Using a sunny summer’s day to light up a cold winter’s night — neat.
☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀
Walking through the shopping areas of the city we stopped in at an American-themed clothes shop. For the life of me I can’t remember the name of the shop — but it was somewhere in the Norrmalm region of the city. Anyway I want to plug this shop as there brilliant offer was fill up a shopping bag full of anything in the shop for just 300 SEK (£25). The centrepiece of my shopping bag was a bowling shirt/short sleeved lab coat that was previously owned by Fernando, Assistant Logistics Manager at Hostess Brands. Yup.
Saturday night we decided to go on an organized bar crawl. For 200 SEK (roughly £18) you get a free shot in 4 bars, 20% off drinks and club entry. Whilst I’m usually the first to object to forced fun of any sort there was no denying that this was a pretty good way to explore the nightlife and meet new people. Of note was an English fireman who threw up on the dancefloor in the second bar we stopped in. Sean Kingston knows.
On to Sunday and we again forced ourselves out into the open to maximize the daylight. Whereas Saturday had been chilly but sunny, Sunday was a more overcast affair. We were however blessed with the first snowfall of the season, which felt like another thing checked off the checklist, even if it was just a few millimetres.
After a reindeer sandwich (seemed more interesting than the traditional Swedish meatballs) we headed to RoomEscape (not to be confused with the online role-playing game RuneScape…). Personally (and I think the others will probably agree), this was the hidden gem of the trip. The game was really well-designed so as to be intricate but not impossible, and the level of detail in the room made for a tense and almost realistic experience. Our scenario featured us trying to disarm nuclear weapons in a Cold War bunker. Despite requiring a few hints to cross the finish line we disabled the bomb and saved the world with 6 minutes to spare! You’re welcome.
So yeah, this was a great trip. No regrets, no “wrong” or “right” decisions, just a bucket load of deeds done. Amen.

Almost jealous of the Swedes
A couple of weeks back I had the pleasure of spending two days in Stockholm, Sweden. As you might already know, Finland used to be part of the great Swedish empire from the 12th century to 1809, so as a Swedish speaking Finn it is always a special feeling to visit Stockholm. It is as close to coming home to as anything that actually isn’t one’s home, this feeling being further enhanced by the many close friends I always get to catch-up with in Stockholm.
It is still almost difficult not to be jealous of my Swedish buddies: the Swedish economy is still strong, the Swedes are tall and beautiful, the tech ecosystem overall is vibrant, and some of the most exciting tech start-ups in the world are from Sweden (Spotify, Klarna, King.com, Pingdom, and many more). Although Creandum and Northzone are really great early stage VCs, I do however hear rumblings that there definitely would be room for more active seed stage investment. At least that seems to be the common message at SUP46, the SUPeractive start-up space smack in the middle of Stockholm. On this trip I also got to meet a few really interesting software companies. I really do hope we will soon find another Swedish investment for Open Ocean, our only current one of course being our rapidly growing superstar Truecaller (www.truecaller.com).
Luckily I haven’t yet had to turn completely green with envy of the Swedes, as my Finnish buddy Mikko Ilonen three weeks ago beat world number four Henrik Stenson in the World Matchplay golf final!

Landed Stockholm and went straight from Arlanda to Viggsö aka “Abba Island”.
Somehow I’m right outside ABBA’s hit-writing cottage on the island. Over the course of days I got subsumed by the breakdown of Björn and Agnetha’s marriage, as documented in ‘The winner takes it all’.
After 3 straight days of listening on repeat, the reductive zero-sum nature of the winner taking it all meaning that the loser *has* to fall weighed me down to exhaustion and I left Sweden, never to return.
Stockholm set off a bizarre mix of city-syndromes in my travels.
Medellin, Colombia: 24 hours in I began to suffer Netflix-induced delusions that I knew more about the #rise #fall of Pablo Escobar than anyone, including locals who actually knew him. I’d casually hang around the [since] demolished house where he was killed on December 2, 1993 and offer visiting tourists free guidance to the rest of Pablo’s Medellin. All but 3 refused me.
Beirut, Lebanon: Guns pointed at my head at a Hezbollah checkpoint near the airport after arrival and I developed some kind of fatalistic swagger, as if death could come at any time and I’d be just fine. So I pushed it. I went to the Bekaa Valley on the Syrian border with an American lady I met in a Beirut lesbian bar. I survived (everything), despite accidentally nudging a soldier’s Kalashnikov on the way to fly out.
Seoul, South Korea: Apart from the DMZ, all I really wanted to do in Seoul was to consume lots of nakji-bokkeum (super-spicy stir-fried octopus dish). Developing quickly into a tentacle-eating obsession in every form and for every meal. Within 24 hours of my first octopus dish I left my luxury Gangnam hotel and started sleeping rough at the Noryangjin fish market, focused on eating Sannajki (live octopus) as it came off the boats. Hallucinations and misunderstandings followed in that order and I hurriedly flew out of Incheon.
Melbourne, Australia: Obsessing crossing the Yarra river, repeatedly (crossing not obsessing). It’s not the Yangtze or the Mississippi but after a few days of hearing about the massive logistical challenges of “crossing the river”, I began to plot out a journey from one end to the other. Also sought out easier crossing points, knowing the stress that these people seem to have about “crossing”. I biked across every bridge crossing from Princes Bridge to the Johnston street bridge in Abbotsford. Not a single friend appeared interested in my views on where and how to cross the river. So I stopped obsessing and left for Sydney.
Tashkent, Ubzbekistan: Modernist architecture I know. Behren’s 1909 AEG factory in Berlin, Corbusier’s 1928 Villa Savoye in France and the Guggenheim here in NYC (guess the year) I’ve all seen. So arriving in Tashkent en route to a road trip around the Aral Sea and the former Soviet chemical weapons testing center on Vozrozhdeniya Island was just transiting. Abrubtly, a parallel world of Tashkent Modernism beckoned. Simple geometric shapes fused with large slabs of reinforced concrete. The exquisite latticework of the State Museum of History and then I checked into something even better from 1974: The Hotel Uzbekistan. I stayed until I ran out of funds and was deported back to Russia.
Granada, Spain: Uncovering what’s underneath; that was the obsession. Specifically what’s underneath the Christian surface and digging (figuratively) into Granada’s rich Islamic and Jewish past. Not just the obvious like the churches built over mosques, but the origins of what locals say. Like when they talk about going to barrio de los greñúos they actually are referring to the Realejo neighborhood with greñúo possibly being a reference to Jewish curls. Alas my few friends here got bored with my obsession with the underneath. One in particular caused me to leave town immediately when she suggested that Stranger Things would be a more appropriate place for me to visit The Upside Down.
Memphis, Tennessee: From aspiring vegetarian and practicing atheist it took only 3 days to become obsessed with meat and megachurches (M&Ms). A meat dish was not enough, I wanted my meat to be coated in meat sauce with a side of meat. And then the possibilities of horizontal integration hit me — everyone you meet in Memphis eventually tells you that their Grandma makes the best fried chicken you’ve ever had. So of course I ended up cruising megachurches and being inadvertently invited back to suburban Sunday fried chicken lunches cooked by real life grannies. Not nearly as creepy as it may sound and I remain generally welcome there to this day.
Johannesburg, South Africa: A sudden deep and abiding passion for security and for planning escape routes/rooms. Plotting out safe routes through town and excessive thinking about how to respond to carjacking attempts — do we floor the car when AK47s are pointed at us or do we immediately go limp and say ‘take whatever you want just leave us alone’. Asking in advance about where the safe room is seemed reasonable to me but some locals seemed to think I was overthinking. And then I was carjacked in mid-morning traffic and my continuous thought during the ensuing 24 minute firefight was ‘I told you so’.
Ciudad Juarez, Mexico: A day trip from joint city El Paso ended up as a days long foray into excessive medical tourism. I’d never really loved my chubby cheeks and really wanted a chiseled sculptured face, so day one ended up under that knife. I’d planned to walk across the Texas border back to El Paso but I spotted a street advertisement for a $100 nose job. That’s less than a boozy lunch so I tried that. Day 3 involved a $800 tummy tuck ($9,500 cheaper than NYC) and a breast augmentation ‘taster’ (don’t ask). I look good.
Kyiv, Ukraine: An unexplained sudden and deep interest in Metro stations and steam baths (Banyas). Peaked in one day spent exploring every corner of ‘Arsenala’, the deepest station in the Kyiv subway system and the second deepest in the world. Followed by an evening of having the shit beaten outta me with birch twigs whilst sipping on Kozak Ukrainian vodka made from dried wheat bread. This time they let me stay. I’m still here, red raw and smashed in every sense.

Amid thousands of coastal islands and inland lakes
Where boreal forests and glaciated mountains take
Stockholm to the East, Gothenburg to the South
The garrison town lingers on me in the shadows of a vintage movie
I check the ghost white newspapers for occurring theatre dates
Without pre-thought, I remade my African life into a Swedish life
Snapping photos in rare destinations is prohibited
Karlsborg! I am in Karlsborg! Why am I here?
Untouched by all the crowded dances
Fika, are you a sacred religion?
The relationships atypical
Atlas and I, discovering ourselves by the water’s edge
Spring has sprung, I’m grateful to be here among the young
In this very moment, I banish all gloom
My mucous membranes inflamed
My clouds scattered in Yahoo hues
May, may my Triumph tulips never die
Here eye to eye, unbound by earth and sky
I cannot lie, I thought by now I’d left up and fly
The victories have begun
Come along and let’s abide by the unsung
Many moons will fall my fragile Atlas, but tonight I’ll lull you to sleep
And tomorrow we’ll continue to give it our all
The little moments shared in silence,
thank God there’s no loud violence
Fika!
You’ve become a sacred religion.

Stockholm Design Week wrapped up yesterday and reports of the amazing designs presented are flooding in. Started in 2002, Stockholm Design Week has become the most important week of the year for Scandinavian Design, where just about everyone in any way connected to or interested in Scandinavian design meet and bring home new trends, contacts and inspiration. The design week runs in parallel to and supports the Stockholm Furniture & Light Fair, the world’s leading event for Scandinavian design. Today we’re going to take a look at some of our favorite designs we’ve seen from the even so far.
The Jin Chair
Created by Japanese designer Jin Kuramoto, this chair was named the best product at the Stockholm Furniture and Light Fair. The chair is made using flax fibers which are a completely biodegradable material that is most commonly used for money, tea bags and linen. Kuramoto devised a method that involves building and shaping thin flax fiber layers on top of each other to form both the seat and frame. A resin is then used to solidify the structure. The resin is also a bio-resin which can biodegrade or be burned. Kuramoto designed the Jin chair for Swedish furniture brand Offecct.
Apollo Lamp
Swedish design brand Phloc presented these elegant new lights. The super clean Scandinavian design is highlighted by the beautiful pastel color palette. The line was designed by Swedish architects Mats Broberg and John Ridderstråle who were inspired by a plumb bob, a tool with a pointed weight on its end that architects use to ensure a vertical hang. The lights are available in a range of colors and finished and can be hung individually or grouped together.
Snøhetta Lighting Range
The Norwegian architects Snøhetta launched their first lighting range at the design fair. Called the Flik Flak collection, the line is comprised of hinged wooden lamps. The lamps were originally designed for Sweden’s Treehotel and they were inspired by the building’s exterior. The lamps feature an LED strip that is sandwiched between black birch veneer and can be opened and closed at 180-degree angle as the planks are held together by a piano hinge. In its closed state, the lamplight is focused and when opened, it disperses across space.
Yoma by Zeitraum
This sleek bed has a very flexible design that we think will be popular as more and more people look for versatile furniture. The long side of the bed serves as a shelf, while the back cushions can be fixed in different positions and arranged to feel comfortable while sleeping, reading or just lounging. The mattress only sinks down a few centimeters, making it appear to be lying on top, giving the bed a sense of weightlessness.
The Barn & Fences
Created by Swedish designer Johan Kauppi, the Barn & Fences were inspired by the winter environment of Swedish Lapland. Intended to be used in office settings, the little houses and space dividers are semi-transparent, yet sound absorbent. Kauppi suggests using the barns for meeting and workplaces, and combining them to suit the office’s needs. The fences have standalone stability and great flexibility, making the system easy to use when creating temporary areas, walkways, angled shapes or zig-zag corners.
These are just some of the great designs that came out of this year’s Stockholm Design Week. What are your favorites? Personally we’d love to have our own personal little work barns. We’re interested to see how interior designers start using these pieces in their work, and look forward to seeing these designs used in interiors going forward.

(Reprinted from NUVO Magazine, June 2003.)
There are a few ways to get to the old town square in Stockholm, Sweden. You can walk up from the water, where Lake Malaren meets the Baltic Sea, calves feeling the steep incline up past the palace, a bright tableau of the city framed in a glance over your shoulder. Or, you can walk the twisty paths of Gamla Stan’s narrow streets (literally the “old town”), cobblestones uneven beneath your feet, past the purveyors of souvenirs, fine crystal and strong Swedish coffee. The practical traveler might opt for the subway (“Tunnelbana” or “T-Bana” for those in the know), emerging on the sunlit southern side of Gamla Stan and retracing steps northward in a straight line uphill. Whatever path you choose, it will eventually open up into the Stortorget — the “Great Square” — and the epicenter of Stockholm’s ancient self.
Four hundred years ago where a bloody coup was staged is now a bright and bustling square, with camera-wielding tourists and Swedes lingering the cafés, faces upturned to the perma-sun in summer or candle-warmed in winter. On their way through, many of them will alight on the steps of a building that bounces sunlight off its coral-coloured walls and classic white pillars, all across the west side of the Great Square. Like Stortorget, it is a combination of the old and the new — the eighteenth-century Old Stockholm Stock Exchange, meeting place of traders and burghers — to which has been attached a sleek pane of glass, affixed with spare steel rods and bearing simple white lettering, modern and minimalist, that let you know not only that you’ve arrived at the “Nobelmuseet” but that what is contained therein will fuse history with modernity and wrap it all up in a crisp, clean Nordic aesthetic. You may have to be a genius to be featured in this museum, but you needn’t be one to appreciate what it has to offer.
Officially it’s called the Nobelmuseet — i.e. “Nobel Museum” as written in the agglutinated Swedish style — but it consists of a single exhibition, “Cultures of Creativity: The Centennial Exhibition of the Nobel Prize,” which opened in April, 2001 to commemorate one hundred years of achievement. It is a topic of breadth and depth, and the exhibit opts for both, layering headlines and highlights over troves of information and esoterica, easily skimmed for the ADD-afflicted but rich in detail for the more questioning intellect (or for salonistas in search of clever cocktail conversation). Either way, it presents a century of Nobel-winning exploits in the context of the individual and the collaborative creative processes. Some conclusions are neatly drawn for visitor consumption (i.e. “creative milieus breed creative thinkers”) but most are left to the thoughtful museet-goer, who may or may not leave with an understanding of Pavlov’s Dog, Schrödinger’s Cat or how the heck Arafat ever won that Peace Prize.
That is the essence of the Nobel Prize: genius, and controversy. The museum does an excellent job of showcasing the first and alluding to the second. Taking in the cool, airy space, all metallic curves and shafts of light, the eye is drawn upward to a kind of conveyor belt on the ceiling, moving panels along like venetian blinds, each featuring the likeness of a Nobel laureate. Fritz Pregl, Chemistry, 1923. Luis Walter Alvarez, Physics, 1968. Naguib Mahfouz, Literature, 1988. Past the reception desk (50 Swedish krona buys you an afternoon of one-way intellectual hobnobbing) there are options: look straight ahead, and you will see an elegant row of plexiglass panels containing newspaper clippings in English and Swedish, each panel representing a decade of Nobel news. Look to the left and find a theatre showing eight vignettes featuring creative Nobel-spawning milieus (think Hemingway’s Paris and Bohr’s Copenhagen); look right and find a theatre showing thirty-two short films about not Glenn Gould but winners like X-Ray pioneer (and physics prize pioneer as the first laureate) Wilhelm Röntgen (1901), writer Wole Soyinka (1986), and Swedish statesman Dag Hammarskjöld (1961). On the other side of this theatre, an interactive multi-media room with headphones and individual flatscreen computers.
Perhaps the best place to begin, though, is at the back of the museum’s spacious single floor, past the sample banquet place-setting and on to the exhibit detailing the life of Alfred Nobel. It is the Nobel Museum after all, and indeed Stockholm’s only monument to the industrialist who made his home in many places other than Sweden yet somehow settled on his out-of-the-way homeland to administer and bestow the world’s most prestigious prizes. The sepia-toned display provides a fairly pristine account of Nobel’s life — his childhood in Stockholm and then St. Petersburg; his difficult inventor/industrialist father and brothers; the tragic loss of his younger brother, Emil, in a nitroglycerine explosion connected to Alfred’s experiments; his uneven and lonely romantic life; and the innovations he developed that advanced the industrial age and built the fortune that would eventually bankroll five distinguished prizes.
(It should be noted here that the so-called Nobel Prize in Economics is actually not a Nobel prize at all, but rather an award established by the Central Bank of Sweden in 1968 to honour Nobel’s memory, with a prize purse guaranteed to match that of the other laureates. It is adjudicated by the Swedish Academy of Sciences which is also responsible for the Physics and Chemistry prizes).
Nobel was, by most accounts, a difficult man — lonely, caustic, closed, not overwhelmingly happy (one of the best of these accounts is in Burton Feldman’s excellent The Nobel Prize which is a 489-page treasure trove of Nobel facts and factoids). He was a workhorse, traveling constantly, establishing dynamite factories across Europe and in the United States, where he spoke Swedish, English, French, Italian, or German depending on the locale. He wrote poetry and plays, patented his multifarious inventions, read widely, kept his own counsel. He died in San Remo, Italy, basically alone — childless, unmarried, brothers and parents deceased. And then, with his will, he gained an entirely new life in the form of the Nobel Prize.
Closed as he was, who can know what exactly motivated his now-famous will. Perhaps the erroneous obituaries, published on the death of his brother, by a few confused journalists — and not overwhelmingly complimentary. Perhaps guilt based on the deaths with which he was associated — dynamite accidents, an ill-fated balloon expedition he bankrolled, the loss of his own brother. Perhaps a desire for expiation, or for admiration — the kind that escaped him in life.
Whatever his reasons, they were enough to direct his entire fortune toward prizes — though only after five years of legal wrangling and painfully-wrought administration of a huge fund with scant guidance. Alfred Nobel’s Last Will and Testament consisted of a single wordy paragraph directing his accrued wealth to a fund which would annually provide for five prizes to “those persons who shall have contributed most materially to benefit mankind during the year immediately preceding” in the areas of Physics, Chemistry, Physiology/Medicine; Literature, and one “to the person who shall have most or best promoted the Fraternity of Nations and the Abolishment or Dimunition of Standing Armies and the Promotion and Increase of Peace Congresses.” The first four prizes were assigned to various distinguished Swedish academic organizations; the Peace Prize was to be selected by a committee determined, inexplicably, by the Norwegian Parliament. So indeed, from the very beginning this was a prize marked by drama and controversy (and who knows? Perhaps Nobel had thought of that, too).
Walking through the newspaper-clipping exhibit decade by decade reveals just how fraught with controversy it was. Here was a so-called global prize, being adjudicated by an exclusively Scandinavian body of bodies (and, except for the Oslo-centric Peace Prize, bestowed to this day by the Swedish king in a lavish ceremony in Stockholm on December 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel’s death). Entrusted to judge the forefront but geographically peripheral, the judges were not always fully informed of cutting-edge work (and as a result many prizes across the board were awarded years and sometimes even decades after the ‘winning’ work had been performed). There was a northern slant, felt almost immediately with a disproportionately high number of Nordic winners (this is seen particularly in the Literature prize, with fifteen Nordic laureates (including Iceland) to France’s twelve and the US’ eleven). Unlike the prefix “Oscar-nominated” there are no plaudits for runners up. Accordingly, competition was fierce and politics fiercer.
Of course, hindsight is always 20/20 but in a museum celebrating a century of prizes one can’t help but look back. While the actual exhibit does not render judgment on this prize or that — its purpose is to celebrate the Nobel Prize as an institution — it does not whitewash its chequered past of backroom politicking, uncredited (and unawarded) inventors, scandals, and shockingly bad choices (though of course you have to look for it!). Moreover, the prizes cannot be rescinded, and the deliberations are secret — so the mistakes of history stick. There was the prize for nuclear fission, awarded to German Otto Hahn in 1944, which completely excluded his decades-long partner Lise Meitner (who had fled, ironically, to Sweden at the outbreak of the war). There was the passing over of Dimitri Mendeleev, whose Periodic Table of the Elements hangs in every science classroom worth its salt, for chemist Henri Moissan who discovered fluorine — as it had already been predicted by Mendeleev’s chart! And Banting and Best — names that are inextricably linked in the Canadian lexicon — were not, in fact, honoured in 1923 for the discovery of insulin — that award actually went to Banting and J.J.R. Macleod (though Banting made a big show of splitting the prize money with Best, his graduate student assistant, and sharing the credit — not to mention that in 1962, theNobel Foundation publicly admitted that Macleod had erroneously been honoured). These were not isolated incidents.
Also common were dramas surrounding the prizes once awarded, based on the merits. Mikhael Gorbachev’s 1986 peace prize was hailed globally but received mixed reactions in the Motherland. Ditto Linus Pauling, who besides Marie Curie is the only laureate to have received a prize in two different categories — first Chemistry in 1954, and then the Peace Prize for his anti-nuclear agitation in 1962 was seen as an international slap in the face to the U.S. (not unlike how last year’s prize to Jimmy Carter was seen as a not-so-subtle rebuke of the Bush Administration’s hawklike foreign policy). Portuguese neurologist Antonio Egas Moniz was honoured with the Medicine prize in 1949 for pioneering the lobotomy, a horrendous procedure that mentally neutered thousands of patients before mercifully falling out of favour within a decade.
Some prizes were even so hotly debated within the supposed coolly objective minds of the adjudicating committees that resignations ensued: in 1989, two members of the Swedish Academy (which judges Literature) resigned over the committee’s decision not to name Salman Rushdie and take a stand against the Iranian fatwah against him — up from one resignation in 1989 for naming William Golding. And back to Arafat: a member of the ’94 Peace Committee publicly resigned and denounced him as a terrorist. Omissions, too, make up as distinguished a list as any collection of laureates: Sigmund Freud. J. Robert Oppenheimer. Henrik Ibsen. Leo Tolstoy. Virginia Woolf. Dimitri Mendeleev. Mahatma Ghandi.
Even more poignant were other omissions — omissions on the dais accepting the award. German-Jewish journalist Carl von Ossietsky was not available to accept his 1935 Peace Prize as he was incarcerated in a concentration camp, where he died. The uproar over the episode prompted Hitler to forbid Germans or Austrians to accept their prizes (beginning in 1938) which resulted in at least three laureates having to forfeit their prize money (still extremely lucky compared to Ossietsky). Controversial, outspoken laureates from the USSR were also precluded from attending — Boris Pasternak in 1958, Andrei Sakharov in 1975. The Nobel Prize is bigger than the laureate alone.
That fact is at its most affecting in the corners of the exhibit, quietly regarding the balance Marie Curie used to weigh her newly-discovered radium, the well-worn Underwood typewriter used by Isaac Bashevis Singer, complete with Yiddish lettering, or listening to Toni Morrison’s beautiful and richly-toned Nobel lecture on headphones in the multi-media room, then Nelson Mandela’s, then Bashevis Singer in his voice aged with patience: “People are asking me often, why do you write in a dying language? Firstly, I like to write ghost stories, and nothing works like a dead language. Ghosts love Yiddish, they all speak it.”
As fascinating as a wander through the Nobelmuseet inevitably is, the museum-going experience is taken to an entirely new plane by virtue of the gift shop. In addition to a fine array of the usual — postcards with distinguished-looking laureates, to whom are attributed elegant-sounding quotes; books about Alfred Nobel, the Nobel Prize and various laureates; posters of exhibited pieces — it offers a creative selection of souvenirs. Highlights include the peculiarly Swedish salty licorice treat, “salt lakrits,” quaintly packaged in the form of a long stick of dynamite (perhaps in a nod to how you’d feel if you actually ate the whole thing) and gold foil-wrapped chocolate coins fashioned after the Nobel medallions (surely a necessary chaser of the aforementioned lakrits!). Also of note is a particularly charming postcard of Albert Einstein reclining against a rock in summer shorts, looking oddly fetching with his slender calves and strappy summer sandals (the quote — “It is harder to crack a prejudice than an atom” — is pure Einstein, who was a passionate advocate for peace and submitted as many nominations for the Peace Prize as he did for physics).
My favorite Nobel keepsake, however, is a Nobel-inspired cookbook for those who would replicate the ceremonial banquet at home, minus the average IQ (The Nobel Banquets: Modern Recipes from the Classic Menus, by Hélène Bodin and Stefan Bjur). The book pairs menu selections from various years with information about the laureates being so honoured and the historical background of the era. 1954, for example, was a banner year celebrating German physicists Max Born and Walther Bothe, Linus Pauling’s Chemistry prize and John Enders, Thomas H. Weller and Frederick C. Robbins, three distinguished U.S. virologists. Had literature laureate Ernest Hemingway been well enough to attend the inter-laureate conversation would probably have been very different. As it was, he missed out on hot smoked rainbow trout with spinach chanterelle mushroom sauce, grilled filet of beef with tagliatelle vegetable and red wine sauce, and green pears accompanied by pistachio nut ice cream (perhaps one of the German physicists ate enough for Bothe of them).
Souvenirs in hand and laureate-worthy thoughts in head, the Nobelmuseet has hopefully provoked thoughts more compelling than weak puns on physics laureates (I hope I’m not Bohr-ing you). Outside, the sun is surely still shining; it’s summer after all, and that’s what the sun does in a Stockholm summer. Stotorget is still bustling and the cafés still do a brisk business. Walking out into the square, there are a few ways you can go — down toward the water, south to the subway, lazily through the rabbit-warren streets of Gamla Stan. Moving away, you throw a glance over your shoulder — framed there is the Nobelmuseet, pillars and glass gleaming in the sunlight, fusion of things old and new from these past hundred years.
Rachel Sklar is the co-founder of TheLi.st. She wrote this in 2003 after living in Stockholm for six months. In addition to writing about the Nobel Museum, Rachel also gained 15 pounds from delicious Swedish chocolate, recorded four tracks for a Swedish dance club and invested in H&M. Her favorite Swedish phrase was “Jag har inte pojkvan.” She thinks Sweden rules.

In this blog, I want to share my recent trip to Stockholm and all the experiences I had during my journey.
The whole trip started because I wanted to plan something good for a UK bank holiday. Sweden was never on my travel list, and I also had a childhood friend living there with his family whom I hadn’t seen in more than four years. So, it felt like the perfect opportunity to catch up and explore a new place at the same time.
On the day of my journey, I took a Norwegian flight from London Gatwick to Stockholm Arlanda. The flight had a slight delay leaving Gatwick but still arrived almost on time. From Arlanda, I hopped on a Flygbussarna bus to reach Stockholm central, and the journey was smooth, taking just 50 minutes. It was already past 10 in the evening when I arrived, but my friend, who lives about 20 minutes away, kindly came to pick me up. We used trams and the metro to get to his place.
One interesting thing I noticed was that you could purchase tickets for most forms of transportation using your mobile phone and scan a QR code when boarding. It was a convenient use of technology and saved me the hassle of buying tickets in person or carrying a separate travel card, like in London.
On Day 2, we bought a single SL ticket for 39 SEK (approximately £2.89) to get to Stockholm central and then decided to walk around. We covered around 20 kilometers, exploring significant historical places like Stockholm City Hall, where Nobel Laureates have their dinner after receiving their prizes. We also visited Gamla Stan, the Royal Palace, Parliament, and many beautiful islands. What stood out to me was the Stockholm Archipelago concept, where many small islands are connected by bridges or ferries, creating a vibrant and unique city. It’s different from many other European cities I’ve been to.
Day 3 took us to Djurgarden. We loved the Open Air museum, where they’ve preserved or recreated life from the 16th-17th centuries. It’s a fantastic way to keep history alive and attract tourists. Skansen, in the same area, had a cool zoo with Swedish and Nordic wild animals. Our next stop was the Vasa Museum, the highest-rated place on Google and TripAdvisor. It’s a treasure trove of interesting historical facts, showcasing a 300+ year-old sunken ship and its history. What amazed me was how they turned a “FAILURE” into a celebration and learning opportunity.
Day 4 was all about visiting Drottningholm Palace and its surroundings in the morning before my evening flight back to London. The palace is where the Swedish Royal family still resides, and it’s a well-maintained place with beautiful gardens. The whole area is so large that it can take hours to explore.
But, as my great trip was coming to an end, some miseries had to balance the good and bad in life! I received notifications on my mobile that my return flight, scheduled for 21:00, had been delayed until 05:33 the next morning. After contacting British Airways customer care and checking the news, I learned that there was a UK-wide Air Traffic Control ‘technical glitch’ causing flight delays and cancellations. The customer care representative advised me to reach the airport as per my original schedule, as they were working to make things right. However, upon arriving at the airport, I found out that the flight was canceled, and no one knew the next steps. The check-in counter gave me an apology letter with vague instructions that essentially said, “figure things out on your own, and we might reimburse you later.” Other passengers said there were no available BA flights to London for at least the next three days. Customer care calls were rejected, and the British Airways app and website crashed due to high traffic. I was essentially stuck in a city without knowing when I could leave.
Luckily, I was able to return to my friend’s place instead of searching for a hotel. I continuously followed the news, which reported thousands of UK-bound flights canceled and the chaos continuing for days. In this situation, I started looking for all available options to get back, including buses, trains, ferries, and routes through other cities. Fortunately, I found an available but expensive option with SAS Airlines for the next day via Stavanger, Norway. So, I decided to go for it instead of getting stuck in Stockholm, which would have affected everything, including my work.
On Day 5, I left my friend’s place with a lot of uncertainty about what lay ahead. Fortunately, the first flight from Stockholm to Stavanger went smoothly. However, before boarding the next flight, I heard an announcement that the flight was overbooked, and they were looking for volunteers to take the next day’s flight along with a 250 Euro compensation! I quickly moved to the front of the boarding queue, just in case they asked me to volunteer if no one else did. I saw the boarding process begin, and the flight was very full. The flight waited for over 40 minutes due to the overbooking issue, and the pilot announced that they had to remove luggage for those who couldn’t make it, causing further delays. After all the chaos, I finally reached London after almost eight hours of travel, which was initially planned for just two hours!

On the outskirts of Stockholm, the Stockholmsmässan convention center played host to one of this year’s much anticipated AWS Summits — it was a day packed with innovation, insights, and conversations around what AWS has been most recently working on for the Cloud. With keynotes about generative AI, hands-on demos, and real-world use cases from the some big names, the event offered a deep dive into how AWS is shaping the future of tech, how companies are leveraging LLM’s and generative AI to build exciting new features, and how they save costs while scaling to a global audience.
I was impressed to see how global companies like Booking.com have already deeply integrated AI into their products and development processes — a clear reminder that those who don’t embrace it, risk falling behind.
Here are a few highlighted talks that I attended with Thibault, my teammate at ACTUM Digital!
We kicked off our packed day of sessions with a talk from Tom Soderstrom, — an AWS Enterprise Strategist and former CTO at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory! Tom’s talk was absolutely packed with interesting stories and experiences from his extensive career with NASA — he gave some insights on how we can experiment better by optimising for speed, reducing cost and risk, and not aiming for perfection the first time around. I really enjoy the kind of talks that don’t try to teach you a specific technology, but instead inspire you to go and think about work in a different way, or approach ideas with a different mindset. I found a shorter version of Tom’s presentation on the AWS Events YouTube Channel — I highly recommend giving it a watch!
From less technical to very technical — this talk about how Booking.com utilises SageMaker was incredibly in-depth, the team of speakers managed to pack so much into an hour! After a brief introduction explaining the trade-offs between different LLM inference options, we were walked through two new GenAI features that Booking.com implemented into it’s product, and then how they fine-tuned the specific needs of each with the help of Amazon SageMaker AI. First, how they reduced the cost of their accommodation description generator by 180x, and second, how they made their intuitive, prompt-based filter search tool 15x faster. You can read more about this in their very detailed AWS Blog post.
As part of a cross-functional team responsible for monitoring and investigating ops issues in our environments, we are all too familiar with the art of getting alarm thresholds into the “sweet spot” where they’re actually alerting for potential issues, and not for some expected window of peak traffic. Alex Livingstone and Mohamed Wali of AWS gave us some great ideas how we can use several “anomaly detection” features of CloudWatch to learn from expected behaviour patterns, and minimise intervention. The models are retrained on AWS automatically without any need for user input, but specific periods can also be excluded from training if you don’t want them to impact the results.
We also saw a demo of Amazon Q Developer operational investigations, a much anticipated CloudWatch feature currently in preview, that instructs Amazon Q to automatically investigate alarms on your behalf. This way, when you go to your dashboard after an alert, you’re already presented with key observations highlighted to aid your investigation why an alarm was triggered. You can see the logs of which services Amazon Q inspected, what information it discovered, and what suggestions it has generated to fix the issue. In some cases, it can even provide runbook suggestions in Systems Manager that can execute steps to resolve the issue automatically! Care must be taken to review these before executing — but as the models behind detection/resolution get smarter, these could start saving developers a lot of time when investigating root causes of issues.
As usual — AWS delivered with a Summit packed full of news, updates, and new technologies to try out, while also sharing some real-world customer success stories as inspiration how we can better leverage AI in our products — If you’re interested in AWS or the cloud at any level, we highly recommend the trip to an AWS Summit near you!

Petra Gardafjord, founder of beautiful Swedish kids brand Beton Studios shares her daily life in Stockholm for a little travel inspiration
My family and I live in a suburb to Stockholm called Sundbyberg, or Sumpan as we like to call it. It’s like its own little town, a little quiet, but still lots going on! Since we live outside the big city we ride the tube everyday. The kids have grown up with it and could probably go by themselves if we let them!
Sumpan is a mix between old and new. It used to be real industrial town but is getting really modern by the years. It’s growing like mad, housing hundreds of families.
On the weekends we like to play outdoors. There’s a park called Tornparken, where the kids can play for hours. In the summer there’s a good sized toddler pool, perfect to splash around in.
Just close by the park is an old water tower rebuilt just recently into a restaurant, Delibruket. They have the most amazing flatbread pizza buffet during weekends and we can sit for hours. Outside is the most amazing view across the town and we can see our house from there.
The library is the perfect spot for changing diapers, nursing, feeding, coffee and just hit the couches with a few good children’s books. It’s a great place to get a little down time since the kids know they can’t be loud in there.
My most favorite place here is Marabouparken. It has a big beautiful park, full of life during the weekends. In the warmer days we bring our towels and picnic baskets and eat fruit and a good fika (Swedish for coffee and buns/cookies) in the grass. Inside is a exhibition hall for all sorts of art and a cool restaurant, Parkliv, that serves the best rhubarb lemonade and lemon pie!
We are a very active family and every chance we get we are out riding bikes or visit the local public swimming pool. We also recently discovered this gorgeous old gym hall just across from where we live. It’s not open for the public but Martin got contacts from work so sometimes we sneak inside and make ourselves a obstacle course and run around like mad people. The kids love it!

So, you may remember that back in September 2024, I was awarded a full bursary to attend an ECR (early career researcher) networking event in Stirling, Scotland. The event was organised by the British Society of Gerontology’s emerging researchers in ageing group (ERA), in collaboration with SWEAH (the Swedish national graduate school on ageing and health), and hosted at the University of Stirling.
You can read my reflective blog on the ECR networking event here.
So, then in February 2025, the cohort who’d attended this networking event were invited to join another collaborative event between ERA and SAIN (the SWEAH Alumni Interdisciplinary Network) — this time, to join a writing retreat in Stockholm, on the island of Långholmen in the old prison!
The retreat provided the opportunity for: networking, space for co-writing and quiet time, social activities, and also the chance to share our research with the group through short presentations. It was too good an opportunity to miss — especially as attendance at the writing retreat was funded — huge thanks to ERA and SAIN!
Having arrived earlier than most, for my extended research trip, I was one of the first to check in at the former prison — enabling me to settle in over a nice dinner, but fall straight into bed in my ‘cell’! I was tired, as it had already been quite a full-on week!
The organisation, just as it had been in Stirling, was impeccable — we’d been advised of other mates’ arrival and departure times (to co-ordinate travel together), and had received the schedule in advance so we knew what to expect! What we hadn’t bargained on was the incredible hospitality of the Swedish, including my introduction to the concept of ‘fika’ — see blog post three and sharing three meals a day with the group.
Wednesday morning gave me the chance to catch up with a friend from Stirling, before joining the others for our first shared lunch together and then kicking off the retreat with introductions, short research presentations, and an introduction to ELSA (the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing) by Dr Brian Beach (University College London / Karolinksa Institutet).
I was particularly excited about our short presentations, as this was the first time I’d had the opportunity to share our co-created postcard blog series, from my Take a Walk in My Shoes research project. Also, in Stirling I’d use haiku poems for my research presentation, this time I used the postcards…
What’s always fascinating for me at ‘gerontology’ events is the rich diversity of research interests and approaches. We’re all focused on aspects of ageing, but bring an incredible variety of topics, methodologies and personalities — it’s great!
We heard about the Intersectional Stigma of Place-based Ageing (ISPA) project, explored voices of older people from marginalised communities and women living with the impact of intimate partner violence.
We learnt about end of life care through the lenses of understanding health inequalities towards the end of life with dementia and through the architectural design of hospices in England; and considered emotional and physical wellbeing through psychological studies into depression and future-time perspectives, and the impact of the built-environment design of housing and healthcare on the psychology of its users.
Age-friendly design and social relationships in physical spaces and urban neighbourhoods, environmental design for ageing and cognitive health, and the detection and assessment of dementia in the autistic population also featured in the presentations, as well as how stress in earlier life and impact health and functioning in later life.
Further research projects are exploring health inequalities in ageing through the interplay between genes and socioeconomic environment, and focusing on how life-course factors shape health and work prospects in later life; in addition to a focus on extended working lives, risk and protective factors for cognitive ageing and dementia.
Healthy ageing was explored in relation to physical function, high-intensity interval training, cardiovascular and cognitive health, and psychological health during the retirement transition.
The writing retreat provided equal measures of intense research focus and writing, with time to enjoy our local setting and spend time with friends. This balance isn’t easy to get right — but it was done here with thought, care, and lots of time for eating and drinking together!
Since attending this ERA event in April, I’ve been invited to present at the ERA pre-conference, which takes place before the main BSG conference in June 2025, AND have secured a bursary to attend. Thank you!

My generation were teenagers in the late 1970’s and thus passionate fans of Sweden since Abba dominated the Top of the Pops (God, how I hated the ghastly Dancing Queen since every girl in high school thought this syrupy pop tune was written specifically for her!) and Björn Borg dominated Centre Court at Wimbledon as the Men’s Champion until the trophy was wrested from him in 1981 in a five set marathon by the awful but brilliant American John McEnroe. As I grew older, I learnt to love Sweden’s amazing social tolerance and cosmopolitan culture, its democratic values, welfare state, its beautiful lakes, ancient cities and effervescent young women whom I met in my fave Hellenic beach resorts like Ayia Napa in Cyprus and Mykonos in the Greek Aegean.
However, in 2025, I have a special reason to love Sweden and it is definitely not the ugly furniture of Ikea my Gen-Z twins adore. The Swedish kroner has been the best anti-dollar FX hedge of 2025 and is up an incredible 17% in the last 6-months. As I expect the Trump Buckeroo to fall 20% before the Big Guy leaves the White house, I hope my Swedish kroner stash rises another 20% and offsets the already exorbitant cost of a Scandi holiday. Since I prefer the Med to the Baltics at any time of the year, why not revert back to the 1980’s watering holes in the Cyclades and meet nice Swedish people in the Scandinavian love shack rather than actually flying to Stockholm Gothenburg or Malmö.
Sweden is also one of the world’s most successful case studies in innovation and entrepreneurial capitalism, the reason Nasdaq’s Old World hub is in Stockholm. This $900 billion economy is one of my favourite countries to invest for the next 5-years as long as Putin does not invade Estonia and try to usurp King Charles XII’s role as the supreme war lord of the North with a blockade of the Baltics. After all, Putin is from St. Petersburg, a port founded by Tsar Pyotr Alexievich to fight the Swedish empire, the superpower of the North in the first decade of the 18th century.
This IT/green tech/export colossus is a goldmine for investors who love corruption free economies dedicated to innovation and talent, a natural for any refugee from Planet Dollar like moi!

Worrying about getting around? getting to and from the airport? want to check out the archipelago but do not want to join an expensive tour?
Public transport is great in Stockholm but it is not cheap. On average, a single ride costs SEK35. As visitor, you can buy a 7 days pass at SEK315 (there are other options if you are staying for only a day or 2, check here for information).
The best thing about this card is, you can actually go to and from the airport with it without paying extra if you do not mind a slightly longer (like 20 mins) commute!
If you go to the train station, they will tell you you need to purchase a SEK120 ticket to go through (which is true). However, we were lucky enough to encounter a staff who is nice enough to tell us the alternative that saved us SEK280/pax (2 more lunches!).
When you are at SkyCity in the airport, go out (and down) from the escalator, you will see a bus stop, get on bus 583 (you can check their schedule here) and ride to the last stop at Märsta station. At Märsta station, you will get on the train that go all the way to Stockholm City.
The bus ride is about 10–15 mins and the train ride is about 30–40mins.
Märsta station is the end of the train line, so you can’t really get it wrong.
(photo credit: Brorsson)
Apart from going to and from the airport, you can also go to (some part of) the Stockholm Archipelago with your Travelcard which easily saves you hundreds of SEK.
Stockholm is made up of 30,000 islands (subject to dispute :P), and it is a large part of Stockholm Swedes’ life to go to the Archipelago during summer/vacation. (To hide away and to not talk to anyone.)
If you want to do some island hopping, you can actually do it with the public ferry which is free with the card. Since I was there in autumn (and didn’t have time), I did not explore that. However, if you have any specific island in mind, you should check the website of waxholmsbolaget for more information.
It would be a pity to visit a city without seeing it from the water. If you do not have enough time to enjoy that, a short ride on the public ferry maybe a good way to do that. We took a short ride on the number 80. My only advice is don’t do it after dark. That’s what we did and we didn’t really see much.
Stockholm metro station is renown for its artistic decorations (you can see my Part 1 post for some picture and links to plan your trip ;)).
When we were in Stockholm, weather was not the best. With the card, we can easily hop on the train/metro/bus and kept ourselves from the rain.
You know what I think, a Travelcard is well worth it I will urge you to get it. You can get the card in the train station/convenient store in the airport.
Stockholm card is different from the Travelcard. It is a card that gives you free access/discount to paid museums, sights etc.. Different from visitor pass in many other cities, it does not include public transport (you need to buy a Travelcard) on top of that.
The card comes in 3 options, from SEK 595 (1 day) to SEK1295 (6 days). I ended up not getting it and not regretting it.
As mentioned in Part 1 of this post — most of the museums have free hours, if you plan accordingly, you can easily save a SEK200–300; as for transport (which is the most expensive items on their list), the only offer they have is the hop-on-hop-off for one day. The route is basically covered by public transport, and Stockholm is a pretty walkable city without the rain.
Another draw back about thePass is that you can only get your money’s worth if you plan very carefully. Sometimes, you may end up just seeing everything but paying attention to nothing, not to mention the interesting thing that you might see if you’re not in a rush.
Lastly, when I took a look at the items, a few of them are very similar (tour around similar places), which you probably would not need to do them all.
The Verdict
I do not think it is worth it to get the pass, unless you are dead set to see all the paid museums (potentially giving up on some of the awesome free museums) and is very strategic about that.
Stockholm is not cheap, but definitely not crazy expensive like people say. I did not have a lot of time to research for the trip, and started looking when I was flights/commute, and I still managed to make the whole trip rather affordable. Doing my research, I found these blogs/site super helpful, hope you can benefit from them too:
And remember, Google is always your best friends and ready to help :)
Have a good time in Stockholm. Follow me here or on instagram @eatwithsara for more posts about food and travel!

Here at All About Capital Cities we aim to give you an overview of all the 196 capital cities in the world.
Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, has a history that spans over 700 years. It was officially founded in 1252 by Birger Jarl, a Swedish statesman who sought to protect Sweden’s interior from sea invasions and to control trade along the Baltic Sea. Its strategic location on 14 islands where Lake Mälaren meets the Baltic made Stockholm ideal for both defense and commerce.
The city quickly became a vital trade center, especially during the Hanseatic League era in the late Middle Ages. German merchants and craftsmen played a major role in shaping its early economy and architecture. In the 16th century, under the reign of Gustav Vasa, Stockholm became the political and administrative capital of a newly unified Sweden, marking the start of the Swedish Empire.
During the 17th century, Stockholm flourished as Sweden emerged as a European great power. The city expanded significantly, with grand palaces and government buildings constructed to reflect its growing prestige. However, this golden age was followed by a period of decline in the 18th century after Sweden lost much of its territory.
The Industrial Revolution in the 19th century revitalized Stockholm, transforming it into a modern city with railways, factories, and growing suburbs. It continued to evolve through the 20th century, becoming a hub for innovation, culture, and diplomacy.
Today, Stockholm is known for its beautiful mix of medieval and modern architecture, its progressive social systems, and its role as a leading city in technology, sustainability, and Scandinavian culture.
Stockholm is famous for its stunning natural setting, rich history, and modern innovation. Spread across 14 islands connected by over 50 bridges, the city is often called the “Venice of the North.” Its blend of medieval charm and cutting-edge design makes it one of Europe’s most attractive capitals.
The city is also renowned for its well-preserved Old Town, Gamla Stan, where cobbled streets and colorful 17th-century buildings surround landmarks like the Royal Palace and Stockholm Cathedral. Stockholm is the cultural heart of Sweden, home to world-class museums such as the Vasa Museum, which houses a 17th-century warship, and the ABBA Museum, celebrating Sweden’s iconic pop group.
As the home of the Nobel Prize ceremonies, Stockholm is a global symbol of intellectual achievement and innovation. The city is also recognized for its sustainability and environmental efforts, often ranking among the world’s greenest cities.
In addition, Stockholm has a vibrant food scene, cutting-edge fashion, and a strong tech industry, earning it the nickname “Unicorn Factory” due to its high number of billion-dollar startups. With its mix of history, nature, and modern living, Stockholm stands out as a unique and influential European capital.
Greta Garbo — Iconic silent film actress of the 1920s and 1930s
Avicii (Tim Bergling) — Influential electronic music producer and DJ
Alfred Nobel — Inventor of dynamite and founder of the Nobel Prizes
Ingrid Bergman — Oscar-winning actress (Casablanca, Gaslight)
Benny Andersson — Member of the pop group ABBA, who were formed in Stockholm
Gamla Stan (Old Town) — Historic heart of Stockholm with cobbled streets and colorful buildings

Take a stroll through the charming streets of Gamla Stan and visit the incredible Vasa Museum. Don’t forget to explore Djurgården, the lush green island, and indulge in the world of modern art at the Fotografiska Museumet. Get ready for an unforgettable adventure in this vibrant city!
Here are five top tips, from a true Stockholm native, on what to do in Stockholm! Want more tips from me? Feel free to leave a comment!
You should check out Gamla Stan when you visit Stockholm — it is a charming neighborhood with narrow streets and colorful buildings. This historic district is located on the island of Stadsholmen and is one of the best-preserved medieval city centers in Europe.
As you wander through its winding cobblestone streets, you’ll come across beautiful architecture, quaint cafes, and charming shops selling Swedish handicrafts. Gamla Stan is also home to several notable landmarks, including the Royal Palace, Stortorget (the main square), and the Stockholm Cathedral.
Don’t forget to explore the narrow alleyways and hidden courtyards, where you’ll find hidden gems and unique surprises. Whether you’re a history buff, an architecture lover, or simply looking for a picturesque setting, Gamla Stan is a must-visit destination in Stockholm.
Located in Stockholm, the Vasa Museum exhibits a well-preserved 17th-century warship. It is a fascinating destination for history enthusiasts and maritime lovers. Upon entering the museum, visitors are greeted by the majestic sight of the Vasa ship, which was salvaged from the depths of the Stockholm harbor after sinking on its maiden voyage in 1628.
The ship’s intricate carvings and ornate details are a testament to the craftsmanship of the era. As you explore the museum, you’ll learn about the ship’s ill-fated journey and the remarkable efforts made to recover and restore it. The Vasa Museum offers a unique glimpse into Sweden’s naval history and serves as a reminder of the country’s seafaring legacy.
Wandering through Djurgården, the green island, allows you to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and immerse yourself in nature’s tranquility. Djurgården is a true oasis in the heart of Stockholm, where you can stroll along lush green pathways and breathe in the fresh air.
The absence of cars on the island adds to its charm, making it the perfect place for a leisurely walk or bike ride. As you explore Djurgården, you’ll come across beautiful gardens, picturesque waterfronts, and even a charming little village. There are also several museums and attractions to visit, such as the Vasa Museum and the ABBA Museum.
Whether you’re a nature lover or a culture enthusiast, Djurgården offers something for everyone, making it a must-visit destination in Stockholm.
The Fotografiska Museumet is a great place to explore if you are interested in contemporary art and photography. Located in Stockholm, Sweden, the museum showcases a vast collection of stunning photographs from renowned photographers around the world.
With its sleek and modern design, the museum provides a perfect backdrop for the captivating artworks on display. From thought-provoking exhibitions to interactive installations, Fotografiska offers a unique and immersive experience for visitors of all ages.
Whether you are a photography enthusiast or simply appreciate the beauty of visual arts, the museum offers a diverse range of exhibitions that will leave you inspired and amazed.

(disclaimer: this post is long overdue, as the trip happened in February. But better late than never!)
Me two months ago: Dear Santa Claus & birthday fairy lady, all I want for my birthday is to experience a white winter for my 30th before I head to Singapore. I’m talking a white winter, with glistening snow as far as the horizon stretches and air so crisp and cold that it takes your breath away. But not so debilitatingly cold that we won’t go outside… Sweden and Iceland, you say? Alright I’m in!
Turns out Stockholm and Iceland were the perfect retreats to get a refreshing dose of true winter before I move to a country with hot, hot, hot and hotter as seasons. The weather was a brisk 0 degrees C/32 degrees F, which was cold, but gave us beautiful flurries of snow every other day. In Sweden, we slowly acclimated to the cold and learned about the viking history of this Nordic country in museum after museum. Then in Iceland, we became outdoor adventurers, summiting glaciers and hiking ice caves. Even for warm-blooded Californians, these two northern spots were the ideal winter vacation.
Sweden highlights:
Iceland highlights (Part 2) is here.
Sweden runs so efficiently. The ARN airport has wifi, the express train that takes you to Central Station has wifi, and the busses run promptly every few minutes. Our Airbnb was in the adorable Old Town district, with narrow cobblestone streets that housed everything from tacky souvenir shops to quaint boutique stores that sold artisan chocolates and fancy wool textiles. It was right next to the riverwalk, where stately old buildings boasted their prowess along the water.
In true American form, we sought out the Swedish things we already knew and loved: Swedish fish, Swedish meatballs, Swedish pancakes, and Swedish massages. Our kind Airbnb host welcomed us with Swedish fish, so we immediately sought out #2: Swedish meatballs. We popped into an adorable cafe on the street corner and ordered meatballs, salmon and soup. The meatballs came in a rich cream sauce but had the appearance of Mexican mole. It was even better than all our Ikea meatball memories combined.
Warning: Swedish food is expensive. Icelandic food is even more expensive. Be prepared to drop $30 for breakfast and lunch and anywhere from $60–100 for dinner, especially if you order drinks. Thankfully (?) the SF restaurant scene has immunized me from sticker shock when I open menus anywhere in the world.
Swedish pancakes were reserved for breakfast the following day at Greasy Spoon (delicious), and it turns out Swedish pancakes are just… pancakes. But when topped with ricotta cheese and pistachios, you really don’t miss the “Swedish” at all. We also ordered eggs benedict and a salmon dish atop what can only be described as chunky potatoes.
And Swedish massages aren’t really a thing. Swedish massages were really invented by the Danish, but misattributed to the Swedish. So we scrapped that idea altogether and found a Thai massage place on Night 2. A warm Thai massage in freezing weather beats a massage in Thailand any day, even if we did pay $50 for an hour :X
Vasa Museum, 5 stars
This was one of the coolest museums I’ve ever been to. Upon entering, you’re greeted by a massive 70-meter ship (225 ft) that’s 95% of its original form. Back in 1621, Sweden was at war with Norway and the king had the ship built in two years. After just 10 minutes on the water, 1.5 km away from the shore, the Vasa ship tipped over and started to sink. She was too top-heavy and narrow in the middle to withstand a gust of wind. Of ~200 people on board, 30 died a tragic (seemingly unnecessary) death. It wasn’t until 333 years later that Sweden had the technological prowess to pull the ship up from the bottom of the ocean. The water was so cold that it was able to preserve the bones, and even the brains and shoes, of the some of the deceased aboard!
Nobel Prize Museum, 5 stars
Exhibit 1 of Swedes being incredibly nice and generous: the Nobel Prize museum was closing in 30 minutes, but the front desk man graciously allowed us in, as long as we promised not to tell anyone (he said with a wink). The museum offered an excellent crash course in all the Nobel prizes, including the Junglebook by Rudyard Kipling for literature, penicillin in medicine, and many other scientific concepts that went straight over my head.
I was frustrated by the US education system that failed to teach us about all these spectacular inventions, but also inspired to read all the Nobel-prize winning literature. Though I had read books by a few of the prize-winning authors (Beloved by Toni Morrison, Lord of the Flies by William Golding), I had barely scratched the surface of authors to read. The museum was also a crash course in learning about Alfred Nobel, a serial inventor, most known for his dynamite and explosive inventions. This was probably more world history I had retained than any class in school :X
Fotografiska Museum, 5 stars
The museum offered three powerful exhibits:
Royal Palace, 4 stars
“Royal” is a bit of a stretch to describe the Swedes’ Palace, but it is a lovely building, and aptly representative of the humble nature of the Swedes. Oddly enough, all the Swedish royalty pictured and ornately framed are brunettes, not at all like the blonde/blue-eyed people I had imagined. There are 3 main buildings — I recommend buying the ticket that gets you into all three. They’re worth checking out.
National Library of Sweden and Stockholm Public Library, 4 stars
Cause we’re #nerds. The bibliophiles in us couldn’t help but make a stop at *both* libraries. The Stockholm Public Library boasted a gorgeous rotunda on its top-level with thousands of books encircling us. As I browsed the shelves, my eyes immediately went to the Isabel Allende section where I saw the exact book I was reading on the trip: Inés of My Soul, but in Swedish. Talk about serendipity! Who needs John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale…
The National Library of Sweden had a slightly more interesting inventory. The library’s basement contained “Codex Gigas”, literally meaning “giant book”, or The Devil’s Bible. It’s the largest known medieval manuscript at 36x20x8.7 inches.
Nordic Museum, 3 stars
The exterior is stunning and looks more royal than the Royal Palace, with its turquoise sheen-ed roof atop sturdy concrete walls and multi-panel glass windows. Statues of imposing men riding horses guard the building to create a sense of awe when you enter the museum. And did I mention free entrance from 1–5pm? Apparently this is the happenin’ place on weekday afternoons with the older Swedes (aka senior citizens..), who comprised 80% of the visitors. And I don’t blame them. The atrium alone provided the most beautiful luncheon backdrop.
Eat in the museum cafe! I ordered the traditional meat and cabbage lasagna-esque dish (no noodles), and Jenn and Jenn got the salmon and mushroom soup. Keep in mind that we all grew up eating family-style, so we had the benefit of getting to try three different entrees at every meal. Plus the cafe provides all-you-can-eat bread, coffee and tea.
The rotating exhibits included Fashion through the Ages and A Nordic History, both of which were an enlightening glimpse into Nordic history through a fun, interactive lens. One exhibit provided paper for us to draw our 2050 fashion predictions and weave a giant tapestry with colorful threads that evoked different emotions.
Sodermalm Square and King’s Garden, 5 stars:
This was a beautiful garden and city center in the middle of Stockholm. There was a giant performance venue plus an ice skating rink decked out in twinkling lights, where parents and their kids swirled around unsteadily and didn’t mind taking a tumble. A small food stand served hot chocolate and even had fireplaces to roast marshmallows. If you could sit long enough in the cold, you could watch the ice sheets float down the river passing by magnificent buildings like the Grand Opera House and International Riviera Grand Hotel. It felt like Christmas in February.
Skansen “Museum”, 2 stars
The world’s oldest outdoor museum is a fascinating microcosm of Sweden. The founder brought or modeled buildings of all trades to Skansen to showcase the different industries, including glassblowing, carpentry, and other crafts. These craftsmen and women were smart and apparently decided to stay home from the cold because most of the shops were closed the day we went. There were outdoor venues, like an ice skating rink, and restaurants that were open, but we skipped. Luckily, the animals were still open for business, and we got to see wolverines (not Hugh Jackman, but honeybadger-like animals), bison, snow wolves, bobcats/lynx, and reindeer! The 2-star rating is a bit harsh, but it was pretty darn cold to spend all day at an outdoor park.
Gondolen Bar, 4 stars
Go for the views, stay for the drinks. We arrived a bit late (30 min before closing so we only had beer and wine offerings available. No matter, I immensely enjoyed my IPA.) We also were able to admire the great views from Katarinahissen, the 12-story elevator that takes you to an outdoor balcony for stunning views of the city.
Sturehof restaurant, 4 stars
Seafood lovers: go here. Again, it was expensive, but worth the price tag. We ordered a seafood platter with shrimp of all sizes, plus crab and Canadian lobster. The shrimp were incredibly tasty. The toast skagen, which is what they’re known for, is mayonnaise-y shrimp on top of toast — a bit overrated in my opinion. However, their scallop appetizer (yes, scallop singular, not plural) was to die for, but will set you back $17.
Grand Escalier, 4 stars
We tried to head to the Spy Bar, which loomed surreptitiously outside the Sturehof restaurant, but we eventually gave up trying to get in. We luckily walked inside the “galeria” (mall) right next to the restaurant and stumbled upon the Grand Escalier bar, which came highly recommended from a friend. Deeee-licious cocktails.
Östermalm Food Hall, 4 stars
I had already had moose medallions, so I was in a meat kick, looking to sample the primest cuts of Sweden’s finest. As we walked around the stalls that offered meats, seafood, pastries, and other goods, we asked a nice gentleman what the most popular meats were. He offered a sampling of their various meat cuts. We had the moose hind, moose salami, and reindeer heart and shoulder. Each had varying levels of smokiness and were all delicious.
When we attempted to pay, the man (Wes) refused and said it was his treat. And the sampling wasn’t just a piece of meat per animal, there were probably ten slices of each meat! Such. Nice. People. For a light lunch, we had their famous cheese quiche and cardamom cinnamon bun with a light hot chocolate. They really love their cardamom in Sweden. Perhaps cardamom is a natural happiness pill??
Slingerbulten restaurant: yummy restaurant. Order the moose medallions.
Da Peppe: If you want a break from Swedish restaurant, check out this very authentic Italian joint in the Old District. They were kind enough to provide free dessert plus a sufficiently embarrassing Italian rendition of “Happy Birthday.”

Stockholm ranks high on many queer people’s favourite cities list — and it’s plain to see why. This waterfront city is a hub of fashion, music, food, nature and progressive queer culture. Let me guide you to my Stockholm.
As soon as you arrive, whether it’s at Arlanda or Skavsta airport, you will be met by the views many associate with Sweden; green pine forests, yellow fields and blue lakes, with red little houses dotted all around. As you approach the city (grab Arlanda Express for the smoothest journey) the houses, as well as the vast open waters, grow in size, revealing the unique character of this capital city. Stockholm is where domestic lakes meet the Baltic sea, and whilst this is the centre of the tech, music and fashion innovation that Sweden is well known for, the city also celebrates nature, tradition — and LGBTQ rights. Let’s dive in.
Stockholm is built on 17 islands and as a visitor you simply must make the most out of this unique feature. My first tip, therefore, is: find your sea legs.
There is nothing quite like island hopping in the archipelago. Get on a traditional archipelago boat — or it’s high-speed equivalent – and take it out to Waxholm, Möja, Finnhamn, Utö or any one of the other gorgeous little stops along the way. Here you will be able to stop for a bite to eat, have a dip in the sea, and explore the Swedish forestry. Thanks to Allemansrätten, the Right of Public Access, you are free to roam the land (with only a few exceptions). If bigger boats are your thing you could get a ferry from Slussen, taking you to Finland or Estonia for the day.

Take time to soak in the waterfront in Stockholm. Whether it’s a walk on Djurgården, a stroll along the picturesque Södermälarstrand, or a panoramic tour along Fjällgatan (where my girlfriend asked me to marry her on New Year’s Eve!), I find it is impossible to get enough of the the Stockholm waterfront views. You can count on many a #selfie moment here.
What’s more, on a warm summer’s evening you will find theatre performances in Rålamshovsparken, high profile gigs at theme park Gröna Lund, romantic picnics at Skinnarviksberget, burgers and boules Boule & Berså at Danviksbro, national sing-along at open air museum Skansen and beer gardens filled with Swedes enjoying a well-earned “AW”, after-work. Following a long, dark winter Sweden embraces summer like few others.
Regardless of whether you are visiting in summer or winter, make sure you indulge in a dip. In the warmer months Stockholm’s many beaches fill up with local holiday makers, and during the rest of year (but also in summer) the many bathhouses create a relaxing oasis. Check out well-renowned Sturebadet, situated in the city centre, or Japanese sanctuary Yasuragi, located in the forests outside Nacka, to experience perfect relaxation. For an added twist and a truly Swedish experience, head out to Hellasgården for a dip in the sea — don’t worry, they cut a hole in the ice for you in the winter.
Stockholm is due to co-host EuroPride together with Gothenburg in 2018 and the city celebrates a huge Pride party every summer — but I have found it to be just as welcoming to queer people all year round.
Strolling through the streets of Stockholm I am always struck by rainbow flags, non-conformative design, boundary pushing initiatives and out gay people just being themselves. Last I was over I just happened upon a small yet mainstream jewellery shop proudly advertising rainbow marriage – that’s just one example. Swedes generally don’t even blink at the thought of same sex couples and when the Pride parade comes to town, the streets fill with people celebrating equality.
Worth noting is that the lesbian scene in Sweden is political; outspokenly feminist and trans inclusive. With lots of lesbian artists and initiatives increasingly gaining recognition across Sweden, the scene is growing particular in the Swedish capital — check out artists such as Silvana Imam, Beatrice Eli and Kakan Hermansson and you get the idea.
And whilst holding hands with my girlfriend (now fiancee!) has never caused me any grief regardless of the time of day, it is at night that the gay scene really comes alive…
Stockholm nightlife thrives particularly between May and August, when the sun doesn’t set and the summer rays stretch on into the early hours. Honestly, it’s magical.
One of the most popular establishments during this time of year (and again, one of my faves) is Mälarpaviljongen, a chic waterfront bar and restaurant buzzing with LGBT clientele, DJs, and staff. Worth noting is that the venue works with LGBT charity Regnbågsfonden and employs LGBT refugees.
Trädgården is another summer club hugely popular with the queer community. Set under the bridges near the waterfront by Eriksdalsbandet, this club invites some of the biggest acts and DJs and it is definitely one to visit. Make sure you go early, though, as queues can be long.
There are lots of club nights aimed specifically at a lesbian/bi clientele. Look out for Moxy, Bitter Pills, Hotellgänget, Club Wish (for the kinky) and keep a keen eye on Gunn Lundemo Events — this Stockholm-based DJ regularly does clubs around the world but she often also plays on home turf and her latest project with the L Word’s Daniela Sea looks seriously cool. Speaking of new, SPACE Stockholm is a recent initiative by lesbian icon and longtime Stockholm DJ Pamela, promising house music and underground decadence.
Many of the gay clubs in Stockholm attract a mixed clientele and “queer” is the buzzword here, as exemplified by the brilliant-looking Klubb Hångel, playing retro tunes and serving a no-attitude-pure-joy kind of vibe.
DATE is a club night run by underground music superstars Ji Nilsson and Julia Spada and whereas it isn’t advertised as queer, it’s a night I’d personally always try to make.
Mainstream gay clubs, where I might expect to see more men than women, include King Kong, Wonk and party boat Patricia. Bar/restaurant/club Marie Laveau, which is mixed and has a very cool vibe, puts on a queer party, Club Laveau, every Friday.
Queer friendly but not explicitly gay clubs include Debaser, Berns and Södra Teatern - but then again you will struggle to find somewhere that isn’t welcoming in Stockholm. For the latest queer events, see Visit Sweden LGBT as well as the Facebook timeline of JagVillGåPåQueerFest — the information is in Swedish but it gives a good idea of new upcoming nights. You might also want to check out Facebook’s list of gay bars here.
Say Swedish music and one band will come to mind regardless of where in the world you are. And now, finally, we have a museum dedicated to their greatness! Whether you are a huge fan or not, the ABBA museum is a Stockholm must as it lets you step back in time and rediscover pop history. Record your own song, perform in your own music video and (my favourite) learn about the music history that followed on from these super trooper dancing queens. Go, go, go!
Music thrives in Stockholm and the list of hits created here, thanks to producers such as Denniz Pop, Max Martin, RedOne, Nijs and Ji Nilsson, is endless. Spot some of the stars, including Zara Larsson, First Aid Kit and The Cardigans, live in Stockholm this summer — and do consider heading over for Popaganda, Stockholm’s coolest pop festival held early September at outdoor swimming bath Eriksdalsbadet. Years and Years and FKA Twigs were incredible last year.
Fans of modern art head to Moderna Museet or Liljevalchs, where each spring their exhibition Vårsalongen showcases the latest artists and pieces for a small entry fee. Fotografiska, the photography museum, is another must as they never fail to put on incredible and thought-provoking exhibitions, often by queer artists.
It is no secret that Swedes love IKEA as much as the rest of the world, but there is more to Swedish interior design than that. On a trip to Stockholm make sure you check out the Svenskt Tenn and Svensk hemslöjd in the city centre and discover the origins of Scandi hygge.
Stockholm Fashion Week takes place twice a year but this city breathes fashion 24/7. Home to brands such as ACNE, Stutterheim, Dagmar, Whyred, Swedish Hasbeens, Anna Holtblad, Filippa K, Hope, Nudie, Happy Socks, COS, Polarn O. Pyret as well as high street hits Weekday, Monki and of course, H&M, Stockholm makes for great shopping, especially as many of these big names actively challenge both hetero and gender norms. “Normkritik”, norm criticism is an important concept in Sweden, not least in fashion.
For high street fashion head to Drottninggatan and the city centre area between tube stops T-centralen, Hötorget and Östermalmstorg. Whilst you will find specialised (and very good!) H&M stores on almost every corner, Monki and Weekday are other Swedish-owned high street brands well worth checking out. Department store Åhléns has a good fashion department with many Swedish designers and Nordiska Kompaniet, a five minute walk from there, is excellent for your high end shopping. MOOD department store around the corner serves up a cool hipster vibe (with incredible toilets) and Biblioteksgatan, Sturegallerian and Sturegatan is where you find your luxury shopping. Do pop into Efva Attling jewellery shop on Biblioteksgatan — Efva is without a doubt one of Sweden’s biggest lesbian icons.
On Södermalm I would recommend a stroll along Åsögatan where you can discover smaller boutiques by Swedish designer stars such as Acne and Stutterheim but also nip into the shop and studio of Caroline Hjerpe, an up and coming jewellery maker with a great Instagram following. Her work has been spotted both on pop star Tove Lo and Sweden’s biggest vlogger Clara Henry (who, btw is openly bisexual and well worth checking out — YouTube here) and for good reason. If you’re lucky her adorable little dog will come say hi, too.
For vintage fashion check out Beyond Retro and Myrorna, the latter is essentially our version of Oxfam but with huge fashionista status.
There is more to Scandi cooking than meatballs and the capital of Scandinavia is well known for its culinary flair. Regardless of your budget, you can eat very, very well in Stockholm and here are a few of my favourite eateries.
Urban Deli — serving local, organic, proper classic Swedish food in a relaxed atmosphere. They have several locations but the Nytorget one is my favourite — possibly because it co-functions as a food shop and also happens to be a big queer hot spot.
Paradiest — a combined organic food store and food court where local produce is at the heart of the operation.
Green Queen — Mälarpaviljonen’s green little sister. This restaurant/deli focuses on “clean” eating, serving up delicious rainbow salads, juices and raw snacks.
Nalle o Kroppkakan — for something very Swedish and rather different, head to this restaurant near Telefonplan. They serve traditional Swedish “kroppkakor”, robust potato dumplings with different fillings. Served with lingonberries and a cold beer, it hardly gets more Swedish than this.
Vigårda — gourmet burgers at budget cost. With an ever changing menu and at least one mean veggie burger at a time this small scale burger chain is the bomb.com. (I will say that mainstream burger chain Max isn’t bad either — they do not one but six veggie options.)
Södra Teatern/Mosebacke — with one of the best views of the city, this classic Södermalm establishment serves Swedish tapas, small courses making the vegetable the star of the show (worry not, you may add meat or fish if you so wish).
A Swedish must is the tradition of fika, meaning coffee or tea with a small snack (preferably a cinnamon roll if you ask me). Your fika options are endless but these are some of my favourites:
The classic fika: Vetekatten
The posh fika: Wienerkonditoriet
The healthy, soulful fika: Koloni
The LGBT tourist fika: Chokladkoppen (ideal for an Old Town sightseeing stop)
The hipster fika: Vurma
The political, vegan fika: Femtopia
The raw fika: STHLM RAW
The Instagram worthy fika: Pom & Flora
The mainstream fika: Wayne’s
And on that sweet note, it is time to round this guide up. Do leave your favourite Stockholm tips in the comments below and hit me up on social media if you have any questions about queer life in Stockholm.
Last but not least… the practicalities.
The main inner city areas to bear in mind are Södermalm/SoFo (for a relaxed and very cool hipster vibe), Östermalm (high end shopping and first class food), gorgeous old town area Gamla Stan (the cobbled streets see you literally step back in time – make sure you visit the castle), down to earth Kungsholmen and green museum island Djurgården.
When I visit I try to walk as much as possible, just because it means I get to see more of the city, but getting around via public transport is easy. The Oyster-like SL card gives you access to the tube, bus, tram and boat — all of which feel safe and clean. Many of the tube stations are decorated with lovely bits of art and a recent addition is that the escalators are lit up by rainbow lights. You can plan your journeys here.
SAS, British Airways, RyanAir and Norwegian all fly non-stop to Stockholm from London. If you fly into Arlanda I would recommend going via Arlanda Express, Flybussarna coach or Taxi 020 — beware of individual taxi drivers trying to grab your attention at the rank and instrad pick the big taxi names, asking for a fixed price.
Stockholm Pride is taking place 31 July — 6 August 2017. See you there?

This was written by me and my spouse, Yoav Luft.
This summer we didn’t want to use planes, busses, or trains, due to the Corona. So we decided to go on a bike trip in the Stockholm archipelago.
We planned 5 days of biking and one additional day to rest on our final destination. We booked everything through an agency called ResGladh, that we’ve found through Sweden By Bike. We could have rented through ResGladh the bikes, but we wanted to keep them, so we purchased two bikes with 8 gear at Decathlon.
We received a map from Sweden By Bike with official bike paths, and prepared our riding plan according to recommendations from them and different attractions (like museums) from Google Maps. In the maps below, each square is 5 km. When planning our route, we wrote down when we will have access to restaurants and supermarkets.
We took two instant rice bags with us and some sandwiches and fruits for the first day, as well as energy bars, nuts, knäckebröd and tahini for the entire trip. We also took two bottles of water, 1 litre each.
We had one backpack of 35 litres, and one bike bag of 40 litres. We switched them during the trip according to our physical condition.
We took a ferry from Stockholm to Väsbystrand, Ljusterö with the bikes. On Summers and weekends queues start early, there is limited space for bicycles (11 on bigger ferries) and its first arrived, first served. We arrived some 45 minutes ahead of time and there was already a queue. We sailed for 2.5 hours.
Before the trip we were sure we’re going to cycle on pastoral gravel paths, so the first day was a bit shocking — although we used official maps for cycling, pretty quickly we’ve found ourselves cycling in a road for cars, without dedicated bike lane, nor shoulders. I haven’t been training recently because of the Corona, and Yoav hasn’t cycled since childhood, so cycling next to car driving 70 kmh wasn’t ideal for us. Luckily all the drivers were very careful, and waited behind us if another car was coming from the other direction.
We ate lunch after crossing from Ljusterö to the main land. We crossed on a floating road, this ferry doesn’t cost money and there’s no visible personnel on it, so it was a bit weird because we didn’t know exactly what to do, so we just went on board together with the cars, and then got off on the other side.. it arrives every 20 minutes. We ate lunch on the other side in the all ubiquitous Swedish “pizza-kebab"".
We continued cycling and stopped at Wira Bruk, a 17th century forge and weapons smithy. It’s a free open museum that we enjoyed, and we also filled our water bottles there and used the toilet. There’s also a coffee place there that we haven’t tried.
We started cycling at 11:30 and arrived at our B&B at 4:30. The owners recommended go bathing at Underskug, but we were exhausted and even missed the supermarket which closed at 18:00. So we went to eat yummy middle-eastern food at Cafè Bergshamra & Pizzeria.
In the morning we ate breakfast with Margaretha and Bosse from Carlberg B&B, chatted with their other guests, and started our longest day of the trip. In Bergshamara there was a bike lane, and next to Karl-Ols we took the side road and finally cycled in the woods on a gravel path. We then continued through Grovstanäs, which is really beautiful. We paused there for a short break by the water. We also got lost there a bit and it added 1–2 km to our original plan.
We paused for lunch at Spillersboda, were there is a café by the water, and we also filled water there, used the toilet, and purchased soap and some cans at the small supermarket there. At all the places we stayed there were towels, but none had soap or shampoo.
We continued then north and had a coffee break at Rådmansö Bakery Shop. The way from Nänninge to Björköören was again pretty intense with the cars of many people coming back to Stockholm on the last weekend of the last vacation week of August. We started to cycle in route (1) that’s marked in azure in the above map, but were stopped by a family arguing that it’s a private way that is blocked. So we switched to 2 and ended the day at STF (Svenska Turistföreningen) Kapellskär hostel in Riddersholm. There is a kiosk there with some microwave dishes, but we cooked some of the food we’ve had with us. At that point we were very sour. Our thighs muscles as well as butts hurt from cycling for two days and we decided to take it easy the next day — planning based on satellite images rather than only the map, and walking uphill instead of paddling.
We’ve decided to go through (4), (5) and (6) in the Södersvik map above. There’s a cycling path parallel to E18 that is unfortunately not marked in the map. It wasn’t very inspirational, but it was safe and easy. Around Insjövägen we got on to the official path again, which was very beautiful. From there it was very fast and nice to get to Norrtälje, and we arrived at noon, which was nice because we had time to enjoy the town.
We stayed in Berglings B&B, which was really nice. We ate at Looi sushi and Ed’s burger, and walked to the pier. In the morning we got ourselves more comfortable bike chairs at Cykelservice i Norrtälje. We also got knee elastic band for Yoav. Yes, we still suffered from the second day’s effort. We had a discussion whether we should come back home or even get a ferry to the final destination with the bikes and then get buses between the places we were supposed to stay for the nights until then. But we decided to give it another chance — and it was worth it, because the fourth day was the most beautiful.
It wasn’t supposed to be Mälby. It was supposed to be Wik B&B in Soderby-Karl, but a few days before the trip something happened and they cancelled all the reservations.
ResGladh found us a place further north, and we thought it’s going to be very tiring, but the road was really nice and quick, and there were four wonderful pauses on the way.
The first break we took was at a church in Roslags-Bro, which was pretty and re-charging.
The second is marked with (1) on the map was a really nice public bathing area with grass, sand and beautiful lake. There were a few people there except for us and it was also nice to see them because we rarely saw people on the paths in this trip.
The one marked with (2) was a coffee place we really enjoyed and also a cool store where I got lovely earrings and neckless, which made me feel much better :D.
The last leg of this day, marked with (3), was a big and nice surprise, cycling along a beautiful artificial canal.
And then we got to our night destination — Livsuniversitetet. This is a special place that we appreciated, and we were almost alone here, similarly to the situation on the second night. Lena Kristina helped us to settle down and then gave us a ride to ICA. She told us a little about this place and about herself — a pioneer psychologist who’d researched and developed methodologies around breathing. They have different retreats for groups of adults and youth. The farm is very cozy with a large kitchen and yoga room, and many secret fun corners.
In the evening we went to Ortala bathing park, which was amazingly beautiful with crystal clear water which were also too cold for us to get in.
Finally we were on our last cycling day. Feeling refreshed and excited about the rest day we planned to spend on Arholma, we started our way south-east.
We stopped at Barnens Ö for a short break, and then at Simpäs. We took the ferry in the afternoon after eating a delicious Thai lunch at the pier.
In Arholma there’s a small supermarket and a couple of restaurants that require reservation. We stayed at another STF hostel that was wonderful (and with lots of fun stuff for kids).
The best decision in preparing this trip was to take a resting day in Arholma. We toured the island, booked an hour at the sauna (private, including the water next to it), and had a really nice dinner at Arholma Dansbana. There weren’t many animals on the island, except for cows and tiny frogs. We were surprised to find a cold war bunker on the island that is now a museum with tours. The day after we hiked in the forest in the north, which was full with blueberries and linden berries, and then took a ferry back in the afternoon, a 4.5 hours trip directly to Stockholm.

There are three amazing things about Stockholm: its history, people, and cuisine. It is the capital of Sweden, a Scandinavian nation with centuries of heritage and thousands of coastal islands and inland lakes. Connected by more than 50 bridges and built on 14 islands, Stockholm houses 2.3 million people in its metropolitan area. It was settled during the Stone Age and was founded as a city in 1252. When I got the chance to visit, fueled with excitement and curiosity, I ventured on without knowing what was waiting for me.
My first stop, the Stockholm City Hall, is the building of the Municipal Council for the city. Famous for its grand ceremonial halls and unique pieces of art, City Hall is most well-known for hosting the Nobel Prize banquet each year. The guided tour is a must, and be sure to check out the Blue Hall (which is actually red), the Prince’s Gallery (with the mural pointed by Sweden’s Prince Eugen), and the Golden Hall (which is decorated with over 18 million mosaic pieces of glass and gold).
My next destination, the Royal Palace, was equally mesmerizing. The tremendous palace, built in the 1700s and painted pastel brown and yellow on the outside, holds more than 1,400 rooms. Even without a guided tour, the Palace still offers an irresistible chance for a taste of royal life. Two unique features of the palace which differentiate it from other grand palaces in Europe are the exhibition dedicated to royalty’s ceremonial outfits and a chamber furnished in 70s styles. Both share insight into the life and duties of the modern royal family.
One good thing about sightseeing in Stockholm is that a lot of the famous architecture and historical sights reside near one another within the city. Coming out from the backdoor of the Royal Palace, I was directly facing Gamla Stan, the medieval old town. Ochre-colored houses sit close to one another while busy restaurants, cafes, boutiques, and souvenir shops occupy the aged, cobblestone streets.
Just as I ventured into Gamla Stan, jet lag suddenly hit me. Unable to keep my eyes open and my body properly functioning, I needed a good, strong coffee americano to continue my journey. And that was when the “accident” took place.
“Can you pass me my wallet in the bag?”
“Yeah, sure. Just one second. But wait…where is my bag?”
“What do you mean, ‘where is your bag?’ You put it right under the table.”
“It’s not there anymore…”
After resting a bit in a small café in Gamla Stan, while going through the photos I had taken throughout the day, my mom and I noticed that our bag, which I had left under the table, had disappeared. Yep, that’s right, I lost the entire backpack on the first day of travelling. Deprived of wallets, travel documents, sunscreen, sunglasses, and basically everything needed for travelling, we were left with the one credit card that I had kept in my pocket.
Though upset at the situation, I was nevertheless surprised and comforted by the warmth of the locals. After hearing about what happened, the owner of the café ran out to comfort my mom and communicate with the local police. As I was running around the medieval alleys, circulating back and forth between fountains, statues, and small churches, looking into trash cans to see if our travel documents were at least thrown out, two shop owners sitting along the streets joined my search and started digging through the trash cans as well. However, our effort was futile in the end.
Frustrated and tired, we wandered aimlessly from Gamla Stan to the city’s central port. It was already around 6 PM, but the sunshine showed no trace of dimming, and it cast a golden tint over the entire cityscape. With an average height of five stories and a unified yellow-orange color theme, the buildings, which were mostly constructed in the 17th century, resembled each other in architectural style. Between the buildings, cobblestone paths ran across the city plane while locals immersed themselves in thoughts and conversations alongside the river.
Suddenly, upon spotting a group of people dressed in suits and gowns congregating in front of a tour boat, we decided to find out what was happening. One of the crew members explained that this was a weekly cruise tour that served fresh shrimp and seafood platters but also required a reservation at least one month in advance. Disappointed and ready to leave, we were once again surprised by “fate.” Another crew member who overheard our conversation called us back and told us that one couple had canceled their reservation last-minute due to an emergency, and that we could hop on if we wanted. Without a second of hesitation, my mom and I advanced.
After boarding the ship, we were welcomed by an ivory tablecloth, crystal wine glasses, and a sweet floral aroma in the air. The waiters soon seated us along the window and displayed the menu, which included shrimp scampi, salmon, and champagne. It was around 8 PM when the cruise sailed out of the port and started roaming gracefully through the islands during golden hours. Surrounded by fresh seafood, sunset, and nature, the lost bag was already out of my mind. From the reflective river, to the cottages hidden in nature, to the modern luxury apartments, everything seemed like an impressionist painting under the violet-blue infused sky.
Ever since I came back, I have been wondering what was so mesmerizing about Stockholm. What made me want to revisit again and again, even after my little “accident”? The answer is clear to me now, as I am recalling the memories and images in my mind: it’s the infinite possibilities one can encounter in this magical city.

Everyone will tell you eating out in Stockholm is expensive, but is quite manageable if think more about how locals eat. After exploring some great free activities, this part of the post will be more focused on the affordable eats :) :
As a foodie, I did not go all the way kebab and sandwich (like I did when I first traveled in Europe 10 years ago). You can also see my reviews about restaurant (actually, pretty affordable, even feel cheap from my Hong Kong perspective) and eating tradition (fika ❤) in my other post here with a map of restaurants that I ate at.
Lunch is the main meal where locals would eat out, and for a good amount of them, it is the main meal for them (eat more at lunch, and skip dinner… this reminds me of my parents). All-you-can-eat are actually not an uncommon option for them and available around the city and decent price (from SEK100 to mid SEK range if you’re eating during the lunch time; some places have discount for early diners).
We went to two all-you-can-eat and one of them we just love! (The other is very good for value, too).
As mentioned in Part 1 of this post, I found this place a heaven on earth! It has also come top in most of the (English) reviews. This is the first buffet where I could taste the difference in each dish and within each dish, each ingredient!
My brother and I are both picky eater, and it is the only place where we love everything (my brother hates pickle and I dislike beetroot in general, but we enjoyed them there). They do have some interesting combination of spices that I would not have thought about but turned out well.
My personal favourites are the lasagna (they made me break my low carb diet a bit), the curry and their BUTTER (I mean margarine).
Apart from great food, you can also enjoy a great view of the city from Hermans, they are pretty popular, so good luck in finding a good table.
After a day being a vegetarian, we went back to our meat lover mode. We went to another highly rated all-you-can-eat that specialized in grilled meat for lunch. Everyday, they will have 3 mains (on our day, it was beef, lamb meat loaf and fish). with a salad selection.
Taste wise I’d say it is not as flavourful as Hermans. However, you can taste the meat (it is not a rare thing here in HK where you can’t taste what you eat). I like all the 3 mains, but like the fish the most. Among everything there, my favourite is the grilled carrot and the mushroom sauce.
I read that the food is prepared from a charcoal grill. I honestly couldn’t tell, but then, they definitely deliver a good meaty, hearty lunch in the CBD at a low price.
For more options (especially if you wouldn’t mind Asian), you can take a look at this and this.
If a sit down lunch is a bit out of budget or simply out of time, you are lucky. Stockholm is a great place for street food with a lot of good roadside grills, food stand and food trucks offering American, Mexican, Middle Eastern food and more.
If you’re determined to look for the food truck, I will definitely recommend you to follow this article and download the apps. We did not do it, and have wasted like an hour’s time to search for truck that are not out on the day.
After one hours’ walking we decided to go for the stand. Our original pick was Nystekt Stromming; however it moved (damn you Google) and we did not know the new location was actually very close… (like across the bridge kind of close). Just walking across the bridge to the old town and you’re there.
Instead of walking across the bridge, we walked to the metro and went to Ostermalms Korvspecialist.
Although not our first choice, this small hot dog stand where chef eats did not disappoint. It has a generous amount of freshly grilled and tasty sausage, but the best part is the bread.
Unlike your regular hot dog, the bread wrap the sausage like a pocket. It makes it easier to eat and also easier to eat both bread and sausages together. The baguette is rightly toasted, very crispy on the outside and still soft on the inside (however much that’s left for the inside).
Another thing that I like about them is their sauerkraut does not taste too strong and would not overpower their sausage.
One hotdog is around SEK50–70, and is enough to feed one adult of reasonable appetite. The staff is quite friendly and I would recommend you to ask for recommendation.
Apart from the fried herring burger, some other fast food that I planned to eat but missed this time are kebab, kebab pizza and falafel. I will be back for you guys (waving)!
This one I can only contribute a little bit, as I did the research but didn’t try that our myself.
There are 2 types of food halls in the world — expensive one and affordable ones. If you go to a food court not because of price but the variety or experience, you could go for more upscale food hall like Östermalms Saluhall.
It might be a good idea if you are planning to buy some fresh food to cook at home.
For the rest of us who are looking for cheap in food halls, the following comes up in my research (in order of popularity):
Ok, if you are really on a budget, picnic is a great idea when the weather allows it.
There are plenty of beautiful green area and parks in Stockholm and you can leisurely enjoy your food in a park. Go for a cheaper supermarket and some of them, like urban deli, also have hot food for sale (if you don’t have anywhere to cook).
Essentially, afterwork is like happy hour, except that some bar would have a small (free) buffet of food. Check out the bars on your way!
For every city, there is definitely places that are affordable if you search for it. Generally, Middle Eastern food (check out my post on my Turkish dinner!), and Asian (which I did not take) would be cheaper. Bar maybe a good options, too. I had 1/2 kg of reasonably good mussels at around SEK165. Also, not to forget you always have your beloved IKEA as an option (although it’s a bit out of the way… who cares with the free shuttle?).
One thing I notice is that, do not follow Tripadvisor (and Yelp!) as most of the reviewers are from a few countries (unless you are their fellow country people), and most of the time, the price tag and review is skewed. I skipped all the results from Tripadvisor.
Another interesting find is Facebook does make decent recommendations! I actually discovered 2 of the places I like through them!
On to the next and last part of this series: how to get around Stockholm cheap (apart from walking and swimming).
Feeling full just from reading? You can also go back to the first part to take a look at all the free activities :)
Just to let you know, I relied on the following posts to gather idea on food :) :

Björn Ståhl, Founding Partner, Uncommon Stockholm said: “We will focus on brands that people in the real world are glad exist. These brands are uncommon and they can make a difference like never before. I’ve admired what Nils, Lucy and Natalie have been building at Uncommon for some time and we can’t wait to continue their impact and partner together in Stockholm.”
Natalie Graeme, Co-founder at Uncommon Creative Studio added: “Björn, Mia and Max have the perfect balance — they each bring a unique quality and their collective experience is impressive. They see the world the same way we do and match our ambition at Uncommon. We’re thrilled to welcome them into the fold and couldn’t think of better partners to venture into Stockholm with.”
Six years in, the studio continues to make awarded and stand-out work winning its first Grand Prix at this year’s Cannes Lions for its groundbreaking campaign with British Airways.
Notably work also includes creating the most recognised mental health initiative in the UK with ITV, to creating a globally infamous free suit hire initiative for H&M — The One Second Suit, to help young men find work, to redefining what the Nike Jordan brand means today launching during the 23’ NBA All-Star Weekend through the eyes of an aspiring female baller.
The studio has always believed in creativity — applying its founding principles of building brands that matter — acts rather than advertising. The studio has built successfully portfolios across experience, CX, design and production — with Uncommon producing its first feature documentary with renowned director Andrew Dominik for Nick Cave and Warren Ellis’ ‘This Much I Know To Be True’ premiering at Berlinale and SXSW and achieved critical acclaim including The Guardian’s Film of the Week as well as being listed in NME’s top films of the year. Its second feature ‘In Camera’ is in the running for Best First Feature at the upcoming annual BFI London Film Festival.
Though the Studio was set up with a clear point of view and purpose, it also wanted to explore a new business model. Rather than just working for clients, if the studio saw a concept that deserved to exist, it would back it. So far the studio has launched the world’s first fully compostable coffee capsule Halo Coffee, a sexual wellness brand SEX BRAND launching with the UK’s most sustainable condom and most recently Communion — a new money saving app on a mission to unlock the freedom associated with the act of saving.
Uncommon also invested in the purpose-driven accelerator Unrest — to support diverse and sustainable businesses. Since its launch two years ago, it has helped 47 startups, raising £7.2M with a total valuation of £110M.

( This piece started in February, finished in June.)
Day 34. It has been more than a month since the experiential heat in the Lion City.
I don’t quite miss home yet, but it’s long enough for me to see stark differences between both cities and culture.
Facial features. Architecture. Museums. Weather. Snow. Winter.
2. Transportation
Metro. Subway. T-bana. Pendeltåg. Train. Escalator. Reliable. Not reliable. like SMRT? And not everyone has a car.
3. Working culture
Fika means put down your stuff and gather for Coffee Break. Phone-usage is a no-no, Socialising is encouraged.Lunch is Lunch. Work is Work. Party is Party. Work-Life Balance. And we take out our shoes when we are in office.
4. Social norms
More reserved. Strangers rarely say Hi. Yet seemed nice after the ‘ice has been broken’. Cashiers are the friendliest.
5. Standard of Living
Singapore is expensive. Deal with it. Stockholm is expensive too (including student hostels). In fact one of the most expensive in Scandinavia/Europe. High taxation. High expenditure on food, drinks, party. Then again, their wages are high as well.
I have met a couple of Singaporeans who got married and settled/is settling in here at Stockholm. Their stories are pretty amazing.
The city is beautiful, Swedes/locals lead less stressful lives, welfare and happiness are never taken for granted.
Perhaps Singapore can learn more from them.If I do have some form of political/social power, I will attempt to change some things back home. Change, is the only constant.

Stockholm, basically a town that is built across little islands at the spot where the fresh waters connect with the salty waters, is, in a way, soaked to the bone with olden tales. That starts from those brave Viking settlers going on, through to big posh palaces plus tales about brave actions at critical times; the Swedish main town gives you that grabbing feel for times of old. Instead of plainly peeking around at sites — why not set out on an immersive day of delight taking one the various history-based days out that Stockholm has available. With many things to select, where should one begin, you could be asking? But don’t stress about this at all! I kinda made this brief rundown of great historical picks found inside Stockholm that, in a way, promises super good times will be had! Let’s ready that travel kit, step on way-back ride machines, let’s get the facts popping coming directly outta those really superb aged settings this grand locale stores carefully! Find the untold experiences of Stockholm simply visit Stockholm’s historical insights just for fun.
So a top choice whilst coming to check the cool times long ago stored in Stockholm definitely asks one see the Vasa boat gallery spot, too! That impressive building protects bits associated to Vasa which stayed surprisingly sound for getting the facts regarding that battleship sinking really fast since making her initial trip going back during 1628. What is rad pertaining that boat could possibly not even revolve ‘round great scales, let’s imagine skilled carvers instead that outstanding piece concerning conserving works after its rescue efforts occurred! Try sensing yourself taking time backwards plus sensing, too, specifically what took ground by taking warships reaching day break for awful occasions took possession. Seeing vast details becomes heart tugging. Certain group programs highlight key bits like politic schemes King Gustavus pushed forward since they also check ship design actions occurring as factors created wreckages plus sunken depths arose also. Give yourself space with watching special booths and rooms particularly renovated cottages or fun playing installations. By really saving change be wise looking at packages visiting all areas offered alongside some guided Vasa Museum tour.
“In every way gaspingly gorgeous! Okay I might have seen news around this one, I just never pictured real views arriving live this! Those specialists presenting, I believe spoke super intelligently and seriously produced vessel memories alive now that felt actually pretty awesome that date! High fives going their means for good experiences!” — Sarah M., History Lover
I tell you those advisors guiding through it basically pour over solid background with interesting tiny tidbits going directly adding charm once drawing images considering existences sailing by sea while onboard ships constructed throughout these days old. I kinda have this sneaky feeling you begin falling breathless as quality happens then also think humbled in knowing tragic ending of some naval thing meeting oceans however having sailed a mile basically; try sinking deeper alongside oceans heritage that instant. Next watch details like they concern themselves uponVasa shipbuilding legacy, hopefully increasing brains inside.
Just that little by slowly disappearing alongside the cuteness found scattered around this town named Gamla Stan basically an area Stockholm says the earliest chapters of lives occur across all these streets is possibly interesting when thinking of the things discovered in all those cool walks during a time of sunshine filled play that takes days really! Paths of rock go spinning close all sides amongst structure of long-lasting nature and paints looking lively inside shades combining that old style mustard yellow alongside reddish exteriors everywhere! That point probably makes something feel beginning directly now across where tales speak around marketers living long ago beside monarchs plotting also not overlooking turns concerning the events inside days of country of Sweden that is her homeland there, specifically now. Person leading usually starts slowly bringing everyone close while discovering alleys almost secretive inside some part, going with gardens unseen generally alongside some gateways never spotted solo now. I’m very very likely that a feeling passes where all footstep has knowledge on this land when that moment arises strolling beside that grand Royal build plus market center Stortorget then possibly not skipping this grand gallery place linked to a guy called Nobel, definitely! Try thinking of crazy trading happenings going wayyy down here across that district as carriages horse guided echoes resounded, hearing quietly all communications hidden. Dig close on past occurrences using this fantastic one to choose alongside me: ahistoric walking tour.
It is cool cause just above what sights pop at eye glance level this place beats full life basically; something seems alive inside that district while moments tick right across history’s grand clock that feels nice and something that might be needed across someone thinking where adventure waits generally; watch some very very cool settings when considering that journey. Know a wide array via a Gamla Stan sites then get shown across paths found created as a pattern thanks a guru showing those points! Basically give yourselves freedoms traveling far time where every uncovered bit plus gripping accounts show themselves out the earliest areas forming spots in capital of Sweden..
In order for a shift for what Stockholm stores by days from long previous: consider watching Sodermalm something pretty awesome discovered toward land reaching off through southern spots past that territory called Gamla. The setting has gradually transformed spanning times right from district reaching at laborers where right now hip elements shoot into show at boutiques created through owners individually or restaurant innovators! This time probably should work seeing together its past history and cool happenings occurring at current that everyone would go through. Next watch the place speak the story beside spots tourists watch plus take that route athidden gems of Stockholm and more.
FeatureBrief Talk Over Here:Times Older!Look out closely how previous times got formed alongside that location known also how events got switched spanning each age for information really?Cooler WaysSeriously taste all feeling known while there really that communities existing art besides some occasions at night having wild nature maybe?Artwork Design!View things that combine little tiny shelters built vintage style versus a few building towers or fun sketches seen through street roads you probably should understand!.Tastes!Really eat meals together those ones known plus various international type you’ve spotted!.
Then walk down avenues at places having good skyline views whilst tales about those big influencers appearing at that area begin sounding now! Maybe just maybe you’ll begin passing some very boho alleys known really also known toward the “SoFo”. Now after hard job hours became stories: one regarding transformation where today the site stores culture those two things make one say one thing “strength”. View way existences have expression inhistoric Sodermalm charm: what richness is being created upon her soil.!
I bet going off that loudness that forms the town and try taking trips going smoothly onboard moving river vessels is a brilliant way how someone visits”Drottningholm,” something awesome that world watches through a protection association!. This impressive place appears really like that district”Versailles” through parts throughout Stockholm that protects the king, as a normal event. View wide space insides but wander down to sweet outside spots whilst something big concerning heritage plays there. A few times those presenting moments bring up happenings belonging at crown persons around that location-parties seen here? Think super persons making places exist, as artwork and something adorning her style! See it there maybe alongside: Swedish royalty and you can do more..
Regardless if people grasp parts regarding royal persons around that spot or others liking forms formed inside spots plus a spot silent arriving by, land with those Palaces offer you moments remembered really! Next take moments guiding yourself where insights start becoming real upon palace grounds Stockholm since moments begin arriving over ground where events play regularly really really..
After reviewing these picks above; comes time we watch place making local residents feel Stockholm is “theirs” (sort off, kinda)? This thing there becomes a place they watch as local authority area still also a piece holding values throughout ground: how prizes that person “Nobel” gets will get honors in days occurring here at a moment year for year. Through showing moment tours occurring here? Through these times begin people watching space appearing huge or art-full or something appearing metallic too- scenes created through all through area as the mother territory stands, known as Sweden! Be open learning things in area- but look how area stands out as strong from plans throughout the long era since then too!!! For spots known building big from history try booking: Stockholm historic buildings ahead and maybe go now.
Making those memories here feels maybe nice through one thing: see those booking occurring containing spot climbing to great levels, too probably. Look up all round location where beautiful events might just knock feet from floor when something plays up there as one watches!
Now those people who begin that part (those tourists) in soil that keeps culture- then the colors looking so attractive becomes super in area they enter really then that moment really forms really awesome sensation. So after times getting big meanings next feelings form right on then next someone getting tours together feels maybe okay through seeingswedish national heritage really!?.

I take the blue line, change to the green one in T-Centralen, and go down in Slussen. I glance through the windows of the galleries while walking through Hornsgatan. I was planning to watch the sunset from the viewpoint at Skinnarviksparken but the weather is not on my side and by the time I get there, dark clouds fill the horizon. I sit down on a bench to watch the snowflakes descend.
At five twenty, I go down and walk along the empty sidewalk next to the water. At some point, it stops snowing and I decide to continue my stroll to Gamla Stan, the old city in the center of Stockholm. The view of the Kungsholmen shore is gorgeous. It has been about a year and a half since the last time I passed through here. One gets too caught up in the routine and life goes by fast.
I continue walking to Rådhuset to take the blue line back home. By the time I am halfway, the dense dark clouds completely erase the lights of the Södermalm district. I can barely see the tower of the Stadhuset next to me. A blizzard covers the city on a white veil. My footprints don’t last more than a few seconds and I stop several times to clean the ice from my glasses.
I finally make it to the blue line and I am back in the warmth of my room a few minutes later. The snowstorm continues outside as if it was to last forever. I sit down in front of my desk and find refuge in the pages of my journal.
I like to write. I have been compiling journals for fifteen years. I write to put my thoughts into words and bring structure and clarity to my mind. I write to immortalize my memories, my beliefs, my stories. We are storytellers after all. We need stories to communicate, to give meaning to the world, and to make sense of our existence.
I leaf through the soft ivory paper of my journal and realize how the last months have been embedded into just a few pages. In contrast, when I go further back to my time as a traveler, several pages are needed to capture a single day of wander: the things I do, the places I visit, the colorful streets, and the different tastes and aromas of a new city, and the conversations I have with the people I meet. Paragraphs pile up and my hand write deteriorates as I rush to capture these experiences before they are altered or, even worse, forgotten by my fragile memory.
I look through the window as the ephemeral snow particles dance to the sound of the wind. I don’t want my days to go by helpless, at the mercy of the wind of life. I fear the moment I wake up and realize that decades have passed and I am still the same person.
I think about Memoirs of Hadrian, a novel by the Belgian writer Margarita Yourcenar. On his deathbed, Hadrian writes a letter to Marcus Aurelius, his future successor. The text recounts the wisdom the Roman Emperor has accumulated throughout different episodes of his life. Particularly, Hadrian declares that there are three ways to learn about human existence: through our own experience, through the experiences of others, and through books.
As a travel enthusiast, I cannot help but relate Margarita’s words to traveling.
By traveling, we leave behind our comfort and dive into the unknown. We expose ourselves to different environments and diverge from our beliefs, values, and prejudices. By traveling, we interact with the people we meet. We engage in conversations and dive into their stories. We learn to see the world through their eyes and add their experience to our own. By reading, we travel to different narratives. We learn from the stories of those who lived in distant times. We are entrusted with their stories to make them our own.
And yet all these perspectives remain incomplete. We see the world from the narrow lenses created by the conditioning our environment has provided. Even books carry the prejudices of the pen. Nevertheless, a rich life is born out of the combination of these incomplete stories.
Life is about feeding our stories through new experiences, rich conversations, and good books that change our narratives. To lead a life that cannot be reduced to just a few pages.

Stockholm, Sweden….A few weeks ago I hopped aboard a plane and headed to Sweden for the weekend. The truth is that Sweden has never been high on my wish list radar, as a destination, so I just have been skipping it year after year. However, living in Poland, Sweden has a huge advantage as a holiday destination. It is located so close to my homeland that it is easy to visit. I only need to cross the Baltic Sea and I’m there. The plane tickets to Sweden are usually bloody cheap … if only the weather there could be better.
Weather is always a strange thing. Every time I visit the Polish coast and look North, it seems that Sweden has better weather, as there are usually no clouds on the horizon. But the reality is far different. The weather in Sweden is cold and windy most of the year, except in summer. I didn’t want the Scandinavian weather to deceive me as I booked my ticket. I hoped that the sun would have mercy on me and would appear in Sweden during my stay. Sure enough, the weather had its way! I left sunny Poland and landed in quite a cloudy Sweden. During my stay, the sun tried to defeat the clouds but failed. My consolation was that it did not rain.
My motto is “like the places to which you travel and appreciate that you can visit them, no matter what”. Seems to me, as a traveller, that we should want to go everywhere and find something interesting anywhere. Consequently, I always try to see the best in each country I visit. Before going to Scandinavia my number one wish, while there was to experience the fjords! But that’s in Norway. Thinking which Scandinavian city would be my number one choice, I had a feeling it would be Stockholm. Now, after returning home, I can confirm 100%, that to me, Stockholm is absolutely the number one city in Scandinavia.
Nordic cities in my opinion are hit or miss. You love or hate them. They don’t have many landmarks, are very expensive and at first glance, they look just boring. Nordic cities such as Oslo, Helsinki, Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Reykjavík share one thing in common. They are coastal cities. I usually love cities bordering on a body of water, as a relationship with water adds a whole new dimension to city life … and Stockholm has lots of water!
People say that Stockholm is the Venice of the North. The city is spread out over 14 islands, that are connected by 57 bridges, with an eye towards my beloved Baltic Sea to the East. There’s something incredibly soothing about almost always having water in sight and that makes Stockholm a nice destination to explore on foot. It is pleasant to stroll when you are never more than a stone’s throw away from the water. There’s so much water everywhere that sometimes it seems like there’s more water than land. Hence, it may seem that there are more boats than cars, in the city. They are moored to the shore and sway on the gentle waves.
But such a picturesque location has also cons. A few times I found it slightly annoying to not be able to get somewhere, located just a few meters away from me, just because there was no bridge exactly where I needed it, and I had to walk around a channel, that made the way much longer.
All in all, I think that water is what makes Stockholm charming. It makes the air feel fresher and clearer. Waterworks for Stockholm especially when the day gives way to the evening. Sunset in Stockholm is a magical time. It is so nice to be near the water when the sun is setting and see Stockholm in its magic hour.
The second thing that struck me the most about the city was the colour. Everywhere, from the gems of the Old Town to more modern architecture, colour seems to be present on every surface. I think that the colours are Stockholm’s heaviest weapon against gloomy and cloudy weather. There is no logic or scheme to the colours of buildings, as they would have never been treated as a wholeness, but as individuals.
It’s more expensive than Paris and London, but it’s not as expensive as people expect. I spent most of my money on food. I’m glad that I had a hotel breakfast at the price of my room because going out for a meal more often than once a day would have ruined my budget.
The silence in Stockholm really hits you when you arrive. The cars seem to move in a silent mode and there is almost a hushed feeling everywhere.
Sweden’s capital city is a 700-year-old European city. It attracts many visitors each year looking to experience Sweden’s largest city, however, there were fewer tourists than I expected. Thanks to that Stockholm has a very relaxed feel. There are not many people on the streets and sometimes it seemed to me, that I had Stockholm, just to myself.
The city has an atmosphere that is very calm compared to other European capitals. Perhaps it is the people living here. Most Swedes seem patient and quiet. Maybe it’s because there are so many open spaces and of course water. Maybe it is because of the history felt in the air. Or maybe because the buildings are so colourful and in some way, they force you to stop and stare at them. Maybe it’s all of this put together…..

I just got back from my two-week trip across most of Northern Europe. This is my third trip back to Europe. (My first was a summer abroad in Italy nearly 8 years ago and my second was another two-week trip in 2014 where we explored Dublin, London, Amsterdam, and Paris.) I daresay this was the best so far! Thom and I visited Stockholm, Copenhagen, Berlin, and again, Amsterdam this time around. In order to share our experience and to create a living record of its details, I’ve decided to write across a few posts on each city and its adventures. This first post serves to detail our overall travel plans, information on flights/places to stay, tips on light packing, and general advice for good travel. I should mention that I’m not an expert on any other these things but it’s worth sharing the little knowledge that I gained before, during, and after this trip.
To begin with, here are a few starting facts about our trip:
Let’s begin by discussing budget flights. Nine months before this vacation even happened I found some non-stop flights from Oakland to Stockholm for $600 a person. These flights kicked off the entire trip and made everything possible. I recall the very first time I ever flew to Europe. (Which was 8 years this summer!) It was to Genoa, Italy from Buffalo, NY. That flight had three stops (Buffalo to NYC, NYC to Frankfurt, and Frankfurt to Milan) and one train (Milan to Genoa) in order to get to my destination with a total of over 20+ hours at a hefty price of $1500. (Thanks Aer Lingus! 🖕) So to come across a flight that was only 10 hours and non-stop to my choice destination, it felt like fate...
Doesn’t that last sentence feel so inspiring? Statements and facts like those are the gold and shiny wrapper on the cheap bar of travel chocolate. Here’s the nitty-gritty of budget flying:
With some of the add-ons and extra taxes, our $600 tickets actually came to $711.30 a person. Our in-between flights from city to city were around $50 a person. (As compared to a train from Berlin to Amsterdam which was $120 a ticket.) In the end, you have to deal with the minor annoyances for that 💰deal.
Let’s move on to transportation.
Thom and I took public transit for the most part. (I’ll discuss the bicycling and Uber rides a bit later in some of my city posts.) For us, it’s a fun challenge learning a new city’s public transit. And unlike American public transportation, European public transportation is fast, convenient, and very, VERY reliable. Upon arriving at the Arlanda Airport, which is located just outside of Stockholm, we took the Arlanda Express Train that runs directly to the city center in just 20 minutes. (As compared to my 1.5 hour MUNI and BART trip to Oakland International Airport. 😑) Out of the four cities we visited, Berlin boasted the fastest and most reliable transportation (dat German innovation) with Amsterdam coming in at a close second. (Trams, trams everywhere!) All the trams, trains, and buses that we took were clean and clearly marked. My only complaint was the summer heat which was especially felt in the enclosed and non-air conditioned trains.
I plan to discuss each Airbnb in detail for each city post but in general our decision to use this service came from a few points:
Finally, let’s talk about packing. Much like my last Europe trip, I took a single backpack and personal bag with me. That was it! Now that this trip is over, I can say, quite proudly, that it was the best decision that I made for packing. After each city we visited, Thom and I both got a little better at packing our bags. It was a very efficient way to travel, IMO.
Here are some pros:
I admit that there are some cons involved with this kind of packing. While I can pack a mean bag, it doesn’t exclude the fact that the weight gets to you…no matter how light. If you’ve ever landed at an airport and took public transit into a city, the transfers mean a lot of walking between terminals and stations. The weight of the bag can cause a lot of stress on your neck and shoulders. Even this year, I packed a bag that weighed about 8 lbs total and after a while, say 20 minutes of walking, it can really push down on you. I should mention that my bag isn’t meant for hiking or true backpacking and therefore isn’t super ergonomic. I’m sure if I had chosen a small hiking backpack, my experience would be different. The bag that I took is just an everyday backpack for commuting which is why long walks with a lot of weight can easily become a small burden.
Backpacking can also force you to make some crucial decisions as to what you pack. One small error (should I bring a bathing suit?) and you’ll be forced to carry that item throughout the entire trip with much resentment. The last time we were in Europe, it rained for most of the trip. Thom brought an umbrella this year. He never needed it! 😂 🙃 Lessons learned.
A few surprising things that we did bring this year are:
I’ve only really traveled internationally in the summer months so packing has always been dictated by the warmer weather. I took mainly dresses with a single pair of jeans and shorts. A few shirts to mix it up and a hoodie with a jean jacket for cooler evenings/days. I took a pair of black flats since they’re so versatile and my Keds for comfort as I walked/biked everywhere. I kept toiletries to small sizes and bought anything else that might have run out.
Thom and I failed to exchange any currency prior to the trip. But I would recommend making that order with your bank if possible since ATMs abroad will charge you a fee for any withdrawals. Also, make the obligatory call to your bank letting them know that you are traveling abroad so that they don’t lock your card and account.
A kind co-worker provided us an extra SIM card and we had another already from past trips, so this year we both had data/service for our phones. Thankfully our SIM cards were both purchased in the Netherlands with Vodaphone. These cards worked in all the other countries we visited and we didn’t need to purchase new cards along the way.
Finally, I’ll add that we obtained Global Entry prior to the trip. It made entering the US very easy and fast when going through customs. If you are a frequent international flyer, consider getting Global Entry. Global Entry includes TSA PreCheck. So if you fly around the country frequently (which I do), it’s very convenient and handy for jumping those long security lines.
This post is a part of a series based on my recent two-week trip to Europe.

3C for describing Stockholm: cold, cool, culture. Its historical background, architecture, fashion, style, traditional foods, and of course ABBA, all make it so cool! It can be also called ‘North Venice’ because of the 14 islands.
We went to Stockholm by Flixbus departed from Copenhagen. It was night and long ride, besides I spent the night awake because of my flu and I really terrified about the journey. The road was empty without lightning… Also, our bus was moving fast. Uh, terrifying…
We started the city tour with Riddarholmen Church which has a thousand years of history.
We sat on the benches around the church, watching Stockholm architecture.
We watched the iconic Södermalm view. Like a postcard…
Gamla Stan: best for the time traveling…
Narrow streets, yellow colors, cinnamon smells… It makes me feel like I am in a different zone.
Me and my friend exploring the city by walking, climbing hills and from the beginning of the city tour, we constantly arguing about which city is better… Copenhagen or Stockholm? We are counting the pros and cons. However, it is an inconclusive debate. After wandering around the Gamla Stan’s old streets, another debate… Does it look like Florence? Then, we are sitting on a bench watching the Baltic Sea, talking about how can we do more efficient things, and be successful in our aims. I guess, this is Stockholm energy. Not syndrome… but this city has effects on people.
I ticked eating Swedish Meatballs in Sweden and going to Ikea in Sweden off on the bucket list. It was the first time I’ve eaten meatballs with sweet lingonberry jam (it was great). I also had Kladdkaka, Kanelbulle and irrelevantly, fortune cookies. All of them were delicious…
We passed through the Øresund Bridge which is so impressive, like diving into the middle of the sea. We are surrounded by only blue: sea and sky. Furthermore thanks to our Flixbus Driver, he was playing the Swedish Eurovision song: Loreen — Tatto. It was pretty unforgettable for me since I listened to this song hundreds of times and never thought I would be listening to this in the main country. (I know the photo is not very good, but I recorded videos and enjoyed the moment.)
Overall
Stockholm is so suitable for a student budget. I was expecting extreme prices, but I was wrong. Especially the souvenirs’ and Ikea’s food prices were acceptable. I want to visit Stockholm again with a rich budget and at that time I must stay at least 3 nights, attend to Stockholm Ghost Walk and Historical Tour, go to the Skansen Open Air Museum and ABBA Museum, appreciate subway art, go to Birka the Viking city, having Fika in a warm, cozy place with enjoying the Northern snow.
Regards, Ozlem.

To be honest, I wasn’t too pleased when I saw the temperature in Stockholm was going to be -5 degrees celsius. But I’m not one to turn down an opportunity to experience different cultures and meet new people. The view from the plane window pretty much confirmed that I was in for a cold couple of days. Sweden from the sky was pretty much blanketed in snow, with forests, motorways and buildings adding speckles of colour to the pure white landscape. Stockholm’s temperature was as expected — FREEZING — but admiring the beautiful architecture as we walked to the office made me temporarily forget this fact.
One of the great things about using Slack at Manifest is how it renders borders immaterial. It’s not perfect and working in different time zones does present its challenges, but being able to meet up with a colleague in a different country and pick-up where you left off on Slack is a great plus.
We like to believe everything is better in Sweden, and while that’s mostly true (I say mostly because the weather ain’t better) I have to say, the coffee machine at our Stockholm office is straight out of Star Trek. To hell with cafetieres and capsules, this baby uses an iPad touchscreen to brew you some of the best tasting Americanos I’ve ever had. We need to figure out a way to set one up in London too. It might even make me do a tea round….once or twice.
Our short time in Stockholm was spent darting from meeting to meeting. We had a couple of new business meetings interspersed with meeting existing clients. I’ve got to say, the half day we spent with Houdini was probably the most inspired I’ve been in my five years at Manifest. It’s not often you sit in a room where everyone is extremely passionate about what they do and where they want their company to go. I’m proud to be working with such a visionary brand, and you can bet you’ll hear a lot more from them in the coming months.
I cannot write a blog about Sweden without mentioning delicious Swedish meatballs and aquavit. Aquavit (literal meaning: water of life) is an important part of Scandinavian drinking culture. We were treated to a Swedish folk song by Anna and Josefine before downing a shot of the drink. Much to the surprise of the Swedes, Alex and myself did not seem at all perturbed by the 37% ABV beverage. We both have strong constitutions, and attempting to drink us under the table is never wise.
After meetings were done, I had the opportunity to explore more of Stockholm over the weekend- it’s truly a stunning city, one I hope to be visiting often… during warmer months.
Manifest has offices in Stockholm, London and New York and we’re recruiting. So, if you fancy joining our international family check out our careers page.

I belong in a gang of 4. Four colleagues, friends and something more than that. Anna, the 1/4 of our gang, spent (and she still has a month there) this semester in Stockholm, Sweden, as an Erasmus student.So the rest of us decided to visit her, have some fun all together in Stockholm and discover this Scandinavian city.
I have tons of stories to tell you about that trip, so I’m gonna keep it simple and write about the most important stuff in bulletpoints and also post along some photos we shot so that I give you a better understanding of what was going on.
A typical limo you see in Stockholm

Finally, I have to say that it was an awesome trip overall! Of course this was special for my and my mates, because we were all together, but I bet you’re gonna love this city no matter what!

I’m a US expat living in Stockholm since 2018. Originally lived in central Stockholm, now living in the burbs. A co-worker once asked me for tips on what to do when they were coming over for a visit. I typed up something, and later another and another person asked, each time I pulled up the old doc, and maybe made some additions. On the most recent instance of this, I realized I could probably just publish this for anyone to find.
If I had to narrow it down to 3 easy things, I’d do Moderna Museet (free), Fotografiska (~$20), and a walk through Gamla Stan.
Quick list of things to do:
Museums:
Sightseeing:
Restaurants:Swedish food
Really good sushi
Mexican
Steak
Choose Uber over cabs when in the city (seriously might be faster to take a scooter though 🙃). If you must use a cab only use these companies: Taxi Stockholm 150000, Taxi Kurir, Sverigetaxi. Most of the others will rip you off (my wife got charged $50 for a 8min ride). For getting from the airport, the Arlanda Express is a direct train to central stockholm, that only takes 18 minutes; you can buy the tickets online or at the airport, and you get a big discount for buying them as a group. A cab to/from would be ~30-40min depending on traffic.

Designing with AI: Reflections from a Night with Miro’s CEO in Stockholm,https://medium.com/@ajithachellam/designing-with-ai-reflections-from-a-night-with-miros-ceo-in-stockholm-c5e94f35b368,"Sign up

On Tuesday, 24th of June I attended an intimate fireside chat in Stockholm with Miro CEO Andrey Khusid, alongside Armin Catovic (Head of AI at Aloi and Vice Chair at Stockholm AI) and Elena Verna, Head of Growth at Lovable. Andre spoke about creativity, product leadership, and what it means to build with purpose in the age of AI. This blog is my attempt to capture that moment: for myself, for other designers navigating similar questions, and for anyone trying to make sense of where we’re all headed next.
“It’s a dance. A dance between humans and AI.”
I liked how Andrey used the word dance and not collaborators. It blew my mind when Andrey introduced the new AI features of Miro and introduced this concept of Canvas as a prompt.
“Some of us think in text. Some think in tables. Some in images. Some in handwriting. AI can translate between all these formats.”
It made me reflect on my own process. How often do I get stuck on one way of seeing things — one visual, one narrative, one iteration. This new dance invites us to explore the edges, to try “what if” scenarios we might not have considered. That’s not just productivity. That’s power. It’s not about outsourcing creativity. It’s about augmenting our intuition with speed, synthesis, and scale. And maybe, just maybe, creating space for more meaningful work.
This night wasn’t just about Miro. It was about the larger wave of transformation pulsing through the city, and one of the clearest signals of that was from Lovable. It was exciting to hear from Elena Verna about how Lovable as an entire company is AI-first, not just the product, but the tooling, workflows, culture, and even mindset.
They recently ran a weekend hackathon where anyone could use Lovable’s tools to build with three major LLMs. More than 2.5 million people created something just in a weekend. It was a strong message to startup founders to scale to the top. And simply, people are looking for a simple and easy product when it comes to digital experiences. Lovable is simple and people love it.
And perhaps that’s what makes Stockholm special right now: it’s not just building tools; it’s building momentum. Hmm, what a great time to be here at the center of tech innovation!
When I was working on the book Catch the Feeling, we discussed a lot about ‘sameness’. With AI-generated content, there is a general play of sameness in designs, products and content that is out. With this thought in mind, we had a question from the room,
What happens when everyone uses the same tools, the same AI models, the same prompts? Will we all just end up building the same thing?
Andrey replied,
“What makes the difference, is human empathy, point of view, and taste.”
It can accelerate your process, suggest alternatives, and synthesize patterns, but if you don’t show up with a strong perspective, it’ll just give you more of what everyone else is getting. In a world of infinite output, originality comes from the courage to have a point of view. Being human!
My friend Jaydatta is doing his Master's Thesis about decision making in Swedish startups. We were having a brief discussion about his findings and how actors and factors influence a major decision in a product. Later in the evening, MIRO CEO touched on his decision-making and leadership style.
“I was scared of adding complexity. I didn’t want to overwhelm the user.”
His vision in 2011 was to build the first browser-based whiteboard, and he kept the product as simple as possible. Andre shared how his leadership style had shifted over the years.
From top-down decision-making in the early days, to bottom-up ownership where teams shaped features based on user needs. He held back a key feature, not because they couldn’t build it, but because he believed simplicity was more important. But when the pandemic hit and MIRO was used heavily, he made a drastic shift, focusing on synchronous collaboration.
And now, as Miro matures again, they’re returning to a model where teams can own and shape their areas. But what stays constant, Andre said, is the need for a strong product vision, otherwise, you end up with 25 products inside one. This was a really powerful insight.
There was a question about what are the emerging skills and the right mindset to survive in a transitioning face in tech.
“The companies that thrive will be full of T-shaped people. Those who go deep in one craft, but also know how to connect the dots across disciplines and prompt machines to get the job done.”
That means being a designer who understands marketing. An engineer who thinks in UX. A PM who can sketch a landing page, run a prompt, and launch it in hours. And increasingly, these people won’t be full-time hires. They’ll be fractional experts, brought in for short bursts of high-impact work.
Lovable is already ahead of this curve. With under 50 full-time roles and revenue approaching $100 million, they’re proving what’s possible when AI augments the builders and everyone is trusted to own more.
Andre even predicted something that caught the room off guard: “Compensation will look different. In a few years, the same job title could pay 5x more to the person who brings exponential impact.”
Not because of tenure. But because they know how to leverage tools, think across domains, and ship value fast. The more impact you create in the company, the more compensation!
With big giants in the picture, someone asked a question,
“What if OpenAI builds your product tomorrow and destroys your business?”
Andre simply smiled and said something that brought a lot of hope and smiles in the room.
“We’re not building because we think OpenAI won’t do it. We’re building because we love what we do.”
A truth that often gets lost in metrics, frameworks, and the pressure to always be future-proof. It reminded me that the joy of creation doesn’t disappear just because the landscape changes.
“We might all be a little f**ked,” Andre joked, “but we’re in it together. And we’re still building.” And that, to me, is what this night in Stockholm was about.
Hope it inspired you too, dear reader. Connect with me on LinkedIn to follow my journey.

After many years of choosing busy beach destinations for our summer holidays, this year we decided to embrace the ‘coolcation’ trend and look for an alternative holiday focusing on cooler climates, scenic landscapes, and opportunities for relaxation and mental wellness. If you are also seeking this kind of holiday, then Stockholm should top your bucket list.
Stockholm, the capital of Sweden is a city that beautifully blends innovation, with its rich historical charm. The summer season truly accentuates its allure with extended daylight hours, festivities, nightlife and a bustling ambiance.
We visited Stockholm in June and were fortunate enough to experience some fantastic weather. We chose to stay at the Grand Hôtel, strategically positioned along the waterfront, providing views of both the Royal Palace and Gamla Stan. It served as an excellent base for us to explore all the city’s attractions, the highlights of which are listed below.
What impressed us the most, coming from a Mediterranean country, was the Scandinavian phenomenon of long days. The sun stays up until late into the evening, creating a sense of endless daylight and extending the feeling of a truly prolonged holiday.

The Incredible story of the Vasa and the lessons it teaches us,https://siddharth-ram.medium.com/the-incredible-story-of-the-vasa-and-the-lessons-it-teaches-us-9d7070d5d328,"Sign up

On 10th August, 1628, the Swedish navy launched the maiden voyage of the Vasa .The Vasa was part of the military expansion and an expression of Swedish naval power: It was explicitly built at the order of the King of Sweden Gustavus Adolphus, and was richly decorated to show off Swedish might and wealth. No expense was spared. One of the rooms was made to look like the royal palace. There were numerous Roman statues on board, — King Adolphus was sending a message that ‘hey, Sweden is the modern Roman empire’. Upon completion, it was one of the most powerful armed vessels in the world.
August 10 was a calm day, perfect for a launch, with a light breeze from the southwest. It passed the Royal palace, and the gun ports were opened for a Royal salute. When doing so, a gust of wind -nothing crazy — filled its sails and it heeled to the port. It passed some bluffs to the south (Södermalm, for those familiar with the geography). A little later, at Tegelviken, a stronger gust caused it to again heel to the port side — and went past the point beyond which the ship could right itself. The gun ports were open because 1300 meters past its launch, the Vasa sank, and about 30 people died (it included women and children as well, since it was a ceremonial trip around the harbor). It took all of 5 minutes to sink, and a major reason was the lower gun ports were open and water poured in as it heeled. But more on this later.
The Vasa lay on the bottom of the Stockholm harbor for 333 years, before it was successfully raised and the Vasa museum captures its stunning story of mismanagement, in a fashion eerily similar to mismanagement as seen in some modern software companies. I was lucky enough to have a tour through this museum while on a work trip to Stockholm. I would visit Stockholm again just to go back to the museum (though Stockholm has so much to see and do)
The Vasa’s story serves as a powerful metaphor for modern software companies, particularly in how organizational dynamics can lead to technical disaster. Just as Vasa’s builders continued with a fundamentally flawed design due to royal pressure, software teams sometimes proceed with architectures or technical decisions they know are problematic due to executive mandates or market pressures. The tragic part of Vasa’s story is that it was known that it was unlikely to survive its launch. In 1628, the captain arranged for the Vice Admiral to demonstrate its stability. 30 men ran back and forth across the upper deck, and the ship started to roll. The Admiral stopped the test because he was afraid the ship would capsize in the harbor. Does this sound familiar to anyone?
Consider how often we see software projects that are “too big to fail” — platforms or products that have had so much investment and executive attention that stopping to address fundamental issues becomes politically impossible. Like the Vasa’s gun ports being open for a royal salute (a political requirement) directly contributing to its sinking, we often see technical compromises made for business optics that ultimately undermine the product’s stability.
The parallel extends to modern engineering organizations where technical experts — much like the shipbuilders of the Vasa — might recognize fundamental flaws but feel unable to effectively raise these concerns up the chain of command. In both cases, the culture of deference to authority and the pressure to deliver can override technical wisdom. Today’s “royal demands” might come in the form of arbitrary deadlines, feature requirements that compromise system stability, or architectural decisions made to align with executive presentations rather than engineering realities. There is a tendency to ‘drift to failure’ in organizations that show up only when it blows up in their faces.
Most tellingly, just as the Vasa’s builders had proven experience with smaller ships but ran into trouble when scaling up to a larger, more complex vessel, software companies often face challenges when scaling from successful smaller systems to more complex platforms. The same principles that worked at a smaller scale can become catastrophic liabilities when applied without adaptation to larger, more complex systems.
This is a standard practice in product development (my writeup on it can be read here). Well, certainly at every place where I had influence over the process. It is entertaining to turn the 5 Why’s framework on the Vasa to get to root cause: King Adolphus was furious, of course, and the loss of his statement piece, and the loss of the many cannons that were on the Vasa (2 gun decks that can be seen in the photo above — it had 64 cannons). There was a royal inquiry, and no one was found guilty — it would be foolhardy — deadly — to point the finger at the king, who was responsible for the tragedy.
So what would the 5 Why’s for the Vasa look like?
The ship capsized and sank about 1,300 meters into its maiden voyage in Stockholm harbor on August 10, 1628. A light gust of wind caused it to heel (tilt) severely to port. Water rushed through the open gun ports, which were only 1.2 meters above the waterline, flooding the ship and causing it to sink within minutes.
The Vasa was dangerously unstable due to its top-heavy design. The ship carried 64 heavy bronze cannons, mostly on the upper gun deck. More critically, the ship’s ballast (72 tonnes) was insufficient to counterbalance the weight of the upper structure, guns, and heavy decorative sculptures. Stability tests before launch showed the ship was dangerously unstable — it heeled severely when just 30 men ran from side to side.
Despite shipbuilder Jakobsson noting the stability problems during construction, and despite a stability test where the ship dangerously heeled, no significant changes were made. Admiral Fleming, who oversaw the test, feared reporting the full extent of the problems to the king. The shipbuilders and naval officers knew of the issues but proceeded with the launch anyway.
In Swedish society under King Adolphus, challenging royal authority was unthinkable. (Note: This is of course not particular to Swedish culture). The king had personally ordered multiple changes during construction, including the second gun deck and additional heavy bronze cannons. He was deeply involved in the design, viewing the Vasa as a symbol of Swedish naval power. No one, including the shipwright, dared question the kings demands.
Sweden in the 1620s operated under absolute monarchy where the king’s word was literally law. King Adolphus had transformed Sweden into a major military power, leading successful campaigns in the Thirty Years’ War. The hierarchical culture of 17th-century Sweden, combined with the king’s reputation as a militant leader, created an environment where professional expertise was subordinate to royal authority. There was no cultural framework for “speaking truth to power” — the concept itself would have been alien to most 17th-century Swedes.
The fundamental issue was a cultural environment that prioritized deference to authority over technical expertise and safety concerns. This cultural dynamic made it impossible for technical experts to effectively challenge decisions that compromised the ship’s safety, even when they recognized the dangers.
The tragic irony is that Adolphus, despite his direct involvement in the ship’s design changes, never saw the Vasa — he was away on campaign in Poland when it sank. The culture of absolute deference to royal authority operated even in his absence, preventing necessary corrections to a fatally flawed design.
Well, that is the Vasa. And we have many modern day examples. I’d love to hear about your experiences!

Stockholm. A city I had heard of since childhood.
I associated its name with major international agreements, particularly the Stockholm Declaration of 1972 — the very first large-scale world conference to make the environment as a major global issue. It marked the beginning of international environmental governance and laid the foundation for what would later become the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This conference shaped the world’s approach to sustainability and climate action, yet I never imagined that one day, I would walk its very streets where such historic discussions took place.
Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would experience this city firsthand. It still feels surreal that I am here.
What struck me the most when I arrived was the contrast — the weather, the atmosphere, the way of life. Coming from Indonesia, where temperatures soar to 35°C with high humidity, adjusting to Stockholm’s crisp air and freezing winters was a challenge. Even in summer, I find myself trembling while Swedes enjoy the sunshine in shorts and tank tops. The shift from tropical heat to below-zero temperatures was an entirely new physical adjustments and rhythm of life.
But despite the cold, I fell in love with this city. There is a sense of calm, an unspoken rhythm that blends modernity with nature. Stockholm moves at its own pace — not too fast, not too slow.
And then, there’s Fika — the Swedish tradition of taking a break over coffee and pastries. At first, I thought it was just a casual coffee break, but I soon realized it’s much more than that. It’s a moment of pause, of connection, of simply being present. In a world that constantly pushes us to be productive, Fika is a reminder that it’s okay to slow down. This ties into something else I admire about Sweden — their emphasis on work-life balance. Here, taking a break is not seen as laziness but as an essential part of life. People respect their time off, and there is an understanding that rest is just as important as work.
The other thing that fascinated me was the language. The moment I heard Swedes casually chatting in their melodic Swedish, I felt a strange excitement. It was unfamiliar yet intriguing.
But, beyond the language, what truly inspires me about Sweden is its commitment to sustainability. Swedes don’t just talk about being environmentally friendly; they integrate it into their daily lives. Recycling, efficient public transport, and waste reduction are not just trends but ingrained habits. It’s no surprise that the world’s first environmental conference was held in Stockholm in 1972, leading to the establishment of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).
One of the biggest realizations I had was about landfills. My perspective on landfills was shaped by what I had seen in Indonesia, where waste management remains a major challenge. Landfills there often emit a strong odor, appear overwhelming, and lack proper handling. But here, it feels different — the landfill doesn’t smell as strong, the area is well-managed, and waste is systematically processed.
I also learned a lot about organic waste. If we truly want to combat climate change, organic waste should never end up in landfills. Food waste releases methane, a greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide. This realization made me see how small actions — like composting or waste sorting — suddenly felt much more significant.
Living in Stockholm has made me reflect on many things. It has challenged my habits, reshaped my mindset, and broadened my perspective. I’ve learned to embrace silence and to enjoy solitude without feeling lonely. I’ve come to appreciate the power of simplicity — how less can be more and how slowing down can actually bring more meaning.
Nonetheless, this is just the beginning of my journey in Stockholm.
— Fingers crossed for what the future has in store! ❤

Report of the Go Global Mission to Stockholm (25 - 28 October 2017)
As an entrepreneur, it is important to broaden your perspectives and keep an eye out on the world, even more so in this digital world we live and work in every day. Hence, I was very excited to join the Go Global Mission to Stockholm, an organization of startups.be and Jong VOKA Oost-Vlaanderen.
Sweden has been an inspiration for me ever since I became involved with technology and startups. The country has an impressive track record: after Silicon Valley, Sweden has the highest number of unicorns per head of population in the world. Iconic companies like Skype (sold to Microsoft), King (the maker of Candy Crush, IPO), Mojang (the company behind Minecraft, sold to Microsoft) and Spotify (you know Spotify), have all been founded in this Nordic country.
How is this possible? What are the reasons behind Sweden’s overwhelming success? Is this story future proof? 3 days in the country’s lovely capital Stockholm would provide all the answers.
A 2 hour flight from Brussels led us to Bromma, a cozy airport about 20 minutes from downtown Stockholm. Hard to imagine this is the main entrance to a European capital where so much value has been created over the past decade.
First stop on our trip was the Stockholm Fintech Hub, a huge co-working space located conveniently above Stockholm’s central train station. Besides the fancy decoration, I noticed a couple of interesting things here:
Off to a good start!
Our visit to Invest Stockholm gave us a lot of insights on the success of Stockholm. The seeds of the Swedish tech boom were planted in the 90s, when the government subsidized the required infrastructure for the digital age.
First, every household in Sweden was granted a personal computer. Every successful tech entrepreneur of today grew up with a PC! Digital natives avant la lettre.
Second, almost every household in Sweden has fiber internet access. Hard to imagine in Belgium, where to this day the public and private sector are still arguing who is going to make the required investments.
It is clear that government initiatives in the nineties have laid the foundations for the incredible success of the past decade.
The impact of these exits cannot be underestimated. As often happens with successful entrepreneurs, they do not rest on their laurels. After selling Skype, Niklas Zennström went on to found Atomico, now one of the most famous venture capital firms in Europe. Same goes for the founders of King with their fund Sweet Capital.
As a result, there is plenty of capital available to invest in promising startups that might become the unicorns of the coming decade. Success often creates even more success. The future of the Swedish tech ecosystem seems bright.
Some (fun) facts about Sweden:
Day 2 started with the highlight of our trip: a visit to Spotify. The music streaming service has over 50 million paying subscribers and is valued at 16 Bio USD in the private markets. Even though it is still making a loss, it is reportedly preparing its long-awaited IPO for somewhere mid 2018.
Spotify is one of those iconic tech companies of this age. The company, led by the enigmatic founder Daniel Ek, has proven to be an exceptional innovator on multiple levels:
1) Business model innovation: in the wake of illegal P2P networks like Napster and Kazaa, Spotify sought to find a legitimate way to revolutionize the music industry.
2) Technical innovation: the secret sauce to Spotify’s early success was the incredibly fast loading of songs. This was an engineering challenge of enormous size and difficulty. The majority of people at Spotify are still deep tech engineers working to make sure load times stay at this amazing level, even at such a huge scale.
3) Organizational innovation: much has been written and said about Spotify’s organizational model. The concepts of autonomous teams (grouped in squads, tribes & alliances), the agile way of working, the flat organization, … have been widely documented and copied by other tech startups. Many attribute the success of Spotify to this special culture of continuous experimentation and improvement, cultivated by the founders from day 1.
It will be very interesting to see what happens to this culture when Spotify goes public. Not making a profit yet, investor pressure might force it to tighten reigns and start cutting costs.
Later, we paid a visit to Detectify, whose founder notoriously hacked Google and got access to a huge amount of customer data. He received a bounty of 10.000 USD and went on to start a successful company in ethical hacking.
I arrived at the hotel at around 10 pm. Having some energy left in the tank, I put on my running shoes. I really enjoy jogging in big cities. Since there is always something new to discover, you hardly notice you are running after a while.
I ran to the Gamla Stan island where I accidentally bumped into the changing of the guards routine at the royal palace. Quite hilarious and way over the top if you ask me!
This run wasn’t only for sightseeing, though. Last week, I decided I am going to run my first marathon in 2018! There you go, the word is out, no coming back to it now. I couldn’t really miss the second training on my schedule, right…
Day 3 started at Klarna, another Swedish unicorn, active in online payment processing. A couple of years ago, it also received a banking license. We got a presentation about the major branding exercise this company had undertaken earlier this year. The result was fascinating: from a dull banking brand to an extravagant colorful identity. Klarna wants to be a bank focused on the consumer’s experience, not on its own payments product. It definitely stands out in its sector with this bold and brave move I can only applaud.
Next stop was the Goodbye Kansas Gaming Studio. Stockholm has an enormous amount of talented gaming engineers, resulting in big hits like Minecraft, Candy Crush Saga, Angry Birds 2 and a host of other console and PC titles. We were told the long dark nights might have something to do with this.
Final stop was at EQT Ventures, one of the top tier venture firms in the Nordics. EQT Ventures is owned by Sweden’s wealthiest family, the Wallenbergs. Over the past century (!), the Wallenbergs have accumulated an enormous portfolio of global industrial players, including Electrolux, Atlas Copco, ABB, SEB, SKF, … to name a few. Add Volvo, Scania and IKEA to the Sweden’s list and you get a sense of how many successful international corporations this country produces. Same goes for its music industry: ABBA, Roxette, Ace of Base, Europe … and more recently Avicii, Robyn, Swedish House Mafia. Due to the small internal market, anyone aspiring a big entrepreneurial or artistic career just has to move abroad as soon as possible.
EQT Ventures is the venture capital firm of the Wallenberg conglomerate. Besides funding (with its 565 Mio EUR investment vehicle), it also offers active guidance to its entrepreneurs (growth, engineering, marketing,…).
EQT Ventures invests in scale-ups that have reached product market fit and about 100k MRR. It sweet spot investment size is between 8 and 10 Million EUR.
EQT gave us a demo of their internal data processing tool called Motherbrain. This platform gathers all publicly available data on technology companies (e.g. Crunchbase, Pitchbook data,..) and enriches them by adding trends in social media activity, number of followers, press coverage, … EQT believes this gives them a competitive advantage in discovering promising startups earlier and getting into deals faster.
4 startups had the opportunity to present their company:
The trip ended with a nice dinner in the city center of Sweden’s lovely capital.
My key takeaways from this Go Global Mission to Stockholm:
Looking forward to getting back into the action at Hyperlane on Monday, fully energized and inspired by 3 awesome days.

This is not just a political reckoning. It is a personal one.
I come from survivors — not only of the Holocaust itself, but of the moral disorientation it left behind. My father escaped Nazi Germany on the last Kindertransport to London. He later carried messages between generals after landing on Normandy Beach, speaking the languages of both the oppressed and the empire. My grandfather survived by finding refuge in Sweden. My lineage is braided with escape, resilience, and silence.
And now, I speak to honor them. To wrest history from the hands of fear.
To advocate for a universalist, justice-rooted Judaism in today’s climate is to invite pushback — from within our communities. These pushbacks do not always come from cruelty. They often come from heartbreak. They come from those who believe they are defending Jewish life, when in fact they may be protecting Jewish trauma from healing and perpetuating animosity worldwide.
To walk into this conversation, we must understand the language of fear — not to be manipulated by it, but to meet it with truth.
Here are five of the most common arguments used to reject a Judaism of shared humanity and prophetic conscience. Then we will reconstruct the machinery of propaganda as it is deployed, in order to disarm it with truth. Then a short and printable “pocket guide” to help us return to our core teachings.
They are not caricatures. They are cries. And if we are to become the choosing ones — not merely the chosen — we must listen with clarity, respond with compassion, and never forget: Again and again and again, Never Again must mean never for anyone...for everyone.
Let us begin where our ancestors survived — but refuse to end there.
Understanding the counterarguments made by fear-based ethnocentric voices — particularly those within Jewish communities that resist universalist interpretations — is essential for both refining your own position and preparing for meaningful dialogue.
Here are five of the most common arguments used by fear-based ethnocentrists to dismiss or dismantle the kind of covenantal, universalist Judaism I advocate:
1. The “Survival First” Argument
Claim: Before we can worry about others, we must secure the survival of the Jewish people. We are always one catastrophe away from annihilation.
Key Points:
Response:
This argument exploits trauma to justify ongoing preemptive dominance. It conflates existential threats with political criticism and flattens time, as if Pharaoh, Hitler, and any current dissenter are interchangeable. It demands eternal victimhood even when Jews wield state or institutional power.
2. The “Particularism is Not a Sin” Argument
Claim: Every nation puts itself first — why should Jews be held to a higher moral standard?
Key Points:
Response:
This argument deliberately ignores that Jewish ethics — rooted in Torah, prophets, and rabbinic tradition — do demand more. It erases the prophetic voice of justice. It also neglects the fact that being a light to the nations (Isaiah 49:6) is not optional in Judaism — it’s core.
3. The “You Don’t Understand Realpolitik” Argument
Claim: Your argument is philosophically interesting but politically dangerous. The world is not a yeshiva or a seminar. We must protect ourselves with strength, not sermons.
Key Points:
Response:
This response uses cynicism to neutralize ethics. It assumes power and moral courage are mutually exclusive. In reality, prophetic leadership has always been a countercultural phenomenon. Moses, Isaiah, and Heschel all spoke into power from a place of moral clarity, not political comfort.
4. The “We Tried Peace, It Didn’t Work” Argument
Claim: We gave land for peace. We made offers. We withdrew. And what did it get us? Rockets. Stabbings. Terror. You’re asking us to endanger our children.
Key Points:
Response:
This is trauma talking — but selectively. It collapses decades of failed diplomacy, settler expansion, and blockade into a single defensive narrative. While security is valid, it cannot be divorced from justice — and justice requires that we confront the history we created, not just the history done to us.
5. The “Self-Hating Jew” Accusation
Claim: Jews who criticize Israel or prioritize universal ethics over Jewish solidarity are internalizing antisemitic narratives. You’re aiding our enemies.
Key Points:
Response:
This is emotional blackmail disguised as community protection. It conflates dissent with betrayal. In truth, ethical critique is an ancient Jewish tradition — from Abraham arguing with God to Jeremiah lamenting corruption in Jerusalem. To speak truth to Jewish power is not betrayal; it is fidelity.
If one were trying to design a manipulative, propagandistic narrative in support of a fear-based ethnocentric worldview, one would need to activate collective trauma, moral inversion, and identity loyalty. The goal is not truth, but emotional certainty, enemy construction, and justified power.
Here are 10 potent narrative devices — some are outright lies, some half-truths, and all are repeated enough to feel self-evident.
They may sound familiar.
1. “We are the eternal victim.”
No one has suffered like us. No one ever will. We are history’s permanent target.
2. “They all want to kill us — again.”
Scratch any critic, and you’ll find a hidden antisemite.
3. “Survival justifies anything.”
If we don’t do this, we won’t exist tomorrow. That’s just how it is.
4. “Our power is only defensive.”
When we act, it’s because we were provoked. When we strike, it’s because we had no choice.
5. “There are no civilians among them.”
They are all complicit — every man, woman, and child. They elected terrorists. They cheer death.
6. “We already tried peace. They spat in our face.”
We offered everything. They gave us rockets. What more proof do you need?
7. “Anyone who criticizes us wants us destroyed.”
You say ‘human rights,’ but you mean ‘our extinction.’
8. “We are the West’s last line of defense.”
Support us, or terrorism wins. We are your moral outpost.
9. “We speak for all Jews.”
If you oppose us, you’re not one of us. You’re self-hating or brainwashed.
10. “History has absolved us.”
After what was done to us, we’ve earned the right to do whatever is necessary.
Repetition and Ritual
These ideas are not just said. They’re:
The Manipulation Goal:
Make it emotionally intolerable — even existentially traitorous — for someone to:
In case you want to have a conscious way to reject manipulation here’s a pocket-sized pamphlet — concise, powerful, and portable — designed to interrupt propaganda in real time and rekindle moral clarity when fear-based ethnocentric messaging is heard. Copy and print it and put it anywhere you want to remain a thinking and feeling human being, grounded in Judaism's highest teachings.
Spotting Propaganda. Reclaiming Conscience.
WHEN YOU HEAR:
“We’re the eternal victim.”
ASK YOURSELF: Is this invoking history to justify current harm?
“They all want to kill us.”
REMEMBER: Fear paints everyone an enemy. But fear is not truth.
“Survival justifies anything.”
TRUTH: Freedom without ethics is just a new kind of Pharaoh.
“They don’t value life like we do.”
DANGER: That’s dehumanization. The oldest lie used to justify violence.
“We tried peace. They gave us terror.”
PAUSE: Did we try peace — or control disguised as peace?
“Everyone’s a terrorist over there.”
FACT: Blanket blame is genocide’s gateway.
“Critics are antisemitic.”
NO. Ethics ≠ hate. Dissent ≠ betrayal.
“We’re defending civilization.”
WATCH OUT: That’s colonial language. That’s empire talking.
“We speak for all Jews.”
YOU KNOW: No one speaks for all of us. Judaism is not a monolith. Never was.
“History has absolved us.”
NEVER. No past horror gives license to inflict one.
INSTEAD, REMEMBER:
“We were slaves in Egypt…” Not to become Pharaohs, but to never be one.
“You shall not oppress the stranger…” Not once — but 36 times. That’s covenant.
“We are not free until all are free.” That’s Judaism at its best. That’s how you know.
Carry this not as a weapon, but as an anchor. So when fear speaks, you remember:
“Justice, justice shall you pursue.”
(Even when it costs. Especially when it costs.)

This is my 28-day journey of living a temporary life in Helsinki, Tallinn, Stockholm, and Copenhagen.
🇸🇪 August 4, 2019
It’s very lucky to have a friend who lives in Stockholm. Jimmie was one of my classmates when I was in San Francisco. He is a writer and a freelance journalist. After leaving San Francisco, I’ve kept in touch with him on Facebook. And luckily I had a chance to visit Stockholm and saw him again.
Thanks to Jimmie, I could visit a beautiful island, Vaxholm in Sweden. It is not far from Stockholm, but it is not easy to get there by public transportation. We went outside of Stockholm by car, arrived at a town with a small dock, and waited for a public ship that moves cars from islands to islands. Because there are no bridges between islands in some places, so the ship plays a role as a bridge. We got on a ship, crossed a bay and got to Vaxholm.
Vaxholm looks like a small town in the countryside. It was a military fortress in the 16th century like Suomenlinna in Finland, but now it is one of the tourist attractions for hiking, camping, or just relaxing. We stopped by a small cafe and had Swedish Fika(coffee) and cinnamon rolls. They tasted really good. We looked around the island by driving and walking.
Vaxholm, this is the place that I have been looking for!! A calm and peaceful place. There are some stores for convenience but not many. There are some people, but it was not crowded. I can go hiking, sailing, fishing, swimming or camping. Or I can just take a walk along the coast. It’s the best place to relax. I wanted to stay more, but I should go back to Stockholm for tomorrow’s new adventure. I just left my heart in Vaxholm.
The more I stay, the more I like Sweden, maybe more than Tallinn. Sorry, Tallinn.

At first glance, it looked just like any suburban street in Sweden. The houses were similar; compact but well-designed with sharp corners and adorned with perfectly manicured lawns. The sidewalks did not have a crack in them and the cars parked next to it were modestly luxurious; not flashy Ferraris but rather fully accessorized Audis.
As we rounded a corner, we came into a small outdoor shopping complex akin to an American strip mall but without the decadent vibes. There were a multitude of real estate agencies, including Skandia Mäklarna, showing off the latest hot properties on the market with pools and staggeringly high prices on the corner of the posters.
The local branch of Handelsbanken was closed but its ATM seemed to be functioning, although nobody lined up because cash is essentially extinct as far as Swedes are concerned. A hip brunch spot — the type where you overpay for a cortado, complain about it but continue going to be seen — was also already closed but we noted it for our next breakfast.
On the other end of the complex was a small independent supermarket called Spisa with…

Thinking about traveling to Stockholm? Here’s the only guide you’ll need to avoid the notorious taxi scams that have tripped up even seasoned travelers.
I’d like to say I’m a savvy traveler, with 35 years of globetrotting experience under my belt.
I know the usual tricks — check prices online, avoid unsolicited “cheap” rides, stick to the designated taxi zones, and confirm the fare in advance.
I had done my homework, read all the guides, and felt confident about getting around Stockholm safely.
But what should’ve been a routine taxi ride quickly turned into a high-stakes lesson in navigating travel scams.
The moment I stepped into that “official” taxi queue, I had no idea I was about to become the latest victim of a meticulously organized setup.
I’m sharing my story to help you avoid the same trap and keep your Stockholm adventure as memorable as mine should have been.

Stockholm is arguably one of the world’s most beautiful capitals. It is built on 14 islands around medieval city center and is located where the freshwater Lake Mälaren flows out into the Baltic Sea. Stockholm is the most populous city in the Scandinavia, with 2.2 million people living in the metropolitan area. Running in Stockholm is a treat, given the water, unique geography, and well laid out pedestrian and recreational paths. The Stockholm Marathon is claimed to have one of the most beautiful marathon routes in the world.
The best running routes in Stockholm are defined by scenic paths along the waterfront, across bridges to the islands, and some lovely green spaces. We also have some routes that combine some of the main Stockholm sights with some pleasant parks and urban highlights. Stockholm has an excellent public transportation system consisting of bus, tram, local train (pendeltåg) and subway (tunnelbana; look for a T-sign).
One of the defining elements of running in Stockholm is its latitude. In summer, running late at night is a particular treat due to 18+hours of daylight. In winter, Stockholm makes up for short days in part by providing good lighting along most of its paths. Despite its northern location, Stockholm has relatively mild weather compared to other locations at similar latitude, or even farther south — receiving more sunshine per year than Paris or London, but also precipitation on about half the days through the year. It can snow from November to April, and winter running will likely involve snow or ice so bring your Yak-Traks. Summers are mild but rarely warm. You’ll almost always need an extra later for morning runs, even in July.

5.5-mile loop. Accessible any point in downtown. MAP
This route covers some of the main sights of the city, with lots of folks out walking and running. Much of the route is along the water and over bridges to two islands. Start your run at Gustav Adolfs square, next to the Royal Opera House. Head to Gamla Stan (Old Town) and pass Riksdagshuset where the Swedish Parliament is situated, as well as, the Royal Palace — His Majesty The King’s official residence. Enjoy the views of the idyllic Gamla Stan while you run south towards Södermalm island. Head west along the waterfront all the way to Långholmen, which is a former prison island, and currently one of Stockholm’s green oases. Cross the bridge to Kungsholmen island and head back east. You will pass another main sight, Stadthus (City Hall), which is also the venue of the annual Nobel Prize banquet. Complete the loop at Gustav Adolfs square.
7.2-mile loop. Access: several subways or buses to Slussen stop. MAP
Södermalm, or Söder as locals call it, is an island in south Stockholm. The vibe in Södermalm is relaxed and trendy, and it was selected as the coolest neighborhood in Europe by Vogue magazine in 2014. Running a loop around the island is a treat. Start your run at Södermalm market square which is easily accessible by public transportation (Slussen stop). Head west and enjoy views in Montelusvägen — a walking path looking over the waterfront to Kungsholmen. Continue further west and climb to Skinnarviksberget, a hill offering another breathtaking view over the city. Run to waterfront and make a loop around the island. Probably the most scenic parts of the loop are a path from Tantolunden in the west to Eriksdalsbadet in the south, and northeast area of the island when you run along the waterfront with Gamla Stan on your right.
5.2-mile loop. Start: Djurgårdsbron Bridge. Access: Bus 76 from downtown. MAP
Djurgården is a green and idyllic island close to central Stockholm, offering a beautiful setting for running. Its official name Kungliga Djurgården means Royal Game Park and it is one of the most popular recreation areas of the city. Start your run at Djurgårdsbron bridge and head east along the canal all the way to Lilla Sjötullsbron bridge. Cross the bridge to south and enter Djurgården island where you will pass scenic green areas and several historical buildings and monuments, the Vasa museum, art galleries, and the popular amusement park Gröna Lund. In the interior of the island is Royal Djurgården, which has gravel, more forested paths that can be a nice add-on.
8.1-mile loop. Access: bus 515 MAP
Hagaparken — a lovely green park about 5km north of the city — is a popular running destination any time of year. The park offers several scenic running paths. The best option is to make a loop along around Brunnsviken lake. Hagaparken is Sweden’s purest version of an ‘English park’, and the surrounding area contains three royal palaces. Probably the most famous building is Haga Palace where Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden, and her husband, Prince Daniel, Duke of Västergötland, moved shortly after their wedding in 2010.
5.6-mile loop. Access: any bus, tram or subway to Central Station MAP
Kungsholmen is a residential island where also the most prominent building of the Stockholm skyline and the venue of the annual Nobel Prize banquet, City Hall, is located. It is also another great running location. A good option to start your run is near Central Station. Head south and you will see Gamla Stan on the other side of waterfront. After passing the City Hall, continue west along the waterfront. Other highlights are a beautiful park called Rålambshovsparken and the inner city beach Smedsuddsbadet on the south side of the island, and Hornsbergs Strand on the north side. Most of the run is along the water.
Hellasgården is a nice recreation area offering several running trails in the woods and along the Källtorpssjön lake. It is located about 20 minutes by bus from downtown Stockholm — take bus 401 from Slussen to the Hellasgården stop in Älta. There are also excellent refreshment possibilities after your run, or options for a sauna or enjoying a sandy beach. See our 5.1 mile route here. Some of the trails have lights but note that in winter season, some of the trails are kept clean from snow while others are used for skiing, thus not suitable for running. See additional information here.
Stockholm has a wide selection of hotels in the downtown area and all of our iconic routes are located within a few mile radius. To have a fast access to the Stockholm Highlights loop, Djurgården and Södermalm routes, look for hotels in Östermalm and Gamla Stan areas. If you want to stay closer to Hagaparken route, then the Vasastan is a good option. It is still very close to Central loop and Södermalm routes, but a bit further from Djurgården. In addition to big international chains see also the following options:
Radisson Blu. Chain of well equipped hotels. Several locations in downtown.
Scandic. Another chain, several locations in downtown.
Nordic Light Hotel. A nice hotel with great location.
Runner’s Store is the biggest running specialty store in Sweden. Located downtown.
Löplabbet is another running specialty store with knowledgeable staff.
XXL. Price-driven big box retailer which has disrupted Scandinavian sporting goods retailers recently. One location in downtown on Hamngatan, another in Bromma airport.
Asics Flagship Store located in downtown on Hamngatan
Run With Me Stockholm offers a variety of private guided running tours covering main sights and attractions of the city. Has free group runs, too.
Stockholm Running Tours is another group combining sightseeing and running.
Nike+ Run Club offers several group runs to runners of all speeds.
Hash House Harriers is a Stockholm chapter of this globally spread “Drinking club with a running problem”. Meets every Wednesday night and every second Saturday afternoon for running, beer and fun.
Stockholm Frontrunners is running and walking group for LGBTQ people and their friends. Meets every Tuesday for group runs.
Stockholm Marathon is the main marathon race in the city, taking place annually late May or early June. Consists of two loops around the city and the finishing line is located on track of the Olympic Stadium.
Stockholm Half Marathon. September. This race has been in its current form since 2007 but its roots date to the 1920's.
Midnattsloppet. August. The “midnight run”, is a 10k race which has been run in Stockholm since 1982. As the name suggests, around 20,000 runners hit the streets of the city after the sunset. The same event is organized annually also in Malmö, Göteborg and Helsinki.
Women’s Health Half Marathon is the biggest half marathon exclusively for women in Europe. Offers also a possibility to run as a pair and split the distance with your friend. Website available only in Swedish — to learn more in English, contact whhm@marathon.se

Who do so many employees fall in love with their companies and practices, even the most terrible ones?
If you’re not familiar with Stockholm Syndrome then you’ve either never been held captive by an agile cell of fervent evangelists, wielding a full set of colourful whiteboard markers, in the company boardroom, you’ve never encountered a technical problem so difficult that you considered bailing out doing a PMP¹ course instead, or perhaps you’ve never had the financial pressure to keep a job you absolutely hate.
And, fellow player in the Grand Game of Software Engineering, even if you did, I have total faith that you wouldn’t give in to your captors.
You see, it’s survival of the fittest out there on the board — meaning it’s those that are technically competent, don’t have a strange love of garments woven from man made fibres, and those who know that management means having an irreversible frontal lobotomy (with a laminated certificate to prove it) and inevitable crossing to the other side of the board that will survive.
We all encounter those that have been summarily brainwashed every now and again in the Grand Game. Whether they’re seen to be repeatedly donning company merch unnecessarily², whether they spend their time organising (i.e. micromanaging) others unnecessarily, or just won’t have a word spoken against…

Stockholm syndrome is often defined as when a hostage develops an empathetic psychological connection with their captor. The reason this happens (as clearly, the hostage is the victim) is that the hostage subconsciously figures out, as seems reasonable, that if they are nice to their captors, they will receive better treatment in exchange. And that’s true.
An easy reference to this is the trope of the “Uncle Tom” in African American slave life during American slavery. During American slavery, certain slaves were mentally trained that if they accepted their slavery, and willingly worked with their master, they would receive better treatment in exchange. And said slaves bought into this, and cooperated in exchange for said better treatment. The African American community now refers to such slaves as “Uncle Toms”.
I propose that the process by which Stockholm syndrome sets in subconsciously, is a tool that ministers of faith use consciously to trick those in their congregation into becoming ardent followers of their own supposed volition.
I’ll explain. When a person enters a church community, they are usually doing it simply for the community at first. A community is a small society. And the smaller the society, the more socialist the society. This is why socialism works well in small countries. The…

My trip started from Turku to Stockholm via the Viking Glory, which is a cruise ferry that runs between Turku-Åland and Islands-Stockholm. Before arriving in Stockholm, I strongly recommend buying a Go City Pass (Stockholm Pass). It includes 50+ attractions, ranging from Museums, Skansen, and Boat tours. You can buy a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5-day pass from SEK 824 (71 €) to SEK 1,899 (162 €) — depending on the validity period. Once you bought the pass, download the Go City app, and you can show the QR code to attractions that are included in the pass to explore the city.
The Go City Pass includes: (More on the official Website) 📱
…
⚠️Not all the attractions are open all year round, for example, the Drottningholm Palace was closed from December 11th — December 30th, 2023, so you may not be able to get in if you go there during the Christmas Season. Same for the Stockholm Winter Tour by Boat, of course, it is only available during the winter season, but there is another boat tour available at other times of the year as well. (I highly recommended the Winter Boat Tour 🛥️)
💰Compile attractions that can be accessed free by the pass in two or three days to save money.
Note that the Go City Pass does not include public transportation unlike the Oslo Pass, so please remember to buy Travelcards if you want to explore the city without limitations. (You can get a discount if you are over 65 years of age, a student holding a Swedish student ID, or if you are under 20 years of age😊). The Travelcards are available on the smartphone app “SL-Journey Planner Ticket” and you can get on the tram, subway, bus, or commuter train within the validity period. 🚌
When you hop on a bus, you need to show the code to the driver, and you need the code for the subway (Marked as Ⓣ) as well. However, for the tram, you can just simply hop on and off!
I would say the subway and the tram are the most common transportation that I used during my stay.

Five years ago, my brother sent me a link to a YouTube video. “This is awesome,” he texted. When I clicked it, I was baffled: it was a clip of a song-and-dance number on a football field from Fox’s series Glee (2009–15).
I didn’t get it: why he loved it, or why he was sharing it with me. After all, this was my brother — a first-born, take-charge, cut-the-bullshit engineer, and he really, really wanted me to see a clip from Glee? Maybe, I thought, he accidently pasted the wrong link?
What I didn't appreciate back then was that he was living at home with two teenage girls. He was outnumbered three-to-one by women. His view of the world, pop culture, and entertainment was distorted day after day to the point where he didn’t realize what had happened. He was a victim of Parental Stockholm Syndrome.
Classic Stockholm Syndrome refers to “a psychological phenomenon in which hostages express empathy and sympathy and have positive feelings toward their captors, sometimes to the point of defending and identifying with the captors.” It was inspired by a Stockholm bank robbery in 1973, during which hostages inside the bank gradually came to defend the criminals who took them hostage.
Parental Stockholm Syndrome is the same thing, except instead of being victims of a bank robbery held at gunpoint, it applies to parents held captive to shows like Glee as well as TV channels like Disney Junior and PBS Kids.
This is a real condition. I know, because I suffer from Parental Stockholm Syndrome.
I've actually said these things in the past year:
If I didn't live with two little girls — ages seven and five — I wouldn't be able to distinguish Periwinkle, a brave Winter fairy, from Rosetta, a plucky gardening fairy with a classic Southern accent. I also wouldn't have strong feelings about the sharp decline in the writing of Dora the Explorer (2000- ) after season two. And I never would have walked around the gym humming to myself the national anthem of Enchancia.
You can resist, but it’s inevitable. When you become a parent, you don’t just bring children into your world; they pull you into theirs.
Try as I might to get them to love things I love — DC Comics, Chicago-style pizza, Texas Hold’em, and North Carolina basketball — they want me to sit with them and enjoy the things they love: Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood (2012- ), Pinkalicious, and almost any movie about mermaids.
I might fight it, clinging to the adult world I left nearly eight years ago, struggling to maintain the illusion that I'm not captive to the passions and imaginations of two little girls. Or I can sit back, let go, and allow myself to tear up when Rapunzel is finally reunited with her parents at the top of the castle.

So, I realise as I write this that my last blog post was about an ECR event at the University of Stirling, arranged by the British Society of Gerontology’s Emerging Researcher’s in Ageing group (ERA). Ironic then, that I am writing this blog post in a former prison in Stockholm, on an ERA Writing Retreat at Långholmen!
The writing retreat, which I’ll write up in a separate post, was scheduled for Wednesday to Friday, so my brain quickly went into planning a research trip around it. Who might I be able to speak to at museums or universities in Stockholm about my research and practice at the Fitzwilliam Museum? And what might I learn about Nordic practice? I did some desk-top research, wrote some emails, and before I knew it, I had conjured up a plan for a research trip! And again, I was visiting a place I hadn’t been to before, so this was exciting…
Arriving on Saturday afternoon, I was able to spend the weekend strolling around the city (which was freezing!), being a tourist in a new city. I took an archipelago boat tour on Sunday morning, followed up by a visit to the Vasa Museet — the museum that I was told was one not to be missed! It was here that I was reminded that I am now unable to visit a museum without stepping into research mode…
The museum is vast — with many floors, and a lack of clear navigation route. Whilst the ship itself (if you’re interested in the story, you can read more on the museum’s website) is impressive, I felt immediately overwhelmed, not knowing where to start, or where to go. I found myself looking for somewhere to sit!
I saw a station where you could collect a map (which was available in numerous different languages), as well as clicking on a QR code to access a FREE audio guide. A map on the wall showed the location of all the stories in the audio guide, which was helpful (although they were not shown on the paper map which you carried with you). I looked around me, and found a theatre style set of wooden steps, where I could sit, look at the ship, and listen to the audio…
The audio was quite interesting, but then I quickly became frustrated by the imitation waves that were added in for effect. Time to move on!
There were lifts, but often with a group of people already waiting, so I chose to use the stairs. I found it quite confusing to navigate my way around, and it was too dark to read the map, so I stopped trying!
The museum is very interactive, with a wide variety of displays, ways to engage, and a LOT of information. I realised I was finding the displays a bit overwhelming, and so decided to focus on the ship itself — actually, as I write this, it’s probably how I usually navigate a museum. Focus on the object of interest!
This was the start of my trip, before I even intended to be focused on research. I’ll add further blogs to this series (links to be added, as I write them):

This is not your romantic cruise! But a beer-soaked “The Love Boat” episode ala Viking style version with hard liquor and long parties.
We decided one weekend to celebrate family birthdays on the ferry trip from Helsinki-Åland-Stockholm. Two good, highly competitive lines, Viking Line and Tallink Silja, the Tallink Silja Viking Line connects Sweden’s capital with Finlands.
We took the Silja Line Promenade for 1–4 persons plus breakfast and grande buffets for each person during the trip. The promenade room is located in the middle and offers a view of the boat’s hallway.
In my honest opinion, Tallink Silja is more upscale and Viking Line is the less expensive one but also a popular one. The Helsinki to Stockholm cruise or vice-versa has a 2-nights and 3-day cruise and is one of the popular ferry trips.
For Finnish people, having a ferry ride from Helsinki to Stockholm is just as common as having a train ride between cities. One of the most popular routes between Sweden and Finland is the Stockholm-Helsinki ferry.

This article originally appeared on Confessions of a Boy Toy
Stockholm is a truly magical city. This spring, we traveled to Sweden’s capital to experience the fairy tale magic for ourselves. From getting lost through the cobblestone streets of charming Gamla Stan (Old Town) or boutique-hopping in the city’s super-hip SoFo neighborhood, Stockholm has enchanting surprises at every turn.
Here are some incredible places you’ll be delighted to stumble upon shall you find yourself in Stockholm.
The clothes and furniture at Grandpa embodies everything we love about the SoFo district: Casual, super-cool and contemporary, despite its name. Grandpa focuses on highlighting Scandinavian fashion and furniture designers with a reputation for making things that are eco-friendly and sustainable, with materials sourced locally, organically or through fair trade.
Another quintessential SoFo shop, Coctail is like a Pedro Almodovar movie that’s come to life. No wonder it’s so popular with film location scouts. While most of Stockholm is still enamored with minimalism, this tiny shop aims for “maximalism” — everything here is just the most, from the luchador masks, the Dia de Los Muertos figurines, the Frida Kahlo mugs, and other colorful, authentic trinkets shipped from Mexican street vendors.
Located in Gamla Stan since 1864, E.Torndahl is a tiny, family-owned boutique featuring the work of local Scandinavian designers and artists. Here, you’ll find fascinating gifts in the form of jewelry, wallets, metallic hair-trimmers shaped like exotic birds, coasters with a bearded man illustration, a portable phone charger shaped like a river rock, and more.
Photography lovers should spend an afternoon — especially if it’s raining — perusing Fotografiska, a for-profit center for modern photography. This place is not afraid to exhibit controversial and provocative photos, so make sure to wear your open-minded goggles. During our visit, we saw work by African artists Samuel Fosso and Rotimi Fani-Kayode, as well as a special exhibition on French fashion photographer Bettina Rheims.
There’s no inch of Stockholm that’s not drenched in history and culture, even down in the subway. The city’s public transit system is said to be the world’s longest art exhibit, with 90 percent of the subway stations decorated with sculptures, mosaics, paintings and public installations by over 150 artists. Some of the most eye-grabbing subway art can be found at the following stations: Kungsträdgården, T-Centralen, Rådhuset, Solna Centrum and Tensta.
If you find yourself in Gamla Stan around noon, check out the changing of the guard at the Royal Palace. It takes place at 12:15 p.m. daily during the summer and on weekends year-round. The Royal Palace itself is a sight to see. You can take a tour of the inside and check out five museums, including the royal treasury, home to the crown jewels, an armory with knights’ gear and the royal stable with coronation carriages and intricate coaches.
Are you a fan of Game of Thrones or Harry Potter or Star Trek or E.T. or Marvel superheroes or Buffy the Vampire Slayer or all of the above? You’re bound to find a book, graphic novel, or other gift for all your geek-related obsessions at this sci-fi mecca in Gamla Stan. Let’s just say this shop has everything you could ever possibly need to decipher every reference in Stranger Things.
If it’s sunny out, this lively terrace at the top of Sodrateatern, an iconic theater in the heart of Stockholm, has to be on your to-do list. And if the weather is not cooperating, Sodrateatern offers plenty of indoor festivities as well, including jazz-fueled dinners that turn into full-blown dance parties.
If you’re traveling to Stockholm during the summer, from early April to late September, make sure to catch the sunset at the hyper-scenic Mälarpaviljongen. This high-spirited, straight-friendly restaurant and outdoor bar is located on the waterfront barges along the Riddarfjärden bay. You can even arrive by boat after a day out on the bay to cap off your cruising adventures.
A gay-owned coffee shop painted mustard-yellow in the heart of Gamla Stan, Chokladkoppen serves delicious hot chocolate in a bowl. If you really want to indulge — and why wouldn’t you? — they also have chocolate cake that’s to die for. During the summer, enjoy the people-watching in the Nobel Museum plaza from one of the cafe’s outdoor tables.
Pharmarium Cocktail Bar
Located in Gamla Stan near where Stockholm’s first-ever pharmacy opened in 1575, Pharmarium serves a different type of modern remedy: exquisite craft cocktails. The Roses of Gold, the Pharmarium’s version of a French 75, was just what the doctor order, made to perfection with vodka, lemon, champagne, and just a sprinkle of gold powder. As if a champagne cocktail needed that extra flair.
You will find plenty of treats in Stockholm’s hip SoFo district, but nothing like the sweet-buttery deliciousness that can be found inside Pärlans Konfektyra. This quaint confectionery looks like it’s from another era. It makes classic, organic caramels and caramel sauce in Scandinavian flavors like lingonberry and salt licorice.
You’d expect this Medieval-themed restaurant would be a tourist trap, but we were the only Americans there. Medeltidskrogen Sjätte Tunnan is a little hidden hotspot to find in Gamla Stan. Once you find the door you have to walk all the way to the back before going downstairs to a cavernous restaurant serving a menu inspired by 1300 A.D. cuisine. A feast perfect for a Viking king.

Understanding the Stockholm Syndrome Phenomenon and Russian Propaganda: Exploring the Complexities of Captivity and Manipulation,https://medium.com/@sleuthyfella/understanding-the-stockholm-syndrome-phenomenon-and-russian-propaganda-exploring-the-complexities-b79a1c1724ab,"Sign up

Captivity and manipulation are two intricate aspects of human psychology that have fascinated researchers for decades. One phenomenon that sheds light on this complex interaction is the Stockholm Syndrome. As discussions around the topic intensify, it becomes imperative to delve deeper into its causes and explore the role that Russian propaganda plays in shaping public opinion.
The Stockholm Syndrome refers to the psychological condition where hostages develop an emotional bond with their captors. Originating from a 1973 bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden, the term has increasingly been used to explain instances of individuals identifying with their perpetrators and paradoxically defending their actions.
To truly comprehend this phenomenon, it is crucial to understand the dynamics at play during periods of captivity. When individuals find themselves in situations where their freedom is severely limited, they become vulnerable to the influence of their captors. Fear, uncertainty, and isolation create an environment where the captors can exercise power and control over their prisoners.
Interestingly, these circumstances can lead to a survival strategy known as “identification with the aggressor” or the Stockholm Syndrome. Victims might unconsciously develop empathy and positivity towards their captors as a means of self-preservation. This psychological defense mechanism aims to reduce perceived threats and increase the chances of survival within the confines of captivity.
However, it is important to note that the Stockholm Syndrome is not limited to scenarios of physical captivity alone. It can also manifest in situations involving emotional manipulation and psychological control. This is where the role of Russian propaganda becomes significant.
Russian propaganda, with its sophisticated tactics, aims to manipulate public opinion and control narratives. By leveraging psychological vulnerabilities, such as the fear of the unknown and the need for security, they can shape people’s perceptions and beliefs. This can lead to individuals sympathizing with and defending actions that align with the propagated narrative, despite their better judgment.
Exploring the complexities of captivity and manipulation, especially in the context of the Stockholm Syndrome and Russian propaganda, highlights the profound impact that external influences can have on the human psyche. By understanding these dynamics, we can develop greater awareness and critical thinking skills to navigate the intricate world of information warfare.
The Stockholm Syndrome serves as a harrowing testament to why societies need to punish criminals to deter crimes. Its intersection with Russian propaganda highlights the need for vigilance in assessing information sources and maintaining a healthy skepticism in an increasingly interconnected world. Only by questioning and seeking the truth can we break free from the invisible chains of manipulation.
Stockholm Syndrome is a psychological response observed in captive situations, where the individual begins to closely identify with their captors and even starts to sympathize with their agenda and demands. It is a complex phenomenon that has been studied and analyzed in various psychological research.
The term “Stockholm Syndrome” was coined after a notorious bank robbery and hostage situation that took place in Stockholm, Sweden in 1973. During this six-day ordeal, the hostages developed a strong bond and emotional attachment to their captors, which baffled both the authorities and the public. This case became the unprecedented reference point for understanding the psychological dynamics of captor-captive relationships.
According to Britannica, the Stockholm Syndrome is a psychological response that occurs when hostages or abuse victims develop an emotional connection with their captors or abusers. This phenomenon is named after a bank robbery that took place in Stockholm, Sweden in 1973, where the hostages ultimately expressed sympathy and loyalty towards their captors.
The syndrome is thought to be a survival mechanism that kicks in when a person feels powerless and threatened, causing them to form an attachment to their perpetrators. In these situations, the victim’s survival instincts kick in, and they begin to identify with their captors, often developing positive feelings toward them. This may be due to the captors intermittently showing kindness or providing the hostages with small acts of compassion during their confinement.
This emotional connection can be perplexing to outsiders who fail to understand the intricate dynamics at play. From an outsider’s perspective, it may seem illogical for the victims to develop positive feelings towards their captors. However, it is important to remember that these individuals are enduring a traumatic experience that distorts their perception of reality.
The Stockholm Syndrome is not limited to physical captivity alone. It can also manifest in situations of emotional manipulation and psychological control. In these cases, the victims may find themselves trapped in toxic relationships or cult-like environments where their thoughts and emotions are manipulated to serve the interests of the abuser.
In such instances, the victims’ identities become intertwined with their captors, leading to a loss of personal agency and an overwhelming sense of dependency. Breaking free from this psychological entanglement can be incredibly challenging, as the victims may fear retribution or believe that they are incapable of surviving without their captors’ support.
One of the factors that can contribute to the development of Stockholm Syndrome is the captor’s ability to instill a sense of fear and helplessness in the victims. By controlling their access to basic needs such as food, water, and sleep, the captors can create a cycle of reward and punishment, fostering a state of emotional dependency. This dependence, coupled with intermittent acts of kindness or compassion, further deepens the victims’ connection to their captors.
Furthermore, the victims may experience cognitive dissonance, a psychological phenomenon where conflicting beliefs and emotions create a state of mental discomfort. To reduce this discomfort, the victims may reinterpret the captors’ actions in a positive light, creating a narrative that justifies their bond with their captors. This cognitive restructuring allows them to maintain a sense of coherence in their worldview, despite the abusive circumstances they find themselves in.
The intersection between the Stockholm Syndrome and Russian propaganda unveils another layer of complexity. Russian propaganda, utilizing sophisticated manipulation techniques, aims to shape public opinion and control narratives. By exploiting psychological vulnerabilities, such as the fear of the unknown and the desire for security, they can sway individuals’ perceptions and evoke emotional responses.
In this context, victims of psychological manipulation may exhibit signs of the Stockholm Syndrome by defending and sympathizing with the propagated narrative, even if it contradicts their original beliefs or goes against their best interests. This underscores the immense power of psychological manipulation in shaping individuals’ thoughts and behaviors, turning them into unwitting prisoners of false ideologies.
To combat the toxic influence of propaganda and break free from the grip of manipulation, it is crucial to foster critical thinking skills and media literacy. Developing the ability to analyze information objectively, question sources, and consider multiple perspectives can help individuals resist the allure of manipulative tactics.
By shining a light on the intertwined concepts of captivity, manipulation, and the Stockholm Syndrome, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex mechanisms at play within the human psyche. It is through this understanding that we can strive to create a society that values freedom, autonomy, and the pursuit of truth, free from the shackles of psychological captivity.
Note: The term “Stockholm Syndrome” is used to describe a specific psychological response and should not be used loosely or trivialized.
One of the most infamous examples of Stockholm Syndrome is the case involving Patty Hearst, a newspaper heiress who was kidnapped in 1974 by the radical group Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA). Initially terrified and coerced, Hearst eventually joined the group and participated in their criminal activities. This case generated significant media attention and captivated the public’s interest, sparking widespread discussions about the psychological mechanisms underlying Stockholm Syndrome.
The study of Stockholm Syndrome has provided tragic insights into the complexities of human behavior and the power of psychological manipulation. Researchers have attempted to unravel the underlying factors that contribute to the development of this phenomenon. Some proposed explanations include the captives’ perception of kindness from their captors, trauma bonding, and a survival instinct that leads the captives to adapt to their circumstances.
While Stockholm Syndrome remains an obscure crime, its impact on the understanding of human psychology cannot be understated. By analyzing and comprehending the intricacies of such situations, psychologists and researchers hope to shed light on the various psychological and emotional processes that individuals may experience when faced with captivity and coercion.
It is crucial to note that each case of Stockholm Syndrome is unique, and individuals’ responses can vary significantly. The understanding and treatment of this phenomenon remain areas of ongoing research, aiming to provide support and guidance to individuals who have experienced such traumatic situations.
The study of Stockholm Syndrome has also highlighted the role of empathy and the human need for connection in captive situations. In some cases, victims may develop a sense of empathy towards their captors, seeing them as complex individuals rather than solely as perpetrators. This empathy can create a bond that reinforces the captive’s identification with the aggressor.
Furthermore, the Stockholm Syndrome can have long-lasting effects on the psychological well-being of the victims. Even after their physical captivity ends, they may continue to struggle with conflicting emotions and a sense of loyalty towards their captors. Overcoming these psychological challenges requires a supportive environment where victims can receive appropriate therapy and support to reintegrate into society.
Cultural and societal factors also play a significant role in shaping the dynamics of the Stockholm Syndrome. The cultural norms and values of a society can influence individuals’ responses to captivity and manipulation. For example, in societies that prioritize authority and obedience, victims may be more likely to develop the Stockholm Syndrome as a means of survival.
The media also has a responsibility in portraying and discussing the Stockholm Syndrome phenomenon accurately and sensitively. Misrepresentation and sensationalization can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misunderstandings about the condition. Therefore, it is crucial for media outlets to approach the topic with empathy, ensuring that victims’ experiences are heard and understood.
It is important to remember that Stockholm Syndrome is a complex psychological phenomenon that arises in captive situations, where victims develop an emotional bond with their captors. This response stems from a survival instinct and the psychological mechanisms of identification with the aggressor. It is crucial to continue studying and understanding the Stockholm Syndrome to provide support and guidance to individuals who have experienced such traumatic situations. By doing so, we can strive to create a society that values compassion, empathy, and freedom from manipulation.
A study conducted by Douglas Wilbur, a visiting scholar in the UTSA Department of Communication, sheds light on an important issue regarding the influence of Russian propaganda on popular alternative media sites. Wilbur’s research, which involved analyzing over 600 articles, provides valuable insights into the correlation between Sputnik, Russia’s state-owned media, and these alternative media platforms that are believed to present favorable coverage of Russia and its allies in the United States.
The study, “Propaganda or Not: Examining the Claims of Extensive Russian Information Operations within the United States,” provides a comprehensive content analysis of articles published in four websites that were labeled by Prop or Not as working on behalf of the Russian government. While Prop or Not faced criticism from major U.S. mainstream media for its methodology in labeling 200 sites as vehicles of propaganda, the research conducted by Wilbur demonstrates the strong credibility of the claims made by Prop or Not regarding Russian interference.
In 2017, Prop or Not alleged that Russia was manipulating U.S. public opinion through online propaganda, but their failure to provide compelling evidence left doubts lingering in the air. However, Wilbur’s research has now validated this claim, shedding light on the extent of Russian interference and its impact on U.S. public opinion. The study delves into the manipulation tactics employed by these targeted websites and explores the strategies used to influence the American narrative.
One of the key findings of Wilbur’s study is the strong, positive correlation between Sputnik and sites like Zero Hedge, a Wall Street-focused website. The analysis suggests that these alternative media outlets echo Russian propaganda, aligning with the claims made by organizations like Prop or Not. This raises concerns about covert manipulation of the U.S. news agenda, posing a potential threat to national security.
Wilbur researched articles published on several websites: Zero Hedge, New Cold War, Global Research, and The Daily Sheeple. The outlets were chosen using a random number approach. Published articles on those sites between January 2019 and July 2020 were then selected for examination if they contained the following key terms: Russia, Syria, Ukraine, Iran, Venezuela, and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). These terms were chosen because they highlight important foreign policy issues for the Russian government. Once the articles were selected, their tonality was rated on a positive or negative scale according to how the news stories described Russia and its allies versus the U.S. and its partners.
Wilbur’s analysis offers a valuable contribution to the ongoing debate surrounding the role of Russian information operations in the United States. By meticulously examining the content of these websites, the study provides insights into the methods employed by Russian actors to shape public discourse and sow discord among the American population.
This research serves as a call to action for organizations and individuals alike, highlighting the importance of critically evaluating the sources and information we encounter online. It underscores the need for improved media literacy and the development of strategies to combat disinformation campaigns that seek to undermine democracy and public trust.
In essence, the study conducted by Wilbur offers compelling evidence to support the claims made by Prop or Not regarding Russian interference in the United States. It provides a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and the general public, deepening our understanding of the evolving challenges posed by digital propaganda and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of information in the digital age.
In an era where information is easily accessible and influences public opinion, it becomes crucial for the U.S. media to be aware of and address these propaganda efforts. As Russia creates and utilizes propaganda as a weapon, it is vital for the U.S. media to have effective countermeasures in place, ensuring that accurate and unbiased information prevails.
By highlighting this issue, Wilbur’s research underscores the importance of media literacy and critical thinking. It reminds us that staying informed and discerning in the face of propaganda is integral to safeguarding the integrity of the news and protecting national interests.
Awareness of the existence and potential impact of propaganda is the first step in combating its influence. The findings of this study emphasize the need for continued research, collaboration, and awareness among media professionals, policymakers, and the general public, as they strive to ensure a vibrant and trustworthy news landscape that upholds democratic values.
Understanding the parallels between Stockholm Syndrome and Russian disinformation and propaganda sheds light on how psychological manipulation can shape public opinion and influence individuals’ beliefs. By drawing this comparison, we can gain insight into the mechanisms at play in both situations, revealing the power of manipulation in shaping individuals’ thoughts and behaviors.
Both Stockholm Syndrome and Russian propaganda involve psychological manipulation and the distortion of reality. In cases of Stockholm Syndrome, captives develop an emotional bond with their captors, defending and identifying with them despite the harm they may have suffered. Similarly, Russian propaganda aims to manipulate public opinion through sophisticated tactics, distorting information and narratives to align with their interests.
In both scenarios, fear and uncertainty play a significant role. In captivity situations, victims experience a sense of powerlessness and dependence on their captors, which can lead to the development of Stockholm Syndrome. Similarly, Russian propaganda preys on individuals’ fears and insecurities, manipulating them through emotionally charged content designed to evoke strong reactions.
Another common factor between the two is the psychological defense mechanism of cognitive restructuring. In the case of Stockholm Syndrome, captives may reinterpret their captors’ actions in a positive light, creating a narrative that justifies their bond. Similarly, victims of propaganda may engage in cognitive dissonance, modifying their beliefs to align with the propagated narrative, despite contradictory evidence.
The role of empathy, albeit in different contexts, is also crucial. In Stockholm Syndrome, victims may develop empathy towards their captors, seeing them as complex individuals rather than solely as perpetrators. In the case of Russian propaganda, individuals may sympathize with the propagated narrative and defend actions that align with it, due to the emotional appeal and manipulation employed.
By comparing Stockholm Syndrome with Russian disinformation and propaganda, we can recognize the underlying psychological mechanisms and vulnerabilities that contribute to individuals’ susceptibility to manipulation. This understanding serves as a reminder of the importance of critical thinking, media literacy, and the ability to question and analyze information from diverse perspectives.
Ultimately, by raising awareness of the tactics used in psychological manipulation, individuals can develop resilience against manipulation and make informed decisions based on reliable information. This empowers individuals to navigate the complex landscape of information warfare and mitigate the impact of psychological captivity induced by manipulation and propaganda.

In 1973, there was a huge bank robbery attempt in Stockholm, Sweden. The robbers held four bank workers hostage for six days. On the sixth days, the police broke inside, trying to arrest the robbers and save the hostages but the said hostages tried to protect the robbers from the police. Later on, the hostages refused giving testimony against the robbers and they even started collecting money to defend them. Within six days of captivity, the hostages had started developing a deep sympathy for the robbers.
As a result, the incident in which captives start developing positive feelings for their captors was named Stockholm Syndrome. This intriguing and paradoxical bond between captors and captives was also found amongst prisoners of war and those being kept in concentration camps as well. But in time, it’s seen that Stockholm Syndrome is not all about literal captors and captives. For example; Stockholm Syndrome can be found between parents and children or spouses as well as in narcissistic relationships, which is the main topic of our article.
In what conditions do we see Stockholm Syndrome?
Stockholm Syndrome requires four important elements:
Judging by the first one, you might think that Stockholm Syndrome happening in a narcissistic relationship is very unlikely. You might feel like a narcissistic relationship cannot exactly be life threatening. After all, not all narcissists resort to physical violence. On the other hand, living with a narcissist can mean that your life is indeed in danger. This danger can be physical, emotional, psychological or spiritual. Besides, narcissists can throw violent temper tantrums when they can’t get something they want or when they’re losing control over someone (narcissistic rage). People on the receiving end of this rage (even if their partners have never abused them physical in the past) may find themselves fearing for their lives or well-being in general.
And the second case is about isolating the victim. Isolating the victim is a typical abusive behavior. In some cases, the victim can practically turn into a hostage due to being completely alienated from the outside world. And in some others, the victim avoids the point of views of other people when under the influence of feelings such as jealousy, paranoia and fear fueled by the narcissist. The isolated person fails to notice the abuse they’re being put through due to not being able to consult to other people, and they also feel like this small, artificial kindness shown by the abuser is all they have now so they cling to it.
Another reason is that the victim is unable to escape, or so they believe because they were convinced by the abuser. In the Stockholm robbery, it was found out that one of the hostages got a chance to escape and yet she did not. The reason to that may be the fact she believed she could not succeed, perhaps she was simply afraid of the danger this attempt might bring. In this situation called “behavioral despair”, the victim feels so hopeless that they resign to their fate. In narcissistic relationships, if the victim is financially abused as well, or if they’re in a relationship where there are children involved, they can be convinced that there’s no way out for them. And if the abused person also has a narcissistic parent, it’s quite likely for them to show signs of behavioral despair. Babies are dependent on their parents in order to survive. But when it comes to children who grow up in problematic environments where their needs are not met; the fact they feel dependent and not strong enough as well as the “small favors” granted by their abusive parents every once in a while may cause them to develop a sympathy for them.
In our last condition, in order for the Stockholm Syndrome to emerge the abuser should display a certain amount of kindness. A desperate and hopeless person who’s already in a life threatening situation and utterly at the mercy of the abuser can start trying to rationalize the situation when they’re shown some kindness by the abuser. These attempts at rationalizing the situation may start with “it’s not that bad!” and end in deeply positive feelings for the abuser in time. After a while, the abuser stops being a bad person in the eyes of the victim, they’re simply misunderstood and turned into what they are today due to certain circumstances.
At this point, the abuser clings to the exaggerated versions of the few good memories they had with the abuser and starts seeing them the way they want them to be, not the way they actually are today.
Reasons of Stockholm Syndrome
Stockholm Syndrome is a product and natural result of systematic abuse, and it’s practically a survival mechanism. People try to save themselves from dangerous situations with “fight or flight” instincts. But running away or fighting it may not always be possible. If we consider the Stockholm robbery, the hostages cannot really overpower armed robbers, and their chances of getting shot are pretty high if they try to run away. As a result, the victim experiences stress and wants to protect themselves, but that doesn’t seem possible. Also, our brains and bodies are not fit for long-term and continuous stress. Therefore, eventually people tend to focus on the “positive aspects” instinctively in an attempt to reduce the stress they’re experiencing. This is practically something that protects them from going utterly insane and it helps them cope with the trauma. People suffering from Stockholm Syndrome have faced something so traumatic that the only way to reduce it was to do this.
The first instinct of the hostages might have been to pretend like they’re on the robbers’ side in order to avoid angering them rather than “focusing on the positive”. They can try to please the abuser to avoid violence. In bilateral relationships, if one of the parties is prone to violence and sudden, aggressive outbursts; the other party may instinctively try to keep them satisfied just to avoid their wrath. But after a while, once the hope for escape has completely faded, this situation goes beyond just pretending and the victim can find themselves feeling a genuine sympathy for the abuser.
Long story short, when there’s no hope for escape and that there’s no other options (or so you think), you try to fit in and adapt to the new conditions in order to survive. Besides, once you embrace the abuser’s point of view, you’re no longer a victim. This situation makes one feel less inferior and more in control of things. As long as the danger of maintaining the relationship isn’t much higher than the risk a breakup might bring, it’s quite hard for the victim to acknowledge the situation they’re in.
All these situations serve the abuser well, because then they’ve successfully created a voluntary victim. Especially for the emotional manipulators, keeping the victim completely under their control is not enough; they want the victim to be willing as well.
Despite all this, you might still find Stockholm Syndrome illogical. You might be having trouble understanding a hostage getting attached to their captor, or a child loving their abusive parent, or a person being unable to leave their violent partner. But do not forget that people who have suffered traumatic things cannot always make reasonable choices. Traumatic incidents are exceptional conditions and desperate times call for desperate measures.
What to do in order to get rid of Stockholm Syndrome in narcissistic relationships?
Breaking the trauma bond on your own might be too difficult, so it would be wiser to get psychological help if possible. You need to make sure the person you’re consulting to has enough knowledge and experience about narcissistic personality disorder, codependency and narcissistic relationship dynamics.
You need to cut all ties with the narcissist for good and follow the “no contact rule”. In this way, you’ll be able to establish yourself a safe zone.
And in relationships, you should always focus on the big picture rather than small details. These “small favors” other people grant you may cost you much bigger things in the long run.

24–25 Sep remembered on 8 Oct
Writing memories is like racing with time. From the Hong Kong 18 days ago, to the Bangkok 16 days ago, to the Copenhagen 13 days ago, theoretically, I am catching up with time, but as I caught up, I found remembering what happened harder and harder. Shouldn’t it be another way around? Or just the memories of Skövde, as a new place, are replacing the old ones faster? Or simply, I am tired of remembering?
“I arrived at Stockholm airport at about 0:30am, in the dark of the new moon, on the coldest day of the year. The Swedish officials had been notified of my arrival, and I had no travel documents on me. I did not use the Japanese passport to avoid committing the offence of forgery and waited for all the other travellers to clear customs before I went to the officer, telling them that I had no documents. A young officer guided me to his office to talk, and I cleared customs in about ten minutes. At the airport, Mrs. Gawell and seven or eight other members who were in charge of my case at Amnesty International came to pick me up. The temperature was -25 degrees Celsius, and they brought a jumper, long boots, gloves, a scarf, and a leather hat for me. They probably thought that I came from the subtropics, that I must have been wearing only a flimsy southern jacket. They insisted that I wear all of these things on the spot. I am sure that I must looked ridiculous. The police simply took my name and then asked me to return the next day back to the airport to complete the formalities. I felt that I was truly in another world.” — “A Perfect Escape” by Peng Ming-Min
Here we arrived at a city without memories.
I had never been to Stockholm. This was my first time. I arrived at the Arlanda Airport in the evening. Since I was travelling from Copenhagen, I did not need to go through the border control. The public transportation was easy. I managed to reach the hotel smoothly.
The name of the hotel was Hotel Expo. It was slightly out of the city centre, around 30 minutes by public transportation. However, for someone who used to live in London, anywhere that can reach the centre within 30 minutes, is included in the concept of centre and considered convenient. In conclusion, I love the hotel, and I would recommend it to anyone who’s visiting, especially if you’re on a budget. It’s right in front of a commuter’s train station, Älvsjö. (Like you can literally see the hotel as you leave the station.) I spent 1250 SEK for 3 nights. It was the friendliest price I found. What I booked was a single room with shared toilets. The room was small but with everything one would need, including a clean towel and extra movable spaces (unlike the room F and I stayed in Hong Kong). The toilets were clean and close to the room. My favourite part was the breakfast, which was included in the price. And not only it was included, it was fancy, with everything one could expect from a four-star hotel breakfast buffet — various cold cuts, cheese, breads, coffee, juice, milk, yoghourt, eggs, fruits, oatmeals, cereals, jams…etc., I can continue listing. And what was crazier was that the gym on the ground floor was also included, that as a resident of the hotel, I could use it for free. Free laundry was also available. The surrounding environment was not massively exciting but convenient, with a huge supermarket, Co-op (I almost tried with my old British membership, wondering if it worked.), along with Subway, restaurants, bars, Chinese food…etc.
The checking process was slightly odd. The man behind the counter checked me in, but said I hadn’t paid for the room. I checked the booking record, and made sure that I had. And then he said, “Oh, then don’t worry about it, I will check it again tomorrow.” That was it. He didn’t come back to me afterwards.
After my joyous breakfast the next morning, I started visiting my long list of places related to Peng or Hedin.
My first stop was Norr Mälarstrand 66. The seemingly ordinary address was where Sven Hedin used to live. The walls of the entryway were covered with murals of a world map, as well as a Chinese-style temple to honour him. I was dying to go in, so after taking some photos from the glass door outside, I decided to sit on the staircases, hoping to bump into someone leaving or entering. After 15 minutes or so, I realised that the day was not my lucky day, so I moved on to what was next on my list, Adolf Fredriks kyrkogård, where Hedin was buried, with a 30-minute walk from where he used to live.
On my way there, I realised that I was in need of a toilet. This might be something to confess — I believe that I had this “pink bubble” filter when speaking of Scandinavia. I was imagining public toilets everywhere, clean and free, public Wifi, water cooler, power outlets, free at every corner. However, a free public toilet seemed to be harder to find than I expected. It was almost 11:00am. It took me a while until I found one, an isolated one on the street. It was free, so, hurray! However, it was not as clean and well-maintained as I expected. But well, that was on me. I am the one who chose to wear the pink goggles, and to be honest, comparing it with the ones in London or Paris, it was a tiny heaven on the street. I happily finished what I needed to do, and moved on with my day.
When I arrived at the Adolf Fredriks kyrkogård, it was around 11:15am. I realised that the church was closed. (It was closed between 11:00am — 11:45am daily.) Luckily, the garden, where the cemetery is, was opened. It was a small yard, with, I would say, a bit more than 100 tombstones as far as I could see, which means, it shouldn’t be difficult for me to find the one of Sven Hedin, especially him being a famous figure. I started to stroll around, one side at a time, one roll at a time, carefully trying to locate his name. Unexpectedly, I failed. I kept wondering why and how, thinking probably Hedin did not want me to find him, that probably he did not not approve of my project, or my criticism towards the concept of explorers and what he did.
Do you remember my internet drama? So, once I arrived in Stockholm, I changed my sim card from the British one to the Taiwanese one, and bought some credit so I can have internet access here in Europe. It was slightly more expensive than usual, so I decided that I was not going to use it unless it’s necessary.
After almost half an hour of trying to locate Hedin, I gave up. I sat down on a bench, turned on the internet on my phone, googling the images of the tombstone of Sven Hedin. From using the housing in the background as a clue, I found it. Turned out that it was covered by a van, the only car parked inside the cemetery. I stood in front of him, explaining the project, and apologising, hoping to have his approval. I told him that I am aware that I am not in any position to judge, and I know it was a different time. The project is not about him, not personally at least. Through talking to him, I started to ask myself why I wanted to do this project. What is it for? I suddenly realised that in a way, migration can be a privilege, even for the ones who were forced to. Peng had to escape, otherwise he would have been killed or imprisoned, but again, how many activists at the time couldn’t, ended up in jails or some random cemeteries in Liu Zhang Li. Refugees had to leave, but again, we all know that more of them didn’t make it. So, it’s a privilege, but it doesn’t mean it’s not hard. It doesn’t mean living in a foreign place, learning a new language, facing unfamiliar environments is not something hard. If I can offer something, some sharing, some talks, so we can feel a little bit better, with our lives, with our choices, probably the whole thing would be worth it? That there could be some meanings in all these?
After talking to him, I looked at my phone, it was 11:45am. The church would be opened by now. I suddenly realised, probably he did it on purpose. If I found his tombstone easily at 11:15am, would I have the patience to sit for 30 minutes to wait for the church to open? I might have decided to move on with my day. Feeling grateful at the coincidence, I walked into the church. It was beautiful. I was the only visitor in the church, however, someone started to play the organ. Not sure if it was a regular performance, or the person was practising, it was magnetising either way. I found a bronze plaque dedicated to Sven Hedin on the wall. I guess probably that was the reason he invited me to come in. I also found a LGBTQIA+ friendly rainbow pin at the souvenir store. How sweet. I guess that would fit in the pink bubble goggle that I was wearing. After a short stay, I moved on to my next spot — Historiska Museet.
I actually can’t remember why I put Historiska Museet on my list. I guess probably at some point I read something saying that part of Hedin’s collection was in the museum. When I arrived, I noticed that on Wednesdays, which was the day I visited, tickets were half priced after 5pm. So I decided to come back later.
Where I went next was the US embassy in Stockholm. This was where Peng applied for his US visa. Even though it sounds like an insignificant part of the story, he actually visited a number of times, detailedly remembered and documented in his book. It was also kind of the turning point for him to move on with his journey from Sweden to the USA. From what I found online, the one I visited should be the same one Peng visited. It was launched in 1955.
I was surprised when I arrived. I was expecting a house, or a building at most, like most of the embassies are. The US embassy in Stockholm took up the land of the size of a university campus, composed of buildings and a huge yard. And as expected, it was barricaded. I started to take photos of the entrance, and of course, caught the attention of the security guard. He gestured to me to go over in a friendly manner, and I believed it was time for me to play the innocent, Asian girl, the tourist card. I said, “Oh, I am not here for anything. I just want to have a look, is it okay if I take some photos?” He gave me a positive answer with a smile. And without anything else to do, or could do, I moved on soon after.

Earlier this year I quit my job as the VP of Platform at SoundCloud and moved back to Stockholm. Working at SoundCloud was a hell of a ride which began back in the summer of 2009. At the time, I’d just graduated from KTH and was doing some work at Propellerhead. I was dreaming about starting my own company after falling in love with entrepreneurship during my time at SSES. Through SSES, I’d also met Eric who’s the SoundCloud co-founder and CTO. We have a lot of shared interests and became great friends.
Knowing Eric was a good reason to frequently visit Berlin where SoundCloud is headquartered. I fell in love with the city and was lucky to experience one of the legendary rooftop parties in SoundCloud’s first office. The team was starting to grow and eventually I got an offer to join. The opportunity was perfect; a chance to join a music tech startup I really believed in, work with people I really liked, and finally make the move to Berlin. We agreed over the phone on a Wednesday and started working the week after.
When I joined SoundCloud, we were less than ten people in a scrappy office and the whole company was doing daily stand-ups together. My job was to build relationships with other companies, mainly music software makers, and get developers to hack on our API. There was so much to do and so much to learn. I loved it and was so excited about getting stuff done that I was almost running to work every day.
We thought we were the coolest thing since disco, but in the beginning it was really hard to convince other companies to partner with us. After all, we were just a small startup from Berlin with rapid growth but uncertain future. However, sending thousands of emails, doing hundreds of calls, taking tons of meetings, and traveling to as many conferences as possible, eventually started to pay off.
As we got bigger, things got a lot easier and eventually we reached a point where we couldn’t even handle all the incoming requests from potential partners. I learned the hard way that it takes time to build good relationships and get people to buy into your ideas, and that timing is super important when it comes to closing deals, so you have to be patient and persistent.
Since I was doing partnerships with other tech companies, I traveled a lot to the US. At a certain point, we needed to establish a permanent presence in the Bay Area, and it was natural for me to make the move to San Francisco and setup our new office there. I was of course stoked about the opportunity to work in SF and get a chance to build a small office from scratch.
It took some time to get things in order, but eventually we got the paperwork sorted, found a great space, and started bringing on new people. I got to obsess with things like office furniture, culture (introducing Friday fika), finding the right people, maintaining the connection to our other offices, and evangelizing SoundCloud in the bay area. It reminded me how naturally passionate I am when I get to coordinate things and craft them down to the details. In the end, things worked out great and I’m really proud of having brought the SoundCloud culture overseas and established so many great relationships in the US.
Over time, we expanded the platform team and scaled up our efforts, and over time we managed to connect the vast majority of music apps and a ton of different web services. We launched partnerships with companies like Apple, Twitter, and Facebook, and created a big developer community who built hundreds of hacks on the API. I was also part of the management team and an active contributor to the overall company strategy work.
Starting a company has always been close to my heart, and as things were running smoothly in SF, I felt the timing was right to leave and build something new. I can’t help loving to build things from scratch and I’m constantly looking for new challenges. In addition, taking some time off would give me a chance to charge my batteries and think about my longterm goals in life.
I’m super proud of having contributed to building a such a great company. Building a startup is an amazing experience that I really recommend. I don’t think there’s a better way to try and learn new things. I’ve learned so many great startup lessons along the way and now I want to take that experience and create something on my own.
A massive thanks to Alex and Eric for giving me the opportunity to support their mission and the freedom to do a great job, and to all the awesome people I’ve worked with along the way! I’ve had so much fun and learned so much.

Before I go on with these holy thoughts, I must mention — Everything in KFC is overpriced. I think they are doing child trafficking for the chickens they serve their customers. So small, you start to wonder if they even allowed the chicken to walk before cooking it.
I even battled a bit of food poisoning in the end. What a way to start the week.
That said, if we stretch it far enough, it’s not hard to see how the whole Stockholm Syndrome narrative could be pushed into some rather unholy territory. I find myself thinking about how people grow up loving the very parents who used to beat the living daylight out of them.
If you’ll allow me the looseness, it doesn’t feel like a huge leap to draw a parallel with those who stay in abusive relationships, covering bruises with excuses and clinging to the people who hurt them.
Few things unsettle me more than watching a person tenderly unpack the logic behind getting brutalized by the very hands that claim to love them. It feels like a kind of demonic possession — something ancient, cruel, and crawling beneath the skin. And if we’re ranking horrors, this one isn’t coming in second.
I think it's Stockholm Syndrome, just nuanced a little.
I’m beginning to understand that there are some gentle themes to healthy living, and it…

Home to the famous pop band ABBA and furniture giant IKEA, Stockholm is the second most visited Nordic country. Built across fourteen islands, the city is known as Europe’s first “green” capital and boasts the longest life expectancy on the continent. “Fika”, the afternoon tradition of indulging in a coffee and pastry break, might also be contributing to the high life expectancy. Be sure to participate in this ritual during your time in Sweden.
This guide outlines a possible itinerary for a long weekend in the city. Below is a quick overview of the proposal:
Most US phone companies do not enable free European service. Check with your phone company before leaving to confirm your plan’s allowance.
Debit/Credit Cards are widely accepted everywhere. I never used cash. No need to take out any Swedish kronor (SEK), but if you feel so inclined, visit your local bank before you leave to get the best conversion rates.
It is important to note that Sweden (along with all of the Nordic countries) is an expensive country to visit, so plan to spend more here than other places in mainland Europe.
Stockholm experiences mild annual temperatures, with lows in the winter around 30 degrees Fahrenheit and highs in summer around 70 degrees. Its sunlight hours, however, are more interesting. During the winter, the sun rises around 9am and sets just after 3pm, making it a long, dark span of months. The summer is drastically (and thankfully) different, with the city averaging around nineteen hours of sunlight per day. Unless you plan to visit up north for winter activities, visit Stockholm from May through September for ideal temperatures and light.
The city offers numerous hotel, Airbnb, and hostel accommodations based on price. STF af Chapman & Skeppsholmen Hostel is a budget friendly, clean hostel on a quieter island conveniently in between Gamla Stan and Djurgården (the museum island, as I affectionately call it). Instead of walking (which is still very convenient), take the Skeppsholmen ferry that leaves every twenty minutes to visit main points of interest.
Gamla Stan, the old town section of the city, is another great area to stay in. The Collector’s Lady Hamilton Hotel in this neighborhood is a Victorian-style hotel with modern updates. In addition, Hotel Tegnerlunden is an affordable option in the Norrmalm District, a busy downtown neighborhood home to many iconic landmarks.
To get from the Arlanda Airport to downtown (near Gamla Stan), skip Uber and take the Arlanda Express. Purchase a ticket at the airport for $27 USD one way and arrive at the Stockholm City stop within twenty minutes. The ride includes WiFi and clean bathrooms. A walk to Gamla Stan from there takes another ten minutes.
Once in the city, utilize the SL ferries for an easy and quick system that locals and tourists alike enjoy. Purchase a ticket at every ferry station for less than $2 USD one way. Walking between each island via bridges tends to take time, so this is a better option, especially when going from Gamla Stan to Djurgården.
We got lazy and ended up Ubering to further neighborhoods like Sodermalm from our hostel (with prices averaging that of mainstream US cities). However, we wish we had taken advantage of the metro system. Clean and accessible, it holds the title of the “world’s longest art gallery” so I’m kicking myself for skipping it.
Start your day with fresh squeezed orange juice and a deliciously lite breakfast at Café Schweizer in old town Gamla Stan. This neighborhood is one of the best preserved historic districts in Europe, so take your time sipping coffee while wandering the cobblestone streets in the early morning.
Next, experience a free walking tour to better understand the history of Gamla Stan. The guide will point out key points of interest such as the Stockholm Royal Palace, Stora Nygatan (a lively street with music), and the Swedish Parliament where environmental activist Greta Thunberg began her global protests. If time permits post-tour, stop by Tasty America for a good laugh at a large collection of the over-processed foods popular in the United States. This grocery store was both intriguing and embarrassing, as it really outlines the absurdity of American food culture.
For lunch, pop over to Restaurant Tradition to taste traditional Swedish and Nordic fare. The Hairy Pig, a pub, is another great option for good food and beer. Try the Swedish Meatballs — you won’t regret it. If not quite hungry yet, take the ferry from Gamla Stan to Djurgården and head straight to one of the most popular museums on the island, the Vasa Museum.
At only $18 USD/adult, this is arguably one of the coolest museums I’ve ever been to. Vasa displays a well preserved warship from 1628 that sank twenty minutes into its maiden voyage, drowning all but thirty people out of its 300 passengers. It took 333 years for the Swedes to retrieve the ship from the bottom of the harbor. Visitors can now view the ship from four different stories, along with numerous artifacts and skeletons from the wreckage. The experience typically takes one hour. Do not miss this.
Stockholm has numerous other museums scattered throughout Djurgården and the city in general that you could hit after Vasa. The Viking Museum showcases 9th century Viking ships and artifacts along with a Disneyworld-like Viking ride. The ABBA Museum, a well marketed but somewhat superficial excursion, outlines the rise and success of the famous band. The Nobel Prize Museum highlights key Nobel prizes and laureates. The one museum I would NOT recommend, however, is the Skansen Museum. Although it is the world’s oldest open air museum and is supposed to showcase Sweden pre-industrial era, it completely lacks signage and guides to teach and clarify what you’re looking at. Skip this.
If you plan on visiting several museums, consider purchasing the All-Inclusive Stockholm Pass which will give you discounts and ‘free’ access to many city landmarks and galleries.
End the evening with dinner at Restaurang Kryp In back in Gamla Stan for more traditional Swedish fare and a great espresso martini. Then, head to Winstrom’s Pub or O’Connell’s Irish Pub for drinks and live music.
Stockholm is home to a massive archipelago with over 24,000 islands. These island chains create plenty of options for fun day trips. Stora Fjäderholmarna, Grinda, and Vaxholm are all small islands within a 90 minute boat ride from the main city center.
I had a really hard time determining which island to visit. Stora Fjäderholmarna is charming and only thirty minutes by boat, but does not allow one to truly experience life deep in the archipelago. Grinda takes approximately 90 minutes and has gorgeous views with many adventure sports to take part in, including kayaking and swimming. I’m a bit regretful that we didn’t stop here. The island we did select, however, was Vaxholm and I am both happy and disappointed in our choice.
Considered the capital of the archipelago, Vaxholm is known for idyllic roads and quaint fisherman cottages. To get there, choose from one of two main ferries. The cheapest option utilizes the public ferry, Waxholmsbolaget. Located next to the Grand Hotel and operating year round, the ferry does not allow pre-purchasing tickets so simply purchase on arrival. The trip lasts an hour or so.
The second option, and the one we selected, involves the Cinderella ferry and a history tour. With a restaurant, bar, and guided cruise, this ferry is a bit nicer and lasts approximately 90 minutes each way. It leaves from a different location (Strandvägen berth no 14) and only runs from May through September. If planning to visit Vaxholm and appreciate history, choose this option.
One can also drive or bus to the town as there is a small bridge connecting it to the mainland — but you’d be remiss to skip exploring the archipelago via water.
On land, explore the little town for an hour or two with its boutiques and waterfront parks, especially Johannesbergsparken. When ready for food, indulge in a tasty burger on the docks at Winbergs Kök & Bar or down the road at Vaxholms Hembygdsgårds Café. The latter was closed when we visited, but we stopped by to sit on the picnic tables and enjoy the view. I would have loved to eat here — the location was idyllic and the menu looked delicious.
If you have time, take a quick water taxi to the Vaxholm Fortress Museum, a site that was once the Citadel for Swedish defense in the 19th century.
My day trip to Vaxholm was great, though I wonder what it would have been like to explore a different island with perhaps more to do. The tour allowed for four or five hours on the island, which was too much for what the island offered for activities. I would have preferred to take the Cinderella ferry there for the history and the public ferry home so we could have returned faster and on our own time.
Alternatively, discover additional island tours through Get Your Guide or simply get out on the water with a RIB tour.
Once back in Stockholm, spend the rest of the evening exploring Norrmalm, a modernized downtown neighborhood next to Gamla Stan. Be sure to walk through Kungsträdgården, the city’s oldest park, and Hötorgshallen, a local food market. Grab drinks at the Lydmar Hotel outdoor pop up bar, then dine alongside locals at Restaurant 1889 Fast Fine Pizza. Known for its ritzy decor yet laid back atmosphere, this restaurant simplifies ordering with a QR barcode and no true waitstaff.
Spend the last day in Stockholm choosing from a handful of excursions:
Regardless of what you decide, enjoy the afternoon/evening in Sodermalm, the “Brooklyn” of Stockholm. Visit Söderhallarna, a modern shopping hall with gourmet food stalls and restaurants, or try Mosebacketerrassen, a beer hall with gorgeous views of Stockholm’s skyline. Skinnarviksparken, a park with hills overlooking the city, is another great place for views and people watching. For a casual dinner, head to gastro-pub Honey Honey. We visited during the Eurovision competition and had a great time watching countries compete while chowing down on pork schnitzel and Swedish meatballs with lingonberry sauce. Later, stop by Häktet for lively drinks with a younger crowd.
After four nights in Stockholm, my next stop was Helsinki, Finland. I purchased a one way flight for $200 USD that was quick and easy. However, I wish I had taken the overnight ferry with either Viking Line or Tallink Silja that would have allowed me to see more of the archipelago and saved the cost of a hotel for a night.

The first museum I visited in Stockholm (I am a museum enthusiast) is the Nordiska Museum, also known as the Nordic Museum, located in Djurgården, an island in central Stockholm. This museum mainly displays the traditions and lifestyle of Scandinavians from the 16th century. It has over one and a half million pieces! The exterior of the museum is fascinating. It was designed in the Dutch-Danish Renaissance style by Isak Gustaf Clason. Founded in the late 19th century by Artur Hazelius, a Swedish scholar and museum director, who also founded the Skansen open-air museum in Stockholm.
💰Free admission with Go City Pass
Regular admission: SEK 170 by 2024 and free admission for children
Opening Time: Almost open every day, even on Christmas from 10:00–17:00
Once you enter the museum, get your tickets with your Go City Pass and you will see an enormous sculpture of King Gustav Vasa. Gustav Vasa (born Gustav Eriksson of the Vasa noble family, also called Gustav I) was King of Sweden from 1523 to 1560 and the founding father of Sweden. He brought Protestantism to Sweden and outmaneuvered the power of the Catholic Church. Every year on the 6th of June, Gustav’s name day, is celebrated as the Swedish national day to honor the electron of King Gustav Vasa.
Besides the sculpture, there are multiple exhibitions you can explore in the museum including:
The Arctic (Arctic Traces: Nature and Culture in Motion), exhibits the tools used in the Arctic and how people have lived in the Arctic through the years. It also brings up the topic of climate change and global warming. Notably, this exhibition is based on 3 years of research under Lotten Gustafsson Reinius, a visiting professor at Stockholm University.
On the right side of the lobby, you can see another exhibition: Strinderg vs. Youssef. It was created by an artist Daniel Youssef with inspiration from August Strindbuerg’s autobiographical novel Inferno. Inferno was written in French from 1896 to 1897. The book talks a lot about Strindberg’s obsession, e.g. occultism, alchemy, and shows signs of paranoia. The story behind the exhibition is interesting, but I am not going to lie, I indeed find the exhibition confusing and hard to interpret the display.
Worth mentioning that there are audio guides available in multiple languages for free!
Another exhibition is called British — Ever So Nordic. It displays the Nordic fashion, clothes style, and lifestyle that was influenced by Britain. One exhibition that I found quite interesting is the “Traditions” located on Level 3. The exhibition constructs the scenes and details of how Nordics celebrate Midsummer, Christmas, and Easter, and the history behind it. Next to this exhibition is the “Table Settings”. Basically, this exhibition shows the interiors and the table setting from the 16th century to circa 1950, including coffee and tea parties, tables for aperitifs, aquavit, and banquets. (You can also see a “Swan” in the exhibition).
The last exhibition that I went to was on Level 2 (Lobby) right next to the Children’s Playhouse. It demonstrates the setting of a traditional Nordic family and most of the displays there are interactive. However, I did not see any description on the official website, but it is worth taking a look!
Before leaving the museum, go to the museum shop and see if there is anything that you want to get as a souvenir and maybe have a real Swedish “fika” in the cafe on level 2.
Recommendation: 🌟🌟🌟/ 5
A must for those who love Nordic history!

I just finished my 5 km run. The sky was grey the whole time, but it didn’t start raining until the moment I stopped — like the weather had been holding back, waiting for me. As the first drops landed on my skin, I stood there, catching my breath, and suddenly I was somewhere else entirely.
Do you remember that day in Stockholm? Outside the Vasa Museum, the first snow of the week had started to melt into rain. We didn’t have an umbrella — of course we didn’t — and we just walked, laughing at how unprepared we were. I was giggling the whole time, remember? It was my first time experiencing snow. I must’ve looked ridiculous — eyes wide, hands out like I could catch the whole sky. But you just smiled and let me take it in. It was cold, but you didn’t complain. I think we were too caught up in the quiet magic of it all.
I closed my eyes today in the rain, and for a second, I could feel your hand in mine again. That desperate little run we made, slipping on cobblestones, trying to find shelter — we never really cared if we found one. Just being there, soaked and smiling, was enough.
I miss the way you looked at me like you wanted to say something, but didn’t. Like the silence between us held more than words ever could. I miss how we didn’t need to explain anything. Everything felt full already.
It’s strange how the body remembers. A cold wind, a wet sleeve — and suddenly I’m there again, with you.
Where are you now? Are you somewhere it’s raining too?
Always,Me

If I have to sum up 2024 it has to be ‘adventure’!
In the quest of making a pivot in my life, I made more than hundred new contacts this year. Every time I spoke with someone, I was looking for a match of vibration. And it actually worked like a story!
I clearly remember the morning when I stood outside a building in central Stockholm, inquisitive about what to expect in the meeting that was about to happen. The door opened, I was welcomed in. A nice lounge, then a kitchen with bananas on a plate. I asked if I can have one. I ran in the morning after breakfast and was exhausted of energy. The urge to have a banana overpowered my self-consciousness. Exchanging a few more sentences, it felt like here I am welcome to be who I am. It was encouraging to leave self-consciousness at the door.
The interaction with a group of people running this new AI firm was particularly positive. I met them again in a few days and it felt like they are brimming with passion to make something work. They have just started a venture and they are looking for someone sharing the vision. And it felt good.
They were fast, it took 3 weeks from the first meeting to the decision. They said this was one of the longest process! I had many questions in my mind, but positivity the company protruded overpowered it all. I matched their vibe, I felt genuinely welcome. The CTO promised me a laptop by the end of my first day. Little did I know that he literally meant it, in the evening while I was out running, I got a call from him, he was standing outside my door.
Working at an AI startup means quite a lot of new information to process everyday by everyone. We don’t have time to sit an ponder over frictions. We chase a common goal and try to resolve issues fast, that means talking more, opening up and showing earnest interest in the goals, finding what will make it work without triggering each other. Feedback loops are faster, tighter and effective. We are always learning and sharing.
There is a high intensity of external communication. We reach outs to people across the industry, write articles, active on social media, give credit to one another. My colleagues were happy to act as photographers, editors and writers to engage with the public, creating a strong thought leadership that draws visitors to our website without any external marketing help. And we pick up the phone and call! We gather most of our leads through our contacts, we make sure to present ourselves as who we are and present the strong determination to make AI agenda work, and our enthusiasm is contagious. There is a touch of genuinity in our proposals, we are a young company, innovative, ready to work, flexible. And we keep those promises that we make. No BS.
Some days are full of self doubt, prospects disappear suddenly, makes one feel small. The internal chat channels are saviors, its a lively space with messages, memes and regular business updates. We keep track of each other, not chasing hours, rather than putting in efforts to collaboratively build the brand. Its rare to have a day without a roller coaster of emotions from ‘Yayyy’ moments to existential doubts. Our salaries includes a fat portion of ‘Resilience’ which is unmatched in numbers. And it just grows, and the best part it I can cash out in any situation of my life, the ‘Resilience’ is the best fund to invest in, it will be with me through thick and thin and will be passed on in generations!
A startup business requires scaling down on lot of aspects. Conferences are silent time eaters, the more you go, the more time you need to process the information and to realign the offset it brings in schedule is weighed by the impact it brings. We don’t ditch it altogether but we are extremely choosy on what to attend. Post work gatherings on the other hand are so exciting and lively! We look forward to it, take turns to organize, sit and talk passionately about our lives and challenges. The conversations fuels the energy needs for the next couple of weeks, reloaded with laughter.
Its been 6 months, the company has grown more than a 100%. Its a dynamic environment yet quite simple, non-pretentious. Everyone brings their own self at work, with their creativity and ideas flowing beyond their roles and titles. If you work at a startup or know anyone working at one, verify if my claims. I am all ears for ‘adventures’ !

Following on from part one of my Stockholm trip at the Vasa Museet, this post reflects on my visit to Nationalmuseum — Sweden’s museum of art and design — and a conversation with Lena Eriksson, Head of Education.
Unlike my earlier visit to the bustling Vasa, this experience offered a quiet contrast. I met Lena on a Monday, when the museum was closed to the public. So instead of wandering the galleries, I had the chance to sit with Lena over coffee for a visit filled with insights rather than artworks.
Nationalmuseum is not just a museum, but also a government authority. Our mandate is to preserve cultural heritage and promote art, public interest in art, and knowledge of art. This mandate is set out in an annual letter of instruction from the Swedish government.
We want to put social development in perspective and be an active player in contemporary society.
This made me wonder: how different is a government-funded museum like this from a university museum? One key difference Lena highlighted was how shifts in government can directly impact priorities, including decisions around accessibility and entry fees. At the time of my visit, admission was 160 SEK (around £12.50), free for under-20s, but with no concessions for older adults or disabled visitors. Navigating such changes with each new administration must be complex, especially when core principles like accessibility can shift with political tides.
Lena also shared insights into the museum’s education programme, which, like many institutions, focuses heavily on children, families, and schools. Their website features a dedicated page for families, with free studio sessions every Sunday, the Oculus Walk — a self-guided family tour — and Villa Curiosa, a playful, sensory exhibition designed to spark curiosity and philosophical questions in children.
Naturally, my own research interests led the conversation towards older audiences. I was curious about the museum’s engagement with older adults and community groups.
As is so often the case, Lena explained that while some great work has been done — including sessions for people living with dementia, inspired by Meet Me at MoMA — these projects are often reliant on short-term external funding. Engagement with older adults still isn’t widely seen as a core part of museum work, despite Sweden’s super-ageing population.
One standout project during the pandemic connected older adults in Sweden and Japan through creative online dialogue — a beautiful example of how digital innovation can support inclusive, cross-cultural exchange.
Before wrapping up, I took a moment to check out Nationalmuseum’s accessibility information online. I was pleased to find it easily — just one click from the homepage — and even more impressed by the friendly, human tone of the opening message:
“We want Nationalmuseum to be open to everyone and are always working to improve our accessibility. If you have any questions or suggestions, we would be happy to hear from you.”
A small but meaningful sign that the museum is open not only to visitors, but to conversation and change.

With my other daughters occupied by their own half-term adventures, I opted for a city getaway to Stockholm; the bargain £29pp return flights played a huge part in my decision. When I’m on the lookout for affordable flights, I make it a habit to browse Skyscanner daily. Despite having to drive from the Midlands to Stansted Airport, the journey proved financially viable as we got cheap flights. Thanks to clear skies over Northern Europe, the flight itself was a mere two hours.
Stockholm in February unfolds like a fairytale, its cobblestone streets dusted with snow and its historic buildings adorned with twinkling lights. For travellers seeking an affordable escape, surprisingly this Scandinavian gem can offer a treasure trove of experiences without breaking the bank.
Embarking on a Winter Boat Trip
No visit to Stockholm would be complete without experiencing its beautiful winter scenery from the water. Despite the cold, a boat trip around Stockholm’s archipelago allows you to capture stunning views of the city draped in snow. Wrap up warmly and sip on hot beverages from the onboard café as you, immerse yourself in the tranquillity of Stockholm’s winter wonderland.
Discovering Stockholm’s Cultural Marvels
Delve into Stockholm’s rich cultural tapestry with visits to its renowned museums, including the ABBA Museum and the Vasa Museum. Dive into the pop phenomenon at the ABBA Museum, where interactive exhibits and karaoke booths bring the iconic band’s music to life. The Abba silent disco was hilarious, and my daughter and I made lasting memories. For a more educational visit then, journey back in time to the Vasa Museum, marvelling at the remarkably preserved Vasa ship that sank centuries ago in the harbour on its first voyage.
Indulging in the Culinary Scene
Stockholm’s culinary scene offers something for everyone. Don’t miss the chance to savour meatballs, a Swedish classic, paired with lingonberry sauce and creamy mashed potatoes or fermented herring. I follow a vegetarian diet, but there were plenty of delicious alternatives available. From mouthwatering vegan meatballs to falafel wraps and the comforting tradition of Fika — a hot drink paired with something sweet for a boost in cold weather — Stockholm offers an abundance of tasty dishes that won’t break the bank.
Unique Accommodation Aboard the Red Boat Hostel
For an unforgettable stay, book a room aboard the Red Boat Hostel, a floating haven nestled in Stockholm’s heart. Enjoy cosy rooms and breathtaking views of the city skyline or tranquil frozen waters surrounding the boat. With its budget-friendly rates, the hostel is the perfect choice. Plus, it’s impeccably clean, cosy, and offers a fantastic buffet breakfast.
Embracing Free Attractions
Maximise your budget with free activities, such as the brilliant and informative walking tour of Gamla Stan, Stockholm’s captivating Old Town. Wander through narrow alleyways and picturesque squares as your guide shares stories of the city’s medieval history. The knowledgeable guides generously volunteer their time, so show your appreciation by tipping them at the end of the tour. Sweden is a cash-free society, even the guides accept card for their tips.
From exploring world-class museums to indulging in culinary delicacies and embarking on free walking tours, there’s no shortage of affordable experiences awaiting you in this Scandinavian gem. Pack your bags, wrap up warm, and prepare for a memorable excursion filled with culture, cuisine, and adventure. #stockholm #citybreak #budgettravel #wintercitybreaks #copysella

Because it strikes the chord between kidnapper and captor for meeting the needs.
The primal pangs of hunger are often the driving force of human bonds. Hunger for us, is more than growling stomach.
Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs explains that a humans are motivated by five basic hungers.
a) Physiological hunger for air, water, food, shelter, and sleep.
b)Security hunger for health, property, employment.
c) Connection hunger for family, love, intimacy, friendship.
d)Psychological hunger for esteem, respect.
e) Metaphysical hunger for self actualization.
Being the head of the community vocational program designed for providing employment opportunities to girls, I’ve come across some baffling cases of marriages. No matter what the degree of abuse, these women never fail to patronize their husbands.
After listening to few girls, I decided to take an inventory to write and see that NEEDS can be irrational and self-deprecating at times.
I talked to more than 10 women from abusive marriages apparently. And to my utter shock they were point blanc unwilling to walk out of the marriage because they thought that however barbaric, they were protected from outer terror-fueled world.
Besides safety, they had one more thing in common – strong attachment.
Just like the victims of Stockholm syndrome. As they fell for their captors and develop a soft bond of connection with them. Because mostly the captors are the one’s who fulfill their basic needs like food and medicine and often physical intimacy when the require to process the trauma of being hijacked or kidnapped.
This is not very common, to fall in love for your kidnapper or captor but happens with people with low self esteem and history of abuse.
When I talked to these women, they were rude and said – better worship one man than be a raw piece of meat to wolves out there.
One of the girl who’s hardly 25 years, told me that her husband after thrashing her hard, treats her with sex and restaurant food. After beating the shit out of her when she is in pain, he doesn’t allows her to cook food. Even takes her to the doctor for treating all the bloody bruises. In this situation when she is being treated so well, she thinks of him as an emergency God. Especially when there is no support from the family.
Psychologists says that terror-bonding and feeling empathy rather than rage towards your captor is the classic example of Stockholm Syndrome. It can also develop between abusive parents and children. Where the child may feel protective toward the parent and try mending the ways to keep the parents happy, unsuccessfully.
When I tried to educate these girls on the psychology of the syndrome, they were reluctant to understand.
As they feel that bonding with their captors( read husbands) after years of intimacy is their survival strategy and looking for normality within the framework of chaos and distress.
What’s wrong in choosing bad when you have the worst? Saying this one of the girl slaps her butt and walks off to stich a new pattern of dress she’s learning under the program.
Psychological abuse is much deeper than we can imagine. It becomes the way of life when the victims have never seen the other side.
Listening to some of the girls – and coming from non-psychological background – there were times I was compelled to see their POVs.
No financial independence and emotional part of the brains shackled tightly.
I believe in rewriting these narratives women needs exposure, life skills, and independence of all nature.
Education on self-esteem, respect. But on top of all education on self-discovery, non-reliance and then finances.

In January of 2019, I started at a new company, which has its headquarter in Stockholm. It was clear that I would — at some point — travel to the capital city of Sweden to pay a visit to the main office. The first opportunity for this was an internal two-day-workshop. There were several options for the date I could choose from. I decided for the Wednesday and Thursday directly after Easter. This way, I could do use the public holidays plus only two additional vacation days to have a ten-day-travel. Two of those days, of course, for the workshop. The remaining days were free for visiting Stockholm. But with eight days at disposal, I decided to spend the first few days (Good Friday until Easter Monday) in the Norwegian capital instead.
As my company also has an office in Oslo, the idea was to meet up with some colleagues for a coffee or lunch. What I wasn’t aware of is that the Easter days are used by the Norwegians usually to spend their time skiing in the mountains. So nearly no one was even in the city and my plan to meet the local colleagues didn’t work out as planned.
20.473 steps.
To get from Oslo-Gardermoen Airport to the central station, there are basically two options: the Flytorget express train (196 NOK; 22 min) and the regional trains operated by NSB (105 NOK; 23 min), such as the R10. I chose the latter. Due to the cancellation of the flight by EasyJet I had intended to take to Oslo, I had to travel a few hours earlier than planned. Which also meant to arrive more prior in Oslo. But as the hotel I booked only offered check-in from 15:00, I had to come up with something to kill time. Unfortunately, this also meant to carry my backpack around the city as well, weighing about eight kilograms. During my first walk through the town, I already visited the Munch museum, but the famous scream was not on display, unfortunately.
One of the things I usually try to do is having a walk around the neighborhood of my hotel on the first day. This gives me quite a good feeling about the area, and I can check out where I can get some snacks for the evening and more importantly: bottled water. It’s not about not trusting the hotels tap water. But when I’m walking around the city for sightseeing, I avoid buying food or drinks in places crowded with tourists, as the prices are a bit higher there. My recommendation is to walk the narrow, little side streets and try to take a different route each time. I usually start in a general direction and find the path as I go depending on which way look more appealing. This method will give you a better picture of the city, and you will find the restaurants where the locals eat. These typically serve good quality for more reasonable prices compared to the restaurants located directly at the usual tourist routes.
28.984 steps.
For the first full day in the city, I decided to book the Oslo Pass for 24 hours using their Android app, which was very convenient. This pass already included public transport. Using this, I took the bus 30 to the peninsula of Bygdøy for visiting the Viking Ship Museum, the Holocaust Center, the Norwegian Maritime Museum, the Fram Museum, and the Kon-Tiki Museum. The Fram Museum got built around the ship of the same name, which was used for polar explorations and the museum included many stories of exploratory expeditions for the north and south pole. All of the mentioned museums had excellent exhibitions and are also suitable for tourists as items are mostly labeled in Norwegian as well as English. I originally planned to include the Norwegian Museum of Cultural History while being in Bygdøy, but instead decided to take the ferry back to the central city. After leaving the boat, I headed for the Akershus fortress, where I wanted to visit Norway’s Resistance Museum and the Norwegian Military History Museum, but both were closed for Easter. Continuing the tour of museums, I took a streetcar to Frogner Plass, to visit the Vigeland Museum about the work of sculptor Gustav Vigeland. Oslo’s city museum is just around the corner, displaying the history of Oslo or Christiania, as the city was named between 1624 and 1924. After I had to leave (as they were closing), I went back with the streetcar and having my last stop for that day, the Nobel Peace Center. This museum was designed very nicely and worth a visit.
After being afoot for more than ten hours that day, I arrived back to my hotel. Although I already knew there was a high rate of electric cars in the Nordic countries, I was still really impressed by seeing at least one Tesla in every single street. There were electric cars of other brands as well but less prominent. Furthermore, there are also quite a lot of electric scooters in the city. Problematic in this context is that they seemed to be allowed on the sidewalks, which I think is pretty dangerous. In fact, Austria just banned them from the sidewalks for this reason, and France plans to do the same.
20.236 steps.
For Easter Sunday, I booked a boat tour around the Oslofjord in the week before traveling. This tour lasted about 2 hours and might have been one of the main factors for my sunburn that I took from Oslo as a souvenir. This tour also included some facts about the buildings at the shores of the fjord and some local history. The Oslofjord is distinctive among the fjords of Norway, as it is one of the oldest, and was not formed by a moving glacier but being part of the Olso rift. After returning to the harbor, I headed to the Royal Palace, as the changing of the guard was going to happen at 13:30.
Although the park around the royal palace is quite lovely and open to the public, I went to Vigelandparken afterward, to see the sculptures, of which I had only seen the models in the museum the day before. I wasn’t the only one with this idea that day. The sun attracted a lot of people, who wanted to enjoy the beautiful sunny weather in the park. There were also some people around which seemed to me as they would be geocaching. And after looking at the map of caches around, I also started to visit some of them in the park as well as outside, while walking back to the city center. The downside was I got so distracted with geocaching, that I left my DSLR camera on a bench next to one cache. As James May would say: C**k!
C**k!
— James May
So I walked back the route I just walked as I was trying to remember when the last time was I had the camera in my hands. Fortunately, a Norwegian couple walked towards me, while I was approaching Vigelandpark again. The guy is carrying a DSLR camera around his neck. Hm, that looks exactly like the one I just lost. It even has the bubble level on it. Wait. Is that mine? It was. He handed it over and explained that they left a note where I lost it, stating they would bring it to the next police station. After having a short chat, I thanked them again, and we split up. As this was enough stress for one day, I decided the next thing I would do is to have a burger and a beer. For this, I stepped in at “The Scotsman.” Like other Norwegian places, you have to get a table first, remember the table number, and then walk up to the bar for ordering. In the background, I could watch the Premier League, as Everton vs. Manchester United was ending, followed by Cardiff vs. Liverpool. A friendly way to end this day.
8.563 steps.
On Easter Monday it was already time to leave Oslo and get on the plane for Stockholm. Somehow, I thought my flight would take off at 10:30 in the morning. Therefore I tried to be at the airport at 9:00, which worked. But somehow I had the wrong time in mind, as my flight was actually scheduled for 12:40. Well, time to find a seat and continue reading my book. But first, let’s find a pharmacy to get something to treat my sunburn. As I don’t speak any Norwegian, I took some time and was switching between shelves back and forth. In the end, I settled for a product which seemed suitable and was small enough to take on the plane. At the cashier, I didn’t have to pay anything. I was confused. The clerk pointed to a sticker on the product, which explained (in Norwegian of course) that I just found an Easter egg. This kind of ‘hide and seek’ seems to be a common thing in some Norwegian shops. It reminded me of some chocolate hidden in the Akershus fortress I noticed when I was there two days before.
After arriving at Stockholm central station, I looked for a supermarket to get bottled water and some lunch/dinner to eat in the hotel. I found a coop with a nice salad bar. And as I was in Sweden now, I couldn’t resist buying about two kilograms of Swedish candy which I emptied over the next couple of evenings at the hotel.
26.940 steps.
As the hotel I stayed at in Stockholm is named “Hotel with Urban Deli,” you can imagine that the breakfast you get here is not standard. Italian-style salami, fresh bread, fruits, yogurt, smoothies, a good selection of loose tea. There was nothing I missed and nothing I could complain about. Everything was fresh and of high quality.
After the great breakfast, I walked a bit around the neighborhood, without a specific destination in mind. While walking towards Gamla Stan, the old city, I came by the Mediterranean Museum. It has a broad selection of items from different cultures around the Mediterranean Sea, including Egypt, ancient Rome, etc. It mainly showcased the evolution of beliefs for life after death and corresponding funeral rituals. After a short stop for a chat and coffee at my company’s main office, I visited the Swedish Army Museum. Showing the history of the Swedish military equipment in the context of the timeline of wars Sweden fought.
As it was already too late for visiting the Swedish History Museum or the Royal Armory, I decided to have a short break at the hotel, before attending a 1,5 h guided tour through Gamla Stan. The tour named “The Ghost Walk” explained some of the darker aspects of Stockholm’s history and was presented by a guide, who was loving his role and tried to send chills down our spines. If you do one guided tour in Stockholm, do this!
Combined: 13.259 steps.
Here it comes, the reason I planned to travel to Stockholm in the first place. A two-day-workshop about communication and personalities. There was a lot of input I received here and lots of things I have to recap after the travel. We were eleven people in this workshop including the facilitator, most of which Swedish. Apart from having fun during the workshop doing some role-plays, we also got to know each other during joined breakfast, lunch and dinner on both days.
17.878 steps.
As the workshop days were a bit exhausting, I started this day a bit later. The breakfast in the hotel was again a great way to do this. But I passed on coffee at the hotel, as I had an appointment for coffee with someone at the company’s office again. Even though this was during my official vacation days, I took to opportunity to have coffee with some colleagues I usually would not meet (as we work in different cities).
While walking to the Royal Palace, I already noticed military marching music playing somewhere. The royal music corps was already on the way to the palace half an hour before the changing of the guard would take place (scheduled for 12:30). I wasn’t the only one having the idea of watching this today. People flooded the area in front of the palace, barely being contained by a few guards to secure the ceremony would have enough room to take place. Although I didn’t understand a single word they said via the public speaker system, it was still quite a show to experience. As the same ceremony in Oslo didn’t contain a music corps, a comparison would be unfair.
One of the most famous landmarks of Stockholm is the city hall though, the Stadshus. The Nobel prizes are awarded here, except for the Nobel Peace Prize which we spoke of before. And there are also some geocaches around. After having spent the majority of the day in parks, I headed back to the office, where an event for new hires was going to happen including Swedish student’s drinking songs, occasionally interrupted by some 15-minute talks. Another opportunity for mingling with colleagues I usually wouldn’t meet.
26.420 steps.
All the things that usually would cost an entrance fee were left for today. Firstly, because I planned to use the Stockholm pass this day, which even gets cheaper if you buy it online and then use the QR code from the mail. Secondly, because of the Stockholm Kulturnatt. Between 18:00 and midnight, a lot of museums and other places were free to visit and offered special tours or exhibitions. But the first thing I had planned for this day was to take the ferry from Klara Mälarstrand to the Royal Domain of Drottningholm to visit the palace and its surrounding park which are part of UNESCO’s world heritage list. The richly decorated palace and its park are worth a visit. In contrast to my boat tour in Oslo, I was prepared with some sun blocker this time.
After arriving back to Klara Mälarstrand, I walked towards Gamla Stan to revisit the Royal Palace. This time also from the inside. With the Stockholm pass, I could directly walk up to the entrance without the need to buy a separate ticket at the desk located in a side wing. At the admission checkpoint, you will be asked to wear your backpack in front of you. I forgot to ask why. In nearly every room, there is a little sign explaining the purpose and history of that room, from bedrooms to audience rooms. As the monarchs introduced a few different orders of chivalry over the years, there are also some rooms dedicated to them. There is a room for the Order of the Polar Star, another room for the Royal Order of the Seraphim, and so on.
Maybe the most prestigious award in the world is the Nobel Prize. Apart from the Nobel Peace Prize, the Nobel Prizes are awarded in the city hall of Stockholm. In 2001, the Nobel Museum opened in Stockholm, which was the next place to visit for me. In here you can find the history of the inception of the Nobel Prizes and temporary exhibition about Martin Luther King Jr. who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, one year after his famous speech.
The probably most popular museum in Stockholm though is the Vasa Museum. The Vasa was a ship built in the 1620s by order of Swedish king for demonstrating the great power of his empire. As he was continually changing his mind about the design of the vessel and demanding to include a higher number of cannons every time, the ship’s buoyancy was put in danger. In fact, after being hit by a mild gust, she sank during her maiden voyage while still being in the harbor of Stockholm. 333 years later, she was recovered, and the museum was built around her.
As the museums had to prepare for the Kultunatt, they all closed at 17:00. During the one hour wait for them to reopen again, I went to eat real Swedish Köttbullar with mashed potatoes and lingonberries at Sjöcafeet. Afterward, I was fit again to continue with the Kultunatt, starting back at the Vasa Museum, as I didn’t manage to see everything on the first visit. Of course, there was quite a queue for the museum building up. On the same island, there is also the Spritmuseum showcasing alcoholic beverages in the context of culture and society. It also included a temporary exhibition about food consumption and consumer behavior in general. Just a few meters further, the Nordic Museum waited to be visited, showing the history of Swedish culture. The focus for the Kulturnatt was put on how Swedish people dressed throughout the decades.
4.500 steps.
Two days before, I coincidentally read a mail from SAS stating that strikes might occur due to ongoing negotiations with their pilots. As my flight wasn’t booked with SAS directly, but via a travel agency, I had to talk to them for asking what was going to happen now. But my flight was not officially canceled yet. So I had to wait. On the next day, I rechecked the status of my flight and saw that it was canceled now. After talking to the agency again, they couldn’t book an alternative flight for me, for organizational reasons. So I had to see for myself how I would be traveling back home. I found a flight operated by a company I never heard of before, with a stop in a city I have never heard if before. And I started at Stockholm Bromma Airport now, instead of Arlanda, which in the end didn’t make any difference in my travel time though. But the 2,5 h stop in Växjö did.
Unfortunately, the Växjö Småland Airport didn’t have a transit area, so after having walked from the aircraft to the airport building, I was already out of the security area. So I had to go through another security check for getting to the gate. THE gate. There was exactly one. As only five flights departed from that airport in total on that day, they don’t need more. It’s the smallest international airport I ever visited. But it was relaxing as well. I used the time to continue the book I was reading, and soon enough it was time to board the same aircraft again for the flight to Berlin. In the end, I landed safely at Berlin-Tegel Airport and was happy to be back home.

So, it’s taken a bit of time to get this blog up… but, in this forth blog post in my #StockholmSeries, I reflect on visits to two neighbouring museums in Stockholm — ArkDes and Moderna Museet…
I came across ArkDes — the Swedish Centre for Architecture and Design — while I was exploring places to visit on this research trip.
I saw that “Admission to ArkDes is free throughout 2025” which was fantastic, but I was also really intrigued by a project they’re running — Unboxing, which runs every day for two hours enabling you to meet and chat to one of the museum’s curators.
Unboxing is the place where you, together with the museum’s curators, unpack and explore never-before-seen items from the museum’s underground archives.
I was interested by the concept of bringing the collection into a different space, giving visitors the opportunity to see behind the scenes, and the museum’s commitment to this being available to everyone, everyday. It blurred the line between exhibit and experience — a quiet but clever way to shift how people relate to the space.
I went straight to the space, which was easy to navigate to from the front of the gallery. Unboxing provides the opportunity for the museum to engage with visitors in a different way, gives curators the chance to talk about their passion, and for visitors to experience objects from the collection — for me, this was seeing architectural drawings — in a different way.
Next door at Moderna Museet, the invitation to engage was everywhere: tables with drawing paper, sketchbook stations, scattered books and varied seating. Each space offered a different kind of welcome, always with a gentle prompt to pause, reflect or create. I loved the moments of rest — especially a bench by a floor-to-ceiling window tucked behind a door marked “staff only” — an unintentional but beautiful in-between space.
I also met with staff from both museums, who spoke about the challenges (and small wins) of increasing access and inclusion, from updating signage to navigating funding and policy shifts. It was a reminder that innovation doesn’t always come from big gestures — it often lives in the details.

More than 100 miles north of the Arctic Circle, our Vy train to Narvik climbed an other-worldly landscape of lakes, rivers and waterfalls, dotted with cabins painted in Scandinavia’s iconic Falu red with white trim.
I was thousands of miles from home, and I felt as if I were on another planet.
Population and vegetation were sparse as we climbed in latitude and altitude, crossing through the Scandinavian Mountain range that forms the border between Sweden and Norway.
I have logged more than 40,000 miles by rail, and love trains so much that I’ve made slow train travel the subject of my master’s capstone. I have always been intrigued by the Arctic, drawn to the northern reaches when looking at maps. And for 24 hours in mid-October, I had the privilege of bringing these two interests together with a 637-mile train trip from Stockholm, Sweden, to Narvik, Norway.
After 48 hours in Stockholm with our cousins, my brother Michael and I arrived at Stockholms Centralstation — a 151-year-old transportation hub that draws 200,000 visitors every day — with about 45 minutes to spare, my bags a little heavier than when I first arrived in the Swedish capital.
Our sleeper train would take us through Swedish forests, over steep mountains and down to the Norwegian port city of Narvik, where we would catch a 4-hour bus ride even farther north to Tromsø, the third largest city above the Arctic Circle.
I grabbed one last cardamom bun at Stockholms Centralstation — my fourth in 48 hours — before we boarded. I had always associated cardamom with Middle Eastern food, but Sweden and Norway consume 18 and 30 times more cardamom than the global median, and cardamom buns were everywhere in Stockholm. Not knowing where I would find one again, I couldn’t resist one more.
When the train rolled in to the station, we found our car and boarded, joining a crowd of passengers from other parts of the world. I heard Italian, Chinese, and a lot of non-native English.
We had booked a couchette, a small space for six people, two benches facing each other by day, three beds on each side by night. I was hoping we’d have the space to ourselves, but we had the next best thing: just one other passenger, a quiet youngish man in a striped t-shirt and a baseball cap who had a bunk at the very top.
Mike and I didn’t stay long in the couchette. As soon as the attendant checked our tickets, we headed to the dining car, where we could sit at a table and enjoy some Bottenvikkens brews from northern Sweden and be around other passengers.
For dinner, I couldn’t pass up the most unique dish — reindeer stew with potatoes, mushrooms and lingonberries. Other offerings included folded flatbread with fried egg and Jokkmokk-sausage, and classic Swedish shrimp sandwich. Each boxed dinner bore the words “We proudly serve food made from scratch in Luleå.”
After dinner, I broke into the sampler pack of aquavit that I had purchased at the liquor store in the Åhléns department store in Stockholm.
One after another, we split four tiny bottles, each one with a different combination of flavors, including dill, caraway, rosemary, citrus, cumin, anise, sherry and cinnamon.
I split each between two glasses, and as we would do throughout our weeklong trip, Mike and I toasted with the Scandinavian “skål” first tapping each other’s glass, then tapping our own glass to the table as a toast to the house before taking the first sip.
Back at the couchette, we made our beds as quietly as we could, knowing that someone else was above us. I would have hated to be in his position, so close to the ceiling. I slept relatively well, waking up every so often to peek outside, in vain, to see if I could see the Northern Lights.
I knew that the restaurant car would open at 5 am and, wanting to be among the early risers, I got up at 5:30 to head down there.
The train was stopped at the Älvsbyn station, and as I made my way to the restaurant car, I found an open door and stuck my head out for fresh air. There I met a train attendant who told me we were stuck for a bit, awaiting information on when we could proceed. I sat and had my tea, texting with my mom and waiting — and waiting — and waiting.
I had oatmeal with cardamom, granola and lingonberries, and we waited some more.
After an hour of “we will know soon,” we were told that due to track problems ahead, we would have to take a bus to Boden and board a new train there, not arriving in Narvik until after 5 pm, long after our bus — and a final subsequent bus — to Tromsø would have departed.
At around 9:30 am, a bus arrived to take us to Boden. It meandered through Swedish forestland, the first of many, many, many miles of it that we would see in the coming hours.
I was disappointed to learn that the train we would board at Boden was a day train, lacking many of the amenities of our night train, namely, my favorite one, the restaurant car. We could buy food and drinks, but with no communal place to eat, we would have to take them back to our seats. We were assigned two window seats, one behind another.
The portion of the trip north of Boden is on a stretch of track known as the Iron Ore Line, which connects Luleå, Sweden, on the Gulf of Bothnia, with Narvik, Norway, on the North Sea.
The line was completed in 1903 to bring iron ore from Sweden to Narvik. Trains on this line have run on electric power since at least 1923 (while the vast majority of track in the United States remains non-electrified a century later). The line still transports iron ore from Kiruna, Svappavaara and Malmberget, as well as shipments of food, to the north, and fish to the south.
Watching the forests pass us by, I tried to detect changes as we moved north into a different climate. Most of the route seemed to be a dense mix of birches that were losing their leaves — a few weeks ahead of the brilliant yellow trees in Stockholm — and conifers.
As we neared the Arctic Circle, the birches had lost all their leaves, and they seemed to be fewer in number. The conifers, too, were fewer, as the dense forests grew more sparse.
What was also sparse here — noise. I like to chat with other people on trains, but this car was silent. We seemed to be the only Americans on board. Other passengers included a young British couple, a middle aged Scottish couple that we would bump into outside a pub in Narvik later that night, a group of about eight Asian people, and the rest seemed Norwegian, Swedish or German.
A walk to the coach area adjacent to the bistro was a much different story — a group of Italians were talking loudly and fast. I loved to hear it and wished we were seated with them.
Crossing the Arctic Circle was not as eventful as I expected. I had marked the spot on my Google maps a couple weeks prior to the trip so that I would know the exact moment we crossed. We passed a sign marking the spot — Polcirkeln — just before the mark on my phone. In any case, I had never before been above the Arctic Circle, so it was an exciting moment — and we still had miles and miles and miles to go.
Most of my long-distance train travel has been in the United States, where I marvel at the vast expanses of open space. With an average density of 35 people per square kilometer, the United States is half as dense as Europe, which has 73 people per square kilometer. However, for this trip, I was traveling through countries far less dense than even the United States: Sweden has 23 people per square kilometer, and Norway has only 17, about half the density of the United States. The land here was wide open.
As we pressed farther north, the train did not take on many new passengers, meaning the train, too, was not densely populated. We mostly discharged passengers, especially at Kiruna, a mining town in Swedish Lapland with about 23,000 inhabitants.
The landscape continued to change. The forested hills of southern Sweden were replaced by flatter land, shorter trees, and lots of lakes. In the distance, we could begin to see the Scandinavian Mountains, the range that runs the length of the border between Sweden and Norway, which we would soon be crossing.
After Kiruna, we could really spread out, which for me meant that I could move from the left side of the train to the right to take photos and video. It was here that we engaged in conversation with some fellow passengers.
Lars, from Bavaria, was going to Abisko, where he planned to take two 20-km hikes before continuing on to the Lofoten archipelago for a few days, and then down to Bodø by bus, and by train farther the south, to be possibly followed by a ferry to Denmark. He was clearly a fan of traveling by land and sea — and had the time to do so.
Ann, from Aarhus, was now living in Tromsø, traveling back north by land because of the detrimental effects air travel has on the climate. She was frustrated by how long and expensive the ride was, and how governments fell short of making it easier for people to make the right choices. Our delay would make her long trip longer and more costly for her. I shared her frustration, but reminded her that much of Europe is light years ahead of the United States when it comes to climate-friendly travel options.
I can’t say enough about the last few hours of that train ride.
After Abisko, the train began to climb the Scandinavian Mountains, reaching a height of about 1,700 feet above sea level, alongside mountains that towered much higher.
The word tundra always connoted to me some distant exotic landscape, something one finds in a nature book or a textbook. Now, I was riding through it, seeing it with my own eyes.
Mosses, lichens and low shrubs offered some color against the rugged, exposed rock. Birches that had long lost their leaves appeared here and there. If not for the sporadic red and gray cabins, I would have thought that a wildfire had recently wiped out this area.
To be more specific, we were crossing through a biome known as the Scandinavian Montane Birch Forests and Grasslands, a tundra ecoregion that spans much of Norway, as well as parts of northern Sweden and Finland.
Though I couldn’t identify them at the time, I later learned that many of the low shrubs I was seeing was likely a mix of crowberry, reindeer lichen, cloudberry, bilberry and wolf’s bane.
The trees were largely downy birches — I could easily identify birches by their white bark — that would grow no taller than 2 to 3 meters, but also may have included aspen, Scots pine, juniper, grey alder, rowan, goat willow and bird cherry.
We passed many alpine lakes that would soon freeze over under the coming polar night. Under the surface likely swam char, trout, tench and minnow.
In Sweden, the lakes all ended in -jávri (Báktájávri, Loktajávri, Vássejávri) the word for “lake” in the Northern Sami language. Once we crossed to Norway, they ended -vatnet (Brudeslørvatnet, Hansenvatnet, Telegrafvatnet) Norwegian for “the water.”
The sun hung low near the horizon, and I was grateful that despite the delay, we were not passing through this stretch in darkness. As I publish this in mid-November, sunset in Kiruna is 1:57 pm. On December 10, the sun will set at 11:48 am, and not rise again until 11:25 am on January 2.
In our destination of Narvik, the sun remains below the horizon from December 6 to January 7.
As we continued westward toward Norway, we hugged the side of mountains, going through several tunnels and snow sheds. Across the valley, I could see waterfalls, like ribbons spaced out on the side of the mountains. I spent much of the last hour or so in the back of the train, where I had space to myself to open and close windows on either side, and take video out of the left, right and rear of the train.
We made several stops in remote towns I could neither pronounce — Låktatjåkka, Vassijaure, Katterkåkk, Riksgränsen — nor imagine living in.
We crossed the Sweden-Norway border inside a tunnel, with the colors of the Swedish flag painted inside, changing over to the colors of the Norwegian flag.
The rail line from the border to Narvik is known as the Ofoten line, and it brought us from an elevation of 1,700 feet down to sea level over the course of 27 miles, as we made the final stretch to our destination.
Soon, we could see a body of water below, the Rombaken, a 12-mile long fjord that was the site of several naval battles during the 1940 Battle of Narvik. The fjord branches out from Narvik’s Ofotfjorden.
As we passed the massive suspension bridge that connects Narvik to Øyjorda across the fjord, we knew it was time for us to gather our bags, say farewell to Ann — with the chance we might see her on our predawn bus ride 12 hours later — and disembark, 637 miles from Stockholm and 130 miles above the Arctic circle.
At Narvik, we walked a half mile through a cloudy mist to the Scandic hotel. At nearly $200, it was the most expensive place to stay, but it was also closest to the bus station, it had a sky bar, and I was fairly confident it could be reimbursed by either the rail company or my credit card insurance.
It didn’t disappoint. The sky bar was amazing, with a nearly 360-degree view of the city. I can’t imagine being there to see either the Northern Lights or the midnight sun. But in our case, it was a cloudy and drizzly night, without much to see in the sky, but the view of the town was nonetheless fascinating.
After a drink and a massive charcuterie board, we left for Narvikguten pub, making a small loop up a hill to see what we could of the full moon. As we entered the pub, we ran into a Scottish couple from the train. I felt bad that they didn’t stick around, saying the prices were “too dear” for them, and that their pounds were especially weak these days. They were in Narvik just to check out the Arctic, heading back south soon and continuing on to Spain after.
We took seats at the bar, realizing quickly that not food would be served there. Into our second beer, we decided that dinner was not entirely necessary after the charcuterie board. We struck up a conversation with the guy next to me, Gus, originally from Oslo and now living in the north with his fiancé. He was a bartender at the bar, drinking there on his day off, stepping out occasionally for a hand-rolled cigarette.
It was interesting — and refreshing — to hear his impressions of Americans. He saw a disconnect between Americans’ personalities and what he reads in the news. We are a welcoming people, he said, based on the conversations he had with Americans on all sides of the political spectrum. But if you judged us based on what you saw in the news, what would you think, I asked? I’d think you were absolutely out of your minds crazy, he said.
During our conversation, our bartender handed Gus two buttons, meant for Mike and me. They bore the name and logo of the pub. They said it was their stamp of approval on us as visitors, and that they welcomed us back any time.
After three or four or more beers, we called it a night, returned the to sky bar for a nightcap and a bag of chips — and then turned in, alarms set for 4:15 am to make our 5:30 am bus ride, an additional four hours to the North.

Have you ever found yourself sympathizing with a known racist person or group of people? If so, this article will provide you with a lantern to make it out of the mental fog. Racism is a form of abuse. While most people do not develop Stockholm Syndrome during an abusive encounter, some do. They produce a psychological response that causes them to develop positive associations with an abuser.
You’ve probably heard about examples of Stockholm Syndrome in bank robberies, kidnappings, and domestic violence circumstances. However, there is no reason why we shouldn’t analyze how race factors into abusive relationships. I suggest that Black people and people of color who develop positive feelings about racists actually suffer from Racial Stockholm Syndrome.
Consider Uncle Ruckus from The Boondocks animated series. He is a dark-skinned Black man who often denies his Blackness, praises white people while condemning Black people. For example, Uncle Ruckus sang, “Colored folks talkin’ about ‘Save Me!’ / Wasn’t nothin’ wrong with slavery! / At least we got good food back then — uh huh, uh huh! / White man sho could be yo friend.”

In Los Angeles, the suburbs would always grow boring- a boredom similar to the tiring feeling of hearing the same song played over and over. At Princeton, you feel like you’re living in Neverland- nothing seems to change, and you always have this warm sense of quiet comfort. In Beijing, the weekends are occupied with sight seeing and night life, and the weekdays always seem to be moving in some direction.
Stockholm, Sweden is the most stable place I have ever lived. It’s also one of the most beautiful. Here’s a quick peep of the fountain right outside of my apartment:
Whenever I need a break from life, I always take a few minutes to sit by the water. Every few seconds, the wind blows the mist in your direction and you feel a momentary, gentle spray. It feels nice, like a cool, refreshing blanket that wraps around your shoulders. This is especially comforting when I think about home and the happier, safer days at Princeton.
And here’s a little view of the bridge connecting the main island with Gamla stan, the “old town” of Stockholm that’s apparently a tourist trap:
During breaks and weekends, my friends and I would take short strolls around the city, and since the majority of Stockholm is built on water, the beautiful views are never-ending. Occasionally, I would find time to walk around the city on my own. As much as I hate being alone, I could explore this place for hours, aimlessly wandering and appreciating the bits and pieces of Europe.
For those of you who don’t know, I’m here interning for a company called Nova Global, a top-talent network that finds talented people around the world and yada yada yada. Work has been amazing, and I absolutely love my coworkers-they’ve been a family to me.
But oddly enough, the memories that I’ve appreciated the most belong to the little lessons of the day-to-day life. Every single morning, I find time to go to the gym and exercise before work. And every single afternoon when I get back from work, I do the same. I’ve cooked nearly every other meal (Nikita, my friend/roommate, cooks the other half), and when the sink looks a little messy I’ll hop right on the dishes. Thanks to Nikita (he used to be a Latvian pro swimmer), I’ve learned how to prepare huge meals that are so healthy, you’d definitely have plenty left over unless you see the guy next to you scarfing down each last bit. I’m really grateful he’s here- he’s been like an older brother to me.
After reading this over, part of me wants to cringe at how spoiled I probably sound, but I don’t think I’ve been this happy for months. The first week was hard, but I finally feel like the background noise is subsiding and I’m regaining clarity and focus again. I’m finally back in my own skin.
Part of me will always be a little sad that I can’t return to the naive, safe-haven of my Sophomore year at Princeton, but I’m happy, and I’m remembering what it means to take life in strides. Week one has done me well, and I know that I’ll always find some way to appreciate each day.
A few notes about Stockholm:
Yesterday, my friends and I decided to take an impromptu cycling trip through Lidingö, a nature reserve slightly northeast of where we lived. Within half an hour, our surroundings transformed from high-rises and busy city intersections into miles and miles of forest and greenery.
Needless to say, it didn’t take long for a group of foreigners to get unbelievably lost on a never-ending trail of that. And every time I shouted to Nikita and asked if he knew where we were, we just laughed and shrugged. It was pure exploration, with no direction and no destination. It’s really been quite some time since I’ve felt so free.
Saturday afternoon, a day prior to the three hour excursion through “fucking” Lidingö (sorry folks, it’s an inside joke), Lucy and Tara convinced me to explore parts of Söldermalm with them. Similar to my little cycling adventure, most of our trip consisted of aimless wandering, letting our minds digest all the “new” that was around us.
For some reason, the entire time I wouldn’t stop chirping about how I wanted to walk along the water. Söldermalm was beautiful- arguably the most beautiful area of Stockholm I’ve seen yet- but part of me was drawn so strongly toward the water. And somehow, we eventually found ourselves standing near a cliffside that held the most breath-taking view I’ve ever seen. There was something special about the sight that restored that warm, comforting feeling that I’ve felt lacking for a while. It’s probably the happiest moment that I’ve had since I’ve landed in Stockholm.
That was when I decided that I wanted my summer to be characterized by serendipity. Week One was characterized by routine and stability, and it’s done me well. But weeks Two through Ten are going to be filled with aimless exploration and travel. I’m booked to fly off to some new country nearly every weekend, and I’m searching for something “new” everyday. It’s almost like I’ve grown an addiction to novelty.
If there’s anything I’ve learned from “fucking” Lindingö, it’s that it’s OK to get incredibly dehydrated and lost in a forest for three hours. We made more than a few wrong turns, but everyone made it out (more-or-less) alright.
Here’s a list of “new” things I’ve checked off or have yet to check off:
Part of me wishes that my mind read like a book, and that it would scribble down every moment I encountered just as it happened- a Carpe Diem recorder of some sort, I guess. But it doesn’t and it can’t, so I’ll do my best to capture how important this weekend in Amsterdam was to me.
Better yet, let me clarify: I’ll do my best to capture how important this burger-loving fiend is to me (sorry JD, but the picture’s gotta go online):
On July 15, 2015, JD Case touched down in Stockholm, and that’s when the (stupid decisions) adventures of Nathan in Europe really began. Europe, or at least the small portion of it I’ve seen, is great, but there’s always this thin cloak of nostalgia for the lazy, naïve days of year two at Princeton. There’s plenty I miss- the spontaneous trips to Starbucks, the 3 AM League games, the Papa Johns, the 3 AM Papa Johns- and I couldn’t have been more grateful that a part of that was able to visit me halfway around the world.
Last week, I surrendered my summer to serendipity, and the aimless exploration continued when we landed in Amsterdam. We hadn’t booked a place to stay until the day of, but JD was able to nab us a few nice spots for a really good price. Here’s a glimpse of the view outside of the aptly named “RoomMate Hotel”:
If Stockholm’s a stable, structured meeting where everyone in the room is prim, proper, and on time, Amsterdam’s a massive, rambunctious bar where everyone’s intoxicated by early evening. Perhaps it was the company, but the city of bikes and beer is definitely one of my favorite places to be. For those of you who don’t know, JD’s spending this summer traveling the entire world. During our conversations, he mentioned that he never missed home much because with every new place, there was always something new to see and experience. And in Amsterdam, that statement couldn’t be any more true.
Wherever you go, the bright lights that reflect off the canal waters always seem to follow you- it really makes the city feel alive by night. When we weren’t lost or eating massive amounts of food, we were in some interesting bar sipping on beers or fancy cocktails. At Vesper Bar (a place that James Bond would go to for cocktails, and with good reason), I noticed their genius motto written on the blackboard after a few drinks in: “Summer is a time when you drink triple, see double, and act single.” It’s been a few days since I’ve been back, and I think I can speak for both of us when I say that we respected that quote quite well.
Of course, the trip ended exactly as any adventure with JD Case and Nathan Lam would: food poisoning. The burger place we ate at above was great, but for some stupid reason we decided to hike twenty minutes to this other place called “Burgermeester” to grab dinner before I left, and that decision absolutely killed us. After an hour of (puking) lying on our beds in the room, we stumbled outside to enjoy a bit of Amsterdam minutes before I had to leave.
We sat by the water and talked about the “strange corners of life,” tossing little pebbles off the edge to see ripples across the surface. Moments before my Uber arrived to take me to the airport, a little lady bug landed on my hand.
They say that’s supposed to be a sign of good luck, and I sure hope it’s true. I’ve got eight weeks left to do and see everything.
A few things that serendipity brought us:
P.S. Don’t worry Chris and Jerry, there’s no way we forgot about you guys:
Here we have Chris 2Changz, shirtless as ever and with us in spirit and Snapchat. Don’t worry buddy, I’ve collected a few bottle caps, and JD and I have something way better for you when we get back to campus. Jerry, you lucked out. I couldn’t find any embarrassing pictures, but I’ll fix that up soon. I can’t wait to see what happens next year in Brown 423.
As you can see, it’s well into week five, but I’m going to do my best to do last week justice. Life in Europe hasn’t grown any less interesting, but it’s been raining lately, and the days in Stockholm feel as though they’re growing shorter and shorter. It’s not a bad thing — rather, it’s as though time has simply lost the weight that it held weeks prior, and that I’ve stopped counting the days. Novelty is always perfect for tying your mind to the present, and when you travel, you become fixated on exploration. It’s addicting, really.
Copenhagen, unlike Amsterdam, was peaceful, and I often found myself subsumed by random thoughts and musings about all the things that’ve happened the past few weeks. Even though it really hasn’t been long, I think it’s fair to say that I’ve matured a considerable amount. The bulk of the trip was spent with Lucy and Tara, but there were pockets of time where I wandered off, as usual, and stumbled upon those little treasures that make traveling worthwhile.
But I’ll get to that later. First, I want to share all the weird things that happened. I feel like that’s more fun.
“It’s like a theme park, and the theme is weed.” — Tara Ramdonee
Last week, JD and I stumbled into the Red Light District. This week, Tara, Lucy, and I discovered the Green Light District. Taking Nikita’s wonderful advice, we made it an obligation to explore Christiania, the “most ghetto, but safe” place in Copenhagen. Two things ran through my mind when I heard that statement. First, everywhere is probably safe for Nikita (the Latvian White Bear), because nobody in their right mind would threaten him. Second, if it was a ghetto, safe place, I imagined that Nikita probably was talking about some hipster hangout.
What we found was exactly as Tara aptly described above. I would’ve taken a few photos, but there’re signs posted everywhere that have a cancel sign over a camera, indicating that I would probably be badly harmed if I let the camera whore inside of me take over. There was weed. Everywhere. If you bought two burgers, you’d get a joint for free. I could probably count the number of people who weren’t high out of their minds on my hand. Don’t worry mum, we didn’t smoke. We did, however, grab a few beers and have a pretty great conversation. However, the rest of the night wasn’t exactly noteworthy. While looking for some clubs in the area, we somehow stumbled upon some eighteen year old’s Danish birthday party where they played Soulja Boy Tell ‘Em.
On Sunday morning, Lucy recommended that we go to this nice little cafe called Bankeraat for lunch. She kept talking about these “stuffed animals” and how these things were dressed up, and knowing the Hello Kitty die-hard that Lucy is, I expected something similar to Sanrio. What we found was this:
Going to the restroom was an even more interesting experience. First off, the rooms with toilets don’t have lights. Second, they have jump scares like this around the corner when you go down this steep, curled staircase into the secluded basement that houses the restroom that people use on a day to day basis:
But other than the fact that I felt like I’ve just stumbled upon the set of American Horror Story, the food was good.
All of these experiences were humorous and interesting, in a way, simply because they didn’t align with expectations. What I’m learning from all this traveling is that the world becomes unbelievably exciting when you escape expectation and let yourself float off in any direction you feel is right. I’ll talk about one last experience, and it’ll be the more sentimental of the three. Ready yourself for the strange abstractions.
Lucy was convinced- absolutely convinced- that the Little Mermaid Statue would be one of the prime tourist attractions of København. And she was right, but not for the reasons she thought were right. Here’s a picture of the Little Mermaid and all its glory:
That’s it. A dinky boulder with Ariel chilling up top. I think my friend Eric Sohng actually would’ve made a much better mermaid than the statue itself. In fact, I have photographic evidence (Warning: Adult Content). What was amazing about it was that heaps and crowds of tourists huddled around the rock, fighting for a prize spot with the star of Copenhagen.
However, there was value there, and it was in the water. I think I’ve slowly come to realize that if I were to belong to any element in the world, I belonged to the water. Right next to the statue, there was a small, unassuming strip of land where the water met Copenhagen.
For a good while, I sat there alone and retreated far beneath the surface into my thoughts. The water felt so vast and immense, and it kept me entranced during the entirety of Lucy’s photo-op (probably thirty minutes). And somehow, something unexplainable in me clicked, and I felt a pull from the world to explore everything. By that, I mean parts of South America and the rest of Asia sometime next year, etc. You can’t really explain moments like these, but they shape you and change you, and they grant you new freedoms that slowly become part of your basic human needs.
Quote of the trip:
“Shall we summon an Über?”
- Tara Ramdonee, our British friend
Perhaps it’s that I’ve grown too busy with work and travel. Perhaps it’s that I’ve really just stopped counting the weeks as I have the past month and fully adopted that Carpé Diem lifestyle. Perhaps it’s both (it’s probably both), but for some odd reason, I have been finding it so much more difficult to sit myself down to continue documenting my trip here. But I’ve started it, and I wouldn’t be proud of myself if I stopped it mid-way. Old Nathan would be fine with that. New Nathan is too, but for some reason there’s a bit more guilt attached to quitting midway.

Berlin is fucking rebellious, and I love it. In Stockholm, if you act slightly out of place in a public setting, you’ll probably be arrested shortly afterward for disturbing the peace (of course I’m exaggerating, but you get what I’m saying). So being in a city where there’s graffiti on every building, drug dealers at every metro stop, and amazing street performers scattered throughout sidewalks was especially refreshing for me.
Story time: As short-lived as the trip was, it was full of unexpected encounters, and not in the same respect as the other trips have been. Because rather than encountering beautiful vantage points and little local treasures, I shared some odd coincidences with people who I either met or, more or less, shared ‘peculiar’ ties with.
These coincidences happened a few times, but I’m only going to talk about the mind-blowing one because, well, who the hell wants to hear about anything else. On the last night I was staying in Berlin, Ray decided to stay at home. Makes total sense for him, because he doesn’t enjoy going out all that much. But for me, staying in would have been a crime because, well, I was in Berlin. And Berlin’s insane.
So I had a two options. I could try and make friends with strangers at the hostel and venture through the night with them, or I could go solo and pray that I would have fun and not look like that creepy lonely rando that you make a conscious effort to avoid on a night out.
Option One failed miserably, because everyone I spoke with in the hostel was 30+ years old and talking about heroine/death metal. Left with Option Two, I went off in some random direction and, as per the advice of my brilliant friend Stefan, just followed crowds. When I got off the metro, I saw a group of people speaking English with pretty strong American accents (yes, we have accents), and my first reaction was “Those kids are definitely in high school.” My second reaction was “Those kids are definitely from California.” I was completely off with the first guess, but spot on for the second one.
Ironically, when I passed by the group, I overheard one of the girls whisper to her friend that I was definitely from California. I guess cut-off tank tops and joggers throw you right in that bucket. And effectively, me being the desperate, lonely rando looking for friends, I turned around and, well, made friends.
Two of them were from Orange County, and all of them were juniors at Northwestern. And the crazy part is that they’re all relatively good friends with the group of Northwestern students that I met in Beijing last summer. Details aside, we had a pretty fun night, and I’m meeting up with a few of them when I get back to California in September. Despite all the wanderlust I’ve been feeling lately, there was always this anxiety attached to the thought of traveling alone. But that night helped me realize that when you’re more or less screwed with no friends, you’ll find ways to meet people.
—
Other than that, most of the trip consisted of photo-ops and (even more) aimless wandering. You could probably get the gist of the trip by scrolling through my album, since I upload enough photos to irritate the majority of my friends list, but I’ll skim through a few highlights.
Bonanza Cafe. Cool place. It’s where I wrote the Week 4 post, so if I seemed over dramatic/sentimental, it’s because they were playing in Nils Frahm in the background.
I always have these recurring nightmares where I either get hit by a car or drive off a cliff. So, being the grim and morbid child that I am, this photo’s actually pretty important to me.
For some reason, this section of East Side Gallery made me so happy I almost cried. Not entirely sure why, but I guess it was a short reassurance that even if things go to shit, everything will more or less be OK.
Random Notes:
The thing with counting is that people usually count what they’re not all too fond of. We count push ups, the minutes of a long, boring meeting, the number of days before we can see a loved one again- we count because, in those few moments, our mind becomes fixated on the passing of time.
And quite frankly, when I first landed in Stockholm, I started counting. I counted the few hours I slept each night when getting accustomed to the early rise and late shine of Stockholm Sun. I counted the number of weeks until JD arrived, and the number of surface-level trips to various countries that I used as superficial fuel to rejuvenate myself. And, by nature of this blog, I counted the weeks. Each week was tinted with its own ordeal that made me mildly uncomfortable at best, and to compensate for the discomfort, I wrote. Every point in your life- even the dry bits- can seem so much more interesting when you put pen to paper and document it all in story. Unfortunately, when that happens, you run the risk of living for photographs and “serendipity,” while casting everything else off as mundane. Trust me, it’s a pretty miserable perspective to have on life. Happiness becomes short-lived.
Roughly two weeks ago, I had a conversation with Nicole (Andrea’s Girlfriend! Go Andrea :D!) about how we’re both restless souls- the way four walls can transform into prison bars if too much time is spent at home. Eventually, we also spoke about how ridiculously unsustainable that is. And thankfully, when I started complaining about the the ‘vanilla-ness’ of Sweden and ranting about my wonderful wanderlust and need for novelty, she called me out on, well, how ridiculously unsustainable I was. Well Nicole, you got through to me pretty well, and I am infinitely grateful for that.
Recently, I haven’t written much, and I think it’s because I’ve stopped counting. I still love seeing the world and exploring and wandering, but it’s no longer what keeps me afloat. It’s been a process, and I can’t deny that, but I’ve really learned to find joy in the bits and pieces of life that I would have otherwise disregarded as ‘boring.’ Here’s a short list to give you an idea:
Come Friday, and I’ll be in London with my supposed ‘fiancée’, and come September 4th, I’ll be home. I can’t say that I’ve emerged a completely different person, but I can say that right now, I feel happy- sustainably happy- in the way that almost seems infectious enough to drown out the white noise.

“If life were as simple as a day in July, would we honor it so?” — P. J. Gordon
Can we honor the act of doing nothing more often? Would we tire of the nothingness? This reminds me of what some people picture retirement as, and I’ve witnessed many who tire from nothingness; they yearn for regimented days of rules and restrictions. They worked all of their lives to be free, and now that they’re free, they miss their cage. It reminded me of Stockholm Syndrome. When someone has been held captive, they develop a psychological bond of trust and belonging with their captor. In my poem, I put the captor as our life’s occupation.
Stockholm Syndrome is what retirees fear.
We worked all our lives waiting on the year
“What will we do with all the extra hours?”
“Guess we can finally tend the flowers.”
“What will become of the position I held?”
“Will they remember me? All I regaled?”
Years gone, time spent being fully engaged,
Almost free, but it’s hard to leave the cage.
~ P. J. Gordon
Retirement can be likened to graduation from high school. You worked hard for it, you’ve done it, now what?

Most of the human suffering in the modern world boils down to our fear of death. This is not surprising, since modern mythology stipulates that matter is primary and basically all there is.
If nothing exists beyond, above or beneath–whichever spatial metaphor you want to use–the physical universe, every physical and practical expression within its confines appears to be very important, such as gender, age, nationality, organizations, career, money, politics, laws, hospitals, formal education, formal science and titles.
Until it is not, because we all die. How unfair.
The good news is that death is merely a transition from one state to another, just like birth is. Death and birth are exactly the same kind of event, only experienced from opposite angles. We come in and we go out. It is like a long breath.*)
Suffering and the idea of an ultimate death both stem from the illusion of time.
The above means that when we are afraid to die, we are actually afraid to go home. We desperately hold on to this temporary existence, as if a temporary sojourn could ever be a true home. We persuade ourselves that the stage play we are in, this video game, this boot camp, is all we have. We anxiously pay attention to the sergeants of the boot camp who shout out their orders
One might even describe our predicament as a prison we fear leaving. This is actually a pertinent analogy, since this phenomenon is well documented — the psychology of it is well described in the wonderful film The Shawshank Redemption.
We desperately hold on to this temporary existence, as if a temporary sojourn could ever be a true home
When I look at our nonacceptance of death and unconscious rejection of home from a spiritual perspective, I see a collective Stockholm syndrome. A Stockholm syndrome on a species level, basically.
We have developed an understanding, even sympathy, for our prison guards, who constantly lead us to believe that this physical world with its societal structure, is all there is, and if we want to make the most of life, we’d better get out there and seize all the goodies we are able to lay our hands on and reach for as desirable a position in the structure we possibly can.
Of course, we can’t all acquire the same amount of things, and not everybody will be able to gain the most coveted positions. We learn this early on, and with that lesson comes another hard ”truth”: Life is not easy. Who said life should be easy? Some win, some lose, but hey, you just have to learn to bite the bullet and do the best of your situation.
But here is the truth: the essence of life is actually very simple. Life is a continuum.
Deep within, underneath the constant chaos of thoughts and feelings, you can sense that you simply are. You are conscious — you are consciousness itself. You experience — you are experience itself. Hence you exist, and you cannot not exist, because that is not an experience. This is all you can ever really, truly, know for certain is real.
Life unfolds from there, and that is all there is to it. All else are temporary mental or emotional constructs.
This physical experience is no doubt immensely important and in many ways a marvelous adventure. But it is not the whole story. Not even close. The best way to approach earthly life is with equanimous curiosity and joy. Not as if it were dead serious. When we open the door to our infinity, a weight is lifted from our hearts.
When we dismiss this simple and self-evident inner knowing life appears complicated. That is when we get the false idea we lack something, and we feel miserable and anxious. Neuroscientists have tried for decades to locate where in the brain consciousness is produced, to no avail, of course. It is in that futile physical search for meaning we become depressed, whether we try to find it in the brain or by hoarding things.
A basic prerequisite for upholding this elaborate matrix is the idea that humans are at the core selfish
We all come into this strange and wondrous place with the inner truth intact. An inkling remains for a few years, but we gradually forget who we really are. We identify with a name, a skill, a position, a story.
For thousands of years a plethora of societal structures have been imposed on us. The guardians of these structures — teachers, doctors, politicians, civil servants, lawyers, soldiers, journalists, researchers, priests, parents — are themselves involuntary pawns in the game, at least the vast majority of them.
A basic prerequisite for upholding this elaborate matrix is the idea that humans are at the core selfish and unreliable, which is why a structural order is needed. We learn that rules and regulations keep this flawed species in check to the benefit of us all. This is a tragic deception. This is, quite frankly, a big lie.
This big lie operates side by side with — and is fueled by — the widespread fear of death.
Someone might object that people were even more scared of death a few hundred years ago, before the introduction of a physicalist worldview, when almost everybody was religious, at least formally.
This might be true, but the difference would be in degree, not in kind, because that ”religiosity” was a very integral part of the matrix. In some ways the Church, for instance, was more materialistic than modern day atheism, whose proponents emphasize humanism. The Church was deeply in cahoots with the secular powers. Priests told people that God needed them to obey the lords of the world as well.
Adhering to a dogmatic, old-school religion is all about pleasing an external God and acquiescing to the hierarchy of His representatives on Earth. And if you don’t, you know which place you will be sent to.
The realization that we are all eternal sparks of God/Source/The One Consciousness is the most forbidden knowledge of all in the traditional Abrahamic religions.
We used science to drag us away from a system of outer oppression to a system of inner oppression
Wait, didn’t we liberate ourselves from all that when science broke with religion? It certainly looked like an attempt. But did we use our new scientific approach to find our way back to our true essence, our core of natural happiness? We did not. We used science to drag us in the opposite direction, away from a system of outer oppression to a system of inner oppression, called materialism.
Either your life is miserable because you are tormented by the constant condemnations of God and the Church, or your life is miserable because you feel the meaninglessness of being a randomly assembled flesh robot. In both cases you feel unfree. Imprisoned.
In the latter case, you may find temporary relief in embracing the system and its rulers, who tell you that all will be well if you just adjust a little bit more to fit into the intricate societal structures. So you try, once more, to do that. And to make the process smoother and less painful, you choose to sympathize with your prison guards.
This is psychologically very understandable as long as you don’t know that there is an alternative. But imagine the sea change in your perspective on life when you realize you can break out of it whenever you want. That all you have been told, and told yourself, about your identity is a chimera. That the essence of you is completely free.
If we all went there, no one would be afraid of death, and no one would want to control anyone or be controlled. The matrix would dissolve itself. It would be obvious there is no need for it.
*) I assume most readers of this essay are with me on what I state about a non-physical reality. However, if any readers are skeptical, simply imagine for a moment that there is a realm we temporarily leave when we are born into physical bodies and go back to when we leave those bodies, i.e. die. It may help to look into the well-documented accounts by people who have had near-death experiences, which by now count in the thousands; practically all of them say that the realm they have visited during those experiences feels very much like their real home and appears far more real than this physical one. New cases are being documented all the time. And then there is the research at the University of Virginia which, believe it or not, seems to confirm young children’s memories of previous lives. There is also other research pointing to a verifiable non-physical reality.

I wasn’t going to write about the election since it gets exhausting. But if you’re like me, you find it increasingly difficult to understand how some of your friends, co-workers, and family members continue to support President Trump. Not because of policy disagreements over everything, although there’s plenty to go around, but because of who Trump is.
Stockholm, Wisconsin is a town of 88 people last time I checked. Almost 70% of them voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012. But most voted for Trump in 2016.
Four years later, it’s time to take an audit of this president before you vote again.
It’s not that everything Trump’s ever done is horrific, although there’s plenty of that to go around, too.
I’m not oblivious to the fact that he got NATO to pay their fair share of expenses defending Europe, despite decades of American presidents asking deaf European nations to pay more. Trump defeated ISIS in Syria. I mean, when’s the last time you even heard of that group since Trump. He brought Israel and numerous Arab countries together. UAE and Bahrain to start, but I have no doubt that we’ll see another four or five peace agreements follow soon. Maybe more.

Many years ago, I used to belong to an online community which is mostly made up of young women in their early twenties. A lot of folks usually send in their questions, queries and stories seeking clarifications and often times, advice.
On a particular day, a lady sent in a long message which signaled that she was pathetic to her abuser and was also very mindful of hurting him.
There were several comments but there was a particular comment which got my attention, the commenter said’ She is suffering from Stockholm’s syndrome.
I was taken aback because the only Stockholm I knew at the time was a city in Sweden and my curiosity got the best of me. I really wanted to know what Stockholm's syndrome meant.
I decided to dig in and do a thorough research and discovered the following;
Stockholm syndrome explained
Stockholm syndrome is an emotional response which happens when an abuser develops positive feelings towards their abusers or captors.
The name came about by a man due to an incident which happened in Stockholm in the year 1973 It’s a story which depicts the loyalty of hostages to their captors.
This illness was named after a bank robbery that occurred in Stockholm, Sweden in 1973.Many of the imprisoned bank employees got sympathetic to the bank robbers during the six-day standoff with authorities.Following their release, some of the bank employees went as far as refusing to testify against the bank robbers in court, and even raised funds to defend them.The term “Stockholm syndrome” was coined by a criminologist and psychiatrist(Nils Bejerot) examining the incident to characterize the affinity some bank staff had for the bank thieves.
What causes Stockholm’s syndrome
1. Overdependent
When you’ve been dependent on your captor/abuser for basic needs, there’s a high tendency of emotional reliance on them.
2. Fair treatment
When hostages have not been threatened or when they’re being treated nicely. It becomes a dent of STOP IT, I LIKE IT
3. When hostages haven’t been dehumanized in any form.
Stockholm Syndrome and children
For situations involving children such as child abuse, there could be an emotional imbalance where the child sees the abuser as a protector especially if the abuser is a close ally or a family. Abuse in this form can be confusing for children because most times, abusers tend to intimidate and threaten their victims from speaking out. At the same time, the abuser also shows love and care to the child. This creates a confusing scenario and can also breed Stockholm syndrome where the child grows up believing the abuser to be a protector rather than a molester.
Stockholm Syndrome and tutors
In the same vein, people who have abusive coaches, tutors and teachers might develop a deep emotional connection with them and rather than see them in the light of the abuse, they create and give excuses for them thereby defending and sympathizing with them.
For Emotional, physical and mental abuse, The victims tend to develop an emotional connection with the abusers because emotional abuse on its own can make a victim develop a trauma bond with the abuser.
A trauma bond is a deep seated bond between an abuser and the person they abuse.
Stockholm Syndrome and sex trafficking
In the movie Gangubai Kathiawadi, which told the story of a young woman who was lured into prostitution and sold off to a sex trafficker, the lady refused to join in the venture because she considered it to be immoral and dishonorable. Day after day, she was subjected to series of inhumane treatment and she knew that in other to survive, she had to join them.
This goes to show that people who are captured and sold off into sex trafficking tend to rely on their dependents for survival. This can create a form of dependence on their abusers.
Is Stockholm Syndrome a mental health disorder?
Even though Stockholm’s syndrome isn’t listed as a formal mental health disorder but rather an emotional response to abuse.
However, there are common symptoms for people who have been victims of abuse such as;
1. Withdrawal
They tend to withdraw from people because most of the time, they find it hard to trust others and tend to believe that every other person is out there to hurt them.
2. Post traumatic stress disorder
PTSD is characterized by failure to recover after a traumatic event or in this case, abuse
3. Sleeplessness
4. Denial
5. feeling of hopelessness, failure, helplessness and often times
6. Depression.
If you or anyone you know is suffering from the Stockholm syndrome, please see a therapist as soon as possible so as to curtail any further imminent serious mental disorder.

25–27 Sep remembered on 8 Oct
After another 12-minute walk from the US embassy, I arrived at Etnografiska Museet, where everything converged.
This was where Peng worked during his time in Sweden, also the home of most of Sven Hedin’s collection. I spent 150 SEK for the ticket. The size of the museum is slightly smaller than I expected, but of course, it wouldn’t be fair to compare it with the British Museum or Musée du quai Branly. The first exhibition I encountered on the ground floor was Yokai, an exhibition about the Japanese Yokai culture (something ghostly or monstrous, but not exactly ghosts or monsters). It was well-curated, informational while entertaining. I was not sure if the credit should go to the Etnografiska Museet or other institutions who co-curated it. However, it was recommendable.
Despite its good quality, for a Taiwanese, Yokai culture is not something unfamiliar, and it also wasn’t the reason of my visit. So I quickly browsed through, and moved upstairs to continue my search.
When I was at the entrance, I saw one of the current exhibitions called “We are Seediq”. I thought to myself that “Oh, there is an indigenous group in Taiwan also called Seediq. What a coincidence.” Turned out that the exhibition was about the indigenous group in Taiwan. The exhibition was small, but again, well-curated and informational.
It is hard to describe how moved I was. I believe that it was the first exhibition that I’ve ever liked in any ethnographic museum. I am sure by now you can imagine, as someone like me, it’s impossible to be completely comfortable, seeing how these items were raided by Eurocentric collectors, explorers, or let’s be honest, colonisers, in the past, and seeing how the cultures were interpreted, as if there weren’t, or aren’t, any actual human beings attached to the said culture. It has always been something fascinating while irritating for me to visit ethnographic museums.
The curatorial concept of this exhibition started with a number of mysterious items as part of the museum collection, from an unsurprisingly problematic source. (What I love about it was also that the “problematic source” was clearly stated in the exhibition.) The reason I said “mysterious”, was because it was actually wrongly labelled as items from Atayal originally, instead of Seediq, due to the mis-categorization from the Japanese colonisation.
“We are Seediq” was co-curated among a number of institutions, including the Seediq National Assembly, and the Indigenous Cultural Heritage Master’s Program of Providence University in Taiwan. The involvement of the “subject’ themselves could be seen everywhere.
First, the title, the “we” implies the existence of human subjects, instead of merely culture or items. It was coming from the mouth of the subjects, not observers. And all the texts written were in three languages — Swedish, English and Chinese. (I know it’s not Seediq, but at least it’s a language that most of the Seediq nowadays can understand.) The interviews of Seediq people were presented as one of the major elements in the centre of the room. The faces and voices were unavoidably seen and heard. What moved me the most was that one of the weaved fabrics in the collection was considered the oldest, documented Seediq weaving pattern preserved in the world. And the museum is working with the organisations in Taiwan to study the pattern in order to recreate them. Even writing about these is making me emotional.
The “collection” here is no longer some “dead” items lying inside a glass vitrine. The “culture” has become alive, moving, working, involving. Then there is a meaning. There is a reason for all of these to happen. I know one might say that the museum should return the stolen items to Taiwan for good. (The texts mentioned that the items were in Taiwan for a time being before being returned to the museum.) I understand it’s not perfect. But honestly, despite the problematic, upsetting source, can we, as Taiwanese, be confident that the items would be well-stored forever, in a professional context on the island? And just reading the texts in the exhibition of a culture that somehow I found adjacent to (I wouldn’t dare to say that it’s mine) in my native language, already gave me goosebumps, which is something I can never dream of seeing in places like the British Museum. I haven’t even started to mention how Taiwan, as a country, as an island with adjacent islands, was being presented correctly in the exhibition, which is again, something I can not dream of in a European context.
After seeing the exhibition, I couldn’t help but make an Instagram story, recommending it, tagging the museum. I received a kind message from someone who runs the account. I genuinely hope that all the exhibitions in ethnographic museums could make me feel this way. I also heard that there is someone from Taiwan working at Etnografiska Museet at the moment. I am sure that helped with what I saw.
Finally, at a corner on the 2nd floor, I found something from Sven Hedin, titled Golden Temple. It’s a model temple he commissioned to make, identical to a temple he encountered in Chengde, China.
I was surprised about how little collections from him were on display, so I asked the friendly staff at the information desk in case I missed anything. She explained that on the ground floor, where the Yokai exhibition is, was Hedin’s collection. but it was removed for the Yokai exhibition. I asked if the collection will come back after Yokai ends. She replied, slightly awkwardly, with a no. I was curious about her reaction, so I googled afterwards. Turned out that the Swedish historian Tommy Lundmark published a book recently, criticising the display of Hedin’s collection in the museum. He believed that the way the collection was displayed touched only lightly, perhaps too lightly, on Hedin’s support of Nazism. Despite that Hedin being a Nazi supporter was not a news anymore, the book seemed to stir more controversies than there was. And the museum, using the coming exhibitions as a cover, removed all the Hedin’s collection, with only the temple left.
It’s a complicated issue. I don’t feel like I have any position to judge. As a researcher, of course I would like to see his collection. However, I also believe that before figuring out a proper way to deal with the problematic history, removing the collection for the time being, was more than understandable.
After the conversation with the helpful staff, I moved on with my day.
The next stop was Hedinsgatan. After I arrived, I found out that “gatan” means “street” in Swedish, instead of “garden”, as I originally thought due to its pronunciation. So, Hedinsgatan, is a street named after Sven Hedin in Stockholm. It was just an ordinary street. I couldn’t find anything special. I also couldn’t figure out the reason why this street in particular was chosen to be given the name. It was not specially close to where he used to live, or the cemetery, or the museum. It remained a mystery to me till this day.
Finally, it was five. We were back to Historiska Museet. I couldn’t find anything from Sven Hedin here, however, after knowing what happened to Etnografiska Museet, I doubt if the museum would want to point out which items were actually from Hedin anyway.
A cute anecdote happened was that, when I arrived, there was a celebratory event of the independence day of Armenia. A lady downstairs asked me to sign on the RSVP list, and I was confused, saying that I was only here to see the exhibition, so she let me pass. After going upstairs, witnessing the champaign and catering of the party, I wished I had signed so I could join. I thought about blending in, however, with my cheap, slightly torn out jeans, and the oversized jacket as a charity from my friend in Berlin last year after losing all my clothes in a luggage, I had a feeling that the plan of blending in naturally would fail. So, I tearfully walked away from the champaign and the finger food.
After the museum, I stopped by a supermarket to grab some bread, cold cuts, spreads and a light beer (which had a significant meaning that I only understood in a few days). I sat down by a beautiful harbour, and started my dinner. I was surprised that I couldn’t see anyone else doing what I was doing. The view was stunning. I remembered sitting by the Seine everyday with friends, enjoying wines and picnic-made sandwich in Paris. After a while, the wind started to blow into my bones, and despite the sunny weather during the day, my fingers started to freeze, and suddenly I realised why I was the only person sitting on the floor at this harbour, picnicking.
The next day, I visited the Konstmuseet in Skövde by train, to drop my large suitcase, so I wouldn’t have to travel in Europe inconveniently while paying for the overpriced luggage fee charged by the budget airlines (and not to mention the fear of losing it again). The trip took me almost the whole day. The 10:30am train was delayed for half an hour, so I arrived at Skövde at around 1pm. After a pleasant chat with David, the technician of the museum, who is also someone from Goldsmiths Fine Art, I went back to the station for my 14:28 train, which was again delayed for 45 minutes, and I ended up arriving at Stockholm Central after 5pm.
With some not-so-worth-mentioning anecdotes happening on the train, I arrived back at the hotel with a sense of relief, since everything I needed to do for work in Stockholm these days was done. To celebrate, I decided to take advantage of the gym downstairs. After spending 30 minutes on treadmills and other machines that I can not name, I felt like a human again. I know the ecstasy was all psychological, as a relief from the anxiety of aging and weight-gaining. Gym is a middle-class fantasy of a healthy life. When I was running on the treadmill, I believed that I was no longer the girl wearing the torn-out jeans, having cheap sandwiches and light beer sitting by the harbour, freezing, fantasising about the free champagne at other people’s parties. Whatever that was, it helped. I loved going to gyms, delusional or not.
I decided to spend my last day in Stockholm (this time) with art. After my last luxurious breakfast at Hotel Expo, I sadly said goodbye to it, and took a train and a bus to Karolinska Institute. It was where Carl Gustaf Bernhard, the host of Peng during his stay in Sweden, worked. I took some photos, and moved on to the Moderna Museet. Moderna Museet is a modern and contemporary art museum in Stockholm, connected to Arkdes, a design and architecture museum. Luckily, Arkdes offers free admission throughout the year of 2024, so I visited both museums in the afternoon, before heading to the airport, taking my 19:45, SAS flight to Heathrow, London.
I guess it’s about time to face this.

Aftab
We begin with Aftab (Persian for ‘sun’s beautiful rays). Let’s send Aftab to a school friend you’ve lost touch with and would like to reconnect to.
How do you send Aftab — close your eyes for 10 secs and send the suns rays to those you have in your heart. And add to this “<name> may you be at peace, may you be happy” and turn that to yourself “may I be happy, may I be at peace”
For the past 2–3 years, I’ve had the privilege of coaching a tremendously talented former colleague on and off. Our most recent engagement concluded last Friday, and I’ve come to realize that one of the most valuable words she needs in her life right now is “No.”….and that too for turning clients away who are no longer a match for her. This message is for her and for any of you as it may offer guidance to some of you in similar situations.
No, Nada, Nee, Nej, Non
“Really successful people say no to almost everything.” — Warren Buffett
What perhaps got you to the level of success you’re at today is saying YES to almost every opportunity. What will get you to your next level of success is saying NO to almost every opportunity.
Which is why I’m going to share with you the single most powerful tool to take your life, career and…

During my recent trip to Stockholm, I was working remotely on New York hours. I ended up loving this weird working schedule. I would explore the city from 9am-3pm, work 3pm-12:30am, and then sleep 1am-9am. Since I working during dinner hours, I decided to orient my trip around a daytime delicacy — pastries. Each day, I explored a new part of the city in search of the best cardamom bun.
I’ve always been a huge fan of cardamom, so I was excited to learn how ubiquitous cardamom buns (aka kardemummabulle) are in this city. They were all delicious, so it’s really about finding the one that meets your taste — they ranged from bready to buttery and from sugary to spicy. Many bakeries were closed for summer break, but these were the favorites I tried:

Ever had the sneaking suspicion that the corporations you hate have trapped you in an endless buying cycle?
You’re confronted with sobering stats about the effects of smartphone addiction on mental health, but your phone’s the first thing you reach for in the morning. You’ve watched that documentary about the true cost of fast fashion to the environment, but you can’t resist those $10 yoga pants. You’re appalled by the piles of waste generated by single-use plastic, but you still get your coffee to-go in disposable cups and your food delivered every day. You fully understand how algorithms are designed to harvest your attention online for profit, but you feverishly refresh your Instagram feed.
Why does the captive start falling in love with the captor, who suddenly seems so indispensable and necessary for survival? Why do we hate how brands use and treat us, but keep going back for more? Consider this: your brand loyalty and relationship with monolithic corporations might actually be a version of Stockholm Syndrome.
First, big brands lure you in with the product and create the illusion of scarcity, making you feel like doing without it isn’t an option. And then, when you’re finally held hostage, even the slightest act of generosity will get the company in your good graces (see: corporate social responsibility and activist ad campaigns). In time there’s some scandal or controversy with clear evidence that the brand is causing unnecessary harm to reap immense profits — but you remain loyal through it all, even feeling friendliness where there should be fear, admiration where there should be contempt.
This is one of the most despair-inducing aspects of Stockholm Syndrome: in the end, even after being released, the captive defends the captor.
Various scholars and experts have tried to put a finger on why. A book on surveillance capitalism by Shoshana Zuboff here, an explosive Medium article on Capitalist Stockholm Syndrome by Umair Haque there. Trouble is, we often don’t even realize we’re being held hostage. The recently viral, user-generated “10 Year Challenge,” where people post then-and-now photos of themselves on social media, is actually an astroturfed meme to train Facebook’s facial recognition capabilities, speculates Kate O’Neill from Wired. In 2009, you logged into Facebook. In 2019, Facebook logs into you.
Worse yet, brands themselves admit they aren’t good for us — it’s one of the ways they keep us in line, so to speak. Apple wants to help curb your iPhone addiction with Screen Time, a new feature that breaks your smartphone usage down to the specific apps in the hopes of motivating you to spend your time differently. Cigarette conglomerate Philip Morris International just embarked on an anti-smoking campaign as part of their vision of a smoke-free future. And in what sounds like a headline from The Onion, Coca-Cola and other junk food giants in China have successfully been funding the narrative that exercise — not cutting down on sugar — can fight obesity. They use their role in creating “solutions” to problems in which they, themselves, are complicit to generate positive PR, reeling us right back in.
Why, despite all this, do we remain brand-loyal? In the 2018 dark comedy Sorry To Bother You, union organizer Squeeze explains, “If you get shown a problem but have no idea how to control it, then you just decide to get used to the problem.”
There’s also nobody else for us to go to. A protest sign spotted at the 2019 Women’s March highlighted the fact that that there’s more public trust in gas station sushi than in President Trump, which isn’t a total exaggeration. Amazon and Google beat political parties and the state government as some of the most trusted entities in an American Institutional Confidence Poll conducted online by YouGov in 2018.
In recent years, capitalism’s sheen has (finally) started fading. Today only 19% of Americans ages 18 to 29 identify themselves as “capitalists”, and the trend goes hand-in-hand with the rising popularity of the Democratic Socialist values espoused by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.
This week marks the start of the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting, attended by hundreds of the world’s most powerful leaders. The United States’ Trump, France’s Macron and Britain’s May could not make it because they are busy tending to crises at home with big economic implications — the partial government shutdown, Yellow Vest protests and Brexit. It behooves the meeting’s attendees to acknowledge that our economic systems are in serious disrepair, and that rapidly rising income inequality is a feature, not a bug, of late stage capitalism.
So how do we ensure that we don’t fall prey to Stockholm Syndrome yet again, making new excuses and justifications for the next generation of brands as we wrestle free from the mega-corporations that control so much of our lives today?
As we enter the fourth industrial revolution, we need to reconsider the role and purpose of the corporation on our planet, and weed out the put-up-or-shut-up variety of consumerism. In his new book Prosperity, Colin Mayer of Oxford’s Saïd Business School offers a new definition for private companies: “Producing profitable solutions to problems of people and planet.” Will we keep condoning the harm that some corporations inflict on society and the environment, or will we demand that they do more, do better? It’s time for the captive to thwart the captor.

Long time no see, or at least on English. I have started to write a bit more on Swedish and more company and It-security focused articles. The reasons behind it is somewhat because of i have started a company! Finally i have teased about it for some time now, am i right?!
So https://lysellssecurityandtech.com aka Lysells Security And Tech AB is live and up and running as a fully working company with stocks and CEO and management and so on, “only” me and my wife still but it is a real company :D
Therefore i will move and probably write a bit more on my new website, with a bit more focus on Security parts and what is happening within security, more focus on companies and Enterprises. But fear not i will write more here on Medium but probably a bit more like write-ups, personal thoughts and stuff that maybe not is compliant with company blogs and stuff.
So as of 12th of august i am traveling to Stockholm, Solna to be precise, every Sunday i take the train up and Thursday i travel home again, it is a lot of time being spent in Stockholm where i am work as an It-security Architect for a financial company and during the nights i try to be busy writing articles, Talks and trying to get a bit more customers where i can help out with Security work. Just to keep busy and i love to work with Security so it is a win-win situation, and if i can work as much as i want to on the evenings when i am in Stockholm that means i can focus fully on Wife, Dogs and Family when i am home, i may even not need to work on Fridays either, so that means i will have 2.5 days home with family and wifey.
But the thing is because i am working and travelling that much i have setup some timeplanning as well, so Sunday and Saturday is full family time the phone is “off” and i focus on private time, Fridays will be a mix, i will often sleep in a bit because i often get home at midnight or even later but then on Friday i will be available for calls and some work-meetings, i do have planned some talks and lunch meetings often on Fridays so often half days.
That is one thing i recommend, plan your time so you get recovery and quality time with the loved ones, for me as a workoholic i work best to do some work on Fridays just for my own sanity and that is the time i have NOT being on other assignments so it is the right thing for me do some work and often many clients wind down on the afternoon of a Friday so friday until lunch is a way to get some stuff done.
But then be able to have the Friday evening, Saturday and Sunday off and get that quality time is golden. I will probably do some every other week in the future not doing it every week as i am doing now, because it costs a lot of money living at hotels and being away from family is tough. But for now it is a fun adventure and the travel home 5–6 hours is often a good way to wind down even if the way home is the worst one, you just want to get home and you cannot get there fast enough!
This was just a word blob, basically a brain dump of my thoughts and some tips and tricks.
But until next time! Be safe on the internet and be safe!

Disclaimer: My story tackles racial prejudice, not to downplay the seriousness of the issue but to highlight its absurdity. So grab your fika or popcorn, and let’s discover the absurdity of racism.
This is my story of how an unpleasant incident had an influencing impact on my life forever.
In 1980, in Stockholm, Sweden, two Swedish colleagues and I decided to walk to the harbour for coffee. We chatted about work, Swedish girls, and beer, matching our quick steps down the lane.
Suddenly, out of nowhere, a white stranger started shouting, “Du, svarta hund, försvinn från min stad.” We froze!
My two colleagues realised that the racial slur was directed at me since I was darker than them. The stranger noticed I didn’t speak Swedish and shouted, “You, black dog, get out of my town!” Those words were sharp and hurtful. It was the first time anyone had called me a black dog.
I felt angry and sad about what had happened.
I was enraged at the ignorance behind the words and sorry for the man who said them. It made me realise that some people will…

The only thing worse than being taken captive is sympathizing and bonding with your captor. But what if our captors are our own beliefs and aspirations?
A friend sent me a blog post that stopped me in my tracks. After reading Chip’s Wounded Entrepreneur post, I immediately went to LinkedIn to reach out to him.
His lived experience and deeply personal message resembled the lives of so many of the founders and entrepreneurs I work with. Touching upon the topic of suicide, that post was a wake-up call.
That’s the driving energy behind Founders Thriving. I wanted to create a space for entrepreneurs and founders to begin developing a healthier relationship between themselves and their companies. A place to build and grow your company but be happy doing it.
The Cult of Ourselves
We all need to begin addressing the cultish beliefs that make up the abusive relationships we so willingly endure with the companies we run. What these stories represent is how easy it is to be held captive by the companies we run; physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.
Most entrepreneurs launch their endeavor with dreams F-R-E-E-D-O-M. Financial freedom, schedule freedom, and the freedom not to report to a boss.
At least those were their original north-star goals.
But ever-so-slowly we silently mortgage away that freedom until we’re caged in by the one thing we thought would free us from the trappings of a normal 9 to 5.
Then like many long-term hostage situations, we begin to bond and sympathize with our captor. Gradually abandoning the people who love and support us in our greatest times of need.
Vicious Cycle
Unfortunately, after launching startups for freedom, what usually happens is entrepreneurs slowly trade in these opportunities to assert our freedom for personal ultimatums: “I’ve gotta do this to [insert infinite to-do-list here]” scenarios. Before they know it they’re reporting to employees and investors, working more hours, and making less money than many of their own staff. #founderseatlast
Version 1.0 of our early programming usually has two hard-coded beliefs. First, putting ourselves first is selfish. Second, our self-worth is largely dependent on our net worth.
If we get good grades we’ll go to a good school. If we go to a good school, we’ll get a high-paying job. If we get a high-paying job, we’ll simply acquire everything we need to be happy.
Now layer on the toxic startup tropes of kill it, crush it, hustle, and struggle and you have a perfect recipe for an emotional or mental meltdown.
I can’t count the number of founders I work with whose goal is to “make their first million.” I call this the “Miserable Millionaire Fallacy.”
Rarely do these founders know where this thought comes from. It’s simply always been there. It’s like a hidden feature that was included in Version 1.0 and bug fixed and patched to fix our current life circumstances.
It’s not until they’ve gotten everything they dreamed of, and are still unhappy, that they begin exploring other means of happiness, purpose, and fulfillment.
Exorcise Exercise
One good way to assess this in yourself or an entrepreneur you’re working with is to have them visualize their company as a real person. Then imagine having an intimate and honest conversation with that person.
Are they kind, encouraging, and supportive? Or are they negative and condescending; taking every opportunity to remind you you’re an imposter?
When you use this personified entity approach and add a dollop of psychology you’ll find that many entrepreneurs begin to sympathize with their captor and have begun to develop deep feelings of codependency with their personified company.
When the company is successful, they are well. When the company is suffering, so do they.
The beauty of this simple exercise is that once an entrepreneur recognizes the pattern, the turn-around can be incredibly fast. The first step is acknowledging your company is not human; therefore it is not capable of taking actions for or against you or making you think or feel anything.
The second requires an acknowledgment that you are wholly responsible for your thoughts and the resulting emotions that come from those thoughts. Based on those two steps, it is 100% within your control to change the relationship you have with your company.
To unwind the default programming of our formative years we need to encourage founders to normalize new behavior and make it ok to prioritize their needs first; essentially, an upgrade to Founder Version 2.0. By prioritizing their needs above the needs of the business, their co-founders, and their investors, business owners regain the agency needed to heal the relationship with their business.
The mission of the MEA is to reframe midlife — from a crisis to a calling. And if that calling is to share your wisdom with up-and-coming entrepreneurs then let’s create a safe space to meet in the middle.
My dream is for Founders Thriving to help prepare those entrepreneurs to work with all of you. I believe that if we take care of ourselves first we can show up more fully resourced for our teams, our families, and our community. Then together, we can all Build Something Better!
If you know a business owner stuck in their own Startup Stockholm Syndrome or someone ready and willing to prioritize their needs first, please send them over to Founders Thriving and join the movement.

Ahh Disney.. The corporate machine that’s been printing money by selling your dreams back to you is a .. tale as old as time.. you could say.
But while I’m always ready to engage in good faith and justified criticism of this behemoth marketing machine, I’m not in love with criticism that points the finger at problems that don’t exist.
Today, I had a conversation with a dear friend who brought up one of the original criticisms of Beauty and the Beast that I haven’t heard mentioned in years. This friend brought up the belief that some people have alleging Belle was suffering from Stockholm syndrome, that she didn’t have enough agency in the film, and that the story is problematic in the world that exists in 2021.
Since this friend of mine is in the process of producing a live theatrical production of Beauty and the Beast, it immediately became my highest priority to disabuse her of this belief.
I, of course, sent her some rambling messages to get my point across, but after making my point, I still wasn’t satisfied. So here I am.

I love Chigozie Obi’s artistry and I love her personality even more, so it made so much sense that I desired to have a conversation with her.
Two failed attempts at meeting and a birthday pool party after, Chigozie and I finally linked, and we had a conversation about everything — from love to relationship dynamics, fitness, friendships, work and her love for Lagos that may suggest she has Stockholm syndrome. The conversation was so good that we planned a second date.
I walked into Basilico — where Chigozie had been working all afternoon — some minutes before 4pm. I scanned through the floor but couldn’t find her until she popped up from the lounge in a corner, wearing a smile so wide and looking so good, as ever, in a lovely dress. She was excitingly taller than I pictured or, if I’m being honest, I was probably shorter than I thought.“Oh my God, you look so beautiful in person,” I said. Chigozie is more beautiful in person.“You too!” She exclaimed in a smile. “I love your top,” she said.“Thank you!”“I’m so sorry I dressed down. Had a crazy gym session,” she said, walking in a limp. Chigozie has been in the gym for a year now and is notorious for tweeting about the woes of exercising, whilst showing up everyday.“That’s so true! I should have worn slippers,” I said, looking at my flat heels and then back at her pair of white slippers. “Sorry about your pain. You’re really trying o. I’ve attempted the gym twice and I’ve quit twice,” I said, chuckling.She laughed. “How?”“I didn’t have a trainer and thought I could wing it like people say. Although the first time, a friend was my gym partner until she moved. The second time, I was checking out YouTube and stuff for routines. So both were sort of epic fails. I think I lasted two weeks for both,” I said, chuckling.Chigozie laughed. “I have a trainer though.”“Yea, I saw. How has that been for you?”“I really like it. I like that I can just go in there without having to think of what I want to do, and just let someone else think for me and instruct me. My only job is to just show up.”I giggled. “I like that.”“Yeah,” she said. “I see you have a new hair done,” I said, looking at her black braids.Chigozie’s eyes beamed. “Yea, I did it yesterday,” she said, excitedly. Her excitement was so real, it was contagious.“It’s really pretty,” I continued in admiration.“Thank you. I like your beads too. You look like an African Queen.”I chuckled in excitement. “Thank you!”Compliments are ten times better when they come from women.
“How are you? How has Lagos been for you?” Chigozie asked, looking at me.“It’s been okay, it’s been chill. I miss my family sometimes though,” I replied.“Where’s family?”“My family home’s at Ekiti.”“Oh okay.”“What?” I asked chuckling.“No, Ekiti is very chill.”“Yeah, it’s very slow too, and then Lagos is pretty fast. Too fast.”“Yeah, I really love the mountains as well. It’s very serene.”“Have you been?”“Yeah. I went in secondary school to…”“Ikogosi,” I finished her statement and we burst out laughing.“Exactly, exactly,” she said in a smile. “Then I went again for an Art Bootcamp. I think that was when I really explored. I went to Ikogosi again, but I also went around town and stuff, and I was a bit older. It wasn’t like a school thing, so we had more freedom. It’s a really beautiful place.”“Lots of mountains everywhere.”“Yeah. When I travel outside of Lagos I discover we’re not chilling here at all. It’s so fast-paced and so chaotic.” Chigozie laughed.“Very chaotic.”“But the thing is that I feel like I have stockholm syndrome. Anytime I leave Lagos, I get homesick and want to come back almost immediately.”“Really?”“Yeah. For example, when I went to Abuja, I was homesick in the first couple of days. It was pretty slow and I was shocked because I thought Abuja was like the ‘next Lagos’ or something, but nah.”“Abuja is actually so dead, not gonna lie,” I said, chuckling.“For real, but apparently, the people who live there like it so much.”“And when they come here also, they want to go back. They basically can’t stand Lagos either,” I said.“Exactly. When we tweet about Abuja, they’re usually like, “No, don’t come o. We don’t want you here.”I laughed. “For real.”“I want to go back again though; just to chill or relax.”“How many times have you been?” I asked.“Once.”“Me too.”“It’s crazy how I got really home sick when I traveled to London last year for a residency, too. I think the best time to travel to London is summer, maybe June or July, when everywhere is bright. It’s very beautiful then.”“When did you go?”“I went in April. There was a lot of rain and the weather was so gloomy,” Chigozie said, irritated at the thought of it. “I get. I hate gloomy weather so much. It’s such a mood dampener.”“Exacly! I made a lot of friends though, but depression was really… was really hitting. I was like ‘Ahahn.’” It felt like she was recounting a traumatic experience.I laughed. “I was so happy on the night I got back to Lagos,” Chigozie said, shaking her head.“You were like ‘freedom at last!’” I exclaimed in a chuckle.“Yes o. Lagos is very chaotic, but it’s still home.”“If you could live in anywhere else asides Lagos, where would you live?”“I think Ghana.”“Yeah? You traveled there earlier this year right?”“Yeah, I did,” Chigozie said. “Ghana is kind of like Nigeria in some sense. Asides the borders being close, there’s a lot of similarities between us in some ways, with the people and culture.”“Yeah. That makes sense.”
We continued our talk about how chaotic Lagos is and how comfortable it is to take walks in Abuja compared to how abysmal it is to do so in Lagos without being catcalled or enraged by drivers who threaten to hit you with their cars. Chigozie then tells me that she would love to move to a place large enough to ride a bicycle in.
“Oh you can ride a bike?”She puts on a slightly judgmental look. “Yes I can. Funnily enough, whenever people tell me they can’t ride a bike, I’m like how?” she asked squinting in disbelief.“What do you mean?” I was almost ready to fight.“What were you doing when you were younger?” Chigozie asked, confused.“Not riding a bike, I guess?” I giggled. “When did you start riding a bike?”“I can’t really remember, but I was pretty young.”“Do you have a bike?”“No I don’t have a bike right now,” Chigozie said. “Bikes are so expensive now, so I’ve heard.”“Yea, I heard too. Me, I was thinking maybe it was like 100k or something.”“Me, I thought it was 30k o, I swear.”We let out a laugh. “Even bikes are expensive right now. Everything is so expensive”“For real. Funny thing is that I made a tweet one time; something in the line of ‘How come you don’t know how to ride a bicycle?’ That’s how some people took it personally. I was like please nau.”I chuckled. “You were like ‘Sorry, I didn’t mean to.’”“See. One person said I was classist or something.”I laughed out loudly. “How did we get here?”Chigozie chuckled. “It was crazy because my friends and I would joke about it and we’d laugh, you get? After I gave the girl my reply, I just blocked her. That’s alright, that’s alright.”I chuckled.“It was obviously a joke, you know? Me, I don’t know how to swim and I’m 26 right now.”“I can’t swim either. I attempted one time and I almost drowned,” I said.“Me too! I’ve almost drowned as well,” she said in a knowing tone. I gasped like I had just made a fun discovery of shared trauma. “It was a terrible day. It was very scary.”“Exactly. And you wouldn’t be able to do anything.”“You’re just there!”“For real.”
We spoke for a while longer about swimming, the injury she sustained on her knee — that led to the failure of our first attempt at meeting— and how random events can make efforts on skincare futile.Chigozie also told me about how she had initially planned to have a birthday pool party at the restaurant we were, until she was told that there was a minimum spend of 500k.“That’s so crazy because you didn’t even know what you were going to order for yet,” I said with a surprised look on my face.“Thank you. It didn’t make sense at all. And I was so disappointed because the guy who initially told me it was okay didn’t apologize for the inconvenience or whatever. I felt bad about it until a friend linked me to another location. It’s called 37 Lagos, and it was so good! Plus their pool is way larger than the one they have here.”“Oh real? Lagos restaurants are really coming up with this minimum spend thing and it’s so annoying,” I said, recounting my own experience.“It’s unnecessarily classist and annoying. I almost cancelled my birthday plans, but a friend linked me to another location.”“Do you have pictures from that day? I don’t think I saw them.”“Oh real? Are you sure?” “Yea. I think I only saw the pictures where you said you had a good day.”“Let me show you,” Chigozie said, opening her Twitter app and scrolling through her media. I spotted a viral video of Trevor Jackson covering Tyla’s Water — Chigozie had posted the video earlier that day, and we laughed about it, knowingly.“You’re such a menace,” I said in a giggle.She laughed. “That video is so funny. I laugh every time I think about it.”
“How did you have a pool party without knowing how to swim though?” I asked on a lighter note while looking through the videos of her pool party, but I was genuinely curious. The pool was truly large.Chigozie chuckled. “So I basically just stood in the shallow end and was kicking my feet. I don’t know how to swim, but I love water. I love being in water.”“Interesting.”I found it even more interesting because she loved something that she almost drowned in.“Yeah.”
“So how are you right now?” I asked.She hesitated. “I’m just here. I’m okay. Turned a new age.”“How does that feel for you?”“In my head, I feel like I’m still 22, to be honest. Or 23. Every time, I’m like ‘Wow, I’m 26.’ Obviously, I don’t behave like a 22 or 23 year old, but in my head I feel like a baby. Like I’m still quite young.”“Like you’re just a girl,” I said amused.Chigozie smiled. “Exactly! Like I’m just a girl,” she said. “It doesn’t feel that much different, to be fair, but next year, especially with my work, I want it to be more successful. I feel like this year was calm, basically for resting. It was easy, more about figuring stuff out. I’m slowly getting into work mode already though, but next year will be awesome.”“Were you excited about your birthday?”“Yes, I was, actually. Usually, I’m not necessarily excited for my birthday, but this year I decided to be. Even when the plans for my birthday location fell through and I was sad, the next day, I got up and decided to be happy,” she said. “You only get one day to truly celebrate yourself — one day that’s for you, so I believe we should try to really enjoy those special days.”“Yea exactly. You’re not lying.”
Chigozie got a call that lasted for about a minute. A call that started with “Hi baby…” and sounded pretty intimate too.
“Are you in a relationship?”“So I got into one recently,” she said.“Oh so you’re new,” I said chuckling.She smiled — or blushed. “Yeah. I feel like I’ve known him for a while though. Like I’ve known him for the longest, which is really great because we kind of like eased into it.”“Yeah. I feel like going into relationships slowly makes a lot of sense; instead of just rushing into it.”“Exactly,” Chigozie said. “So it’s really nice. I feel like it’s one of those things that make life less difficult and crazy.”“I feel you. Having someone to text on those crazy days can be very sweet.”“For real,” she said. “Are you in a relationship?” “No,” I replied almost immediately and we both burst into a long laugh.“It’s the way you replied so fast for me,” Chigozie said in a laugh.“Oh my God. I didn’t know it came out so fast either,” I said, still laughing.“Are you like searching or something?”I hesitated. “I don’t know. I don’t think I’m actively searching,” I started. “I enjoy having crushes though,” I continued in a grin.“Crushes can be fun,” Chigozie said.“Yeah. I’m so done with situationships though. Like it’s enough.”“Thank you please!” She exclaimed in alliance.“I want something really sweet.”“You’ll find it.”“Were you looking for love when you found it?”“Not necessarily. I had gotten out of a thing when it happened.”“Oh you got out of a relationship this year?”“Yeah.” Chigozie paused. “Well, no.” She smiled. “We were pretty much undefined.”“A situationship?”She laughed. “More or less. Exactly.”I chuckled. “How was that?”“Never again o!” Chigozie exclaimed.We burst out into a laugh that said a lot about the crazy experiences we’ve both had.“Literally never again. I tell everyone I know not to go into situationships. Unless you’re both really okay with it, it’s fine,” Chigozie said.“Yeah.”“I think I’m a lover, to be honest. I’m a very big lover girl. So situationships are not my thing. I’ve not had a lot of them so when people talked about them, I was like ‘I can’t relate,’ until I related and was like ‘Omo, this thing is crazy o!’ I can’t be doing this please.”I laughed.“And I feel like situationship breakups hurt even more than relationship breakups. With relationships, you had that person, you experienced that person, but with situationships, it’s just something that never was.”“Exactly. It didn’t even happen, but like it was so exciting.”“Yeah, like so much impact still. So I don’t recommend for people who love love and are very soft because they’ll definitely fall in love. It’s even more risky when sex gets involved.”“For real. There’s this bond that’ll be created. A bond that might only be in your head. Like it’d be only you catching feelings.”“Yeah. So I think it’s best to just save yourself while it’s still early because the deeper you fall into it, the more hopeful you get and the more tragic the end is,” Chigozie said.She made a lot of sense.“I saw a video one time and it described how, with men, loving occurs in a process, but with women, they most likely have feelings for a man before they even start dating. There’s this rush already.”“Yeah! That’s so accurate. I think we get too emotionally connected and sometimes we don’t even know how connected we got until much later and we’re like ‘Wow. This thing really impacted and affected me.’”“Another thing I don’t like about situationships is how you can’t hold the other person accountable for the stuff they do that may have offended you, but with relationships, you can sit your partner down and explain in detail,” I said, tapping on the couch we were sitting on.Chigozie chuckled. “You would even have the right to have the conversation. Honestly, I feel like I can be so self aware with people, so I always like to check in. I never want to overstep my boundary or feel like I’m doing too much, so I always try to be clear. That’s not something I can enjoy doing in situationships.”“Yeah, for real.”“And when you get into healthy relationships, you realize you wasted so much time holding on to half-assed love,” Chigozie said.“Right?”
We talked further about how relationships hold so much weight and how important it is to be with someone who, according to Chigozie, would not be one of your 99 problems and would love communicating with you, even during fights.“The worst thing is when you’re an overthinker and you’re not with someone who loves listening to you and is interested in validating your feelings. Every action weighs on you,” Chigozie said.“Yeah, that’s so true,” I said. “I think that when somebody raises an issue or talks about a weird way you treated them, it’s not because they hate you. I think that if they tell you that you did this, it’s because they like you enough to talk about it and they still want you to be in their life.”“Exactly.”“And most times, how you see things might be different, but it’s so important to validate those feelings still. They’re not talking about what you meant or your intent, instead, they’re talking about how you made them feel.”“Yeah. And I feel it’s so important to be considerate in expressing your feelings too. I also believe it’s important to lay your feelings down on the table and talk things out — my friends have really helped me with this. You know, you might even end up apologizing, but at the end of the day, your connection grows stronger and that’s better than any ‘win.’”“For real. I really feel you on that.”
We talked more about conflict in relationships — be it romance or friendships — and how important it is to address issues with the other person in mind. We also talked about knowing when to let go of certain people when issues keep recurring and there’s no potential of a better relationship with them.
“So I want to ask a question about your artistry. How come all your paintings look like you?” My question was almost accusatory.
“It’s not even intentional,” Chigozie replied, giggling. “I’m not even doing it on purpose all the time. A lot of my paintings speak on things concerning me, so yeah those ones, but I actually don’t do it on purpose.” She paused. “Yeah, maybe I know my face so well and the way I paint sometimes reflects that, but I don’t mind it though because at the end of the day, a lot of the things I paint speak to me, so I feel like in that way, I’m just sharing pieces of myself with people and then, even though it’s unintentional, it makes my art more recognizable. So whenever people see my painting, they know it’s Chigozie that did that.”I smiled. “Yeah like ‘That’s Chigozie Obi’s art!’ I think that’s unique.”“Yeah.”“So have you ever had a solo exhibition in Lagos?”“So I had one at the Art X Lagos Fair. That was my first, but I want to have one next year. One that isn’t attached to an organization or body or something. Just completely mine. So hopefully that goes well.”“Yeah, it’ll go well. I’ll come.”“Yes, you have to come!” Chigozie exclaimed. “I have so many ideas I want to bring to life. Four fingers crossed that it goes well.” She chuckled, crossing her fingers.I laughed.
“So you’re a first daughter. Did you see those tweets about first daughters and pieces of advice for them?” I asked referencing a Twitter trend.“I saw a few and there was one I saw that said ‘Learn when to detach from people,’ and it really hit me,” Chigozie started. I feel like I hold on to people and give them multiple chances and I feel like that may have stemmed from my experience as a first daughter. I’ve learnt that I have to learn how to be myself first, and when I lost my Mum, I think it became a thing of ‘You’re the Mum now and you have to take care of your brother and your Dad,’ but eventually, I was like I still have my own life whilst still checking in and making sure they’re good.”“When did you lose your Mum?”“2019.”“Oh really?”“Yeah,” she paused. “After my Mum died, it sunk in that you can literally die at any moment, and when you die, nothing matters. Not the money, nothing at all. And even if people celebrate you on Earth, you’ll never know. So I find enjoying myself a big deal. It’s so important to me. I might not do it in the most extravagant way because money is so important, but I always try to find pockets of joy.”“And I think you have a lot of fun too,” I said.“Yeah, I try,” Chigozie said. “I think the misconception people have of me though, is that they think my life is so soft, like I have people who will dm me and be like ‘Chigozie, you just dey chop life o,’ but I’m like, I’m out here busting my ass o. I might not just show all the processes, but underneath all of that, it’s still work,” she said. I chuckled. “Yeah, I feel you.”“I take and post a lot of pictures though. When my Mum died, we only had about three pictures together.”“Oh my God.” That was sad.“I know right? So I told myself I want to start documenting everything, from my friends, to what I’m doing, places I visit, everything actually.”“Yeah. I’ve seen your Instagram page dedicated to pictures of places and things too,” I said, referencing Le Journal De Gozie. “Yeah. Sometimes, when I’m feeling down, all I need to do is scroll through my Instagram accounts, and it’s pretty easy to document on Instagram and Twitter too.”“I think that’s very intentional. It’s really nice and I love the concept of it.”“Thank you,” she said, smiling.
“I think you’ve really hacked your style too. I notice you love clothes,” I said.“Yeah, I do.”“Your outfits are pretty.”“Right? Thank you. I think that I’m evolving too. One thing I don’t want to do is feel like I can’t wear certain outfits because I’m growing older. I want my style to remain like this forever. One day, I’m wearing ashewo clothes, the next day, I’m dressed like a boss lady. The next day, I’m doing office worker. The next day I’m doing stripper.”“Does it depend your mood?” I asked before realizing the last thing she mentioned, and I laughed.“Sometimes,” she said, laughing. “I notice that when I’m feeling down, I wear black a lot.”“Now I’m going to be on the lookout for you in black,” I said, joking.She laughed. “No no, it’s not all the time. I’m wearing black tomorrow for my birthday dinner.”“Okay. After tomorrow, I’ll be on the lookout for you in black.”Chigozie laughed.
“So you mentioned earlier how expectations have shaped you in some way as a first daughter and how you’ve managed them. Are there childhood events or trauma that you feel have, in some way, affected your current view of the world or how you relate to people?”Chigozie hesitated for a second. “Hmmm not particularly, but I know that growing up introverted, it took me having female friends to open up to certain things. I grew up with so many boys around me and I didn’t really lean into my feminine side while growing up as well. I think I was a late bloomer too. Growing up like that didn’t make me feel so great or feminine in a way, but my female friends have helped me to open up more and appreciate my body more. It’s also much easier to talk to them about topics like sex. I had to become more confident with saying how I feel and sharing how I certain things affect me too,” she said. “I did like a 180. Is it 180 or 360?” Chigozie asked. She was trying to describe the turning point in her life and I found it hilarious.“You sha did something,” I replied, laughing. My brain was not processing that either, to be honest.She laughed. “I sha did something,” she said. “I feel like younger Chigozie would be happy with where I am right now.”“I’m sure she is.”
I listened to Chigozie tell me about how growing up introverted made her self aware, and maybe a little too much in some cases, as she has now grown to be more calculative of the things she says, who she says them too and where she says them. It’s not exactly a problem though because she would never be silent when she needs to speak. It was then I realized that I hadn’t ordered for a drink or food yet.
“I think I’m ready to have a drink now,” I said. “You should have the chapman. It’s really good.”I was staring at the menu. “Oh really?” “Yeah. People say the pineapple juice is good too though.”“Nah, I’ll have the Chapman. What’s their pizza like?”“It’s so good, but disclaimer: It’s really simple. There’s nothing much happening with it.”“I love my pizza like that though. Is it flat?”“Yeah, it is. I usually have the pepperoni,” Chigozie said. “My boyfriend’s not a fan of it like I am though.”I chuckled. We had two pepperoni pizzas to go and the Chapman was really good. I tried not to finish it in one sip. Chigozie said I did a good job for not finishing it all at once.
“I really like this space,” I said, scanning through the restaurant.“Yeah it’s pretty chill. Have you been to Godaïf?”“Nah I haven’t.”“We should go there next.”I squealed in faux excitement. “Is that a second date?” Chigozie laughed.“You know those moments when you go out on a date and you get excited when they start planning a second date before the end of the first?” I asked.“Yeah,” Chigozie replied, smiling.“That’s how I feel right now.”

Perhaps I should have been more compassionate towards the Stockholm inflicted ones. I tried. Not hard but I tried. I couldn't do it. I couldn't look into the inhuman eyes of the corporate bot and feel anything but loathing.

Stockholm Syndrome, a perplexing psychological phenomenon, has captured the attention of experts and the public alike due to its intricate interplay between captive and captor. This psychological response, which was first observed during a bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden in 1973, continues to raise questions about human behavior under duress.
When individuals find themselves in situations of extreme vulnerability and captivity, they may develop a peculiar bond with their captors. This bond appears counterintuitive, as one might expect fear and aversion to predominate in such scenarios. However, Stockholm Syndrome highlights the complexity of human coping mechanisms, shedding light on the psychological mechanisms that drive these unexpected emotional connections.
Victims of Stockholm Syndrome often display empathy and loyalty towards their captors, perceiving them as protectors or guardians rather than aggressors. This psychological shift can be attributed to several factors, including perceived dependency on the captor for basic needs, isolation…

We are at our best when we establish authentic connections with one another, lifting each other up. Two incredible highlights this week: ⭐Helping a dear friend securing an interview and watching him shine bright after listening to him painfully talk himself down for months; ⭐My call with Giulia Fiorista has become a weekly opportunity for me to brainstorm, be inspired, and inspire. This time around, I shared some input that might’ve turned out more useful than I expected. And that’s why it’s usually a good idea to share your knowledge: you might be sitting on someone’s goldmine taking it completely for granted.
I posted about it on LinkedIn earlier this week: I was sorting some ancient papers and documents and unearthed one of my first CVs ever! The “good old days” when: 1) You printed and handed your CV in person wherever you wished to apply; 2) I didn’t realise I could be creative and make up a format of my own (and remove the headshot altogether); 3) LinkedIn wasn’t really a thing. So much has changed in 10 years uh?!
Talking with colleagues in tech, it seems there’s a pattern of communication issues between Product and Commercial across the industry. How many opportunities is this incommunicability costing us? Something to think about…
My final thought is coming from a place of distrust. Some weeks ago I reached out to a popular pre-employment testing company with some questions about what steps they take to make your their timed logics test is “neurodiverse-friendly”. For example, people with dyslexia are known to underperform on timed tests, is there an option for a time-extension? It’s something simple that can make a huge difference for a candidate. I reached out to them through 4 different sources and was ignored for the most part until I was told someone would get in contact. So far, it’s only been silence on their part… If this lack of response equals to a “no”, wouldn’t these tests be highly discriminatory?
Thanks for reading, happy weekend! 👒

No trip to Stockholm is complete with a visit to the archipelago. Let me guide you to some of my favourite spots…
“Stockholm i mitt hjärta, Stockholm in my heart — a city of islands, that is you.” Those are the words by Lasse Berghagen that fill the air every Tuesday summer night as thousands of people, gathered at open air museum Skansen for the popular singalong TV show Allsång på Skansen, take tune. As their words travel across the bay below, the cameras pan over the stunning water landscape and one wonders if the melody manages to reach all of the 14 islands that make up the capital of Scandinavia — or indeed the patchwork of 30,000 islands that spread out beyond that.
Stockholm is beautiful any time of the year, but the magical, seemingly endless, summer light sees the capital come to life more than ever — and at this time of the year there is only one place to be. Outside.
Whether it’s a walk through the national park and museum island of Royal Djurgården or a stroll along the picturesque Söder Mälarstrand, a run along Årstaviken or a panoramic tour of Fjällgatan, the inner city waterfront views are breathtaking. However, a summer trip to Stockholm is not complete without a trip to skärgården, the archipelago.
To explore the 30,000 islands that make up the Stockholm archipelago (all accessible thanks to the Swedish Right To Roam), simply hop on a traditional white, wooden boat from Waxholmsbolaget or a speedier Cinderella ferry from Strömma. Once on board, the archipelago world is your oyster.
Where to go? Here are a few suggestions.
Fjäderholmarna is a good start. Located 30 minutes from Stockholm’s Nybrokajen, this cluster of islands is the closest archipelago destination and it offers both beautiful countryside and bustling town life. Here you can explore traditional handicraft, sample beer at the local brewery, try handmade sweets at the chocolate factory and indulge in delicious ice cream from Systrana Degens Glassstuga. Once you’ve tasted what the town has to offer, why not stroll along the beaches, take a dip in the sea and spend the evening unwinding with a glass of wine and fresh seafood at one of the many restaurants? Life could be worse.
Waxholm is without a doubt the capital of the archipelago. Complete with its own castle, built in 1549 to defend King Gustaf Vasa, this historic old town comes with pastel-coloured houses, art, shopping and good food. It’s a great option if you want to mix nature with culture and it is also accessible via car or bus, should you prefer getting around on land.
Grinda sits at the heart of the archipelago and is an island that, located about an hour from Stockholm, just epitomises serene Swedish countryside. Step back in time as you step off the boat and find yourself in a nature reserve decorated with idyllic, old-school red and yellow houses, wild nature and beautiful beaches. The art nouvaeu style Grinda Wärdshus restaurant is open weekends and holidays and you will not struggle to find a blissful place to picnic on the rest of Grinda. Just lush.
Möja is the spot for the active traveller. Ideal if you want to do more than just chill by the beach, this large island is well suited for bike trips and day hikes — and do make sure you climb to the top of Vårdkaseberget and enjoy a stunning view of the surrounding scenery. Beaches are less accessible here, so it’s not necessarily one for swimming, but you can eat freshly caught seafood at Wikströms Fisk, a tavern run by the archipelago’s only professional fisherman.
Sandhamn is a well-known, idyllic harbour and popular destination for big yachts and their owners. Located about an hour from Stockholm city, Sandhamn offers sandy beaches (as indicated by the name — it literally means Sand Harbour), bike trails, kayaking and spa, not to mention plenty of restaurants and bars; this is without a doubt the party central of the archipelago.
Finnhamn is your destination if you want to see more of the archipelago as part of your trip. Getting here takes about 2.5 hours by boat so you want to set off in time — but what a journey it is. Expect plenty of photo opportunities on board, and do try to get a good seat outside if the weather is nice; there are few things as peaceful as tanning on a boat gliding through skärgården. (Though it can get windy so do pack a jumper in case.) Bring a picnic blanket, snacks and bikini for a day of ultimate relaxation — once on the island you will find perfect trekking conditions and many a private bay to picnic, tan and swim. Just don’t miss the last boat back, though if you do you can always stay overnight at the local hostel.
Utö, meaning Outer Island, sits farthest out in the Southern part of the archipelago and so offers a very wild, natural experience. A visit here is all about enjoying the elements. Renowned for the many hours of sunshine that it gets, the island serves up white sand beaches, cliffs and various sporting opportunities including canoeing, biking, tennis, beach volleyball and boules. Hike around the island and get the best view from the 18th Century windmill.
As you can tell there is plenty of option in the Stockholm archipelago, but regardless of your choice, you will find yourself unwinding with every breath of fresh sea air — and returning back home you may just find yourself singing about your love for Stockholm…

Freedom is scary.
That is the thought I left you with last time.
As much as we want freedom, getting there requires that we sever the umbilical cord that connects us to the lies and limiting beliefs that we have come to rely on from day to day.
And that is scary.
I believe this is why people cling so tightly to their guns and their religion and their political affiliations.
Fear.
The thing about fear, though, is that, in most cases, it is not based in tangible reality. It is not the result of something that has actually happened to an individual. But, rather, it is centered in some kind of what-if or hypothetical scenario.
Fear finds its sustenance in the straw man.
Let us take guns for example.
People cling extremely tightly to their guns and their right to own them. So much so that they are unwilling even to restrict other’s access to them, even if those people legitimately should not be allowed that responsibility.
Even at the expense of other’s lives, these people will defend their guns.
Why?
Because of a perceived need to protect themselves from a tyrannical government or from the off chance that a fully armed intruder will break in to their home. Neither of these things are terribly likely to happen in the grand scheme of things.
But the fear is there. And someone has told them that the solution for these fears is a gun.
And so their beliefs about the world have become restricted and limiting. And therefore how they view the world has become warped.
And that distorted view of the world creates more fear and therefore a tighter grasp on what is perceived as the solution to that fear.
And so on and so on it goes.
Fear causes us to believe only the most limited of things about the world and ourselves. And these limiting beliefs act to keep us chained to a radiator in the dark basement of our souls.
And there we believe we must stay, no matter what.

Nashville. Seattle. Detroit. London. New York. London. Stockholm. All of these are key cities in the music of the 20th century.
But hang on a minute. Stockholm??
Yeah, I wouldn’t have thought so either. Aside from the obvious example and a few bands from the early 2000s, like Eskobar and Kent, still in my record collection, I never would have associated the Swedish capital city with music.
That changed when I spent some time there in the summer of 2024.
Like any good trip to a city I’ve never been in, my initial walk in the neighbourhood in which I’m staying revolves around tracking down record stores.
“But aren’t they all the same as the ones at home?” someone might ask. “Don’t be silly” is the only logical answer.
I walked out of the first one with two Charlatans records that I’ve never seen at any other store anywhere in the world. The fact that one was their second album…

I’m sitting on my favorite aircraft, Delta Air Lines A330–900 Neo, headed to a place that I also love to visit. Amsterdam. Although it’s not our final destination, it’s a fantastic location for a layover in the KLM lounge, a Delta Air Lines partner, where services are also top-notch.
There’s plenty of space to find a wonderful temporary home for relaxation, sleep, meals, reflection, or anything your spirit craves related to your travel desires.
Okay, I’ve skipped a little too far ahead because, in the meantime, we’re still sitting in my favorite seat, Delta One, on my favorite airline. If you haven’t experienced D-1, well, let me give you a sneak preview. In this seating configuration, my desk is to the right, with a plug-in for my laptop, and a convenient port for headphones to listen to entertainment options, including music, movies, TV Series, and family entertainment.
If you’re feeling a bit tired and need to catch some z’s, there’s a pillow, blanket, and comfortable eye mask available. The most fantastic feature is that the seat converts into a lie-flat bed, making it easy to find your comfort zone.
Passengers must wait until the plane reaches the appropriate altitude and the pilot gives the okay to move about the cabin…

When I was in ninth standard, I first came across him. He was from another school. People called him Andrew. He was not the tallest, but was the strongest. He was unbeaten at arm wrestling. There was a certain charm about him that all the boys flocked around him. They all looked forward to be with him. To be in his company, was considered privilege by clueless fourteen-year-olds. He would influence major decisions, dictate terms, bring in new trends and wore the best clothes because his father was a rich man. He always had at least half-a-dozen boys hanging out with him. After school, he would form a circle with those boys and pick two of them and made them fight. Like a referee, he would signal the start of the bout and wait until one of them was completely on the ground, and gave up. He enjoyed while the boys fought and after the fight, both of them would continue to walk around him, like nothing happened. They were just following orders and it didn’t affect them emotionally, although I’m sure physical pain lasted.
One day at school, Andrew was caught copying in the English exam. And in those days, punishments were ruthless. Especially, in that school, they had a public-shaming vice-principal who would beat the shit out of the kid in assembly if the crime was grave enough. The next day, before the start of the Maths exam, the vice-principal called Andrew out and announced to the whole school that he had copied in the English exam. And he began to hit him with a cane. After seven or eight blows, the stick broke and the beating continued by hand. There was hair pulling and ear pulling and unlimited supply of swearing. After about five minutes, the beating stopped and everyone was allowed inside the exam halls. After the exam, all the seven or eight boys who hung around him, returned to their duty — standing beside him. And the first thing Andrew said to them, ‘I didn’t get hurt at all. In fact, the stick broke!’ and everyone hailed him as a legend. That was my introduction to blind followers.
Now extrapolate this story to the current crisis in North India. Everyone knows that their chief has been convicted of rapes without any reasonable doubt and still, they continue to take his side. And they will defend to death, their leader, who is their only sense of self-worth and identity. Young, old, men, women and even young girls have come out in his support in lakhs and they think he is innocent. They don’t just think, they believe the whole thing to be a conspiracy against him, perpetrated by the state.
In psychology, there’s a concept called the ‘Stockholm Syndrome’, where the hostages start liking their kidnappers and form a psychological alliance with them. Sometimes, very strong emotional develop between two persons where one person intermittently harasses, beats, threatens, abuses, or intimidates the other. In this case, although it is legally proved that the so called saint is a rapist, somehow it puts into question, the years of dedication they have displayed towards him. It is like you pet a snake since the day it hatched and one day, it grows big enough to bite you, the the only person who loves it. But then, you like the snake so much that you are ready to die by its poison.
In 2010, I was working with a film director helping him complete a paranormal/horror movie script. During those sittings, we happened to discuss a god-man from Andhra Pradesh who charged about five lakhs for a darshan. That is, you have to pay that money just to see him. And there is a long queue of people willing to do that. In fact, people wait for months for their turn. Then, I asked him, what about poor people, don’t they have access? He said, ‘If you can’t afford him, you can pay two lakhs and see his wife.’
His answer blew my mind. Then, I asked him, what is so special about meeting him? Why should one pay that kind of money? To which, he said, ‘I have a friend who pays five lakhs every now and then. He says, it is his aura. The moment you enter the room, you can feel his aura. And if he touches you, his aura stays with you for a long time and it will attract all the positive things, makes you rich, literally and mentally.’
To an extent, I believe in the concept of aura and positive vibes. But people willing to pay for it? That was a new. An eye-opener. So while we’re at it, if you go and tell this friend of the director, that the god-man is a fraud and that he’s been exploiting the vulnerabilities of gullible disciples, what do you think will happen? He will tell you to get the hell out.
That’s what cults do. When a person gets indoctrinated into a belief system and start following a guru, or a god-man, what actually happens is that they build a strong, unbreakable bridge with them. And in the process of building that bridge, they shut off all roads toward rationality and ability for freedom of thought. It’s a tunnel with no other outlets. And that liberates people, because this sense of belonging to that cult, it’s better than their current life. And what looks like liberation, is actually, a long, endless, incarceration of the mind.

Hello and Hi!
This is the first dataviz challenge for the Data Visualisation Stockholm (DVS) Meetup group. We’ve been discussing holding a challenge for at least a year and FINALLY we’ve finished the first one!
DVS was founded two years ago when the two original organisers started their own two dataviz Meetup groups just a few days apart in Stockholm, Sweden, but then decided that Stockholm was a one-dataviz-Meetup-group town and joined forces. We both wanted to create a space where we would gather enthusiastic designers, developers, artists, statisticians, journalists, and all kinds of amazing people interested in data to network and get to know each other. We also wanted our members to have the opportunity to grow as data designers.
We have discussed holding challenges for a while now, but it took an enthusiastic member asking us to stop procrastinating (Thanks!) and get on with it. But the discussions were not fruitless; they got us talking about the types of dataviz challenges we liked and the kind wanted to run. We determined that a fun and engaging challenge, one that we would want to participate in, had two equally important parts, an interesting theme and a design constraint. The theme would attract participants and the design constraint would challenge them to be creative.
This first challenge was all about Stockholm winters. The dataset had data on snow depth and temperature in Stockholm stretching from January 2021 all the way back to the beginning of the early 20th century.
I must say that I was quite impressed with the variety of submissions we got!
So in no particular order lets go through the charts and see all submissions. Descriptions were written by the respective authors.
WhoMatthias Stahl. Freelance data visualisation designer with a history in bioinformatics, passionate about the combination of data, code, art and design to craft beautiful and impactful visuals.Twitter: @h_i_g_s_c_hLink to the interactive viz
CommentI wanted to go for a spiral layout as this enables the year-wise comparison of this periodic data. I then transformed the temperature and snow data into binary variables — fitting to the overall black-and-white theme. Is there snow: yes/no; and is the temperature higher than 10 °C: yes/no. The best way to encode the temperature turned out to be the spiral line thickness. The circles for the snowy days are apparently inspired by snowflakes. In order to make it clearer that circles represent snowy days, I added a snowing animation.
Tools: Sketch on paper, then Svelte and D3
WhoAlenka Gucek. Postdoc at Uppsala University, studying diabetes and cell biology. I’ve always enjoyed doing visualisations for research and now I’m looking for ways to change career to dataviz.Twitter: @alenka_gucek
CommentOriginally I was planning for a gif with falling snow, but it looked like too much of chart junk. Then I switched to do something simple and informative, inspired by Evelina Judeikyte’s talk [at one of the Meetup events] on simplicity, annotations in The Economist and spark lines by Edward Tufte.
Tools: Excel, Origin and CorelDraw
WhoNina Lindell. Data visualisation engineer at Telia, building products based on mobility data.Twitter: @ninatsutsLink to the code
CommentI wanted to make the data look like piles of snow, and finally create a ridge-line plot (aka joy plot). I have recently started learning D3 and the challenge seemed like a good opportunity to try out my skills on a real dataset. I decided to keep the last 50 years of data and only look at the snow depth. There are still some things I would like to improve upon — highlight interesting data points with annotations, mark the scale, and make winters continuous so that at least November — March are on the same row. That is something for the next iteration.
Tools: Tableau for prototyping, D3 for the final chart
WhoTyler Wolf. Data visualisation specialist at King Games.Twitter: @tylernwolf
CommentI thought about the question “what does a month look like?” And then broke it into the two pieces of data we had in the dataset: temperature and snowfall. But then I wanted to give it context and look for patterns, specifically thinking of the question, are days getting hotter? — obviously thinking of climate change. So I ran a moving average on temperatures to break the temperature component into above or below average for that month. I did this because we can conclude that it’s cold in the winter and hot in the summer already, so a relative comparison gives more context. That made three pieces of data. Finally, I thought about how much I like it when it snows, so it would be nice to get an idea of how many days it was actually snowing in each month. So with those pieces of data and the limitation of black and white only, I experimented with rectangles and lines until I arrived at something that felt right and could condense the data, making each month look unique and allowing their elements to interact with each other. The aesthetic was inspired partially by some of giorgia lupi’s work.
Tools: D3 to draw the graphics, observablehq to get up and experimenting quickly and Figma for early sketching and to draw the legend and title.
WhoPatrick Wojda. Data visualisation and front-end engineer at Aftonbladet, Swedens largest online newspaper.
CommentLooking through the data I realised that there were too many years in the dataset to visualise without losing the personal perspective so I filtered the data on a personal question… were my childhood winters snowier than what my kids get to experience? I did all of the data cleaning and formatting using Javascript (lodash and D3). The most fun aspect of the challenge was figuring out the design, but I spent almost all of the time on data processing. I iterated over the design multiple times, both hand-drawn and in code before I got to where I wanted.
Tools: Javascript, lodash, D3, Svelte, Paper app on IOS for sketching.
That’s a wrap!
Stay tuned for more challenges, we will be announcing them on our GitHub repo (https://github.com/Dataviz-Stockholm/challenges).
Take care and stay safe.

According to Wikipedia, there are four components that comprise Stockholm syndrome:
I was never a huge Javascript guy. I’d use jQuery from time to time. Sometimes, I’d use it to make some AJAX calls and maybe change an element or two on a Rails app I was working on. Life was simple, with jQuery doing most of the grunt work and me doing nothing at all. I didn’t need to know much about Javascript at all and that was the way I liked it.
I was eventually asked to develop a desktop application for authoring media-heavy multi-language content. Not wanting to descend into the waking nightmare that is Java Swing that I had learned to hate in graduate school, I quickly picked up Angular (1) and Electron. It was magical.
I loved how simple everything was. I could write to disk as often as I wanted using Node’s NON-BLOCKING IO (very web-scale). Callback hell was a little difficult to deal with, but then I learned about Promises and entered Promise hell. The fires in this hell were a little less intense, so it was all good. Even better, I now reside in the promised (haha get it) land of Async Await.
Anyhow, Angular truly felt like magic the first time I used it. I would change the application’s state and things would just appear! I didn’t have to use selectors or iterate through DOM elements like some sort of neanderthal. I didn’t understand how the lifecycle worked at all, but who really wants to? Not me. I want to keep the magic alive.
Nobody wants (Angular) sausage after they see how it’s made.
— a very wise person
Of course, this quickly bit me in the ass. My completely unoptimized code was slow sometimes (all the time). So, like any responsible and capable developer, I arrived at an obvious conclusion: Angular was the problem and there was nothing I could do to fix it. I needed to switch frameworks, to use something faster, more performant, and most importantly, with better benchmark scores.
I moved onto React. With React came stage-0 proposals, Babel, Webpack, boilerplates, functional programming, great hair, Redux, GraphQL, CSS in JS, and much more. I now spend my time away from work preparing for work, reading about the hottest new packages, jumping on every bandwagon I can. Maybe I should use Parcel, it’s zero configuration and probably knows what’s best for me. I’ve abandoned all non-Javascript languages for the backend. How else am I going to get my SSR-game on? Javascript is all I need.
I think Javascript is a pretty good guy. You can iterate SO FAST. Compiling? What’s that? Think of all the time you’ll save not waiting for stuff to compile. Sure, there’s essentially no native type system and all sorts of dangerous type coercions can happen, but hey, that’s what Flow and Typescript are for, right? Transpiling is fine and very fast! There are no problems here.
Sure, bugs in the original Javascript implementation have become part of the spec. But look, Brendan Eich had to hack together all of Javascript in a few days. Can you blame him? No. Nobody’s perfect. Except for Javascript. Javascript is perfect.
Javascript is very human. Most teams I’ve worked with are fluent in Javascript. Look at all of the NPM packages. I’d wager that it encompasses all of human knowledge. If there was to be a language to transcend all languages and bring all of humanity together, I would bet on Javascript. Is there a Babel transform for Esperanto? That’d probably be a good start.
To Javascript is human.
— Alexander Pope
I feel this point about ‘belief in humanity’ is somewhat tenuous. You can tell I’m really stretching. Javascript isn’t a human being. Although, Javascript is pretty weird and unpredictable, as are humans.
The local police have been in a standoff outside of where Javascript and I have been holed up for the last 47 hours. I can’t be sure if I’m actually suffering from Stockholm syndrome because I’m not just a very cooperative person in general. But what I do know is that I’m not coming out of the deep, dark hole that I’ve dug myself into.
I like it here. There’s everything I could need or want. I’m very comfortable here. This is who I am now. If anyone is feeling charitable, please throw some food down here if you can. In the meantime, I think I’m going to take a nap. I’m very tired from all of this Javascripting.

This is my 28-day journey of living a temporary life in Helsinki, Tallinn, Stockholm, and Copenhagen.

Look closely at the present you are constructing: it should look like the future you are dreaming. (Alice Walker)
Finding gratitude in small things and injecting a little randomness into my life is one of my 2018 and 2019 resolutions. And a lot of small wonders coincidently happened every day. Because I am in a different country and experiencing different culture? Well, it might be true, but might not.
I went to Gamla Stan and looked around the old town. Sometimes I stopped by souvenir shops to buy a Sweden flag pin because I’m collecting flag pins of countries that I visited. But today I had a bigger mission from my niece. We had a chat on Instagram yesterday, and she told me that she wanted to get a beautiful Swedish style pencil case. Well, what is the Swedish style and where can I find that style? I just went around some shops and found a beautiful pencil case. Surprisingly, it was the same style pencil case as the one that she wanted to have. Today’s small wonder started like that.
While I was looking around, I saw a bunch of people gathering in front of the palace. It seemed like they were waiting for something. So, I joined in the line of people and waited together. Some minutes later, the palace guards riding on horses started marching with music. I never imagined that I could see the Changing of the Guard at Gamla Stan. The second small wonder accidentally happened, too.
I got to a small square and saw old buildings painted with beautiful colors next to the Noble Prize Museum. When I took some pictures and started keep walking, I saw a young boy drawing buildings that I took pictures of just now. I came to him quietly and looked at his painting. It was really beautiful, more beautiful than the original ones. I saw a small donation box beside him, took 20 SEK from my pocket and put it into his box. He looked at me with smile and said, “Thank you.” It was a small donation for rooting for his dream. I prayed with all my heart, recalling his big innocent grin that he will be a great artist who will make our world better with his great ability. That was my third small wonder that I came across in Gamla Stan.
After wandering at Gamla Stan, I bought a cinnamon roll, went to Humlegarden, a park near my hotel, sat on a bench, and read a book, eating the cinnamon roll. If a park like this was near my home in Seoul, I would be really happy. Building a library, a park, and a stage that anyone comes and uses for free — building a free culture park — is one of my dreams, but can I construct this wonder in the future?

For the final project of this 12-week UI sprint, my peers and I were asked to create a passion project based on a travel campaign. This campaign’s deliverables would be executed through a 4 screen website, branding assets, and printed/digital media marketing; all targeted towards a specific demographic to promote possible visitors to visit that location.
I chose to focus my final project on Stockholm, Sweden. Over the last few years, it’s one of the cities I’ve set my heart on. With a deep love for all things Scandinavian design (both interior, industrial, and graphic), it was only natural that I wanted to infuse my personal interests into this project. Although I have never been, I asked myself why I would want to visit this city rich in arts & culture, and what my itinerary would possibly include while I was there. In my younger years growing up, I spent multiple weekends off school and during summer vacations obsessing over museums. My brother and I had no problem wasting away the day exploring each exhibit on display — he loved learning about dinosaurs, I was interested in arts & crafts. Under the same roof, we always found a middle ground.
During the initial research phase of this project, I came across an article that defined Stockholm as a “mecca of museums”. It is home to over 100+ museums within the city limits. Both national collections, and independent institutions that celebrate an array of topics — from ABBA, marine biology, photography, alcohol distillery, etc., Stockholm has a museum that would peak every type of interest for a potential tourist. Here I found the niche demographic I would design for. My goal was to highlight this special collection of institutions (for both museum lovers and those not familiar), and give the general public a streamlined resource for planning their visit in the city.
Moving forward, I created a fictional persona to design for the campaign — meet Joel Pryor. He’s 26 years old, and currently living, working, and playing in the city of Vancouver. He is a recent Architectural Technologist graduate, interning as a junior A/T at a firm. In the evenings he works part time at an East Van cocktail bar, where he connects with other likeminded peers that join his interests in film photography, design, biking, jazz music, and fashion. Listed below is his motivations/frustrations correlating to both travel planning in general, and visiting Stockholm for the first time. My goal was to create a realistic persona with flexible ideals that would be found in his demographic. Joel is knowledgeable in all things niche, and I wanted to create a campaign that reflected that altruistic path.
Before navigating artistic directions for the project, I already knew the route I wanted to take it in in terms of composition in typography. I wanted the project to be an ode to Swiss type, through the applications of poster and print. The Swiss design identity is bold and robust, yet simplified through its modern form and function of sans serif type. Below is the graphic inspiration and composition I collected moving forward in deciding the application of art directions.
Art direction #1: playful, bright, young, quirky, primary
Art direction #2: unapologetic, contrasting, provocative, strong
In the end, I decided to apply the second art direction due to the sensibility of black and white to contrast the colorful imagery that goes along with museums. Looping back to the persona, Joel, it would align with Swedish brands he’d identify with, and the “in your face” and “tongue and cheek” language of the campaign. Museums aren’t the most exciting attraction at the top of mind for people unlike Joel, and I felt that in order for it to resonate with a larger demographic, it would have to be striking.
For the logo, I played on the symmetry of stacked letters within the word “museums” to mimic the level of weights within the site branding. I went through multiple iterations of movement when it came to the letters, and thought that since the site followed a grid system, the logotype should also follow suit.
Circular STD was the singular font chosen for all the branding and application of the campaign. Carrying on with the sans serif typefaces known in Swiss design, it replicates a weighted presence without feeling intimidating. Black and bold is used for all the H1 and H2 headers, with book supplementing body text. All capitals are used on the headers to emphasize the urgency and weight.
As previous mentioned; the art direction I continued with carries a black and white narrative that is minimalistic, modern, and clean. Due to the variety of images hypothetically added by the museums themselves, I wanted a clean slate for the content to speak for itself. The only pattern that would contrast the two tones is a pinstripe; made up of a list of the museums within the city.
For collateral purposes, I chose products that would continue the conversation of the city and the findings at these museums past Stockholm city limits. Travellers would have the capability to carry their discoveries back home with them, and discuss their trip through the points of contact.
Below are the multiple levels of the Design Inception that I created for the campaign. The outer layer describes the environment of all UI assets, and as you go further into the center it breaks down the tone of the campaign through the tone. At the center of the Design Inception is the over arching why; why that target demo would find this campaign useful, and the overall purpose moving forward. My final why is as follows: “Connecting past and present”. Humanity wants to see a visual representation of change through time. Evolution, progression, succession — all documented and on view for the mass public. In the ethos section of the “About”, I created a spiral visual that lists the words “Remarkable. Relevant. Educational.” These three words summarize the levels of the inception on a digestable level.
Before unveiling the prototype, I wanted to outline the primary user flow that Joel, would walk through on the site. From the home page, the user would have the option to click the “About” page, which tells the ethos of the campaign, a “Registry” that lists the filter of museums within Stockholm, and finally, a “Web Shop”. For the sake of the prototype, the user would click “Registry” if they were interested in seeing the hub of locations, then from there their desired topic would filter their results into an event calendar, social media links, or that 3rd party museum site. The black squares are the screens made for the prototype and the white outlined boxes are future considerations.
As a final deliverable for the project, I compiled mockups for how Google Adwords would advertise the campaign. Keeping in mind the persona, I chose 4 different sites that Joel would frequently visit as his choice of media. The exemplary image below showcases the banner on Dezeen (both upper top and right of the navigation) but similar banners would be displayed on sites like Vice and Monocle. In terms of Instagram, I also wanted to imply that my target user frequents social media to see what’s current in the media and the influence it has on day to day. The Museums of Stockholm Instagram would emulate the feel of the site, and update users on new exhibitions, events, and restock of product.

full Travel Portfolio
Stockholm Syndrome, in case you didn't know, is the phenomenon of a captive becoming attached to, or at least developing feelings of trust or affection toward their captor. It was perhaps fitting/ironic/coincidental then, that as we landed in the Swedish capital our only organised activity for the weekend was a game of RoomEscape — a live action, “escape-the-room” puzzle-cum-teambuilding challenge.
However before I digress with this tenuous attempt to fit some sort of play on words into the blog title, let’s rewind the weekend and run things through chronologically.
← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ←
We flew out around lunchtime on Friday. If you book flights an appropriate amount of time in advance you can get from London to Stockholm for as little as £20 return. Which is great, but there are sacrifices to make elsewhere…getting from Skavsta Airport to Stockholm is actually more expensive than the flight (£22 return), and for us getting from Surrey to Stansted was even more expensive than that. But the journey is the destination, right…?
I always loathe arriving in a new place at night-time (or rather in darkness — it was only 16:30) as it totally inhibits one’s ability to soak up the local atmosphere — the vibe. And on a more practical level it makes it just that little bit trickier to get one’s bearings. We had no problem finding our AirBnb though — located one tube stop from the Central station and then barely 100m from the station to our front door.
The Friday night was not entirely different to our typical London Friday night — it was messy. Huge shout out to Helle for curating our insobriety and taking us to the Party Arena. I can confirm, Sweden definitely knows how to get trolleyed. And how to Salsa. I would go into more detail if I my memory would permit it.
Our most impressive feat of the weekend was perhaps waking up in time the next morning to catch Stockholm in the daylight (roughly 08:30 to 15:00). Our cultural custodians, Usman and Jordan (with the aid of Trip Advisor) guided us around the old town, and to Stockholm’s City Hall, the site of the annual Nobel Prize Banquet, which we missed by one day. Invites must’ve got lost in the post.
A pretty cool thing that was going on was this, an artificial “star” hoisted into the Swedish night sky, generated by solar energy from last summer. Using a sunny summer’s day to light up a cold winter’s night — neat.
☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀
Walking through the shopping areas of the city we stopped in at an American-themed clothes shop. For the life of me I can’t remember the name of the shop — but it was somewhere in the Norrmalm region of the city. Anyway I want to plug this shop as there brilliant offer was fill up a shopping bag full of anything in the shop for just 300 SEK (£25). The centrepiece of my shopping bag was a bowling shirt/short sleeved lab coat that was previously owned by Fernando, Assistant Logistics Manager at Hostess Brands. Yup.
Saturday night we decided to go on an organized bar crawl. For 200 SEK (roughly £18) you get a free shot in 4 bars, 20% off drinks and club entry. Whilst I’m usually the first to object to forced fun of any sort there was no denying that this was a pretty good way to explore the nightlife and meet new people. Of note was an English fireman who threw up on the dancefloor in the second bar we stopped in. Sean Kingston knows.
On to Sunday and we again forced ourselves out into the open to maximize the daylight. Whereas Saturday had been chilly but sunny, Sunday was a more overcast affair. We were however blessed with the first snowfall of the season, which felt like another thing checked off the checklist, even if it was just a few millimetres.
After a reindeer sandwich (seemed more interesting than the traditional Swedish meatballs) we headed to RoomEscape (not to be confused with the online role-playing game RuneScape…). Personally (and I think the others will probably agree), this was the hidden gem of the trip. The game was really well-designed so as to be intricate but not impossible, and the level of detail in the room made for a tense and almost realistic experience. Our scenario featured us trying to disarm nuclear weapons in a Cold War bunker. Despite requiring a few hints to cross the finish line we disabled the bomb and saved the world with 6 minutes to spare! You’re welcome.
So yeah, this was a great trip. No regrets, no “wrong” or “right” decisions, just a bucket load of deeds done. Amen.

Almost jealous of the Swedes
A couple of weeks back I had the pleasure of spending two days in Stockholm, Sweden. As you might already know, Finland used to be part of the great Swedish empire from the 12th century to 1809, so as a Swedish speaking Finn it is always a special feeling to visit Stockholm. It is as close to coming home to as anything that actually isn’t one’s home, this feeling being further enhanced by the many close friends I always get to catch-up with in Stockholm.
It is still almost difficult not to be jealous of my Swedish buddies: the Swedish economy is still strong, the Swedes are tall and beautiful, the tech ecosystem overall is vibrant, and some of the most exciting tech start-ups in the world are from Sweden (Spotify, Klarna, King.com, Pingdom, and many more). Although Creandum and Northzone are really great early stage VCs, I do however hear rumblings that there definitely would be room for more active seed stage investment. At least that seems to be the common message at SUP46, the SUPeractive start-up space smack in the middle of Stockholm. On this trip I also got to meet a few really interesting software companies. I really do hope we will soon find another Swedish investment for Open Ocean, our only current one of course being our rapidly growing superstar Truecaller (www.truecaller.com).
Luckily I haven’t yet had to turn completely green with envy of the Swedes, as my Finnish buddy Mikko Ilonen three weeks ago beat world number four Henrik Stenson in the World Matchplay golf final!

Landed Stockholm and went straight from Arlanda to Viggsö aka “Abba Island”.
Somehow I’m right outside ABBA’s hit-writing cottage on the island. Over the course of days I got subsumed by the breakdown of Björn and Agnetha’s marriage, as documented in ‘The winner takes it all’.
After 3 straight days of listening on repeat, the reductive zero-sum nature of the winner taking it all meaning that the loser *has* to fall weighed me down to exhaustion and I left Sweden, never to return.
Stockholm set off a bizarre mix of city-syndromes in my travels.
Medellin, Colombia: 24 hours in I began to suffer Netflix-induced delusions that I knew more about the #rise #fall of Pablo Escobar than anyone, including locals who actually knew him. I’d casually hang around the [since] demolished house where he was killed on December 2, 1993 and offer visiting tourists free guidance to the rest of Pablo’s Medellin. All but 3 refused me.
Beirut, Lebanon: Guns pointed at my head at a Hezbollah checkpoint near the airport after arrival and I developed some kind of fatalistic swagger, as if death could come at any time and I’d be just fine. So I pushed it. I went to the Bekaa Valley on the Syrian border with an American lady I met in a Beirut lesbian bar. I survived (everything), despite accidentally nudging a soldier’s Kalashnikov on the way to fly out.
Seoul, South Korea: Apart from the DMZ, all I really wanted to do in Seoul was to consume lots of nakji-bokkeum (super-spicy stir-fried octopus dish). Developing quickly into a tentacle-eating obsession in every form and for every meal. Within 24 hours of my first octopus dish I left my luxury Gangnam hotel and started sleeping rough at the Noryangjin fish market, focused on eating Sannajki (live octopus) as it came off the boats. Hallucinations and misunderstandings followed in that order and I hurriedly flew out of Incheon.
Melbourne, Australia: Obsessing crossing the Yarra river, repeatedly (crossing not obsessing). It’s not the Yangtze or the Mississippi but after a few days of hearing about the massive logistical challenges of “crossing the river”, I began to plot out a journey from one end to the other. Also sought out easier crossing points, knowing the stress that these people seem to have about “crossing”. I biked across every bridge crossing from Princes Bridge to the Johnston street bridge in Abbotsford. Not a single friend appeared interested in my views on where and how to cross the river. So I stopped obsessing and left for Sydney.
Tashkent, Ubzbekistan: Modernist architecture I know. Behren’s 1909 AEG factory in Berlin, Corbusier’s 1928 Villa Savoye in France and the Guggenheim here in NYC (guess the year) I’ve all seen. So arriving in Tashkent en route to a road trip around the Aral Sea and the former Soviet chemical weapons testing center on Vozrozhdeniya Island was just transiting. Abrubtly, a parallel world of Tashkent Modernism beckoned. Simple geometric shapes fused with large slabs of reinforced concrete. The exquisite latticework of the State Museum of History and then I checked into something even better from 1974: The Hotel Uzbekistan. I stayed until I ran out of funds and was deported back to Russia.
Granada, Spain: Uncovering what’s underneath; that was the obsession. Specifically what’s underneath the Christian surface and digging (figuratively) into Granada’s rich Islamic and Jewish past. Not just the obvious like the churches built over mosques, but the origins of what locals say. Like when they talk about going to barrio de los greñúos they actually are referring to the Realejo neighborhood with greñúo possibly being a reference to Jewish curls. Alas my few friends here got bored with my obsession with the underneath. One in particular caused me to leave town immediately when she suggested that Stranger Things would be a more appropriate place for me to visit The Upside Down.
Memphis, Tennessee: From aspiring vegetarian and practicing atheist it took only 3 days to become obsessed with meat and megachurches (M&Ms). A meat dish was not enough, I wanted my meat to be coated in meat sauce with a side of meat. And then the possibilities of horizontal integration hit me — everyone you meet in Memphis eventually tells you that their Grandma makes the best fried chicken you’ve ever had. So of course I ended up cruising megachurches and being inadvertently invited back to suburban Sunday fried chicken lunches cooked by real life grannies. Not nearly as creepy as it may sound and I remain generally welcome there to this day.
Johannesburg, South Africa: A sudden deep and abiding passion for security and for planning escape routes/rooms. Plotting out safe routes through town and excessive thinking about how to respond to carjacking attempts — do we floor the car when AK47s are pointed at us or do we immediately go limp and say ‘take whatever you want just leave us alone’. Asking in advance about where the safe room is seemed reasonable to me but some locals seemed to think I was overthinking. And then I was carjacked in mid-morning traffic and my continuous thought during the ensuing 24 minute firefight was ‘I told you so’.
Ciudad Juarez, Mexico: A day trip from joint city El Paso ended up as a days long foray into excessive medical tourism. I’d never really loved my chubby cheeks and really wanted a chiseled sculptured face, so day one ended up under that knife. I’d planned to walk across the Texas border back to El Paso but I spotted a street advertisement for a $100 nose job. That’s less than a boozy lunch so I tried that. Day 3 involved a $800 tummy tuck ($9,500 cheaper than NYC) and a breast augmentation ‘taster’ (don’t ask). I look good.
Kyiv, Ukraine: An unexplained sudden and deep interest in Metro stations and steam baths (Banyas). Peaked in one day spent exploring every corner of ‘Arsenala’, the deepest station in the Kyiv subway system and the second deepest in the world. Followed by an evening of having the shit beaten outta me with birch twigs whilst sipping on Kozak Ukrainian vodka made from dried wheat bread. This time they let me stay. I’m still here, red raw and smashed in every sense.

Amid thousands of coastal islands and inland lakes
Where boreal forests and glaciated mountains take
Stockholm to the East, Gothenburg to the South
The garrison town lingers on me in the shadows of a vintage movie
I check the ghost white newspapers for occurring theatre dates
Without pre-thought, I remade my African life into a Swedish life
Snapping photos in rare destinations is prohibited
Karlsborg! I am in Karlsborg! Why am I here?
Untouched by all the crowded dances
Fika, are you a sacred religion?
The relationships atypical
Atlas and I, discovering ourselves by the water’s edge
Spring has sprung, I’m grateful to be here among the young
In this very moment, I banish all gloom
My mucous membranes inflamed
My clouds scattered in Yahoo hues
May, may my Triumph tulips never die
Here eye to eye, unbound by earth and sky
I cannot lie, I thought by now I’d left up and fly
The victories have begun
Come along and let’s abide by the unsung
Many moons will fall my fragile Atlas, but tonight I’ll lull you to sleep
And tomorrow we’ll continue to give it our all
The little moments shared in silence,
thank God there’s no loud violence
Fika!
You’ve become a sacred religion.

Stockholm Design Week wrapped up yesterday and reports of the amazing designs presented are flooding in. Started in 2002, Stockholm Design Week has become the most important week of the year for Scandinavian Design, where just about everyone in any way connected to or interested in Scandinavian design meet and bring home new trends, contacts and inspiration. The design week runs in parallel to and supports the Stockholm Furniture & Light Fair, the world’s leading event for Scandinavian design. Today we’re going to take a look at some of our favorite designs we’ve seen from the even so far.
The Jin Chair
Created by Japanese designer Jin Kuramoto, this chair was named the best product at the Stockholm Furniture and Light Fair. The chair is made using flax fibers which are a completely biodegradable material that is most commonly used for money, tea bags and linen. Kuramoto devised a method that involves building and shaping thin flax fiber layers on top of each other to form both the seat and frame. A resin is then used to solidify the structure. The resin is also a bio-resin which can biodegrade or be burned. Kuramoto designed the Jin chair for Swedish furniture brand Offecct.
Apollo Lamp
Swedish design brand Phloc presented these elegant new lights. The super clean Scandinavian design is highlighted by the beautiful pastel color palette. The line was designed by Swedish architects Mats Broberg and John Ridderstråle who were inspired by a plumb bob, a tool with a pointed weight on its end that architects use to ensure a vertical hang. The lights are available in a range of colors and finished and can be hung individually or grouped together.
Snøhetta Lighting Range
The Norwegian architects Snøhetta launched their first lighting range at the design fair. Called the Flik Flak collection, the line is comprised of hinged wooden lamps. The lamps were originally designed for Sweden’s Treehotel and they were inspired by the building’s exterior. The lamps feature an LED strip that is sandwiched between black birch veneer and can be opened and closed at 180-degree angle as the planks are held together by a piano hinge. In its closed state, the lamplight is focused and when opened, it disperses across space.
Yoma by Zeitraum
This sleek bed has a very flexible design that we think will be popular as more and more people look for versatile furniture. The long side of the bed serves as a shelf, while the back cushions can be fixed in different positions and arranged to feel comfortable while sleeping, reading or just lounging. The mattress only sinks down a few centimeters, making it appear to be lying on top, giving the bed a sense of weightlessness.
The Barn & Fences
Created by Swedish designer Johan Kauppi, the Barn & Fences were inspired by the winter environment of Swedish Lapland. Intended to be used in office settings, the little houses and space dividers are semi-transparent, yet sound absorbent. Kauppi suggests using the barns for meeting and workplaces, and combining them to suit the office’s needs. The fences have standalone stability and great flexibility, making the system easy to use when creating temporary areas, walkways, angled shapes or zig-zag corners.
These are just some of the great designs that came out of this year’s Stockholm Design Week. What are your favorites? Personally we’d love to have our own personal little work barns. We’re interested to see how interior designers start using these pieces in their work, and look forward to seeing these designs used in interiors going forward.

(Reprinted from NUVO Magazine, June 2003.)
There are a few ways to get to the old town square in Stockholm, Sweden. You can walk up from the water, where Lake Malaren meets the Baltic Sea, calves feeling the steep incline up past the palace, a bright tableau of the city framed in a glance over your shoulder. Or, you can walk the twisty paths of Gamla Stan’s narrow streets (literally the “old town”), cobblestones uneven beneath your feet, past the purveyors of souvenirs, fine crystal and strong Swedish coffee. The practical traveler might opt for the subway (“Tunnelbana” or “T-Bana” for those in the know), emerging on the sunlit southern side of Gamla Stan and retracing steps northward in a straight line uphill. Whatever path you choose, it will eventually open up into the Stortorget — the “Great Square” — and the epicenter of Stockholm’s ancient self.
Four hundred years ago where a bloody coup was staged is now a bright and bustling square, with camera-wielding tourists and Swedes lingering the cafés, faces upturned to the perma-sun in summer or candle-warmed in winter. On their way through, many of them will alight on the steps of a building that bounces sunlight off its coral-coloured walls and classic white pillars, all across the west side of the Great Square. Like Stortorget, it is a combination of the old and the new — the eighteenth-century Old Stockholm Stock Exchange, meeting place of traders and burghers — to which has been attached a sleek pane of glass, affixed with spare steel rods and bearing simple white lettering, modern and minimalist, that let you know not only that you’ve arrived at the “Nobelmuseet” but that what is contained therein will fuse history with modernity and wrap it all up in a crisp, clean Nordic aesthetic. You may have to be a genius to be featured in this museum, but you needn’t be one to appreciate what it has to offer.
Officially it’s called the Nobelmuseet — i.e. “Nobel Museum” as written in the agglutinated Swedish style — but it consists of a single exhibition, “Cultures of Creativity: The Centennial Exhibition of the Nobel Prize,” which opened in April, 2001 to commemorate one hundred years of achievement. It is a topic of breadth and depth, and the exhibit opts for both, layering headlines and highlights over troves of information and esoterica, easily skimmed for the ADD-afflicted but rich in detail for the more questioning intellect (or for salonistas in search of clever cocktail conversation). Either way, it presents a century of Nobel-winning exploits in the context of the individual and the collaborative creative processes. Some conclusions are neatly drawn for visitor consumption (i.e. “creative milieus breed creative thinkers”) but most are left to the thoughtful museet-goer, who may or may not leave with an understanding of Pavlov’s Dog, Schrödinger’s Cat or how the heck Arafat ever won that Peace Prize.
That is the essence of the Nobel Prize: genius, and controversy. The museum does an excellent job of showcasing the first and alluding to the second. Taking in the cool, airy space, all metallic curves and shafts of light, the eye is drawn upward to a kind of conveyor belt on the ceiling, moving panels along like venetian blinds, each featuring the likeness of a Nobel laureate. Fritz Pregl, Chemistry, 1923. Luis Walter Alvarez, Physics, 1968. Naguib Mahfouz, Literature, 1988. Past the reception desk (50 Swedish krona buys you an afternoon of one-way intellectual hobnobbing) there are options: look straight ahead, and you will see an elegant row of plexiglass panels containing newspaper clippings in English and Swedish, each panel representing a decade of Nobel news. Look to the left and find a theatre showing eight vignettes featuring creative Nobel-spawning milieus (think Hemingway’s Paris and Bohr’s Copenhagen); look right and find a theatre showing thirty-two short films about not Glenn Gould but winners like X-Ray pioneer (and physics prize pioneer as the first laureate) Wilhelm Röntgen (1901), writer Wole Soyinka (1986), and Swedish statesman Dag Hammarskjöld (1961). On the other side of this theatre, an interactive multi-media room with headphones and individual flatscreen computers.
Perhaps the best place to begin, though, is at the back of the museum’s spacious single floor, past the sample banquet place-setting and on to the exhibit detailing the life of Alfred Nobel. It is the Nobel Museum after all, and indeed Stockholm’s only monument to the industrialist who made his home in many places other than Sweden yet somehow settled on his out-of-the-way homeland to administer and bestow the world’s most prestigious prizes. The sepia-toned display provides a fairly pristine account of Nobel’s life — his childhood in Stockholm and then St. Petersburg; his difficult inventor/industrialist father and brothers; the tragic loss of his younger brother, Emil, in a nitroglycerine explosion connected to Alfred’s experiments; his uneven and lonely romantic life; and the innovations he developed that advanced the industrial age and built the fortune that would eventually bankroll five distinguished prizes.
(It should be noted here that the so-called Nobel Prize in Economics is actually not a Nobel prize at all, but rather an award established by the Central Bank of Sweden in 1968 to honour Nobel’s memory, with a prize purse guaranteed to match that of the other laureates. It is adjudicated by the Swedish Academy of Sciences which is also responsible for the Physics and Chemistry prizes).
Nobel was, by most accounts, a difficult man — lonely, caustic, closed, not overwhelmingly happy (one of the best of these accounts is in Burton Feldman’s excellent The Nobel Prize which is a 489-page treasure trove of Nobel facts and factoids). He was a workhorse, traveling constantly, establishing dynamite factories across Europe and in the United States, where he spoke Swedish, English, French, Italian, or German depending on the locale. He wrote poetry and plays, patented his multifarious inventions, read widely, kept his own counsel. He died in San Remo, Italy, basically alone — childless, unmarried, brothers and parents deceased. And then, with his will, he gained an entirely new life in the form of the Nobel Prize.
Closed as he was, who can know what exactly motivated his now-famous will. Perhaps the erroneous obituaries, published on the death of his brother, by a few confused journalists — and not overwhelmingly complimentary. Perhaps guilt based on the deaths with which he was associated — dynamite accidents, an ill-fated balloon expedition he bankrolled, the loss of his own brother. Perhaps a desire for expiation, or for admiration — the kind that escaped him in life.
Whatever his reasons, they were enough to direct his entire fortune toward prizes — though only after five years of legal wrangling and painfully-wrought administration of a huge fund with scant guidance. Alfred Nobel’s Last Will and Testament consisted of a single wordy paragraph directing his accrued wealth to a fund which would annually provide for five prizes to “those persons who shall have contributed most materially to benefit mankind during the year immediately preceding” in the areas of Physics, Chemistry, Physiology/Medicine; Literature, and one “to the person who shall have most or best promoted the Fraternity of Nations and the Abolishment or Dimunition of Standing Armies and the Promotion and Increase of Peace Congresses.” The first four prizes were assigned to various distinguished Swedish academic organizations; the Peace Prize was to be selected by a committee determined, inexplicably, by the Norwegian Parliament. So indeed, from the very beginning this was a prize marked by drama and controversy (and who knows? Perhaps Nobel had thought of that, too).
Walking through the newspaper-clipping exhibit decade by decade reveals just how fraught with controversy it was. Here was a so-called global prize, being adjudicated by an exclusively Scandinavian body of bodies (and, except for the Oslo-centric Peace Prize, bestowed to this day by the Swedish king in a lavish ceremony in Stockholm on December 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel’s death). Entrusted to judge the forefront but geographically peripheral, the judges were not always fully informed of cutting-edge work (and as a result many prizes across the board were awarded years and sometimes even decades after the ‘winning’ work had been performed). There was a northern slant, felt almost immediately with a disproportionately high number of Nordic winners (this is seen particularly in the Literature prize, with fifteen Nordic laureates (including Iceland) to France’s twelve and the US’ eleven). Unlike the prefix “Oscar-nominated” there are no plaudits for runners up. Accordingly, competition was fierce and politics fiercer.
Of course, hindsight is always 20/20 but in a museum celebrating a century of prizes one can’t help but look back. While the actual exhibit does not render judgment on this prize or that — its purpose is to celebrate the Nobel Prize as an institution — it does not whitewash its chequered past of backroom politicking, uncredited (and unawarded) inventors, scandals, and shockingly bad choices (though of course you have to look for it!). Moreover, the prizes cannot be rescinded, and the deliberations are secret — so the mistakes of history stick. There was the prize for nuclear fission, awarded to German Otto Hahn in 1944, which completely excluded his decades-long partner Lise Meitner (who had fled, ironically, to Sweden at the outbreak of the war). There was the passing over of Dimitri Mendeleev, whose Periodic Table of the Elements hangs in every science classroom worth its salt, for chemist Henri Moissan who discovered fluorine — as it had already been predicted by Mendeleev’s chart! And Banting and Best — names that are inextricably linked in the Canadian lexicon — were not, in fact, honoured in 1923 for the discovery of insulin — that award actually went to Banting and J.J.R. Macleod (though Banting made a big show of splitting the prize money with Best, his graduate student assistant, and sharing the credit — not to mention that in 1962, theNobel Foundation publicly admitted that Macleod had erroneously been honoured). These were not isolated incidents.
Also common were dramas surrounding the prizes once awarded, based on the merits. Mikhael Gorbachev’s 1986 peace prize was hailed globally but received mixed reactions in the Motherland. Ditto Linus Pauling, who besides Marie Curie is the only laureate to have received a prize in two different categories — first Chemistry in 1954, and then the Peace Prize for his anti-nuclear agitation in 1962 was seen as an international slap in the face to the U.S. (not unlike how last year’s prize to Jimmy Carter was seen as a not-so-subtle rebuke of the Bush Administration’s hawklike foreign policy). Portuguese neurologist Antonio Egas Moniz was honoured with the Medicine prize in 1949 for pioneering the lobotomy, a horrendous procedure that mentally neutered thousands of patients before mercifully falling out of favour within a decade.
Some prizes were even so hotly debated within the supposed coolly objective minds of the adjudicating committees that resignations ensued: in 1989, two members of the Swedish Academy (which judges Literature) resigned over the committee’s decision not to name Salman Rushdie and take a stand against the Iranian fatwah against him — up from one resignation in 1989 for naming William Golding. And back to Arafat: a member of the ’94 Peace Committee publicly resigned and denounced him as a terrorist. Omissions, too, make up as distinguished a list as any collection of laureates: Sigmund Freud. J. Robert Oppenheimer. Henrik Ibsen. Leo Tolstoy. Virginia Woolf. Dimitri Mendeleev. Mahatma Ghandi.
Even more poignant were other omissions — omissions on the dais accepting the award. German-Jewish journalist Carl von Ossietsky was not available to accept his 1935 Peace Prize as he was incarcerated in a concentration camp, where he died. The uproar over the episode prompted Hitler to forbid Germans or Austrians to accept their prizes (beginning in 1938) which resulted in at least three laureates having to forfeit their prize money (still extremely lucky compared to Ossietsky). Controversial, outspoken laureates from the USSR were also precluded from attending — Boris Pasternak in 1958, Andrei Sakharov in 1975. The Nobel Prize is bigger than the laureate alone.
That fact is at its most affecting in the corners of the exhibit, quietly regarding the balance Marie Curie used to weigh her newly-discovered radium, the well-worn Underwood typewriter used by Isaac Bashevis Singer, complete with Yiddish lettering, or listening to Toni Morrison’s beautiful and richly-toned Nobel lecture on headphones in the multi-media room, then Nelson Mandela’s, then Bashevis Singer in his voice aged with patience: “People are asking me often, why do you write in a dying language? Firstly, I like to write ghost stories, and nothing works like a dead language. Ghosts love Yiddish, they all speak it.”
As fascinating as a wander through the Nobelmuseet inevitably is, the museum-going experience is taken to an entirely new plane by virtue of the gift shop. In addition to a fine array of the usual — postcards with distinguished-looking laureates, to whom are attributed elegant-sounding quotes; books about Alfred Nobel, the Nobel Prize and various laureates; posters of exhibited pieces — it offers a creative selection of souvenirs. Highlights include the peculiarly Swedish salty licorice treat, “salt lakrits,” quaintly packaged in the form of a long stick of dynamite (perhaps in a nod to how you’d feel if you actually ate the whole thing) and gold foil-wrapped chocolate coins fashioned after the Nobel medallions (surely a necessary chaser of the aforementioned lakrits!). Also of note is a particularly charming postcard of Albert Einstein reclining against a rock in summer shorts, looking oddly fetching with his slender calves and strappy summer sandals (the quote — “It is harder to crack a prejudice than an atom” — is pure Einstein, who was a passionate advocate for peace and submitted as many nominations for the Peace Prize as he did for physics).
My favorite Nobel keepsake, however, is a Nobel-inspired cookbook for those who would replicate the ceremonial banquet at home, minus the average IQ (The Nobel Banquets: Modern Recipes from the Classic Menus, by Hélène Bodin and Stefan Bjur). The book pairs menu selections from various years with information about the laureates being so honoured and the historical background of the era. 1954, for example, was a banner year celebrating German physicists Max Born and Walther Bothe, Linus Pauling’s Chemistry prize and John Enders, Thomas H. Weller and Frederick C. Robbins, three distinguished U.S. virologists. Had literature laureate Ernest Hemingway been well enough to attend the inter-laureate conversation would probably have been very different. As it was, he missed out on hot smoked rainbow trout with spinach chanterelle mushroom sauce, grilled filet of beef with tagliatelle vegetable and red wine sauce, and green pears accompanied by pistachio nut ice cream (perhaps one of the German physicists ate enough for Bothe of them).
Souvenirs in hand and laureate-worthy thoughts in head, the Nobelmuseet has hopefully provoked thoughts more compelling than weak puns on physics laureates (I hope I’m not Bohr-ing you). Outside, the sun is surely still shining; it’s summer after all, and that’s what the sun does in a Stockholm summer. Stotorget is still bustling and the cafés still do a brisk business. Walking out into the square, there are a few ways you can go — down toward the water, south to the subway, lazily through the rabbit-warren streets of Gamla Stan. Moving away, you throw a glance over your shoulder — framed there is the Nobelmuseet, pillars and glass gleaming in the sunlight, fusion of things old and new from these past hundred years.

In this blog, I want to share my recent trip to Stockholm and all the experiences I had during my journey.
The whole trip started because I wanted to plan something good for a UK bank holiday. Sweden was never on my travel list, and I also had a childhood friend living there with his family whom I hadn’t seen in more than four years. So, it felt like the perfect opportunity to catch up and explore a new place at the same time.
On the day of my journey, I took a Norwegian flight from London Gatwick to Stockholm Arlanda. The flight had a slight delay leaving Gatwick but still arrived almost on time. From Arlanda, I hopped on a Flygbussarna bus to reach Stockholm central, and the journey was smooth, taking just 50 minutes. It was already past 10 in the evening when I arrived, but my friend, who lives about 20 minutes away, kindly came to pick me up. We used trams and the metro to get to his place.
One interesting thing I noticed was that you could purchase tickets for most forms of transportation using your mobile phone and scan a QR code when boarding. It was a convenient use of technology and saved me the hassle of buying tickets in person or carrying a separate travel card, like in London.
On Day 2, we bought a single SL ticket for 39 SEK (approximately £2.89) to get to Stockholm central and then decided to walk around. We covered around 20 kilometers, exploring significant historical places like Stockholm City Hall, where Nobel Laureates have their dinner after receiving their prizes. We also visited Gamla Stan, the Royal Palace, Parliament, and many beautiful islands. What stood out to me was the Stockholm Archipelago concept, where many small islands are connected by bridges or ferries, creating a vibrant and unique city. It’s different from many other European cities I’ve been to.
Day 3 took us to Djurgarden. We loved the Open Air museum, where they’ve preserved or recreated life from the 16th-17th centuries. It’s a fantastic way to keep history alive and attract tourists. Skansen, in the same area, had a cool zoo with Swedish and Nordic wild animals. Our next stop was the Vasa Museum, the highest-rated place on Google and TripAdvisor. It’s a treasure trove of interesting historical facts, showcasing a 300+ year-old sunken ship and its history. What amazed me was how they turned a “FAILURE” into a celebration and learning opportunity.
Day 4 was all about visiting Drottningholm Palace and its surroundings in the morning before my evening flight back to London. The palace is where the Swedish Royal family still resides, and it’s a well-maintained place with beautiful gardens. The whole area is so large that it can take hours to explore.
But, as my great trip was coming to an end, some miseries had to balance the good and bad in life! I received notifications on my mobile that my return flight, scheduled for 21:00, had been delayed until 05:33 the next morning. After contacting British Airways customer care and checking the news, I learned that there was a UK-wide Air Traffic Control ‘technical glitch’ causing flight delays and cancellations. The customer care representative advised me to reach the airport as per my original schedule, as they were working to make things right. However, upon arriving at the airport, I found out that the flight was canceled, and no one knew the next steps. The check-in counter gave me an apology letter with vague instructions that essentially said, “figure things out on your own, and we might reimburse you later.” Other passengers said there were no available BA flights to London for at least the next three days. Customer care calls were rejected, and the British Airways app and website crashed due to high traffic. I was essentially stuck in a city without knowing when I could leave.
Luckily, I was able to return to my friend’s place instead of searching for a hotel. I continuously followed the news, which reported thousands of UK-bound flights canceled and the chaos continuing for days. In this situation, I started looking for all available options to get back, including buses, trains, ferries, and routes through other cities. Fortunately, I found an available but expensive option with SAS Airlines for the next day via Stavanger, Norway. So, I decided to go for it instead of getting stuck in Stockholm, which would have affected everything, including my work.
On Day 5, I left my friend’s place with a lot of uncertainty about what lay ahead. Fortunately, the first flight from Stockholm to Stavanger went smoothly. However, before boarding the next flight, I heard an announcement that the flight was overbooked, and they were looking for volunteers to take the next day’s flight along with a 250 Euro compensation! I quickly moved to the front of the boarding queue, just in case they asked me to volunteer if no one else did. I saw the boarding process begin, and the flight was very full. The flight waited for over 40 minutes due to the overbooking issue, and the pilot announced that they had to remove luggage for those who couldn’t make it, causing further delays. After all the chaos, I finally reached London after almost eight hours of travel, which was initially planned for just two hours!

On the outskirts of Stockholm, the Stockholmsmässan convention center played host to one of this year’s much anticipated AWS Summits — it was a day packed with innovation, insights, and conversations around what AWS has been most recently working on for the Cloud. With keynotes about generative AI, hands-on demos, and real-world use cases from the some big names, the event offered a deep dive into how AWS is shaping the future of tech, how companies are leveraging LLM’s and generative AI to build exciting new features, and how they save costs while scaling to a global audience.
I was impressed to see how global companies like Booking.com have already deeply integrated AI into their products and development processes — a clear reminder that those who don’t embrace it, risk falling behind.
Here are a few highlighted talks that I attended with Thibault, my teammate at ACTUM Digital!
We kicked off our packed day of sessions with a talk from Tom Soderstrom, — an AWS Enterprise Strategist and former CTO at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory! Tom’s talk was absolutely packed with interesting stories and experiences from his extensive career with NASA — he gave some insights on how we can experiment better by optimising for speed, reducing cost and risk, and not aiming for perfection the first time around. I really enjoy the kind of talks that don’t try to teach you a specific technology, but instead inspire you to go and think about work in a different way, or approach ideas with a different mindset. I found a shorter version of Tom’s presentation on the AWS Events YouTube Channel — I highly recommend giving it a watch!
From less technical to very technical — this talk about how Booking.com utilises SageMaker was incredibly in-depth, the team of speakers managed to pack so much into an hour! After a brief introduction explaining the trade-offs between different LLM inference options, we were walked through two new GenAI features that Booking.com implemented into it’s product, and then how they fine-tuned the specific needs of each with the help of Amazon SageMaker AI. First, how they reduced the cost of their accommodation description generator by 180x, and second, how they made their intuitive, prompt-based filter search tool 15x faster. You can read more about this in their very detailed AWS Blog post.
As part of a cross-functional team responsible for monitoring and investigating ops issues in our environments, we are all too familiar with the art of getting alarm thresholds into the “sweet spot” where they’re actually alerting for potential issues, and not for some expected window of peak traffic. Alex Livingstone and Mohamed Wali of AWS gave us some great ideas how we can use several “anomaly detection” features of CloudWatch to learn from expected behaviour patterns, and minimise intervention. The models are retrained on AWS automatically without any need for user input, but specific periods can also be excluded from training if you don’t want them to impact the results.
We also saw a demo of Amazon Q Developer operational investigations, a much anticipated CloudWatch feature currently in preview, that instructs Amazon Q to automatically investigate alarms on your behalf. This way, when you go to your dashboard after an alert, you’re already presented with key observations highlighted to aid your investigation why an alarm was triggered. You can see the logs of which services Amazon Q inspected, what information it discovered, and what suggestions it has generated to fix the issue. In some cases, it can even provide runbook suggestions in Systems Manager that can execute steps to resolve the issue automatically! Care must be taken to review these before executing — but as the models behind detection/resolution get smarter, these could start saving developers a lot of time when investigating root causes of issues.
As usual — AWS delivered with a Summit packed full of news, updates, and new technologies to try out, while also sharing some real-world customer success stories as inspiration how we can better leverage AI in our products — If you’re interested in AWS or the cloud at any level, we highly recommend the trip to an AWS Summit near you!

Petra Gardafjord, founder of beautiful Swedish kids brand Beton Studios shares her daily life in Stockholm for a little travel inspiration
My family and I live in a suburb to Stockholm called Sundbyberg, or Sumpan as we like to call it. It’s like its own little town, a little quiet, but still lots going on! Since we live outside the big city we ride the tube everyday. The kids have grown up with it and could probably go by themselves if we let them!
Sumpan is a mix between old and new. It used to be real industrial town but is getting really modern by the years. It’s growing like mad, housing hundreds of families.
On the weekends we like to play outdoors. There’s a park called Tornparken, where the kids can play for hours. In the summer there’s a good sized toddler pool, perfect to splash around in.
Just close by the park is an old water tower rebuilt just recently into a restaurant, Delibruket. They have the most amazing flatbread pizza buffet during weekends and we can sit for hours. Outside is the most amazing view across the town and we can see our house from there.
The library is the perfect spot for changing diapers, nursing, feeding, coffee and just hit the couches with a few good children’s books. It’s a great place to get a little down time since the kids know they can’t be loud in there.
My most favorite place here is Marabouparken. It has a big beautiful park, full of life during the weekends. In the warmer days we bring our towels and picnic baskets and eat fruit and a good fika (Swedish for coffee and buns/cookies) in the grass. Inside is a exhibition hall for all sorts of art and a cool restaurant, Parkliv, that serves the best rhubarb lemonade and lemon pie!
We are a very active family and every chance we get we are out riding bikes or visit the local public swimming pool. We also recently discovered this gorgeous old gym hall just across from where we live. It’s not open for the public but Martin got contacts from work so sometimes we sneak inside and make ourselves a obstacle course and run around like mad people. The kids love it!

So, you may remember that back in September 2024, I was awarded a full bursary to attend an ECR (early career researcher) networking event in Stirling, Scotland. The event was organised by the British Society of Gerontology’s emerging researchers in ageing group (ERA), in collaboration with SWEAH (the Swedish national graduate school on ageing and health), and hosted at the University of Stirling.
You can read my reflective blog on the ECR networking event here.
So, then in February 2025, the cohort who’d attended this networking event were invited to join another collaborative event between ERA and SAIN (the SWEAH Alumni Interdisciplinary Network) — this time, to join a writing retreat in Stockholm, on the island of Långholmen in the old prison!
The retreat provided the opportunity for: networking, space for co-writing and quiet time, social activities, and also the chance to share our research with the group through short presentations. It was too good an opportunity to miss — especially as attendance at the writing retreat was funded — huge thanks to ERA and SAIN!
Having arrived earlier than most, for my extended research trip, I was one of the first to check in at the former prison — enabling me to settle in over a nice dinner, but fall straight into bed in my ‘cell’! I was tired, as it had already been quite a full-on week!
The organisation, just as it had been in Stirling, was impeccable — we’d been advised of other mates’ arrival and departure times (to co-ordinate travel together), and had received the schedule in advance so we knew what to expect! What we hadn’t bargained on was the incredible hospitality of the Swedish, including my introduction to the concept of ‘fika’ — see blog post three and sharing three meals a day with the group.
Wednesday morning gave me the chance to catch up with a friend from Stirling, before joining the others for our first shared lunch together and then kicking off the retreat with introductions, short research presentations, and an introduction to ELSA (the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing) by Dr Brian Beach (University College London / Karolinksa Institutet).
I was particularly excited about our short presentations, as this was the first time I’d had the opportunity to share our co-created postcard blog series, from my Take a Walk in My Shoes research project. Also, in Stirling I’d use haiku poems for my research presentation, this time I used the postcards…
What’s always fascinating for me at ‘gerontology’ events is the rich diversity of research interests and approaches. We’re all focused on aspects of ageing, but bring an incredible variety of topics, methodologies and personalities — it’s great!
We heard about the Intersectional Stigma of Place-based Ageing (ISPA) project, explored voices of older people from marginalised communities and women living with the impact of intimate partner violence.
We learnt about end of life care through the lenses of understanding health inequalities towards the end of life with dementia and through the architectural design of hospices in England; and considered emotional and physical wellbeing through psychological studies into depression and future-time perspectives, and the impact of the built-environment design of housing and healthcare on the psychology of its users.
Age-friendly design and social relationships in physical spaces and urban neighbourhoods, environmental design for ageing and cognitive health, and the detection and assessment of dementia in the autistic population also featured in the presentations, as well as how stress in earlier life and impact health and functioning in later life.
Further research projects are exploring health inequalities in ageing through the interplay between genes and socioeconomic environment, and focusing on how life-course factors shape health and work prospects in later life; in addition to a focus on extended working lives, risk and protective factors for cognitive ageing and dementia.
Healthy ageing was explored in relation to physical function, high-intensity interval training, cardiovascular and cognitive health, and psychological health during the retirement transition.
The writing retreat provided equal measures of intense research focus and writing, with time to enjoy our local setting and spend time with friends. This balance isn’t easy to get right — but it was done here with thought, care, and lots of time for eating and drinking together!
Since attending this ERA event in April, I’ve been invited to present at the ERA pre-conference, which takes place before the main BSG conference in June 2025, AND have secured a bursary to attend. Thank you!

Updated September 2019
This guide is meant to help you navigate the Stockholm Tech/Startup Scene.
Stockholm’s tech scene is considered one of the leading in the world, and it’s growing quickly. Investments are at record levels with $1,4Bn invested in 2016, and $1,75Bn exit value in the same year.
In the center of every startup community are the entrepreneurs. Without them there wouldn’t be a startup community to begin with. After the entrepreneurs, there’s a second layer of support from investors, government, universities etc. These form an ecosystem that can be hard to navigate.
To help you navigate I’ve listed the organisations and initiatives that support tech startups in one way or another — and that can be found in Stockholm.

Every school day, I send my kids into a building where other people take on a role in loco parentis, meaning in place of a parent. In many ways, this is a wonderful oppotrunity for them. In others, it’s kind of like sending them to that ex-spouse whose views vary so widely from yours that it’s a wonder your kids haven’t fallen into a chasm of confusion yet.
This particular rant is about the chasm of differences between our heroic attempts at engaging in good nutrition at home v. the notorious, the storied, the hallmarked….SCHOOL LUNCH.
Yes, the ominous school lunch has received its due reputation over the years — often appearing in more than just a cameo in our favorite coming-of-age TV and movies, rued for its terrible taste and dubious ingredients. It even became the star of one of the best comedic outputs from Adam Sandler and Chris Farley (say it with me: sloppy, sloppy Joe).
But it’s not just the taste or the ingredients that I feel urged to rant about today. It is the two-strike punch that is its lack-luster nutritional value plus my utter lack of control over it.
What caused this most recent bout of rage, you might ask? A simple review of our school’s menu of the day, in order to help my kids decide whether to bring home lunch or school lunch. And what did I find upon venturing into that dark abyss?
Our school district feeds our kids “entrees” of — I kid you not — cinnamon rolls. And these are served with a side “vegetable” of — no, really — tater tots.
This is not a joke.
Then they talk to my kids about the dangers of peer pressure on forming unhealthy habits…
The object lesson comes when my kid brings their broccoli and chicken to school and watches all ten of their friends eat cinnamon rolls next to them, so then they have broccoli, chicken, and cinnamon rolls (which, who wouldn’t?).
I have no idea who came up with the meal plan, who put it into writing, who reviewed it, who approved it. I do understand that there are limitations that those persons are working with, including systematic problems and budgetary issues. I also think they were either uninformed or wholly uncreative, un-adaptive, and unresourceful. Or, they also make bad choices for themselves and don’t want to admit it, so they just perpetuate the problems. Now I shall venture into the swamp of that latter estimation:
A few days ago, I came across a social media post (not exactly reality, I know) pleading with folks in a Type One Diabetes group to “agree and acknowledge” that Type Two Diabetes is not caused by diet. Because I am a glutton for punishment, I went to the comments. I expected to see at least some folks kindly or courteously disagreeing, (because this particular group is generally kind and courteous) but…I didn’t. Instead, I saw a whole lot of “yeah, it’s a complex issue,” or “yeah, it’s unclear” nonsense. Why are we telling ourselves this story (at least online)?
Our insulin sensitivity becomes less sensitive due to overuse, and how do we cause overuse? Um, by overusing it…e.g., by feeding it lots of things that require insulin (cue cinnamon rolls and tater tots).
I’m getting pretty sick of people in our culture trying to excuse away suboptimal choices because they feel bad about themselves for making those choices. The truth is this: will power is hard (especially at first) and much harder when it also involves counter-culture, and right now, our culture is a punk kid with a green mohawk and leather coat who is not only dogging us, but whom our parents actually hired to watch us, so we can’t get away from him, and he’s constantly egging us on to do stupid shit in the form of terrible nutrition. We don’t have to lie to ourselves in order to cut ourselves slack about this.
But instead of saying “those donuts sitting feet away from me in the staff room, every single Monday, without fail, with their pink frosting and happy-go-lucky sprinkles, make it much more difficult for me to not eat them,” we tell ourselves this story instead: “those donuts in the staff room aren’t actually bad for me.” Both statements cut us some slack, but the first one is true and the second one is a lie.
And only the first one has the added benefit of reminding us that the culture around us is a problem, and that we could actually address it, at least little by little. The lie, on the other hand, just perpetuates the system that continues to peer pressure us into making choices that deteriorate the mid- and end-years of our lives.
So what to do about it. First, cut yourself slack in the form of actual truth. You are living in Foodcourtia, and that makes it very dificult to make good choices.
Second, don’t be the person who brings donuts, or who puts candy on your desk, or who brings mounds of shareable snacks to events (did you know the word — the very idea — of a “snack” was invented by the food industry in order to sell you more stuff? I shall refer you to Invader Zim for a lighthearted way to laugh about this). It’s unecessary to add to the problem. Do be that person who dares to bring single-ingredient foods, vegetables, protein, etc. to the world’s staff rooms, desks, and events instead.
Because, you, too, can be a punk kid with a mohawk peer pressuring the people around you.

“ Topophilia is the love of place, a deeply felt affective response to the environment. It is more than a preference; it is a visceral attachment to a locale that resonates with memory, identity, and aesthetic or cultural meaning.” – Yi-Fu Tuan, Topophilia: A Study of Environmental Perception, Attitudes, and Values (1974)
The term Topophilia, coined by geographer Yi-Fu Tuan, refers to the emotional bonds between an individual and a certain place. When examined philosophically, Topophilia may be understood as more than emotional attachment; it becomes a lens through which existence is structured and understood. This essay develops a first-person philosophical reflection on my Topophilia, grounded in personal experience of Stockholm as a city whose atmospheric restraint and spatial quietude have reshaped my understanding of happiness, time, and selfhood. In the city where I have encountered what I refer to as Nordic Euphoria, which I define as, a sustained condition of existential balance and interior coherence, and not just a euphoric peak of sensory pleasure. My intention here is to articulate how specific geographies can participate in the formation of lived meanings, and how they function as existential orientation.
The notion of Topophilia is often reduced to sentimental longing or cultural nostalgia. Yet when viewed through the lens of existential philosophy and phenomenology, it appears as a far deeper relation. Hence, a mode of attunement between inner and outer worlds. In other words, the experience of being in a place may signal a deeper ontological fit, where the external rhythms of a landscape mirror or harmonize with one’s inner structure of feeling. In the context of Stockholm, this alignment revealed itself not through dramatic moments, but in a quiet and recurring realization of coherence. The slow unfolding of time, the softness of urban soundscapes, and the restraint in visual stimuli all contributed to a sense of interior deceleration. Time, in this place, did not push forward – to me, it deepened. This temporal stillness allowed for a psychological settling, where being became less fractured and more whole.
The specific characteristics of Stockholm is in its Northern flavour, muted colors, and measured pace that engage the phenomenology of place in unique ways. These elements invite a form of presence that is not about stimulation but about stillness. This is not the absence of movement, but the presence of calm. Besides, the city’s space becomes an aesthetic and affective medium through which one experiences a non-anxious, grounded form of subjectivity. The condition of Nordic Euphoria is not commonly described in either philosophical literature or urban theory. It is neither hedonistic nor ecstatic. Rather, it is my sustained experience of equilibrium. It arises from the city’s spatial ethos; the silence of winter, the rhythmic calm of public spaces, and the sense of contemplative detachment embedded in the architecture itself. This spatial environment subtly constructs a psychological atmosphere in which self-conscious striving diminishes, and being-in-the-world becomes sufficient in itself.
In this context, Topophilia becomes more than a desire for familiarity or beauty. It is a structure of belonging that roots identity not in biography but in spatial resonance. Stockholm, in this reflection, becomes not a setting but a co-constitutive element of identity. The city’s stillness mirrors and shapes a form of joy that is not externalized, but interior. This mode of happiness resists conventional definitions not depending on progress or fulfillment, but on presence. It is the joy of walking without purpose, of looking without need to possess. In Stockholm, the relationship to space becomes one of trust, or a confidence in which no performance is needed to justify one’s being. In this trust, I found a form of happiness that I had never known before, and which I refer to as a form of “existential arrival”.
In essence, place is not a neutral backdrop to human experience, but it is often a silent participant in shaping who we become. When understood deeply, Topophilia is not about place alone but it is about the self-in-place, and about the transformation of subjectivity through spatial experience. The experience of Stockholm as examined here is not anecdotal but archetypal; it shows how space, when aligned with one’s existential rhythms, becomes a silent teacher of stillness, presence, and coherence. The eternal Topophilia to Stockholm is not nostalgia for a fixed past, nor fantasy of escape. Therefore, it is an ongoing, lived alignment between external geography and internal structure. Simply put, my Nordic Euphoria is not a memory but it is a way of being, where my sense of self – no longer fragmented by acceleration or noise, finds rest in the fold of place.

Every researcher has that one piece of lab equipment they’re irrationally attached to, the old centrifuge that rattles like a lawnmower, the cracked beaker they refuse to throw away, or the pipette that’s seen them through every late-night experiment.
For me, it’s a pipette. And if it could talk, it would probably file a complaint.
This is the story of a partnership that started with respect and careful handling… and spiraled into something much more chaotic. A love-hate relationship built on duct tape, bad habits, and stubborn loyalty.
Back when I first got this pipette, it was love at first click. It fit perfectly in my hand — sleek, shiny, ready to help me conquer experiments one microliter at a time.
“Ah, yes, the glory days,” my pipette would say now. “Remember when you used to respect me?” it would sigh. “You used to calibrate me. Now you just pray.”
In those early days, I carried it around like a newborn. I placed it gently on foam pads, wiped it down after every assay, and whispered silent apologies if I accidentally tapped it too hard.
“I did have feelings,” it would say. “Now I just have scratches and abandonment issues.” “Your pipetting technique is why my therapist says I have trust issues.”
But fast forward to year two of grad school. I’m tired. It’s tiring. We’re still pretending we’re fine.
“You’re one coffee spill away from dropping me again. I know it. And I’m not emotionally ready.” “Now you throw me around like I wronged you personally.” “I’m in my third existential crisis this week — and that’s just from your PCR setup.”
These days, I barely think before I grab it. I jam tips on like I’m trying to break a world record. Calibration? A distant memory. I tell myself I’ll “definitely do it tomorrow,” knowing surely that I won’t.
“You used to warm me up,” it grumbles. “Now you treat me like a glue stick with a grudge.” “Precision? Sweetheart, I’m eyeballing volumes at this point.” “I’m not a pipette anymore. I’m an emotional support stick.”
Sometimes, when my experiments fail and the pipette aspirates weirdly, I glare at it like it personally betrayed me.
“YOU forgot to pre-wet the tip,” it would hiss. “Don’t gaslight me.”
Maybe — just maybe — I’m the problem. “Oh, you think?” the pipette snaps.
There are newer pipettes in the drawer. Calibrated. Smooth. Reliable. But I don’t reach for them. It’s always you, old friend.
“Stockholm syndrome. Look it up,” my pipette mutters, rolling its imaginary eyes.
At this point, we’re both hanging on by willpower, static electricity, and two pieces of lab tape.
“You think your data’s unreliable? Buddy, I’m running on trauma and duct tape,” it says, deadpan.
And yet, I can’t throw it away. We’ve been through too much. It’s more than a pipette now, it’s part of my PhD trauma. “One more semester,” it whispers. “Then I ghost you.”
Maybe science is also like life, it is about learning to love the broken things that still show up every day, even when they talk back.

Stockholm’s skyline from Södermalm is something special that ensnares your senses with the same sort of soft-spoken estranged quirkiness you’ve seen in similar European cities or in the smaller surrounding suburbs encircling them. You know the kind of suburbs I mean. The ones where you end up celebrating the New Year because your long-distance girlfriend’s friends live in city-skirting cottages. The ones where you’re quickly forced to accept that the WiFi just isn’t gonna work so you connect to Baileys instead. The ones where people mostly don’t speak English and you finally file that three-day Duolingo streak you achieved in 2013 under ‘non-functional’.
Also filed under ‘non-functional’ is the Katarina Elevator, the second thing to catch your eyes when you’re treading November puddles across the bridge into Södermalm — the first is an impromptu paste-up anti-Trump exhibition tied to the hashtag #PensForFreedom. When you’ve had a sensible chuckle at The Donald redrawn as various memes and fascist figures, you hop on the free roaming data your phone plan has blessed you with, Google ‘bridge elevator soda mall’, and tap ‘did you mean: bridge elevator södermalm’. You read that the local hard hats closed the lift in 2010 because it had rusted into a death trap. Sounds fun, you think.
Though the lift itself is closed, the span of bridge between its peak and the heights of Södermalm is still open and littered with throngs of tourists as awkwardly monolingual as yourself, so you summit the substitute lift-shaft: a string of wooden steps zig-zagging from the lowly lock up to where the lookout kisses the cliff. Walking out into the elements, you instantly start to visualize all the photos you’re gonna take, and the double-tap-baiting hashtags to go with them. There are lengths of metal wiring above the hip-height barriers, so you grip your iPhone extra tight and slip it between the safety cables.
Why is there a large Coca Cola sign fastened to the façade of that building? It doesn’t look like a factory. If it is a factory, well, damn, cute factory. There’s a huge Heineken sign a few buildings over, too. It makes you want to go buy a pint, until you remember Stockholm booze prices. Either way, you’re gonna do some cool shit with the red and green of the signs when you edit these photos in Lightroom and VSCO later. Snap, snap, snap. Oh, and there’s the Stomatol sign you read about on Atlas Obscura. It’s the oldest animated sign in Sweden. It still lights up at night in the same way it has since 1909. It’s a tube of toothpaste.
You’ve never been this excited by an animated illuminated tube of toothpaste.
Yellow and orange have always been your favorite colors. You’ve convinced yourself it’s because they’re attention-grabbing shades which make people stop and look at your photos on Instagram, but deep down inside you know it’s because a few of your crushes have had the slightly manic pixie dream girl tendency to wear bright colors. Now it’s time to crush on some buildings, because the Stockholm city skyline you see from the bridge is a beautiful blend of fall hues. Why the endless layers of yellow and orange architecture? You’d Google it but your phone has died because the battery got too cold.
There’s something bothering you about a few of your cityscape photos, and you realize it’s a construction site in the corner. A jagged hole at the center of a crossroad bordered by a clashing blue tarp. You look out, and notice for the first time that the cityscape is dotted by a whole web of these pockmarks. It’s like taking a selfie and gradually counting all the spots on your face. People regurgitate the cliché that living life through a camera or a screen stops you from seeing the beauty in the world, but if anything, it just helps you see the shitty stuff faster.
The dot-to-dot of building works reminds you of Berlin. That time your other long-distance girlfriend said the German capital’s like one big eternal construction project. That’s a cute and endearing observation, you think. It’s a shame you only saw Berlin from one of those open-top double-decker tour buses. Why did you do that? You’re better than that.
You made up for it, though, by completely eschewing public transport in Sweden. You and your travel companions walked everywhere. Heck, you didn’t even ride the funicular to the top of the open-air museum-zoo hybrid Skansen, and funiculars align perfectly with your love of ageing quirky technologies, Tom Scott videos, and not climbing hills. You even skip the metro when the snow settles and turns the ground into an icy deathtrap on your final day in Stockholm. You throw on your warm clothes, right? Nope. Somehow, you’ve become known as the guy who always wears shorts, and you can’t just break a two-year streak because global warming isn’t doing its job properly.
Your friends fly back to the US. Two days later, Trump gets elected. No amount of warm clothes can help with that coldness.
You’ve still got seven hours in Stockholm by yourself before you board the Arlanda Express and head to the airport, and you’ve made plans to meet up with another friend in Sweden. She’s Latvian, and you’ve only met her once, at a garden party back home in Portsmouth. You’re pretty sure you got really drunk and miscommunicated an opinion about national stereotypes in a way that insulted her, but she still wants to see you, so that’s nice. You flick your access card into the old suitcase the hostel have fashioned into a deposit box and walk out into the snow, and for the first time in two years, you feel like it isn’t working out between you and your shorts.
It quickly becomes apparent that your thinly-soled Dunlop canvases have no grip, and your feet threaten to quit their job and let gravity fill the vacancy. You start walking slowly and carefully, but realize this probably makes you look cold. Cold? You can’t be seen to be some weak human with feelings and senses. You’re a hardened shorts veteran. So you speed up, even though this triples your chances of slipping up and breaking an arm. You’re aware this is stupid, because the European Health Card in your wallet expired in 2014. But the Nando’s loyalty card in front of it is still valid, so there’s a silver lining.
You’ve got your go-to response to “aren’t you cold wearing shorts in this weather?” locked and loaded on your lips: “nah, it’s a warm summer’s day every day in my life.” You’ve been saying it ever since it made a guy smile while you waited for a train in Amsterdam one time. Nobody asks, though. They laugh from afar instead, sometimes at you, sometimes with you. One guy mutters something that sounds like “idiot” under his breath, but he was probably saying something in Swedish, like the Swedish word for “idiot.” Another guy says he’s from Bulgaria and follows you down the street asking for money. He doesn’t even acknowledge your shorts.
Drottninggatan, Riksgatan, and Västerlånggatan slip into one another, and you unsteadily slalom between tourists stopped in their tracks by Gamla Stan’s glowing maze of souvenir shops. “Consumer whores,” you mutter under your breath, making a mental note of a Dala horse you simply must come back and buy later. Soon, you shuffle into Slussen, Södermalm several slippery steps away. Your eyes flicker between the Katarina Elevator and the architectural lasagne behind you in Gamla Stan. There’re still two hours before you’re due to meet your Latvian friend, so you clumsily clamber uphill like a kid going the wrong way up a slide.
The Coca Cola (‘Drink’ is spelled ‘Drick’, you realize), Heineken, and Stomatol signs, the endless layers of orange and yellow, skyrocketing spires of verdigris patinas, the caverns of construction cryogenically comatose, and the railway bridge threading through. It’s all capped in a thin film of frost and snow, and the part of your brain which cries at Love Actually every Christmas sheds a little tear at the sight of the once-fiery fall-colored façades doused to a blend of beiges by the icy whites and chilling blues of this overnight refrigerator of a city.
You’re what people who ask “is your email address all one word?” call a ‘millennial’, so you abide by your natural instinct of instantly Instagramming the view, forcing yourself to tap out a caption despite the fact that your frozen fingers are refusing to move with the same stubbornness as you insisting on avoiding long pants.
After quickly dismissing the idea that the Stomatol sign might make a rad tattoo, you turn to walk off the Katarina Elevator bridge, venture into Södermalm, and hunt down the coffeeshop your friend has picked out. Your final lone thought is that ‘Stomatol’ and ‘Södermalm’ might very well sound similar, but you daren’t tell anyone in case that sneaky umlaut screws everything up.
Over matcha lattes and sweet teas, you and your friend open up new worlds to one another. You drown her in social media advice that’ll help with the launch of a humanitarian podcast she’s working on, and she unlocks an interest in fine dining you didn’t know you had parked in your brain’s overflow garage. Her interest in artistic cuisine is partially sparked by her boyfriend working as a chef at Buckingham Palace. Your interest in social media is partially sparked by that one time a picture of you sitting on the kitchen floor clutching a toaster to your chest went moderately viral.
You fly home, slip on some jeans, nod with satisfaction at the 83 Likes you got on the snow-capped cityscape photo, sit down to watch Chef’s Table, and wonder why you didn’t ask your Latvian friend whether her boyfriend ever petted the Queen’s corgis.

Originally published by The Local Sweden on Jan. 15, 2016
Amayd, a Nigerian mechanic, Thomas, a Swedish former bus driver, and Zina, a Roma magazine vendor, have one thing in common: struggling to find a place to sleep in Stockholm.
“It’s hellfire,” Amayd described life on the streets. A short man with a slow gait, grey-speckled beard, and blood-laced eyes, Amayd is a 42-year-old father from Nigeria. After 13 years as a permanent resident in Spain, he arrived to Stockholm two weeks ago.
Every night, he’s entered the lottery for a bed at a Salvation Army-run centre with success. But on Sunday, his name wasn’t drawn — and Amayd had nowhere to sleep. He stayed in the Central Station until it closed, then spent the night walking through snow-blown streets.
“I only have one coat,” Amayd said. “I was afraid to die of the cold.”
Amayd’s story is extreme. While he’s one of at least 2000 people defined as homeless in Stockholm, the city categorizes homelessness on a spectrum that extends to those living in government-assisted apartments. It also boasts a unique “roof-over-your-head” guarantee ensuring that no resident has to sleep outside.
As a European Union migrant, though, Amayd doesn’t fall under this guarantee. Stockholm’s homeless population is starkly divided between Swedish citizens and permanent residents versus EU migrants. Although the two groups share similar needs, registered citizens and residents receive social services, but unregistered migrants aren’t entitled to government benefits.
“If you’re not registered and you don’t have any money, we’ll give you economic help and shelter,” said Lena Svärd, director of the city’s emergency homeless reception. “You can stay here for three months, but if you don’t find a job or nothing happens after that, we can’t help you and you can’t stay.”
While Stockholm’s social services fund non-profit organisations to help temporary migrants, they focus on tackling Swedish homelessness.
‘Roof Over Your Head’ Just A Start
In 2015, Stockholm’s unit for the homeless helped 1475 clients — 84% of whom were males, most between the ages of 45–65. The city runs six shelters with space for 207 clients, but a bed is just the first step.
“Only around 10% of our clients live in shelters,” explained Jenny Swärd, director of the unit for the homeless. “But it’s not a long-term solution. Shelters can hinder your ability to overcome homelessness. Some people get adjusted to staying there, and when we offer them an apartment with support, they wonder why they have to go and pay rent.”
Social workers like Swärd attribute homelessness among Swedes to three main causes: lack of housing, substance abuse, and mental health. To address the first cause, Swärd and her team try to get clients into a permanent place — a tough job in Stockholm’s competitive housing market.
“It’s difficult to get an apartment, and if you have problems, it’s difficult to stay if you don’t get support,” she said. “If clients get good support, around 90% can stay in their apartments. If they live there for one year and everything works out fine, they get the contract for themselves.”
46% of the clients who left Swärd’s unit last year now live in their own place. But Bodil Nilsson, director of the Salvation Army’s drop-in centre for homeless Swedes, doubted whether this would solve the core issues.
“Our guests are living on the edge of society,” said Nilsson. “Many of them have a place to stay, and some have their own contract, but that doesn’t mean they’re happy. Getting their own apartment is not the solution, and they can lose it because of old habits.”
Core Issues Mental Illness and Addiction
‘Old habits’ are drug and alcohol addictions that estrange clients from their families, cause health problems, and hinder individuals from keeping jobs.
Karin Perak, a social worker with the city’s outreach team that meets the homeless on the streets, claimed substance abuse and mental illness are the main causes of homelessness among a majority of Swedes.
The latter is true for Thomas Ljungberg. A self-depreciating but good-humored 50-year-old with sparse ginger hair, Thomas commandeered a table with two friends at the Salvation Army Monday morning. He’s been unemployed and homeless because of mental illness since 1997.
“I experienced traumatic things in the past that I couldn’t process, and it broke my mental health,” he explained. “I worked as a bus driver for 7 years, it was the best job I ever had, but my brain was overloaded. When I get tired, I can’t control myself, and I didn’t want to have a busload of people behind me, so I chose to stop because I was broken down mentally.”
For 13 years, Thomas slept in temporary shelters until getting his own apartment, supported by the government, five years ago. He now regularly sees a psychiatrist.
“I don’t think of it as helpful, but I guess it is,” he said. “4 years ago, I was like a walking zombie; I could have never sat here and had a conversation.”
Whatever the cause of homelessness, many homeless individuals simply need help navigating their way through the complicated social system.
Nilsson explained: “They come to us because they lack the ability to take responsibility, or they’re away from the system and they don’t have the strength or energy or knowledge to get back. Often they want help, but they’ve been in the situation for so long, they say there’s no point. It takes a lot of courage to turn your life around.”
“But it’s possible,” Swärd said. “The city is expanding every day, but we have fewer homeless people.”
While homelessness among Swedes has steadily decreased in recent years, though, the number of homeless EU migrants skyrocketed.
Migrants Survive on the Fringe
“In the past four to five years, it’s gotten worse,” said Björn Taikon, a community worker with 25 years experience in the municipality. “More people are coming because all of Europe is closed.”
Social services estimate there are now between 600 to 1000 EU-migrants without regular income or proper housing in Stockholm. 40% are Romani people, or gypsies.
“It’s very difficult to work with this population, because the long-term solution is in their home country,” said Åsa Lindhagen, Stockholm’s vice-mayor for social affairs who represents the Green Party in the national parliament. “It’s a shame and tragedy that we haven’t succeeded better in Europe to distribute the wealth to everyone. So we have to do everything we can to make it easier for their stay here, especially during winter.”
“When we found out that people were sleeping on the streets and it was very cold, the city offered shelters,” said Swärd, “so that people won’t die.”
In November 2014, the city began funding non-profit organisations, including the City Mission, Salvation Army, and Philadelphia Church, to provide shelter during winter nights.
Taikon and his colleague Moishe Besokadap, also a Romani who grew up in Stockholm, took up the project. Nearly every day since then, the pair gather at designated times in central locations throughout the city.
Within minutes of the two men entering T-Centralen on Saturday morning, bearded men in parkas and dark-braided women in swishing skirts flocked to them, warmly greeting the two in the Romani language. Besokadap took each person’s ID card and wrote down his or her name and personal number. It’s his job to assign the person to a bed in one of the four night shelters on a first come, first served, basis.
“There are always too many people, but we try and find them other shelters,” Besokadap said. The only exception is if the temperature is below -7, when churches open their doors for people to stay without registering.
On Tuesday night, the temperature hovered around the limit. Thick snowflakes swirled in street lamps as a group of Roma trudged past deserted warehouses to the city’s largest EU migrant shelter.
At 9 pm, the doors opened. A volunteer checked each guest’s number, then took their 10 kroner ($1.75) entrance fee. Once registered, guests can stay five nights — then they must re-register, find a new place, or enter the lottery for one of the free beds.
Upstairs, volunteers dished out mounds of food and served steaming cups of coffee or tea. After eating, the guests settled into their bunk beds, took showers, started a game of chess, or showed off pictures of their children.
One married couple Gratian, 24 and Zina, 26, left their two children in Romania with Gratian’s mother to come to Sweden four months ago.
“It’s much better,” Zina said with a vivacious smile. “We get work here and our family gets food on the table.”
Gratian has found sporadic moving jobs while Zina cleans, sells magazines, or recycles cans. Without language skills and permanent residency, though, they’ve struggled to find permanent work, and they asked Besokadap for help to find better jobs.
“They trust us because we’re family,” he said. “They don’t trust the government, they think they want to do something to them or take something from them, but they trust us because no gypsy would want to hurt another gypsy.”
Downstairs, registration was complete, but two men still waited outside the front door, hoping there were empty beds left. There were not.
A volunteer told them to try another one of the shelters, explaining the location and pointing them in the right direction. The two men turned back into the snowy dark, hoping they’d get lucky that night.

I am not sure if you ever heard the term that I used to name the next chapter of WASTELESS WORLD STORY
If not I do recommend asking WIKIPEDIA
en.wikipedia.org
“Stockholm syndrome is a proposed condition or theory that tries to explain why hostages sometimes develop a psychological bond with their captors!”
To say it simply, or in other words, THE PREY LOVES THE HUNTER
Some confusion may resonate now in your head, looking at the city name in the article name and the city in the header image, which seems to be different and you are right, it is ABU DHABI, the location of COP28 which has been dedicated the extra articles published during the first week of the duration of the global CONFERENCE OF PARTIES that for 28 years already call the UNITED NATIONS
This image, from the same event led under the presidency of the CEO of the largest OIL PRODUCERS in the country and one of the world's leading PETROL COMPANIES, may increase your confusion.
This is good
Because CONFUSION seems to be missing in the heads of 97,000 participants invited to join COP28 with travel, accommodation, food, and drinks covered by the organizer and sponsors
Most of the invited participants (not speaking about politicians, lobbyists, and “world leaders”) come to change the world by contributing with their word to climate change. They know action is needed to realize where they come from.
After coming back the ENEMY is no more the ENEMY but a FRIEND or SOMEONE WHO CARES.
Does it sound familiar to you?
Ask your memory
If it does not help, check the start of this article
THE HUNTERS BECOME THE PREY
falling “in love” with those who let other people money to pay for the tickets, hotel rooms, entertainment, food, and drinks and I am sure everyone will not carry just a COP28 badge home, but great memories of great, nice, rich and influential people that behave like friends, listening for an hour to the claims to say at the end
YOU ARE RIGHT, WE WILL PUT MONEY IN FUND FOR YOU
Above is a screenshot from December 7, 2023, below LIVE COUNTER
It will be hard to return, from the luxury of lean cities, airconditioned rooms, halls filled with entertainment, and tables all the time filled with exotic dishes, from the place where a shower can be taken as long as you wish and you can fill hot water in the bathtub several times day, because this is the life they dreamed about and it exists already.
I would like to propose an extension of the WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE because I do not think the STOCKHOLD SYNDROM applies only to individuals or HUMANS. For a long time companies and organizations ENJOY their own
and no hostages, weapons, or danger need to be applied, MONEY is what makes one addicted
At the moment of integrating the table into my article COP28 and the UN promoted simultaneously on Twitter following poster
with this description
I do understand why the authors did not reply to my cooperation proposal sent when the first information leaked some time ago
Others, who get paid significantly more to come to COP 28 than just a return ticket, accommodation, food, and drink are proud that for them the planet is just a PLAYGROUND on which money can be made with ease
The “new” STOCKHOLM syndrome will act as the next ADHD, it will become the new NORMAL
Have a nice time free of waste and wasting in all its forms, stay safe and free, and BE HUMAN

Stockholm, basically a town that is built across little islands at the spot where the fresh waters connect with the salty waters, is, in a way, soaked to the bone with olden tales. That starts from those brave Viking settlers going on, through to big posh palaces plus tales about brave actions at critical times; the Swedish main town gives you that grabbing feel for times of old. Instead of plainly peeking around at sites — why not set out on an immersive day of delight taking one the various history-based days out that Stockholm has available. With many things to select, where should one begin, you could be asking? But don’t stress about this at all! I kinda made this brief rundown of great historical picks found inside Stockholm that, in a way, promises super good times will be had! Let’s ready that travel kit, step on way-back ride machines, let’s get the facts popping coming directly outta those really superb aged settings this grand locale stores carefully! Find the untold experiences of Stockholm simply visit Stockholm’s historical insights just for fun.
So a top choice whilst coming to check the cool times long ago stored in Stockholm definitely asks one see the Vasa boat gallery spot, too! That impressive building protects bits associated to Vasa which stayed surprisingly sound for getting the facts regarding that battleship sinking really fast since making her initial trip going back during 1628. What is rad pertaining that boat could possibly not even revolve ‘round great scales, let’s imagine skilled carvers instead that outstanding piece concerning conserving works after its rescue efforts occurred! Try sensing yourself taking time backwards plus sensing, too, specifically what took ground by taking warships reaching day break for awful occasions took possession. Seeing vast details becomes heart tugging. Certain group programs highlight key bits like politic schemes King Gustavus pushed forward since they also check ship design actions occurring as factors created wreckages plus sunken depths arose also. Give yourself space with watching special booths and rooms particularly renovated cottages or fun playing installations. By really saving change be wise looking at packages visiting all areas offered alongside some guided Vasa Museum tour.
“In every way gaspingly gorgeous! Okay I might have seen news around this one, I just never pictured real views arriving live this! Those specialists presenting, I believe spoke super intelligently and seriously produced vessel memories alive now that felt actually pretty awesome that date! High fives going their means for good experiences!” — Sarah M., History Lover
I tell you those advisors guiding through it basically pour over solid background with interesting tiny tidbits going directly adding charm once drawing images considering existences sailing by sea while onboard ships constructed throughout these days old. I kinda have this sneaky feeling you begin falling breathless as quality happens then also think humbled in knowing tragic ending of some naval thing meeting oceans however having sailed a mile basically; try sinking deeper alongside oceans heritage that instant. Next watch details like they concern themselves uponVasa shipbuilding legacy, hopefully increasing brains inside.
Just that little by slowly disappearing alongside the cuteness found scattered around this town named Gamla Stan basically an area Stockholm says the earliest chapters of lives occur across all these streets is possibly interesting when thinking of the things discovered in all those cool walks during a time of sunshine filled play that takes days really! Paths of rock go spinning close all sides amongst structure of long-lasting nature and paints looking lively inside shades combining that old style mustard yellow alongside reddish exteriors everywhere! That point probably makes something feel beginning directly now across where tales speak around marketers living long ago beside monarchs plotting also not overlooking turns concerning the events inside days of country of Sweden that is her homeland there, specifically now. Person leading usually starts slowly bringing everyone close while discovering alleys almost secretive inside some part, going with gardens unseen generally alongside some gateways never spotted solo now. I’m very very likely that a feeling passes where all footstep has knowledge on this land when that moment arises strolling beside that grand Royal build plus market center Stortorget then possibly not skipping this grand gallery place linked to a guy called Nobel, definitely! Try thinking of crazy trading happenings going wayyy down here across that district as carriages horse guided echoes resounded, hearing quietly all communications hidden. Dig close on past occurrences using this fantastic one to choose alongside me: ahistoric walking tour.
It is cool cause just above what sights pop at eye glance level this place beats full life basically; something seems alive inside that district while moments tick right across history’s grand clock that feels nice and something that might be needed across someone thinking where adventure waits generally; watch some very very cool settings when considering that journey. Know a wide array via a Gamla Stan sites then get shown across paths found created as a pattern thanks a guru showing those points! Basically give yourselves freedoms traveling far time where every uncovered bit plus gripping accounts show themselves out the earliest areas forming spots in capital of Sweden..
In order for a shift for what Stockholm stores by days from long previous: consider watching Sodermalm something pretty awesome discovered toward land reaching off through southern spots past that territory called Gamla. The setting has gradually transformed spanning times right from district reaching at laborers where right now hip elements shoot into show at boutiques created through owners individually or restaurant innovators! This time probably should work seeing together its past history and cool happenings occurring at current that everyone would go through. Next watch the place speak the story beside spots tourists watch plus take that route athidden gems of Stockholm and more.
FeatureBrief Talk Over Here:Times Older!Look out closely how previous times got formed alongside that location known also how events got switched spanning each age for information really?Cooler WaysSeriously taste all feeling known while there really that communities existing art besides some occasions at night having wild nature maybe?Artwork Design!View things that combine little tiny shelters built vintage style versus a few building towers or fun sketches seen through street roads you probably should understand!.Tastes!Really eat meals together those ones known plus various international type you’ve spotted!.
Then walk down avenues at places having good skyline views whilst tales about those big influencers appearing at that area begin sounding now! Maybe just maybe you’ll begin passing some very boho alleys known really also known toward the “SoFo”. Now after hard job hours became stories: one regarding transformation where today the site stores culture those two things make one say one thing “strength”. View way existences have expression inhistoric Sodermalm charm: what richness is being created upon her soil.!
I bet going off that loudness that forms the town and try taking trips going smoothly onboard moving river vessels is a brilliant way how someone visits”Drottningholm,” something awesome that world watches through a protection association!. This impressive place appears really like that district”Versailles” through parts throughout Stockholm that protects the king, as a normal event. View wide space insides but wander down to sweet outside spots whilst something big concerning heritage plays there. A few times those presenting moments bring up happenings belonging at crown persons around that location-parties seen here? Think super persons making places exist, as artwork and something adorning her style! See it there maybe alongside: Swedish royalty and you can do more..
Regardless if people grasp parts regarding royal persons around that spot or others liking forms formed inside spots plus a spot silent arriving by, land with those Palaces offer you moments remembered really! Next take moments guiding yourself where insights start becoming real upon palace grounds Stockholm since moments begin arriving over ground where events play regularly really really..
After reviewing these picks above; comes time we watch place making local residents feel Stockholm is “theirs” (sort off, kinda)? This thing there becomes a place they watch as local authority area still also a piece holding values throughout ground: how prizes that person “Nobel” gets will get honors in days occurring here at a moment year for year. Through showing moment tours occurring here? Through these times begin people watching space appearing huge or art-full or something appearing metallic too- scenes created through all through area as the mother territory stands, known as Sweden! Be open learning things in area- but look how area stands out as strong from plans throughout the long era since then too!!! For spots known building big from history try booking: Stockholm historic buildings ahead and maybe go now.
Making those memories here feels maybe nice through one thing: see those booking occurring containing spot climbing to great levels, too probably. Look up all round location where beautiful events might just knock feet from floor when something plays up there as one watches!
Now those people who begin that part (those tourists) in soil that keeps culture- then the colors looking so attractive becomes super in area they enter really then that moment really forms really awesome sensation. So after times getting big meanings next feelings form right on then next someone getting tours together feels maybe okay through seeingswedish national heritage really!?.

Celebrating the Unsung Heroes Behind Every Great Achievement
I visited Stockholm recently and couldn’t help noticing how much history fills the city.
I wandered through the Vasa Museum, then ended up at Stockholm’s City Hall, that red-brick landmark standing quietly over the water.
Inside, a guide led us through the halls where Nobel laureates have dined.
I stopped at the grand staircase, amazed by every curve and step. Ragnar Östberg, the architect behind it all, was known for obsessing over every detail, not for himself, but for the queen and her royal guests.
Östberg’s attention to detail was legendary.
He made his wife walk up and down different versions of the staircase until every step felt right. He wanted the queen, and every guest after her, to glide down without a stumble. But even as he worked for royalty, he never forgot the people who helped bring his vision to life.
His team — the builders, craftsmen, and artists — were honoured in a way that surprised me.
Instead of the mayor’s own bust above the office, you’ll find the faces of these collaborators, a daily reminder that nobody succeeds alone.

Björn Ståhl, Founding Partner, Uncommon Stockholm said: “We will focus on brands that people in the real world are glad exist. These brands are uncommon and they can make a difference like never before. I’ve admired what Nils, Lucy and Natalie have been building at Uncommon for some time and we can’t wait to continue their impact and partner together in Stockholm.”
Natalie Graeme, Co-founder at Uncommon Creative Studio added: “Björn, Mia and Max have the perfect balance — they each bring a unique quality and their collective experience is impressive. They see the world the same way we do and match our ambition at Uncommon. We’re thrilled to welcome them into the fold and couldn’t think of better partners to venture into Stockholm with.”
Six years in, the studio continues to make awarded and stand-out work winning its first Grand Prix at this year’s Cannes Lions for its groundbreaking campaign with British Airways.
Notably work also includes creating the most recognised mental health initiative in the UK with ITV, to creating a globally infamous free suit hire initiative for H&M — The One Second Suit, to help young men find work, to redefining what the Nike Jordan brand means today launching during the 23’ NBA All-Star Weekend through the eyes of an aspiring female baller.
The studio has always believed in creativity — applying its founding principles of building brands that matter — acts rather than advertising. The studio has built successfully portfolios across experience, CX, design and production — with Uncommon producing its first feature documentary with renowned director Andrew Dominik for Nick Cave and Warren Ellis’ ‘This Much I Know To Be True’ premiering at Berlinale and SXSW and achieved critical acclaim including The Guardian’s Film of the Week as well as being listed in NME’s top films of the year. Its second feature ‘In Camera’ is in the running for Best First Feature at the upcoming annual BFI London Film Festival.
Though the Studio was set up with a clear point of view and purpose, it also wanted to explore a new business model. Rather than just working for clients, if the studio saw a concept that deserved to exist, it would back it. So far the studio has launched the world’s first fully compostable coffee capsule Halo Coffee, a sexual wellness brand SEX BRAND launching with the UK’s most sustainable condom and most recently Communion — a new money saving app on a mission to unlock the freedom associated with the act of saving.
Uncommon also invested in the purpose-driven accelerator Unrest — to support diverse and sustainable businesses. Since its launch two years ago, it has helped 47 startups, raising £7.2M with a total valuation of £110M.

Accounts & Recounts of my thoughts during my stay here in Stockholm, Sweden.

( This piece started in February, finished in June.)
Day 34. It has been more than a month since the experiential heat in the Lion City.
I don’t quite miss home yet, but it’s long enough for me to see stark differences between both cities and culture.
Facial features. Architecture. Museums. Weather. Snow. Winter.
2. Transportation
Metro. Subway. T-bana. Pendeltåg. Train. Escalator. Reliable. Not reliable. like SMRT? And not everyone has a car.
3. Working culture
Fika means put down your stuff and gather for Coffee Break. Phone-usage is a no-no, Socialising is encouraged.Lunch is Lunch. Work is Work. Party is Party. Work-Life Balance. And we take out our shoes when we are in office.
4. Social norms
More reserved. Strangers rarely say Hi. Yet seemed nice after the ‘ice has been broken’. Cashiers are the friendliest.
5. Standard of Living
Singapore is expensive. Deal with it. Stockholm is expensive too (including student hostels). In fact one of the most expensive in Scandinavia/Europe. High taxation. High expenditure on food, drinks, party. Then again, their wages are high as well.
I have met a couple of Singaporeans who got married and settled/is settling in here at Stockholm. Their stories are pretty amazing.
The city is beautiful, Swedes/locals lead less stressful lives, welfare and happiness are never taken for granted.
Perhaps Singapore can learn more from them.If I do have some form of political/social power, I will attempt to change some things back home. Change, is the only constant.

I’m a US expat living in Stockholm since 2018. Originally lived in central Stockholm, now living in the burbs. A co-worker once asked me for tips on what to do when they were coming over for a visit. I typed up something, and later another and another person asked, each time I pulled up the old doc, and maybe made some additions. On the most recent instance of this, I realized I could probably just publish this for anyone to find.
If I had to narrow it down to 3 easy things, I’d do Moderna Museet (free), Fotografiska (~$20), and a walk through Gamla Stan.
Quick list of things to do:
Museums:
Sightseeing:
Restaurants:Swedish food
Really good sushi
Mexican
Steak
Choose Uber over cabs when in the city (seriously might be faster to take a scooter though 🙃). If you must use a cab only use these companies: Taxi Stockholm 150000, Taxi Kurir, Sverigetaxi. Most of the others will rip you off (my wife got charged $50 for a 8min ride). For getting from the airport, the Arlanda Express is a direct train to central stockholm, that only takes 18 minutes; you can buy the tickets online or at the airport, and you get a big discount for buying them as a group. A cab to/from would be ~30-40min depending on traffic.

Stockholm, Sweden….A few weeks ago I hopped aboard a plane and headed to Sweden for the weekend. The truth is that Sweden has never been high on my wish list radar, as a destination, so I just have been skipping it year after year. However, living in Poland, Sweden has a huge advantage as a holiday destination. It is located so close to my homeland that it is easy to visit. I only need to cross the Baltic Sea and I’m there. The plane tickets to Sweden are usually bloody cheap … if only the weather there could be better.
Weather is always a strange thing. Every time I visit the Polish coast and look North, it seems that Sweden has better weather, as there are usually no clouds on the horizon. But the reality is far different. The weather in Sweden is cold and windy most of the year, except in summer. I didn’t want the Scandinavian weather to deceive me as I booked my ticket. I hoped that the sun would have mercy on me and would appear in Sweden during my stay. Sure enough, the weather had its way! I left sunny Poland and landed in quite a cloudy Sweden. During my stay, the sun tried to defeat the clouds but failed. My consolation was that it did not rain.
My motto is “like the places to which you travel and appreciate that you can visit them, no matter what”. Seems to me, as a traveller, that we should want to go everywhere and find something interesting anywhere. Consequently, I always try to see the best in each country I visit. Before going to Scandinavia my number one wish, while there was to experience the fjords! But that’s in Norway. Thinking which Scandinavian city would be my number one choice, I had a feeling it would be Stockholm. Now, after returning home, I can confirm 100%, that to me, Stockholm is absolutely the number one city in Scandinavia.
Nordic cities in my opinion are hit or miss. You love or hate them. They don’t have many landmarks, are very expensive and at first glance, they look just boring. Nordic cities such as Oslo, Helsinki, Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Reykjavík share one thing in common. They are coastal cities. I usually love cities bordering on a body of water, as a relationship with water adds a whole new dimension to city life … and Stockholm has lots of water!
People say that Stockholm is the Venice of the North. The city is spread out over 14 islands, that are connected by 57 bridges, with an eye towards my beloved Baltic Sea to the East. There’s something incredibly soothing about almost always having water in sight and that makes Stockholm a nice destination to explore on foot. It is pleasant to stroll when you are never more than a stone’s throw away from the water. There’s so much water everywhere that sometimes it seems like there’s more water than land. Hence, it may seem that there are more boats than cars, in the city. They are moored to the shore and sway on the gentle waves.
But such a picturesque location has also cons. A few times I found it slightly annoying to not be able to get somewhere, located just a few meters away from me, just because there was no bridge exactly where I needed it, and I had to walk around a channel, that made the way much longer.
All in all, I think that water is what makes Stockholm charming. It makes the air feel fresher and clearer. Waterworks for Stockholm especially when the day gives way to the evening. Sunset in Stockholm is a magical time. It is so nice to be near the water when the sun is setting and see Stockholm in its magic hour.
The second thing that struck me the most about the city was the colour. Everywhere, from the gems of the Old Town to more modern architecture, colour seems to be present on every surface. I think that the colours are Stockholm’s heaviest weapon against gloomy and cloudy weather. There is no logic or scheme to the colours of buildings, as they would have never been treated as a wholeness, but as individuals.
It’s more expensive than Paris and London, but it’s not as expensive as people expect. I spent most of my money on food. I’m glad that I had a hotel breakfast at the price of my room because going out for a meal more often than once a day would have ruined my budget.
The silence in Stockholm really hits you when you arrive. The cars seem to move in a silent mode and there is almost a hushed feeling everywhere.
Sweden’s capital city is a 700-year-old European city. It attracts many visitors each year looking to experience Sweden’s largest city, however, there were fewer tourists than I expected. Thanks to that Stockholm has a very relaxed feel. There are not many people on the streets and sometimes it seemed to me, that I had Stockholm, just to myself.
The city has an atmosphere that is very calm compared to other European capitals. Perhaps it is the people living here. Most Swedes seem patient and quiet. Maybe it’s because there are so many open spaces and of course water. Maybe it is because of the history felt in the air. Or maybe because the buildings are so colourful and in some way, they force you to stop and stare at them. Maybe it’s all of this put together…..

I just got back from my two-week trip across most of Northern Europe. This is my third trip back to Europe. (My first was a summer abroad in Italy nearly 8 years ago and my second was another two-week trip in 2014 where we explored Dublin, London, Amsterdam, and Paris.) I daresay this was the best so far! Thom and I visited Stockholm, Copenhagen, Berlin, and again, Amsterdam this time around. In order to share our experience and to create a living record of its details, I’ve decided to write across a few posts on each city and its adventures. This first post serves to detail our overall travel plans, information on flights/places to stay, tips on light packing, and general advice for good travel. I should mention that I’m not an expert on any other these things but it’s worth sharing the little knowledge that I gained before, during, and after this trip.
To begin with, here are a few starting facts about our trip:
Let’s begin by discussing budget flights. Nine months before this vacation even happened I found some non-stop flights from Oakland to Stockholm for $600 a person. These flights kicked off the entire trip and made everything possible. I recall the very first time I ever flew to Europe. (Which was 8 years this summer!) It was to Genoa, Italy from Buffalo, NY. That flight had three stops (Buffalo to NYC, NYC to Frankfurt, and Frankfurt to Milan) and one train (Milan to Genoa) in order to get to my destination with a total of over 20+ hours at a hefty price of $1500. (Thanks Aer Lingus! 🖕) So to come across a flight that was only 10 hours and non-stop to my choice destination, it felt like fate...
Doesn’t that last sentence feel so inspiring? Statements and facts like those are the gold and shiny wrapper on the cheap bar of travel chocolate. Here’s the nitty-gritty of budget flying:
With some of the add-ons and extra taxes, our $600 tickets actually came to $711.30 a person. Our in-between flights from city to city were around $50 a person. (As compared to a train from Berlin to Amsterdam which was $120 a ticket.) In the end, you have to deal with the minor annoyances for that 💰deal.
Let’s move on to transportation.
Thom and I took public transit for the most part. (I’ll discuss the bicycling and Uber rides a bit later in some of my city posts.) For us, it’s a fun challenge learning a new city’s public transit. And unlike American public transportation, European public transportation is fast, convenient, and very, VERY reliable. Upon arriving at the Arlanda Airport, which is located just outside of Stockholm, we took the Arlanda Express Train that runs directly to the city center in just 20 minutes. (As compared to my 1.5 hour MUNI and BART trip to Oakland International Airport. 😑) Out of the four cities we visited, Berlin boasted the fastest and most reliable transportation (dat German innovation) with Amsterdam coming in at a close second. (Trams, trams everywhere!) All the trams, trains, and buses that we took were clean and clearly marked. My only complaint was the summer heat which was especially felt in the enclosed and non-air conditioned trains.
I plan to discuss each Airbnb in detail for each city post but in general our decision to use this service came from a few points:
Finally, let’s talk about packing. Much like my last Europe trip, I took a single backpack and personal bag with me. That was it! Now that this trip is over, I can say, quite proudly, that it was the best decision that I made for packing. After each city we visited, Thom and I both got a little better at packing our bags. It was a very efficient way to travel, IMO.
Here are some pros:
I admit that there are some cons involved with this kind of packing. While I can pack a mean bag, it doesn’t exclude the fact that the weight gets to you…no matter how light. If you’ve ever landed at an airport and took public transit into a city, the transfers mean a lot of walking between terminals and stations. The weight of the bag can cause a lot of stress on your neck and shoulders. Even this year, I packed a bag that weighed about 8 lbs total and after a while, say 20 minutes of walking, it can really push down on you. I should mention that my bag isn’t meant for hiking or true backpacking and therefore isn’t super ergonomic. I’m sure if I had chosen a small hiking backpack, my experience would be different. The bag that I took is just an everyday backpack for commuting which is why long walks with a lot of weight can easily become a small burden.
Backpacking can also force you to make some crucial decisions as to what you pack. One small error (should I bring a bathing suit?) and you’ll be forced to carry that item throughout the entire trip with much resentment. The last time we were in Europe, it rained for most of the trip. Thom brought an umbrella this year. He never needed it! 😂 🙃 Lessons learned.
A few surprising things that we did bring this year are:
I’ve only really traveled internationally in the summer months so packing has always been dictated by the warmer weather. I took mainly dresses with a single pair of jeans and shorts. A few shirts to mix it up and a hoodie with a jean jacket for cooler evenings/days. I took a pair of black flats since they’re so versatile and my Keds for comfort as I walked/biked everywhere. I kept toiletries to small sizes and bought anything else that might have run out.
Thom and I failed to exchange any currency prior to the trip. But I would recommend making that order with your bank if possible since ATMs abroad will charge you a fee for any withdrawals. Also, make the obligatory call to your bank letting them know that you are traveling abroad so that they don’t lock your card and account.
A kind co-worker provided us an extra SIM card and we had another already from past trips, so this year we both had data/service for our phones. Thankfully our SIM cards were both purchased in the Netherlands with Vodaphone. These cards worked in all the other countries we visited and we didn’t need to purchase new cards along the way.
Finally, I’ll add that we obtained Global Entry prior to the trip. It made entering the US very easy and fast when going through customs. If you are a frequent international flyer, consider getting Global Entry. Global Entry includes TSA PreCheck. So if you fly around the country frequently (which I do), it’s very convenient and handy for jumping those long security lines.

3C for describing Stockholm: cold, cool, culture. Its historical background, architecture, fashion, style, traditional foods, and of course ABBA, all make it so cool! It can be also called ‘North Venice’ because of the 14 islands.
We went to Stockholm by Flixbus departed from Copenhagen. It was night and long ride, besides I spent the night awake because of my flu and I really terrified about the journey. The road was empty without lightning… Also, our bus was moving fast. Uh, terrifying…
We started the city tour with Riddarholmen Church which has a thousand years of history.
We sat on the benches around the church, watching Stockholm architecture.
We watched the iconic Södermalm view. Like a postcard…
Gamla Stan: best for the time traveling…
Narrow streets, yellow colors, cinnamon smells… It makes me feel like I am in a different zone.
Me and my friend exploring the city by walking, climbing hills and from the beginning of the city tour, we constantly arguing about which city is better… Copenhagen or Stockholm? We are counting the pros and cons. However, it is an inconclusive debate. After wandering around the Gamla Stan’s old streets, another debate… Does it look like Florence? Then, we are sitting on a bench watching the Baltic Sea, talking about how can we do more efficient things, and be successful in our aims. I guess, this is Stockholm energy. Not syndrome… but this city has effects on people.
I ticked eating Swedish Meatballs in Sweden and going to Ikea in Sweden off on the bucket list. It was the first time I’ve eaten meatballs with sweet lingonberry jam (it was great). I also had Kladdkaka, Kanelbulle and irrelevantly, fortune cookies. All of them were delicious…
We passed through the Øresund Bridge which is so impressive, like diving into the middle of the sea. We are surrounded by only blue: sea and sky. Furthermore thanks to our Flixbus Driver, he was playing the Swedish Eurovision song: Loreen — Tatto. It was pretty unforgettable for me since I listened to this song hundreds of times and never thought I would be listening to this in the main country. (I know the photo is not very good, but I recorded videos and enjoyed the moment.)
Overall
Stockholm is so suitable for a student budget. I was expecting extreme prices, but I was wrong. Especially the souvenirs’ and Ikea’s food prices were acceptable. I want to visit Stockholm again with a rich budget and at that time I must stay at least 3 nights, attend to Stockholm Ghost Walk and Historical Tour, go to the Skansen Open Air Museum and ABBA Museum, appreciate subway art, go to Birka the Viking city, having Fika in a warm, cozy place with enjoying the Northern snow.
Regards, Ozlem.

To be honest, I wasn’t too pleased when I saw the temperature in Stockholm was going to be -5 degrees celsius. But I’m not one to turn down an opportunity to experience different cultures and meet new people. The view from the plane window pretty much confirmed that I was in for a cold couple of days. Sweden from the sky was pretty much blanketed in snow, with forests, motorways and buildings adding speckles of colour to the pure white landscape. Stockholm’s temperature was as expected — FREEZING — but admiring the beautiful architecture as we walked to the office made me temporarily forget this fact.
One of the great things about using Slack at Manifest is how it renders borders immaterial. It’s not perfect and working in different time zones does present its challenges, but being able to meet up with a colleague in a different country and pick-up where you left off on Slack is a great plus.
We like to believe everything is better in Sweden, and while that’s mostly true (I say mostly because the weather ain’t better) I have to say, the coffee machine at our Stockholm office is straight out of Star Trek. To hell with cafetieres and capsules, this baby uses an iPad touchscreen to brew you some of the best tasting Americanos I’ve ever had. We need to figure out a way to set one up in London too. It might even make me do a tea round….once or twice.
Our short time in Stockholm was spent darting from meeting to meeting. We had a couple of new business meetings interspersed with meeting existing clients. I’ve got to say, the half day we spent with Houdini was probably the most inspired I’ve been in my five years at Manifest. It’s not often you sit in a room where everyone is extremely passionate about what they do and where they want their company to go. I’m proud to be working with such a visionary brand, and you can bet you’ll hear a lot more from them in the coming months.
I cannot write a blog about Sweden without mentioning delicious Swedish meatballs and aquavit. Aquavit (literal meaning: water of life) is an important part of Scandinavian drinking culture. We were treated to a Swedish folk song by Anna and Josefine before downing a shot of the drink. Much to the surprise of the Swedes, Alex and myself did not seem at all perturbed by the 37% ABV beverage. We both have strong constitutions, and attempting to drink us under the table is never wise.
After meetings were done, I had the opportunity to explore more of Stockholm over the weekend- it’s truly a stunning city, one I hope to be visiting often… during warmer months.
Manifest has offices in Stockholm, London and New York and we’re recruiting. So, if you fancy joining our international family check out our careers page.

I belong in a gang of 4. Four colleagues, friends and something more than that. Anna, the 1/4 of our gang, spent (and she still has a month there) this semester in Stockholm, Sweden, as an Erasmus student.So the rest of us decided to visit her, have some fun all together in Stockholm and discover this Scandinavian city.
I have tons of stories to tell you about that trip, so I’m gonna keep it simple and write about the most important stuff in bulletpoints and also post along some photos we shot so that I give you a better understanding of what was going on.
A typical limo you see in Stockholm
With Faviana, in Greetify HQ
Finally, I have to say that it was an awesome trip overall! Of course this was special for my and my mates, because we were all together, but I bet you’re gonna love this city no matter what!

After many years of choosing busy beach destinations for our summer holidays, this year we decided to embrace the ‘coolcation’ trend and look for an alternative holiday focusing on cooler climates, scenic landscapes, and opportunities for relaxation and mental wellness. If you are also seeking this kind of holiday, then Stockholm should top your bucket list.
Stockholm, the capital of Sweden is a city that beautifully blends innovation, with its rich historical charm. The summer season truly accentuates its allure with extended daylight hours, festivities, nightlife and a bustling ambiance.
We visited Stockholm in June and were fortunate enough to experience some fantastic weather. We chose to stay at the Grand Hôtel, strategically positioned along the waterfront, providing views of both the Royal Palace and Gamla Stan. It served as an excellent base for us to explore all the city’s attractions, the highlights of which are listed below.
What impressed us the most, coming from a Mediterranean country, was the Scandinavian phenomenon of long days. The sun stays up until late into the evening, creating a sense of endless daylight and extending the feeling of a truly prolonged holiday.

Report of the Go Global Mission to Stockholm (25 - 28 October 2017)
As an entrepreneur, it is important to broaden your perspectives and keep an eye out on the world, even more so in this digital world we live and work in every day. Hence, I was very excited to join the Go Global Mission to Stockholm, an organization of startups.be and Jong VOKA Oost-Vlaanderen.
Sweden has been an inspiration for me ever since I became involved with technology and startups. The country has an impressive track record: after Silicon Valley, Sweden has the highest number of unicorns per head of population in the world. Iconic companies like Skype (sold to Microsoft), King (the maker of Candy Crush, IPO), Mojang (the company behind Minecraft, sold to Microsoft) and Spotify (you know Spotify), have all been founded in this Nordic country.
How is this possible? What are the reasons behind Sweden’s overwhelming success? Is this story future proof? 3 days in the country’s lovely capital Stockholm would provide all the answers.
A 2 hour flight from Brussels led us to Bromma, a cozy airport about 20 minutes from downtown Stockholm. Hard to imagine this is the main entrance to a European capital where so much value has been created over the past decade.
First stop on our trip was the Stockholm Fintech Hub, a huge co-working space located conveniently above Stockholm’s central train station. Besides the fancy decoration, I noticed a couple of interesting things here:
Off to a good start!
Our visit to Invest Stockholm gave us a lot of insights on the success of Stockholm. The seeds of the Swedish tech boom were planted in the 90s, when the government subsidized the required infrastructure for the digital age.
First, every household in Sweden was granted a personal computer. Every successful tech entrepreneur of today grew up with a PC! Digital natives avant la lettre.
Second, almost every household in Sweden has fiber internet access. Hard to imagine in Belgium, where to this day the public and private sector are still arguing who is going to make the required investments.
It is clear that government initiatives in the nineties have laid the foundations for the incredible success of the past decade.
The impact of these exits cannot be underestimated. As often happens with successful entrepreneurs, they do not rest on their laurels. After selling Skype, Niklas Zennström went on to found Atomico, now one of the most famous venture capital firms in Europe. Same goes for the founders of King with their fund Sweet Capital.
As a result, there is plenty of capital available to invest in promising startups that might become the unicorns of the coming decade. Success often creates even more success. The future of the Swedish tech ecosystem seems bright.
Some (fun) facts about Sweden:
Day 2 started with the highlight of our trip: a visit to Spotify. The music streaming service has over 50 million paying subscribers and is valued at 16 Bio USD in the private markets. Even though it is still making a loss, it is reportedly preparing its long-awaited IPO for somewhere mid 2018.
Spotify is one of those iconic tech companies of this age. The company, led by the enigmatic founder Daniel Ek, has proven to be an exceptional innovator on multiple levels:
1) Business model innovation: in the wake of illegal P2P networks like Napster and Kazaa, Spotify sought to find a legitimate way to revolutionize the music industry.
2) Technical innovation: the secret sauce to Spotify’s early success was the incredibly fast loading of songs. This was an engineering challenge of enormous size and difficulty. The majority of people at Spotify are still deep tech engineers working to make sure load times stay at this amazing level, even at such a huge scale.
3) Organizational innovation: much has been written and said about Spotify’s organizational model. The concepts of autonomous teams (grouped in squads, tribes & alliances), the agile way of working, the flat organization, … have been widely documented and copied by other tech startups. Many attribute the success of Spotify to this special culture of continuous experimentation and improvement, cultivated by the founders from day 1.
It will be very interesting to see what happens to this culture when Spotify goes public. Not making a profit yet, investor pressure might force it to tighten reigns and start cutting costs.
Later, we paid a visit to Detectify, whose founder notoriously hacked Google and got access to a huge amount of customer data. He received a bounty of 10.000 USD and went on to start a successful company in ethical hacking.
I arrived at the hotel at around 10 pm. Having some energy left in the tank, I put on my running shoes. I really enjoy jogging in big cities. Since there is always something new to discover, you hardly notice you are running after a while.
I ran to the Gamla Stan island where I accidentally bumped into the changing of the guards routine at the royal palace. Quite hilarious and way over the top if you ask me!
This run wasn’t only for sightseeing, though. Last week, I decided I am going to run my first marathon in 2018! There you go, the word is out, no coming back to it now. I couldn’t really miss the second training on my schedule, right…
Day 3 started at Klarna, another Swedish unicorn, active in online payment processing. A couple of years ago, it also received a banking license. We got a presentation about the major branding exercise this company had undertaken earlier this year. The result was fascinating: from a dull banking brand to an extravagant colorful identity. Klarna wants to be a bank focused on the consumer’s experience, not on its own payments product. It definitely stands out in its sector with this bold and brave move I can only applaud.
Next stop was the Goodbye Kansas Gaming Studio. Stockholm has an enormous amount of talented gaming engineers, resulting in big hits like Minecraft, Candy Crush Saga, Angry Birds 2 and a host of other console and PC titles. We were told the long dark nights might have something to do with this.
Final stop was at EQT Ventures, one of the top tier venture firms in the Nordics. EQT Ventures is owned by Sweden’s wealthiest family, the Wallenbergs. Over the past century (!), the Wallenbergs have accumulated an enormous portfolio of global industrial players, including Electrolux, Atlas Copco, ABB, SEB, SKF, … to name a few. Add Volvo, Scania and IKEA to the Sweden’s list and you get a sense of how many successful international corporations this country produces. Same goes for its music industry: ABBA, Roxette, Ace of Base, Europe … and more recently Avicii, Robyn, Swedish House Mafia. Due to the small internal market, anyone aspiring a big entrepreneurial or artistic career just has to move abroad as soon as possible.
EQT Ventures is the venture capital firm of the Wallenberg conglomerate. Besides funding (with its 565 Mio EUR investment vehicle), it also offers active guidance to its entrepreneurs (growth, engineering, marketing,…).
EQT Ventures invests in scale-ups that have reached product market fit and about 100k MRR. It sweet spot investment size is between 8 and 10 Million EUR.
EQT gave us a demo of their internal data processing tool called Motherbrain. This platform gathers all publicly available data on technology companies (e.g. Crunchbase, Pitchbook data,..) and enriches them by adding trends in social media activity, number of followers, press coverage, … EQT believes this gives them a competitive advantage in discovering promising startups earlier and getting into deals faster.
4 startups had the opportunity to present their company:
The trip ended with a nice dinner in the city center of Sweden’s lovely capital.
My key takeaways from this Go Global Mission to Stockholm:
Looking forward to getting back into the action at Hyperlane on Monday, fully energized and inspired by 3 awesome days.

Stockholm. A city I had heard of since childhood.
I associated its name with major international agreements, particularly the Stockholm Declaration of 1972 — the very first large-scale world conference to make the environment as a major global issue. It marked the beginning of international environmental governance and laid the foundation for what would later become the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This conference shaped the world’s approach to sustainability and climate action, yet I never imagined that one day, I would walk its very streets where such historic discussions took place.
Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would experience this city firsthand. It still feels surreal that I am here.
What struck me the most when I arrived was the contrast — the weather, the atmosphere, the way of life. Coming from Indonesia, where temperatures soar to 35°C with high humidity, adjusting to Stockholm’s crisp air and freezing winters was a challenge. Even in summer, I find myself trembling while Swedes enjoy the sunshine in shorts and tank tops. The shift from tropical heat to below-zero temperatures was an entirely new physical adjustments and rhythm of life.
But despite the cold, I fell in love with this city. There is a sense of calm, an unspoken rhythm that blends modernity with nature. Stockholm moves at its own pace — not too fast, not too slow.
And then, there’s Fika — the Swedish tradition of taking a break over coffee and pastries. At first, I thought it was just a casual coffee break, but I soon realized it’s much more than that. It’s a moment of pause, of connection, of simply being present. In a world that constantly pushes us to be productive, Fika is a reminder that it’s okay to slow down. This ties into something else I admire about Sweden — their emphasis on work-life balance. Here, taking a break is not seen as laziness but as an essential part of life. People respect their time off, and there is an understanding that rest is just as important as work.
The other thing that fascinated me was the language. The moment I heard Swedes casually chatting in their melodic Swedish, I felt a strange excitement. It was unfamiliar yet intriguing.
But, beyond the language, what truly inspires me about Sweden is its commitment to sustainability. Swedes don’t just talk about being environmentally friendly; they integrate it into their daily lives. Recycling, efficient public transport, and waste reduction are not just trends but ingrained habits. It’s no surprise that the world’s first environmental conference was held in Stockholm in 1972, leading to the establishment of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).
One of the biggest realizations I had was about landfills. My perspective on landfills was shaped by what I had seen in Indonesia, where waste management remains a major challenge. Landfills there often emit a strong odor, appear overwhelming, and lack proper handling. But here, it feels different — the landfill doesn’t smell as strong, the area is well-managed, and waste is systematically processed.
I also learned a lot about organic waste. If we truly want to combat climate change, organic waste should never end up in landfills. Food waste releases methane, a greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide. This realization made me see how small actions — like composting or waste sorting — suddenly felt much more significant.
Living in Stockholm has made me reflect on many things. It has challenged my habits, reshaped my mindset, and broadened my perspective. I’ve learned to embrace silence and to enjoy solitude without feeling lonely. I’ve come to appreciate the power of simplicity — how less can be more and how slowing down can actually bring more meaning.
Nonetheless, this is just the beginning of my journey in Stockholm.
— Fingers crossed for what the future has in store! ❤

At first glance, it looked just like any suburban street in Sweden. The houses were similar; compact but well-designed with sharp corners and adorned with perfectly manicured lawns. The sidewalks did not have a crack in them and the cars parked next to it were modestly luxurious; not flashy Ferraris but rather fully accessorized Audis.
As we rounded a corner, we came into a small outdoor shopping complex akin to an American strip mall but without the decadent vibes. There were a multitude of real estate agencies, including Skandia Mäklarna, showing off the latest hot properties on the market with pools and staggeringly high prices on the corner of the posters.
The local branch of Handelsbanken was closed but its ATM seemed to be functioning, although nobody lined up because cash is essentially extinct as far as Swedes are concerned. A hip brunch spot — the type where you overpay for a cortado, complain about it but continue going to be seen — was also already closed but we noted it for our next breakfast.
On the other end of the complex was a small independent supermarket called Spisa with…

Designing with AI: Reflections from a Night with Miro’s CEO in Stockholm,https://medium.com/@ajithachellam/designing-with-ai-reflections-from-a-night-with-miros-ceo-in-stockholm-c5e94f35b368,"Sign up

On Tuesday, 24th of June I attended an intimate fireside chat in Stockholm with Miro CEO Andrey Khusid, alongside Armin Catovic (Head of AI at Aloi and Vice Chair at Stockholm AI) and Elena Verna, Head of Growth at Lovable. Andre spoke about creativity, product leadership, and what it means to build with purpose in the age of AI. This blog is my attempt to capture that moment: for myself, for other designers navigating similar questions, and for anyone trying to make sense of where we’re all headed next.
“It’s a dance. A dance between humans and AI.”
I liked how Andrey used the word dance and not collaborators. It blew my mind when Andrey introduced the new AI features of Miro and introduced this concept of Canvas as a prompt.
“Some of us think in text. Some think in tables. Some in images. Some in handwriting. AI can translate between all these formats.”
It made me reflect on my own process. How often do I get stuck on one way of seeing things — one visual, one narrative, one iteration. This new dance invites us to explore the edges, to try “what if” scenarios we might not have considered. That’s not just productivity. That’s power. It’s not about outsourcing creativity. It’s about augmenting our intuition with speed, synthesis, and scale. And maybe, just maybe, creating space for more meaningful work.
This night wasn’t just about Miro. It was about the larger wave of transformation pulsing through the city, and one of the clearest signals of that was from Lovable. It was exciting to hear from Elena Verna about how Lovable as an entire company is AI-first, not just the product, but the tooling, workflows, culture, and even mindset.
They recently ran a weekend hackathon where anyone could use Lovable’s tools to build with three major LLMs. More than 2.5 million people created something just in a weekend. It was a strong message to startup founders to scale to the top. And simply, people are looking for a simple and easy product when it comes to digital experiences. Lovable is simple and people love it.
And perhaps that’s what makes Stockholm special right now: it’s not just building tools; it’s building momentum. Hmm, what a great time to be here at the center of tech innovation!
When I was working on the book Catch the Feeling, we discussed a lot about ‘sameness’. With AI-generated content, there is a general play of sameness in designs, products and content that is out. With this thought in mind, we had a question from the room,
What happens when everyone uses the same tools, the same AI models, the same prompts? Will we all just end up building the same thing?
Andrey replied,
“What makes the difference, is human empathy, point of view, and taste.”
It can accelerate your process, suggest alternatives, and synthesize patterns, but if you don’t show up with a strong perspective, it’ll just give you more of what everyone else is getting. In a world of infinite output, originality comes from the courage to have a point of view. Being human!
My friend Jaydatta is doing his Master's Thesis about decision making in Swedish startups. We were having a brief discussion about his findings and how actors and factors influence a major decision in a product. Later in the evening, MIRO CEO touched on his decision-making and leadership style.
“I was scared of adding complexity. I didn’t want to overwhelm the user.”
His vision in 2011 was to build the first browser-based whiteboard, and he kept the product as simple as possible. Andre shared how his leadership style had shifted over the years.
From top-down decision-making in the early days, to bottom-up ownership where teams shaped features based on user needs. He held back a key feature, not because they couldn’t build it, but because he believed simplicity was more important. But when the pandemic hit and MIRO was used heavily, he made a drastic shift, focusing on synchronous collaboration.
And now, as Miro matures again, they’re returning to a model where teams can own and shape their areas. But what stays constant, Andre said, is the need for a strong product vision, otherwise, you end up with 25 products inside one. This was a really powerful insight.
There was a question about what are the emerging skills and the right mindset to survive in a transitioning face in tech.
“The companies that thrive will be full of T-shaped people. Those who go deep in one craft, but also know how to connect the dots across disciplines and prompt machines to get the job done.”
That means being a designer who understands marketing. An engineer who thinks in UX. A PM who can sketch a landing page, run a prompt, and launch it in hours. And increasingly, these people won’t be full-time hires. They’ll be fractional experts, brought in for short bursts of high-impact work.
Lovable is already ahead of this curve. With under 50 full-time roles and revenue approaching $100 million, they’re proving what’s possible when AI augments the builders and everyone is trusted to own more.
Andre even predicted something that caught the room off guard: “Compensation will look different. In a few years, the same job title could pay 5x more to the person who brings exponential impact.”
Not because of tenure. But because they know how to leverage tools, think across domains, and ship value fast. The more impact you create in the company, the more compensation!
With big giants in the picture, someone asked a question,
“What if OpenAI builds your product tomorrow and destroys your business?”
Andre simply smiled and said something that brought a lot of hope and smiles in the room.
“We’re not building because we think OpenAI won’t do it. We’re building because we love what we do.”
A truth that often gets lost in metrics, frameworks, and the pressure to always be future-proof. It reminded me that the joy of creation doesn’t disappear just because the landscape changes.
“We might all be a little f**ked,” Andre joked, “but we’re in it together. And we’re still building.” And that, to me, is what this night in Stockholm was about.
Hope it inspired you too, dear reader. Connect with me on LinkedIn to follow my journey.

My trip started from Turku to Stockholm via the Viking Glory, which is a cruise ferry that runs between Turku-Åland and Islands-Stockholm. Before arriving in Stockholm, I strongly recommend buying a Go City Pass (Stockholm Pass). It includes 50+ attractions, ranging from Museums, Skansen, and Boat tours. You can buy a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5-day pass from SEK 824 (71 €) to SEK 1,899 (162 €) — depending on the validity period. Once you bought the pass, download the Go City app, and you can show the QR code to attractions that are included in the pass to explore the city.
The Go City Pass includes: (More on the official Website) 📱
…
⚠️Not all the attractions are open all year round, for example, the Drottningholm Palace was closed from December 11th — December 30th, 2023, so you may not be able to get in if you go there during the Christmas Season. Same for the Stockholm Winter Tour by Boat, of course, it is only available during the winter season, but there is another boat tour available at other times of the year as well. (I highly recommended the Winter Boat Tour 🛥️)
💰Compile attractions that can be accessed free by the pass in two or three days to save money.
Note that the Go City Pass does not include public transportation unlike the Oslo Pass, so please remember to buy Travelcards if you want to explore the city without limitations. (You can get a discount if you are over 65 years of age, a student holding a Swedish student ID, or if you are under 20 years of age😊). The Travelcards are available on the smartphone app “SL-Journey Planner Ticket” and you can get on the tram, subway, bus, or commuter train within the validity period. 🚌
When you hop on a bus, you need to show the code to the driver, and you need the code for the subway (Marked as Ⓣ) as well. However, for the tram, you can just simply hop on and off!
I would say the subway and the tram are the most common transportation that I used during my stay.

Stockholm is arguably one of the world’s most beautiful capitals. It is built on 14 islands around medieval city center and is located where the freshwater Lake Mälaren flows out into the Baltic Sea. Stockholm is the most populous city in the Scandinavia, with 2.2 million people living in the metropolitan area. Running in Stockholm is a treat, given the water, unique geography, and well laid out pedestrian and recreational paths. The Stockholm Marathon is claimed to have one of the most beautiful marathon routes in the world.
The best running routes in Stockholm are defined by scenic paths along the waterfront, across bridges to the islands, and some lovely green spaces. We also have some routes that combine some of the main Stockholm sights with some pleasant parks and urban highlights. Stockholm has an excellent public transportation system consisting of bus, tram, local train (pendeltåg) and subway (tunnelbana; look for a T-sign).
One of the defining elements of running in Stockholm is its latitude. In summer, running late at night is a particular treat due to 18+hours of daylight. In winter, Stockholm makes up for short days in part by providing good lighting along most of its paths. Despite its northern location, Stockholm has relatively mild weather compared to other locations at similar latitude, or even farther south — receiving more sunshine per year than Paris or London, but also precipitation on about half the days through the year. It can snow from November to April, and winter running will likely involve snow or ice so bring your Yak-Traks. Summers are mild but rarely warm. You’ll almost always need an extra later for morning runs, even in July.

5.5-mile loop. Accessible any point in downtown. MAP
This route covers some of the main sights of the city, with lots of folks out walking and running. Much of the route is along the water and over bridges to two islands. Start your run at Gustav Adolfs square, next to the Royal Opera House. Head to Gamla Stan (Old Town) and pass Riksdagshuset where the Swedish Parliament is situated, as well as, the Royal Palace — His Majesty The King’s official residence. Enjoy the views of the idyllic Gamla Stan while you run south towards Södermalm island. Head west along the waterfront all the way to Långholmen, which is a former prison island, and currently one of Stockholm’s green oases. Cross the bridge to Kungsholmen island and head back east. You will pass another main sight, Stadthus (City Hall), which is also the venue of the annual Nobel Prize banquet. Complete the loop at Gustav Adolfs square.
7.2-mile loop. Access: several subways or buses to Slussen stop. MAP
Södermalm, or Söder as locals call it, is an island in south Stockholm. The vibe in Södermalm is relaxed and trendy, and it was selected as the coolest neighborhood in Europe by Vogue magazine in 2014. Running a loop around the island is a treat. Start your run at Södermalm market square which is easily accessible by public transportation (Slussen stop). Head west and enjoy views in Montelusvägen — a walking path looking over the waterfront to Kungsholmen. Continue further west and climb to Skinnarviksberget, a hill offering another breathtaking view over the city. Run to waterfront and make a loop around the island. Probably the most scenic parts of the loop are a path from Tantolunden in the west to Eriksdalsbadet in the south, and northeast area of the island when you run along the waterfront with Gamla Stan on your right.
5.2-mile loop. Start: Djurgårdsbron Bridge. Access: Bus 76 from downtown. MAP
Djurgården is a green and idyllic island close to central Stockholm, offering a beautiful setting for running. Its official name Kungliga Djurgården means Royal Game Park and it is one of the most popular recreation areas of the city. Start your run at Djurgårdsbron bridge and head east along the canal all the way to Lilla Sjötullsbron bridge. Cross the bridge to south and enter Djurgården island where you will pass scenic green areas and several historical buildings and monuments, the Vasa museum, art galleries, and the popular amusement park Gröna Lund. In the interior of the island is Royal Djurgården, which has gravel, more forested paths that can be a nice add-on.
8.1-mile loop. Access: bus 515 MAP
Hagaparken — a lovely green park about 5km north of the city — is a popular running destination any time of year. The park offers several scenic running paths. The best option is to make a loop along around Brunnsviken lake. Hagaparken is Sweden’s purest version of an ‘English park’, and the surrounding area contains three royal palaces. Probably the most famous building is Haga Palace where Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden, and her husband, Prince Daniel, Duke of Västergötland, moved shortly after their wedding in 2010.
5.6-mile loop. Access: any bus, tram or subway to Central Station MAP
Kungsholmen is a residential island where also the most prominent building of the Stockholm skyline and the venue of the annual Nobel Prize banquet, City Hall, is located. It is also another great running location. A good option to start your run is near Central Station. Head south and you will see Gamla Stan on the other side of waterfront. After passing the City Hall, continue west along the waterfront. Other highlights are a beautiful park called Rålambshovsparken and the inner city beach Smedsuddsbadet on the south side of the island, and Hornsbergs Strand on the north side. Most of the run is along the water.
Hellasgården is a nice recreation area offering several running trails in the woods and along the Källtorpssjön lake. It is located about 20 minutes by bus from downtown Stockholm — take bus 401 from Slussen to the Hellasgården stop in Älta. There are also excellent refreshment possibilities after your run, or options for a sauna or enjoying a sandy beach. See our 5.1 mile route here. Some of the trails have lights but note that in winter season, some of the trails are kept clean from snow while others are used for skiing, thus not suitable for running. See additional information here.
Stockholm has a wide selection of hotels in the downtown area and all of our iconic routes are located within a few mile radius. To have a fast access to the Stockholm Highlights loop, Djurgården and Södermalm routes, look for hotels in Östermalm and Gamla Stan areas. If you want to stay closer to Hagaparken route, then the Vasastan is a good option. It is still very close to Central loop and Södermalm routes, but a bit further from Djurgården. In addition to big international chains see also the following options:
Radisson Blu. Chain of well equipped hotels. Several locations in downtown.
Scandic. Another chain, several locations in downtown.
Nordic Light Hotel. A nice hotel with great location.
Runner’s Store is the biggest running specialty store in Sweden. Located downtown.
Löplabbet is another running specialty store with knowledgeable staff.
XXL. Price-driven big box retailer which has disrupted Scandinavian sporting goods retailers recently. One location in downtown on Hamngatan, another in Bromma airport.
Asics Flagship Store located in downtown on Hamngatan
Run With Me Stockholm offers a variety of private guided running tours covering main sights and attractions of the city. Has free group runs, too.
Stockholm Running Tours is another group combining sightseeing and running.
Nike+ Run Club offers several group runs to runners of all speeds.
Hash House Harriers is a Stockholm chapter of this globally spread “Drinking club with a running problem”. Meets every Wednesday night and every second Saturday afternoon for running, beer and fun.
Stockholm Frontrunners is running and walking group for LGBTQ people and their friends. Meets every Tuesday for group runs.
Stockholm Marathon is the main marathon race in the city, taking place annually late May or early June. Consists of two loops around the city and the finishing line is located on track of the Olympic Stadium.
Stockholm Half Marathon. September. This race has been in its current form since 2007 but its roots date to the 1920's.
Midnattsloppet. August. The “midnight run”, is a 10k race which has been run in Stockholm since 1982. As the name suggests, around 20,000 runners hit the streets of the city after the sunset. The same event is organized annually also in Malmö, Göteborg and Helsinki.
Women’s Health Half Marathon is the biggest half marathon exclusively for women in Europe. Offers also a possibility to run as a pair and split the distance with your friend. Website available only in Swedish — to learn more in English, contact whhm@marathon.se

On 10th August, 1628, the Swedish navy launched the maiden voyage of the Vasa .The Vasa was part of the military expansion and an expression of Swedish naval power: It was explicitly built at the order of the King of Sweden Gustavus Adolphus, and was richly decorated to show off Swedish might and wealth. No expense was spared. One of the rooms was made to look like the royal palace. There were numerous Roman statues on board, — King Adolphus was sending a message that ‘hey, Sweden is the modern Roman empire’. Upon completion, it was one of the most powerful armed vessels in the world.
August 10 was a calm day, perfect for a launch, with a light breeze from the southwest. It passed the Royal palace, and the gun ports were opened for a Royal salute. When doing so, a gust of wind -nothing crazy — filled its sails and it heeled to the port. It passed some bluffs to the south (Södermalm, for those familiar with the geography). A little later, at Tegelviken, a stronger gust caused it to again heel to the port side — and went past the point beyond which the ship could right itself. The gun ports were open because 1300 meters past its launch, the Vasa sank, and about 30 people died (it included women and children as well, since it was a ceremonial trip around the harbor). It took all of 5 minutes to sink, and a major reason was the lower gun ports were open and water poured in as it heeled. But more on this later.
The Vasa lay on the bottom of the Stockholm harbor for 333 years, before it was successfully raised and the Vasa museum captures its stunning story of mismanagement, in a fashion eerily similar to mismanagement as seen in some modern software companies. I was lucky enough to have a tour through this museum while on a work trip to Stockholm. I would visit Stockholm again just to go back to the museum (though Stockholm has so much to see and do)
The Vasa’s story serves as a powerful metaphor for modern software companies, particularly in how organizational dynamics can lead to technical disaster. Just as Vasa’s builders continued with a fundamentally flawed design due to royal pressure, software teams sometimes proceed with architectures or technical decisions they know are problematic due to executive mandates or market pressures. The tragic part of Vasa’s story is that it was known that it was unlikely to survive its launch. In 1628, the captain arranged for the Vice Admiral to demonstrate its stability. 30 men ran back and forth across the upper deck, and the ship started to roll. The Admiral stopped the test because he was afraid the ship would capsize in the harbor. Does this sound familiar to anyone?
Consider how often we see software projects that are “too big to fail” — platforms or products that have had so much investment and executive attention that stopping to address fundamental issues becomes politically impossible. Like the Vasa’s gun ports being open for a royal salute (a political requirement) directly contributing to its sinking, we often see technical compromises made for business optics that ultimately undermine the product’s stability.
The parallel extends to modern engineering organizations where technical experts — much like the shipbuilders of the Vasa — might recognize fundamental flaws but feel unable to effectively raise these concerns up the chain of command. In both cases, the culture of deference to authority and the pressure to deliver can override technical wisdom. Today’s “royal demands” might come in the form of arbitrary deadlines, feature requirements that compromise system stability, or architectural decisions made to align with executive presentations rather than engineering realities. There is a tendency to ‘drift to failure’ in organizations that show up only when it blows up in their faces.
Most tellingly, just as the Vasa’s builders had proven experience with smaller ships but ran into trouble when scaling up to a larger, more complex vessel, software companies often face challenges when scaling from successful smaller systems to more complex platforms. The same principles that worked at a smaller scale can become catastrophic liabilities when applied without adaptation to larger, more complex systems.
This is a standard practice in product development (my writeup on it can be read here). Well, certainly at every place where I had influence over the process. It is entertaining to turn the 5 Why’s framework on the Vasa to get to root cause: King Adolphus was furious, of course, and the loss of his statement piece, and the loss of the many cannons that were on the Vasa (2 gun decks that can be seen in the photo above — it had 64 cannons). There was a royal inquiry, and no one was found guilty — it would be foolhardy — deadly — to point the finger at the king, who was responsible for the tragedy.
So what would the 5 Why’s for the Vasa look like?
The ship capsized and sank about 1,300 meters into its maiden voyage in Stockholm harbor on August 10, 1628. A light gust of wind caused it to heel (tilt) severely to port. Water rushed through the open gun ports, which were only 1.2 meters above the waterline, flooding the ship and causing it to sink within minutes.
The Vasa was dangerously unstable due to its top-heavy design. The ship carried 64 heavy bronze cannons, mostly on the upper gun deck. More critically, the ship’s ballast (72 tonnes) was insufficient to counterbalance the weight of the upper structure, guns, and heavy decorative sculptures. Stability tests before launch showed the ship was dangerously unstable — it heeled severely when just 30 men ran from side to side.
Despite shipbuilder Jakobsson noting the stability problems during construction, and despite a stability test where the ship dangerously heeled, no significant changes were made. Admiral Fleming, who oversaw the test, feared reporting the full extent of the problems to the king. The shipbuilders and naval officers knew of the issues but proceeded with the launch anyway.
In Swedish society under King Adolphus, challenging royal authority was unthinkable. (Note: This is of course not particular to Swedish culture). The king had personally ordered multiple changes during construction, including the second gun deck and additional heavy bronze cannons. He was deeply involved in the design, viewing the Vasa as a symbol of Swedish naval power. No one, including the shipwright, dared question the kings demands.
Sweden in the 1620s operated under absolute monarchy where the king’s word was literally law. King Adolphus had transformed Sweden into a major military power, leading successful campaigns in the Thirty Years’ War. The hierarchical culture of 17th-century Sweden, combined with the king’s reputation as a militant leader, created an environment where professional expertise was subordinate to royal authority. There was no cultural framework for “speaking truth to power” — the concept itself would have been alien to most 17th-century Swedes.
The fundamental issue was a cultural environment that prioritized deference to authority over technical expertise and safety concerns. This cultural dynamic made it impossible for technical experts to effectively challenge decisions that compromised the ship’s safety, even when they recognized the dangers.
The tragic irony is that Adolphus, despite his direct involvement in the ship’s design changes, never saw the Vasa — he was away on campaign in Poland when it sank. The culture of absolute deference to royal authority operated even in his absence, preventing necessary corrections to a fatally flawed design.
Well, that is the Vasa. And we have many modern day examples. I’d love to hear about your experiences!

Who do so many employees fall in love with their companies and practices, even the most terrible ones?
If you’re not familiar with Stockholm Syndrome then you’ve either never been held captive by an agile cell of fervent evangelists, wielding a full set of colourful whiteboard markers, in the company boardroom, you’ve never encountered a technical problem so difficult that you considered bailing out doing a PMP¹ course instead, or perhaps you’ve never had the financial pressure to keep a job you absolutely hate.
And, fellow player in the Grand Game of Software Engineering, even if you did, I have total faith that you wouldn’t give in to your captors.
You see, it’s survival of the fittest out there on the board — meaning it’s those that are technically competent, don’t have a strange love of garments woven from man made fibres, and those who know that management means having an irreversible frontal lobotomy (with a laminated certificate to prove it) and inevitable crossing to the other side of the board that will survive.
We all encounter those that have been summarily brainwashed every now and again in the Grand Game. Whether they’re seen to be repeatedly donning company merch unnecessarily², whether they spend their time organising (i.e. micromanaging) others unnecessarily, or just won’t have a word spoken against…

This is my 28-day journey of living a temporary life in Helsinki, Tallinn, Stockholm, and Copenhagen.
🇸🇪 August 4, 2019
It’s very lucky to have a friend who lives in Stockholm. Jimmie was one of my classmates when I was in San Francisco. He is a writer and a freelance journalist. After leaving San Francisco, I’ve kept in touch with him on Facebook. And luckily I had a chance to visit Stockholm and saw him again.
Thanks to Jimmie, I could visit a beautiful island, Vaxholm in Sweden. It is not far from Stockholm, but it is not easy to get there by public transportation. We went outside of Stockholm by car, arrived at a town with a small dock, and waited for a public ship that moves cars from islands to islands. Because there are no bridges between islands in some places, so the ship plays a role as a bridge. We got on a ship, crossed a bay and got to Vaxholm.
Vaxholm looks like a small town in the countryside. It was a military fortress in the 16th century like Suomenlinna in Finland, but now it is one of the tourist attractions for hiking, camping, or just relaxing. We stopped by a small cafe and had Swedish Fika(coffee) and cinnamon rolls. They tasted really good. We looked around the island by driving and walking.
Vaxholm, this is the place that I have been looking for!! A calm and peaceful place. There are some stores for convenience but not many. There are some people, but it was not crowded. I can go hiking, sailing, fishing, swimming or camping. Or I can just take a walk along the coast. It’s the best place to relax. I wanted to stay more, but I should go back to Stockholm for tomorrow’s new adventure. I just left my heart in Vaxholm.
The more I stay, the more I like Sweden, maybe more than Tallinn. Sorry, Tallinn.

This is not just a political reckoning. It is a personal one.
I come from survivors — not only of the Holocaust itself, but of the moral disorientation it left behind. My father escaped Nazi Germany on the last Kindertransport to London. He later carried messages between generals after landing on Normandy Beach, speaking the languages of both the oppressed and the empire. My grandfather survived by finding refuge in Sweden. My lineage is braided with escape, resilience, and silence.
And now, I speak to honor them. To wrest history from the hands of fear.
To advocate for a universalist, justice-rooted Judaism in today’s climate is to invite pushback — from within our communities. These pushbacks do not always come from cruelty. They often come from heartbreak. They come from those who believe they are defending Jewish life, when in fact they may be protecting Jewish trauma from healing and perpetuating animosity worldwide.
To walk into this conversation, we must understand the language of fear — not to be manipulated by it, but to meet it with truth.
Here are five of the most common arguments used to reject a Judaism of shared humanity and prophetic conscience. Then we will reconstruct the machinery of propaganda as it is deployed, in order to disarm it with truth. Then a short and printable “pocket guide” to help us return to our core teachings.
They are not caricatures. They are cries. And if we are to become the choosing ones — not merely the chosen — we must listen with clarity, respond with compassion, and never forget: Again and again and again, Never Again must mean never for anyone...for everyone.
Let us begin where our ancestors survived — but refuse to end there.
Understanding the counterarguments made by fear-based ethnocentric voices — particularly those within Jewish communities that resist universalist interpretations — is essential for both refining your own position and preparing for meaningful dialogue.
Here are five of the most common arguments used by fear-based ethnocentrists to dismiss or dismantle the kind of covenantal, universalist Judaism I advocate:
1. The “Survival First” Argument
Claim: Before we can worry about others, we must secure the survival of the Jewish people. We are always one catastrophe away from annihilation.
Key Points:
Response:
This argument exploits trauma to justify ongoing preemptive dominance. It conflates existential threats with political criticism and flattens time, as if Pharaoh, Hitler, and any current dissenter are interchangeable. It demands eternal victimhood even when Jews wield state or institutional power.
2. The “Particularism is Not a Sin” Argument
Claim: Every nation puts itself first — why should Jews be held to a higher moral standard?
Key Points:
Response:
This argument deliberately ignores that Jewish ethics — rooted in Torah, prophets, and rabbinic tradition — do demand more. It erases the prophetic voice of justice. It also neglects the fact that being a light to the nations (Isaiah 49:6) is not optional in Judaism — it’s core.
3. The “You Don’t Understand Realpolitik” Argument
Claim: Your argument is philosophically interesting but politically dangerous. The world is not a yeshiva or a seminar. We must protect ourselves with strength, not sermons.
Key Points:
Response:
This response uses cynicism to neutralize ethics. It assumes power and moral courage are mutually exclusive. In reality, prophetic leadership has always been a countercultural phenomenon. Moses, Isaiah, and Heschel all spoke into power from a place of moral clarity, not political comfort.
4. The “We Tried Peace, It Didn’t Work” Argument
Claim: We gave land for peace. We made offers. We withdrew. And what did it get us? Rockets. Stabbings. Terror. You’re asking us to endanger our children.
Key Points:
Response:
This is trauma talking — but selectively. It collapses decades of failed diplomacy, settler expansion, and blockade into a single defensive narrative. While security is valid, it cannot be divorced from justice — and justice requires that we confront the history we created, not just the history done to us.
5. The “Self-Hating Jew” Accusation
Claim: Jews who criticize Israel or prioritize universal ethics over Jewish solidarity are internalizing antisemitic narratives. You’re aiding our enemies.
Key Points:
Response:
This is emotional blackmail disguised as community protection. It conflates dissent with betrayal. In truth, ethical critique is an ancient Jewish tradition — from Abraham arguing with God to Jeremiah lamenting corruption in Jerusalem. To speak truth to Jewish power is not betrayal; it is fidelity.
If one were trying to design a manipulative, propagandistic narrative in support of a fear-based ethnocentric worldview, one would need to activate collective trauma, moral inversion, and identity loyalty. The goal is not truth, but emotional certainty, enemy construction, and justified power.
Here are 10 potent narrative devices — some are outright lies, some half-truths, and all are repeated enough to feel self-evident.
They may sound familiar.
1. “We are the eternal victim.”
No one has suffered like us. No one ever will. We are history’s permanent target.
2. “They all want to kill us — again.”
Scratch any critic, and you’ll find a hidden antisemite.
3. “Survival justifies anything.”
If we don’t do this, we won’t exist tomorrow. That’s just how it is.
4. “Our power is only defensive.”
When we act, it’s because we were provoked. When we strike, it’s because we had no choice.
5. “There are no civilians among them.”
They are all complicit — every man, woman, and child. They elected terrorists. They cheer death.
6. “We already tried peace. They spat in our face.”
We offered everything. They gave us rockets. What more proof do you need?
7. “Anyone who criticizes us wants us destroyed.”
You say ‘human rights,’ but you mean ‘our extinction.’
8. “We are the West’s last line of defense.”
Support us, or terrorism wins. We are your moral outpost.
9. “We speak for all Jews.”
If you oppose us, you’re not one of us. You’re self-hating or brainwashed.
10. “History has absolved us.”
After what was done to us, we’ve earned the right to do whatever is necessary.
Repetition and Ritual
These ideas are not just said. They’re:
The Manipulation Goal:
Make it emotionally intolerable — even existentially traitorous — for someone to:
In case you want to have a conscious way to reject manipulation here’s a pocket-sized pamphlet — concise, powerful, and portable — designed to interrupt propaganda in real time and rekindle moral clarity when fear-based ethnocentric messaging is heard. Copy and print it and put it anywhere you want to remain a thinking and feeling human being, grounded in Judaism's highest teachings.
Spotting Propaganda. Reclaiming Conscience.
WHEN YOU HEAR:
“We’re the eternal victim.”
ASK YOURSELF: Is this invoking history to justify current harm?
“They all want to kill us.”
REMEMBER: Fear paints everyone an enemy. But fear is not truth.
“Survival justifies anything.”
TRUTH: Freedom without ethics is just a new kind of Pharaoh.
“They don’t value life like we do.”
DANGER: That’s dehumanization. The oldest lie used to justify violence.
“We tried peace. They gave us terror.”
PAUSE: Did we try peace — or control disguised as peace?
“Everyone’s a terrorist over there.”
FACT: Blanket blame is genocide’s gateway.
“Critics are antisemitic.”
NO. Ethics ≠ hate. Dissent ≠ betrayal.
“We’re defending civilization.”
WATCH OUT: That’s colonial language. That’s empire talking.
“We speak for all Jews.”
YOU KNOW: No one speaks for all of us. Judaism is not a monolith. Never was.
“History has absolved us.”
NEVER. No past horror gives license to inflict one.
INSTEAD, REMEMBER:
“We were slaves in Egypt…” Not to become Pharaohs, but to never be one.
“You shall not oppress the stranger…” Not once — but 36 times. That’s covenant.
“We are not free until all are free.” That’s Judaism at its best. That’s how you know.
Carry this not as a weapon, but as an anchor. So when fear speaks, you remember:
“Justice, justice shall you pursue.”
(Even when it costs. Especially when it costs.)

Thinking about traveling to Stockholm? Here’s the only guide you’ll need to avoid the notorious taxi scams that have tripped up even seasoned travelers.
I’d like to say I’m a savvy traveler, with 35 years of globetrotting experience under my belt.
I know the usual tricks — check prices online, avoid unsolicited “cheap” rides, stick to the designated taxi zones, and confirm the fare in advance.
I had done my homework, read all the guides, and felt confident about getting around Stockholm safely.
But what should’ve been a routine taxi ride quickly turned into a high-stakes lesson in navigating travel scams.
The moment I stepped into that “official” taxi queue, I had no idea I was about to become the latest victim of a meticulously organized setup.
I’m sharing my story to help you avoid the same trap and keep your Stockholm adventure as memorable as mine should have been.

So, I realise as I write this that my last blog post was about an ECR event at the University of Stirling, arranged by the British Society of Gerontology’s Emerging Researcher’s in Ageing group (ERA). Ironic then, that I am writing this blog post in a former prison in Stockholm, on an ERA Writing Retreat at Långholmen!
The writing retreat, which I’ll write up in a separate post, was scheduled for Wednesday to Friday, so my brain quickly went into planning a research trip around it. Who might I be able to speak to at museums or universities in Stockholm about my research and practice at the Fitzwilliam Museum? And what might I learn about Nordic practice? I did some desk-top research, wrote some emails, and before I knew it, I had conjured up a plan for a research trip! And again, I was visiting a place I hadn’t been to before, so this was exciting…
Arriving on Saturday afternoon, I was able to spend the weekend strolling around the city (which was freezing!), being a tourist in a new city. I took an archipelago boat tour on Sunday morning, followed up by a visit to the Vasa Museet — the museum that I was told was one not to be missed! It was here that I was reminded that I am now unable to visit a museum without stepping into research mode…
The museum is vast — with many floors, and a lack of clear navigation route. Whilst the ship itself (if you’re interested in the story, you can read more on the museum’s website) is impressive, I felt immediately overwhelmed, not knowing where to start, or where to go. I found myself looking for somewhere to sit!
I saw a station where you could collect a map (which was available in numerous different languages), as well as clicking on a QR code to access a FREE audio guide. A map on the wall showed the location of all the stories in the audio guide, which was helpful (although they were not shown on the paper map which you carried with you). I looked around me, and found a theatre style set of wooden steps, where I could sit, look at the ship, and listen to the audio…
The audio was quite interesting, but then I quickly became frustrated by the imitation waves that were added in for effect. Time to move on!
There were lifts, but often with a group of people already waiting, so I chose to use the stairs. I found it quite confusing to navigate my way around, and it was too dark to read the map, so I stopped trying!
The museum is very interactive, with a wide variety of displays, ways to engage, and a LOT of information. I realised I was finding the displays a bit overwhelming, and so decided to focus on the ship itself — actually, as I write this, it’s probably how I usually navigate a museum. Focus on the object of interest!
This was the start of my trip, before I even intended to be focused on research. I’ll add further blogs to this series (links to be added, as I write them):

Stockholm syndrome is often defined as when a hostage develops an empathetic psychological connection with their captor. The reason this happens (as clearly, the hostage is the victim) is that the hostage subconsciously figures out, as seems reasonable, that if they are nice to their captors, they will receive better treatment in exchange. And that’s true.
An easy reference to this is the trope of the “Uncle Tom” in African American slave life during American slavery. During American slavery, certain slaves were mentally trained that if they accepted their slavery, and willingly worked with their master, they would receive better treatment in exchange. And said slaves bought into this, and cooperated in exchange for said better treatment. The African American community now refers to such slaves as “Uncle Toms”.
I propose that the process by which Stockholm syndrome sets in subconsciously, is a tool that ministers of faith use consciously to trick those in their congregation into becoming ardent followers of their own supposed volition.
I’ll explain. When a person enters a church community, they are usually doing it simply for the community at first. A community is a small society. And the smaller the society, the more socialist the society. This is why socialism works well in small countries. The…

This article originally appeared on Confessions of a Boy Toy
Stockholm is a truly magical city. This spring, we traveled to Sweden’s capital to experience the fairy tale magic for ourselves. From getting lost through the cobblestone streets of charming Gamla Stan (Old Town) or boutique-hopping in the city’s super-hip SoFo neighborhood, Stockholm has enchanting surprises at every turn.
Here are some incredible places you’ll be delighted to stumble upon shall you find yourself in Stockholm.
The clothes and furniture at Grandpa embodies everything we love about the SoFo district: Casual, super-cool and contemporary, despite its name. Grandpa focuses on highlighting Scandinavian fashion and furniture designers with a reputation for making things that are eco-friendly and sustainable, with materials sourced locally, organically or through fair trade.
Another quintessential SoFo shop, Coctail is like a Pedro Almodovar movie that’s come to life. No wonder it’s so popular with film location scouts. While most of Stockholm is still enamored with minimalism, this tiny shop aims for “maximalism” — everything here is just the most, from the luchador masks, the Dia de Los Muertos figurines, the Frida Kahlo mugs, and other colorful, authentic trinkets shipped from Mexican street vendors.
Located in Gamla Stan since 1864, E.Torndahl is a tiny, family-owned boutique featuring the work of local Scandinavian designers and artists. Here, you’ll find fascinating gifts in the form of jewelry, wallets, metallic hair-trimmers shaped like exotic birds, coasters with a bearded man illustration, a portable phone charger shaped like a river rock, and more.
Photography lovers should spend an afternoon — especially if it’s raining — perusing Fotografiska, a for-profit center for modern photography. This place is not afraid to exhibit controversial and provocative photos, so make sure to wear your open-minded goggles. During our visit, we saw work by African artists Samuel Fosso and Rotimi Fani-Kayode, as well as a special exhibition on French fashion photographer Bettina Rheims.
There’s no inch of Stockholm that’s not drenched in history and culture, even down in the subway. The city’s public transit system is said to be the world’s longest art exhibit, with 90 percent of the subway stations decorated with sculptures, mosaics, paintings and public installations by over 150 artists. Some of the most eye-grabbing subway art can be found at the following stations: Kungsträdgården, T-Centralen, Rådhuset, Solna Centrum and Tensta.
If you find yourself in Gamla Stan around noon, check out the changing of the guard at the Royal Palace. It takes place at 12:15 p.m. daily during the summer and on weekends year-round. The Royal Palace itself is a sight to see. You can take a tour of the inside and check out five museums, including the royal treasury, home to the crown jewels, an armory with knights’ gear and the royal stable with coronation carriages and intricate coaches.
Are you a fan of Game of Thrones or Harry Potter or Star Trek or E.T. or Marvel superheroes or Buffy the Vampire Slayer or all of the above? You’re bound to find a book, graphic novel, or other gift for all your geek-related obsessions at this sci-fi mecca in Gamla Stan. Let’s just say this shop has everything you could ever possibly need to decipher every reference in Stranger Things.
If it’s sunny out, this lively terrace at the top of Sodrateatern, an iconic theater in the heart of Stockholm, has to be on your to-do list. And if the weather is not cooperating, Sodrateatern offers plenty of indoor festivities as well, including jazz-fueled dinners that turn into full-blown dance parties.
If you’re traveling to Stockholm during the summer, from early April to late September, make sure to catch the sunset at the hyper-scenic Mälarpaviljongen. This high-spirited, straight-friendly restaurant and outdoor bar is located on the waterfront barges along the Riddarfjärden bay. You can even arrive by boat after a day out on the bay to cap off your cruising adventures.
A gay-owned coffee shop painted mustard-yellow in the heart of Gamla Stan, Chokladkoppen serves delicious hot chocolate in a bowl. If you really want to indulge — and why wouldn’t you? — they also have chocolate cake that’s to die for. During the summer, enjoy the people-watching in the Nobel Museum plaza from one of the cafe’s outdoor tables.
Pharmarium Cocktail Bar
Located in Gamla Stan near where Stockholm’s first-ever pharmacy opened in 1575, Pharmarium serves a different type of modern remedy: exquisite craft cocktails. The Roses of Gold, the Pharmarium’s version of a French 75, was just what the doctor order, made to perfection with vodka, lemon, champagne, and just a sprinkle of gold powder. As if a champagne cocktail needed that extra flair.
You will find plenty of treats in Stockholm’s hip SoFo district, but nothing like the sweet-buttery deliciousness that can be found inside Pärlans Konfektyra. This quaint confectionery looks like it’s from another era. It makes classic, organic caramels and caramel sauce in Scandinavian flavors like lingonberry and salt licorice.
You’d expect this Medieval-themed restaurant would be a tourist trap, but we were the only Americans there. Medeltidskrogen Sjätte Tunnan is a little hidden hotspot to find in Gamla Stan. Once you find the door you have to walk all the way to the back before going downstairs to a cavernous restaurant serving a menu inspired by 1300 A.D. cuisine. A feast perfect for a Viking king.

By MATT PUSATERI
Five years ago, my brother sent me a link to a YouTube video. “This is awesome,” he texted. When I clicked it, I was baffled: it was a clip of a song-and-dance number on a football field from Fox’s series Glee (2009–15).
I didn’t get it: why he loved it, or why he was sharing it with me. After all, this was my brother — a first-born, take-charge, cut-the-bullshit engineer, and he really, really wanted me to see a clip from Glee? Maybe, I thought, he accidently pasted the wrong link?
What I didn't appreciate back then was that he was living at home with two teenage girls. He was outnumbered three-to-one by women. His view of the world, pop culture, and entertainment was distorted day after day to the point where he didn’t realize what had happened. He was a victim of Parental Stockholm Syndrome.
Classic Stockholm Syndrome refers to “a psychological phenomenon in which hostages express empathy and sympathy and have positive feelings toward their captors, sometimes to the point of defending and identifying with the captors.” It was inspired by a Stockholm bank robbery in 1973, during which hostages inside the bank gradually came to defend the criminals who took them hostage.
Parental Stockholm Syndrome is the same thing, except instead of being victims of a bank robbery held at gunpoint, it applies to parents held captive to shows like Glee as well as TV channels like Disney Junior and PBS Kids.
This is a real condition. I know, because I suffer from Parental Stockholm Syndrome.
I've actually said these things in the past year:
If I didn't live with two little girls — ages seven and five — I wouldn't be able to distinguish Periwinkle, a brave Winter fairy, from Rosetta, a plucky gardening fairy with a classic Southern accent. I also wouldn't have strong feelings about the sharp decline in the writing of Dora the Explorer (2000- ) after season two. And I never would have walked around the gym humming to myself the national anthem of Enchancia.
You can resist, but it’s inevitable. When you become a parent, you don’t just bring children into your world; they pull you into theirs.
Try as I might to get them to love things I love — DC Comics, Chicago-style pizza, Texas Hold’em, and North Carolina basketball — they want me to sit with them and enjoy the things they love: Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood (2012- ), Pinkalicious, and almost any movie about mermaids.
I might fight it, clinging to the adult world I left nearly eight years ago, struggling to maintain the illusion that I'm not captive to the passions and imaginations of two little girls. Or I can sit back, let go, and allow myself to tear up when Rapunzel is finally reunited with her parents at the top of the castle.

In 1973, there was a huge bank robbery attempt in Stockholm, Sweden. The robbers held four bank workers hostage for six days. On the sixth days, the police broke inside, trying to arrest the robbers and save the hostages but the said hostages tried to protect the robbers from the police. Later on, the hostages refused giving testimony against the robbers and they even started collecting money to defend them. Within six days of captivity, the hostages had started developing a deep sympathy for the robbers.
As a result, the incident in which captives start developing positive feelings for their captors was named Stockholm Syndrome. This intriguing and paradoxical bond between captors and captives was also found amongst prisoners of war and those being kept in concentration camps as well. But in time, it’s seen that Stockholm Syndrome is not all about literal captors and captives. For example; Stockholm Syndrome can be found between parents and children or spouses as well as in narcissistic relationships, which is the main topic of our article.
In what conditions do we see Stockholm Syndrome?
Stockholm Syndrome requires four important elements:
Judging by the first one, you might think that Stockholm Syndrome happening in a narcissistic relationship is very unlikely. You might feel like a narcissistic relationship cannot exactly be life threatening. After all, not all narcissists resort to physical violence. On the other hand, living with a narcissist can mean that your life is indeed in danger. This danger can be physical, emotional, psychological or spiritual. Besides, narcissists can throw violent temper tantrums when they can’t get something they want or when they’re losing control over someone (narcissistic rage). People on the receiving end of this rage (even if their partners have never abused them physical in the past) may find themselves fearing for their lives or well-being in general.
And the second case is about isolating the victim. Isolating the victim is a typical abusive behavior. In some cases, the victim can practically turn into a hostage due to being completely alienated from the outside world. And in some others, the victim avoids the point of views of other people when under the influence of feelings such as jealousy, paranoia and fear fueled by the narcissist. The isolated person fails to notice the abuse they’re being put through due to not being able to consult to other people, and they also feel like this small, artificial kindness shown by the abuser is all they have now so they cling to it.
Another reason is that the victim is unable to escape, or so they believe because they were convinced by the abuser. In the Stockholm robbery, it was found out that one of the hostages got a chance to escape and yet she did not. The reason to that may be the fact she believed she could not succeed, perhaps she was simply afraid of the danger this attempt might bring. In this situation called “behavioral despair”, the victim feels so hopeless that they resign to their fate. In narcissistic relationships, if the victim is financially abused as well, or if they’re in a relationship where there are children involved, they can be convinced that there’s no way out for them. And if the abused person also has a narcissistic parent, it’s quite likely for them to show signs of behavioral despair. Babies are dependent on their parents in order to survive. But when it comes to children who grow up in problematic environments where their needs are not met; the fact they feel dependent and not strong enough as well as the “small favors” granted by their abusive parents every once in a while may cause them to develop a sympathy for them.
In our last condition, in order for the Stockholm Syndrome to emerge the abuser should display a certain amount of kindness. A desperate and hopeless person who’s already in a life threatening situation and utterly at the mercy of the abuser can start trying to rationalize the situation when they’re shown some kindness by the abuser. These attempts at rationalizing the situation may start with “it’s not that bad!” and end in deeply positive feelings for the abuser in time. After a while, the abuser stops being a bad person in the eyes of the victim, they’re simply misunderstood and turned into what they are today due to certain circumstances.
At this point, the abuser clings to the exaggerated versions of the few good memories they had with the abuser and starts seeing them the way they want them to be, not the way they actually are today.
Reasons of Stockholm Syndrome
Stockholm Syndrome is a product and natural result of systematic abuse, and it’s practically a survival mechanism. People try to save themselves from dangerous situations with “fight or flight” instincts. But running away or fighting it may not always be possible. If we consider the Stockholm robbery, the hostages cannot really overpower armed robbers, and their chances of getting shot are pretty high if they try to run away. As a result, the victim experiences stress and wants to protect themselves, but that doesn’t seem possible. Also, our brains and bodies are not fit for long-term and continuous stress. Therefore, eventually people tend to focus on the “positive aspects” instinctively in an attempt to reduce the stress they’re experiencing. This is practically something that protects them from going utterly insane and it helps them cope with the trauma. People suffering from Stockholm Syndrome have faced something so traumatic that the only way to reduce it was to do this.
The first instinct of the hostages might have been to pretend like they’re on the robbers’ side in order to avoid angering them rather than “focusing on the positive”. They can try to please the abuser to avoid violence. In bilateral relationships, if one of the parties is prone to violence and sudden, aggressive outbursts; the other party may instinctively try to keep them satisfied just to avoid their wrath. But after a while, once the hope for escape has completely faded, this situation goes beyond just pretending and the victim can find themselves feeling a genuine sympathy for the abuser.
Long story short, when there’s no hope for escape and that there’s no other options (or so you think), you try to fit in and adapt to the new conditions in order to survive. Besides, once you embrace the abuser’s point of view, you’re no longer a victim. This situation makes one feel less inferior and more in control of things. As long as the danger of maintaining the relationship isn’t much higher than the risk a breakup might bring, it’s quite hard for the victim to acknowledge the situation they’re in.
All these situations serve the abuser well, because then they’ve successfully created a voluntary victim. Especially for the emotional manipulators, keeping the victim completely under their control is not enough; they want the victim to be willing as well.
Despite all this, you might still find Stockholm Syndrome illogical. You might be having trouble understanding a hostage getting attached to their captor, or a child loving their abusive parent, or a person being unable to leave their violent partner. But do not forget that people who have suffered traumatic things cannot always make reasonable choices. Traumatic incidents are exceptional conditions and desperate times call for desperate measures.
What to do in order to get rid of Stockholm Syndrome in narcissistic relationships?
Breaking the trauma bond on your own might be too difficult, so it would be wiser to get psychological help if possible. You need to make sure the person you’re consulting to has enough knowledge and experience about narcissistic personality disorder, codependency and narcissistic relationship dynamics.
You need to cut all ties with the narcissist for good and follow the “no contact rule”. In this way, you’ll be able to establish yourself a safe zone.
And in relationships, you should always focus on the big picture rather than small details. These “small favors” other people grant you may cost you much bigger things in the long run.

Captivity and manipulation are two intricate aspects of human psychology that have fascinated researchers for decades. One phenomenon that sheds light on this complex interaction is the Stockholm Syndrome. As discussions around the topic intensify, it becomes imperative to delve deeper into its causes and explore the role that Russian propaganda plays in shaping public opinion.
The Stockholm Syndrome refers to the psychological condition where hostages develop an emotional bond with their captors. Originating from a 1973 bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden, the term has increasingly been used to explain instances of individuals identifying with their perpetrators and paradoxically defending their actions.
To truly comprehend this phenomenon, it is crucial to understand the dynamics at play during periods of captivity. When individuals find themselves in situations where their freedom is severely limited, they become vulnerable to the influence of their captors. Fear, uncertainty, and isolation create an environment where the captors can exercise power and control over their prisoners.
Interestingly, these circumstances can lead to a survival strategy known as “identification with the aggressor” or the Stockholm Syndrome. Victims might unconsciously develop empathy and positivity towards their captors as a means of self-preservation. This psychological defense mechanism aims to reduce perceived threats and increase the chances of survival within the confines of captivity.
However, it is important to note that the Stockholm Syndrome is not limited to scenarios of physical captivity alone. It can also manifest in situations involving emotional manipulation and psychological control. This is where the role of Russian propaganda becomes significant.
Russian propaganda, with its sophisticated tactics, aims to manipulate public opinion and control narratives. By leveraging psychological vulnerabilities, such as the fear of the unknown and the need for security, they can shape people’s perceptions and beliefs. This can lead to individuals sympathizing with and defending actions that align with the propagated narrative, despite their better judgment.
Exploring the complexities of captivity and manipulation, especially in the context of the Stockholm Syndrome and Russian propaganda, highlights the profound impact that external influences can have on the human psyche. By understanding these dynamics, we can develop greater awareness and critical thinking skills to navigate the intricate world of information warfare.
The Stockholm Syndrome serves as a harrowing testament to why societies need to punish criminals to deter crimes. Its intersection with Russian propaganda highlights the need for vigilance in assessing information sources and maintaining a healthy skepticism in an increasingly interconnected world. Only by questioning and seeking the truth can we break free from the invisible chains of manipulation.
Stockholm Syndrome is a psychological response observed in captive situations, where the individual begins to closely identify with their captors and even starts to sympathize with their agenda and demands. It is a complex phenomenon that has been studied and analyzed in various psychological research.
The term “Stockholm Syndrome” was coined after a notorious bank robbery and hostage situation that took place in Stockholm, Sweden in 1973. During this six-day ordeal, the hostages developed a strong bond and emotional attachment to their captors, which baffled both the authorities and the public. This case became the unprecedented reference point for understanding the psychological dynamics of captor-captive relationships.
According to Britannica, the Stockholm Syndrome is a psychological response that occurs when hostages or abuse victims develop an emotional connection with their captors or abusers. This phenomenon is named after a bank robbery that took place in Stockholm, Sweden in 1973, where the hostages ultimately expressed sympathy and loyalty towards their captors.
The syndrome is thought to be a survival mechanism that kicks in when a person feels powerless and threatened, causing them to form an attachment to their perpetrators. In these situations, the victim’s survival instincts kick in, and they begin to identify with their captors, often developing positive feelings toward them. This may be due to the captors intermittently showing kindness or providing the hostages with small acts of compassion during their confinement.
This emotional connection can be perplexing to outsiders who fail to understand the intricate dynamics at play. From an outsider’s perspective, it may seem illogical for the victims to develop positive feelings towards their captors. However, it is important to remember that these individuals are enduring a traumatic experience that distorts their perception of reality.
The Stockholm Syndrome is not limited to physical captivity alone. It can also manifest in situations of emotional manipulation and psychological control. In these cases, the victims may find themselves trapped in toxic relationships or cult-like environments where their thoughts and emotions are manipulated to serve the interests of the abuser.
In such instances, the victims’ identities become intertwined with their captors, leading to a loss of personal agency and an overwhelming sense of dependency. Breaking free from this psychological entanglement can be incredibly challenging, as the victims may fear retribution or believe that they are incapable of surviving without their captors’ support.
One of the factors that can contribute to the development of Stockholm Syndrome is the captor’s ability to instill a sense of fear and helplessness in the victims. By controlling their access to basic needs such as food, water, and sleep, the captors can create a cycle of reward and punishment, fostering a state of emotional dependency. This dependence, coupled with intermittent acts of kindness or compassion, further deepens the victims’ connection to their captors.
Furthermore, the victims may experience cognitive dissonance, a psychological phenomenon where conflicting beliefs and emotions create a state of mental discomfort. To reduce this discomfort, the victims may reinterpret the captors’ actions in a positive light, creating a narrative that justifies their bond with their captors. This cognitive restructuring allows them to maintain a sense of coherence in their worldview, despite the abusive circumstances they find themselves in.
The intersection between the Stockholm Syndrome and Russian propaganda unveils another layer of complexity. Russian propaganda, utilizing sophisticated manipulation techniques, aims to shape public opinion and control narratives. By exploiting psychological vulnerabilities, such as the fear of the unknown and the desire for security, they can sway individuals’ perceptions and evoke emotional responses.
In this context, victims of psychological manipulation may exhibit signs of the Stockholm Syndrome by defending and sympathizing with the propagated narrative, even if it contradicts their original beliefs or goes against their best interests. This underscores the immense power of psychological manipulation in shaping individuals’ thoughts and behaviors, turning them into unwitting prisoners of false ideologies.
To combat the toxic influence of propaganda and break free from the grip of manipulation, it is crucial to foster critical thinking skills and media literacy. Developing the ability to analyze information objectively, question sources, and consider multiple perspectives can help individuals resist the allure of manipulative tactics.
By shining a light on the intertwined concepts of captivity, manipulation, and the Stockholm Syndrome, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex mechanisms at play within the human psyche. It is through this understanding that we can strive to create a society that values freedom, autonomy, and the pursuit of truth, free from the shackles of psychological captivity.
Note: The term “Stockholm Syndrome” is used to describe a specific psychological response and should not be used loosely or trivialized.
One of the most infamous examples of Stockholm Syndrome is the case involving Patty Hearst, a newspaper heiress who was kidnapped in 1974 by the radical group Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA). Initially terrified and coerced, Hearst eventually joined the group and participated in their criminal activities. This case generated significant media attention and captivated the public’s interest, sparking widespread discussions about the psychological mechanisms underlying Stockholm Syndrome.
The study of Stockholm Syndrome has provided tragic insights into the complexities of human behavior and the power of psychological manipulation. Researchers have attempted to unravel the underlying factors that contribute to the development of this phenomenon. Some proposed explanations include the captives’ perception of kindness from their captors, trauma bonding, and a survival instinct that leads the captives to adapt to their circumstances.
While Stockholm Syndrome remains an obscure crime, its impact on the understanding of human psychology cannot be understated. By analyzing and comprehending the intricacies of such situations, psychologists and researchers hope to shed light on the various psychological and emotional processes that individuals may experience when faced with captivity and coercion.
It is crucial to note that each case of Stockholm Syndrome is unique, and individuals’ responses can vary significantly. The understanding and treatment of this phenomenon remain areas of ongoing research, aiming to provide support and guidance to individuals who have experienced such traumatic situations.
The study of Stockholm Syndrome has also highlighted the role of empathy and the human need for connection in captive situations. In some cases, victims may develop a sense of empathy towards their captors, seeing them as complex individuals rather than solely as perpetrators. This empathy can create a bond that reinforces the captive’s identification with the aggressor.
Furthermore, the Stockholm Syndrome can have long-lasting effects on the psychological well-being of the victims. Even after their physical captivity ends, they may continue to struggle with conflicting emotions and a sense of loyalty towards their captors. Overcoming these psychological challenges requires a supportive environment where victims can receive appropriate therapy and support to reintegrate into society.
Cultural and societal factors also play a significant role in shaping the dynamics of the Stockholm Syndrome. The cultural norms and values of a society can influence individuals’ responses to captivity and manipulation. For example, in societies that prioritize authority and obedience, victims may be more likely to develop the Stockholm Syndrome as a means of survival.
The media also has a responsibility in portraying and discussing the Stockholm Syndrome phenomenon accurately and sensitively. Misrepresentation and sensationalization can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misunderstandings about the condition. Therefore, it is crucial for media outlets to approach the topic with empathy, ensuring that victims’ experiences are heard and understood.
It is important to remember that Stockholm Syndrome is a complex psychological phenomenon that arises in captive situations, where victims develop an emotional bond with their captors. This response stems from a survival instinct and the psychological mechanisms of identification with the aggressor. It is crucial to continue studying and understanding the Stockholm Syndrome to provide support and guidance to individuals who have experienced such traumatic situations. By doing so, we can strive to create a society that values compassion, empathy, and freedom from manipulation.
A study conducted by Douglas Wilbur, a visiting scholar in the UTSA Department of Communication, sheds light on an important issue regarding the influence of Russian propaganda on popular alternative media sites. Wilbur’s research, which involved analyzing over 600 articles, provides valuable insights into the correlation between Sputnik, Russia’s state-owned media, and these alternative media platforms that are believed to present favorable coverage of Russia and its allies in the United States.
The study, “Propaganda or Not: Examining the Claims of Extensive Russian Information Operations within the United States,” provides a comprehensive content analysis of articles published in four websites that were labeled by Prop or Not as working on behalf of the Russian government. While Prop or Not faced criticism from major U.S. mainstream media for its methodology in labeling 200 sites as vehicles of propaganda, the research conducted by Wilbur demonstrates the strong credibility of the claims made by Prop or Not regarding Russian interference.
In 2017, Prop or Not alleged that Russia was manipulating U.S. public opinion through online propaganda, but their failure to provide compelling evidence left doubts lingering in the air. However, Wilbur’s research has now validated this claim, shedding light on the extent of Russian interference and its impact on U.S. public opinion. The study delves into the manipulation tactics employed by these targeted websites and explores the strategies used to influence the American narrative.
One of the key findings of Wilbur’s study is the strong, positive correlation between Sputnik and sites like Zero Hedge, a Wall Street-focused website. The analysis suggests that these alternative media outlets echo Russian propaganda, aligning with the claims made by organizations like Prop or Not. This raises concerns about covert manipulation of the U.S. news agenda, posing a potential threat to national security.
Wilbur researched articles published on several websites: Zero Hedge, New Cold War, Global Research, and The Daily Sheeple. The outlets were chosen using a random number approach. Published articles on those sites between January 2019 and July 2020 were then selected for examination if they contained the following key terms: Russia, Syria, Ukraine, Iran, Venezuela, and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). These terms were chosen because they highlight important foreign policy issues for the Russian government. Once the articles were selected, their tonality was rated on a positive or negative scale according to how the news stories described Russia and its allies versus the U.S. and its partners.
Wilbur’s analysis offers a valuable contribution to the ongoing debate surrounding the role of Russian information operations in the United States. By meticulously examining the content of these websites, the study provides insights into the methods employed by Russian actors to shape public discourse and sow discord among the American population.
This research serves as a call to action for organizations and individuals alike, highlighting the importance of critically evaluating the sources and information we encounter online. It underscores the need for improved media literacy and the development of strategies to combat disinformation campaigns that seek to undermine democracy and public trust.
In essence, the study conducted by Wilbur offers compelling evidence to support the claims made by Prop or Not regarding Russian interference in the United States. It provides a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and the general public, deepening our understanding of the evolving challenges posed by digital propaganda and the imperative to safeguard the integrity of information in the digital age.
In an era where information is easily accessible and influences public opinion, it becomes crucial for the U.S. media to be aware of and address these propaganda efforts. As Russia creates and utilizes propaganda as a weapon, it is vital for the U.S. media to have effective countermeasures in place, ensuring that accurate and unbiased information prevails.
By highlighting this issue, Wilbur’s research underscores the importance of media literacy and critical thinking. It reminds us that staying informed and discerning in the face of propaganda is integral to safeguarding the integrity of the news and protecting national interests.
Awareness of the existence and potential impact of propaganda is the first step in combating its influence. The findings of this study emphasize the need for continued research, collaboration, and awareness among media professionals, policymakers, and the general public, as they strive to ensure a vibrant and trustworthy news landscape that upholds democratic values.
Understanding the parallels between Stockholm Syndrome and Russian disinformation and propaganda sheds light on how psychological manipulation can shape public opinion and influence individuals’ beliefs. By drawing this comparison, we can gain insight into the mechanisms at play in both situations, revealing the power of manipulation in shaping individuals’ thoughts and behaviors.
Both Stockholm Syndrome and Russian propaganda involve psychological manipulation and the distortion of reality. In cases of Stockholm Syndrome, captives develop an emotional bond with their captors, defending and identifying with them despite the harm they may have suffered. Similarly, Russian propaganda aims to manipulate public opinion through sophisticated tactics, distorting information and narratives to align with their interests.
In both scenarios, fear and uncertainty play a significant role. In captivity situations, victims experience a sense of powerlessness and dependence on their captors, which can lead to the development of Stockholm Syndrome. Similarly, Russian propaganda preys on individuals’ fears and insecurities, manipulating them through emotionally charged content designed to evoke strong reactions.
Another common factor between the two is the psychological defense mechanism of cognitive restructuring. In the case of Stockholm Syndrome, captives may reinterpret their captors’ actions in a positive light, creating a narrative that justifies their bond. Similarly, victims of propaganda may engage in cognitive dissonance, modifying their beliefs to align with the propagated narrative, despite contradictory evidence.
The role of empathy, albeit in different contexts, is also crucial. In Stockholm Syndrome, victims may develop empathy towards their captors, seeing them as complex individuals rather than solely as perpetrators. In the case of Russian propaganda, individuals may sympathize with the propagated narrative and defend actions that align with it, due to the emotional appeal and manipulation employed.
By comparing Stockholm Syndrome with Russian disinformation and propaganda, we can recognize the underlying psychological mechanisms and vulnerabilities that contribute to individuals’ susceptibility to manipulation. This understanding serves as a reminder of the importance of critical thinking, media literacy, and the ability to question and analyze information from diverse perspectives.
Ultimately, by raising awareness of the tactics used in psychological manipulation, individuals can develop resilience against manipulation and make informed decisions based on reliable information. This empowers individuals to navigate the complex landscape of information warfare and mitigate the impact of psychological captivity induced by manipulation and propaganda.

I take the blue line, change to the green one in T-Centralen, and go down in Slussen. I glance through the windows of the galleries while walking through Hornsgatan. I was planning to watch the sunset from the viewpoint at Skinnarviksparken but the weather is not on my side and by the time I get there, dark clouds fill the horizon. I sit down on a bench to watch the snowflakes descend.
At five twenty, I go down and walk along the empty sidewalk next to the water. At some point, it stops snowing and I decide to continue my stroll to Gamla Stan, the old city in the center of Stockholm. The view of the Kungsholmen shore is gorgeous. It has been about a year and a half since the last time I passed through here. One gets too caught up in the routine and life goes by fast.
I continue walking to Rådhuset to take the blue line back home. By the time I am halfway, the dense dark clouds completely erase the lights of the Södermalm district. I can barely see the tower of the Stadhuset next to me. A blizzard covers the city on a white veil. My footprints don’t last more than a few seconds and I stop several times to clean the ice from my glasses.
I finally make it to the blue line and I am back in the warmth of my room a few minutes later. The snowstorm continues outside as if it was to last forever. I sit down in front of my desk and find refuge in the pages of my journal.
I like to write. I have been compiling journals for fifteen years. I write to put my thoughts into words and bring structure and clarity to my mind. I write to immortalize my memories, my beliefs, my stories. We are storytellers after all. We need stories to communicate, to give meaning to the world, and to make sense of our existence.
I leaf through the soft ivory paper of my journal and realize how the last months have been embedded into just a few pages. In contrast, when I go further back to my time as a traveler, several pages are needed to capture a single day of wander: the things I do, the places I visit, the colorful streets, and the different tastes and aromas of a new city, and the conversations I have with the people I meet. Paragraphs pile up and my hand write deteriorates as I rush to capture these experiences before they are altered or, even worse, forgotten by my fragile memory.
I look through the window as the ephemeral snow particles dance to the sound of the wind. I don’t want my days to go by helpless, at the mercy of the wind of life. I fear the moment I wake up and realize that decades have passed and I am still the same person.
I think about Memoirs of Hadrian, a novel by the Belgian writer Margarita Yourcenar. On his deathbed, Hadrian writes a letter to Marcus Aurelius, his future successor. The text recounts the wisdom the Roman Emperor has accumulated throughout different episodes of his life. Particularly, Hadrian declares that there are three ways to learn about human existence: through our own experience, through the experiences of others, and through books.
As a travel enthusiast, I cannot help but relate Margarita’s words to traveling.
By traveling, we leave behind our comfort and dive into the unknown. We expose ourselves to different environments and diverge from our beliefs, values, and prejudices. By traveling, we interact with the people we meet. We engage in conversations and dive into their stories. We learn to see the world through their eyes and add their experience to our own. By reading, we travel to different narratives. We learn from the stories of those who lived in distant times. We are entrusted with their stories to make them our own.
And yet all these perspectives remain incomplete. We see the world from the narrow lenses created by the conditioning our environment has provided. Even books carry the prejudices of the pen. Nevertheless, a rich life is born out of the combination of these incomplete stories.
Life is about feeding our stories through new experiences, rich conversations, and good books that change our narratives. To lead a life that cannot be reduced to just a few pages.

Home to the famous pop band ABBA and furniture giant IKEA, Stockholm is the second most visited Nordic country. Built across fourteen islands, the city is known as Europe’s first “green” capital and boasts the longest life expectancy on the continent. “Fika”, the afternoon tradition of indulging in a coffee and pastry break, might also be contributing to the high life expectancy. Be sure to participate in this ritual during your time in Sweden.
This guide outlines a possible itinerary for a long weekend in the city. Below is a quick overview of the proposal:
Most US phone companies do not enable free European service. Check with your phone company before leaving to confirm your plan’s allowance.
Debit/Credit Cards are widely accepted everywhere. I never used cash. No need to take out any Swedish kronor (SEK), but if you feel so inclined, visit your local bank before you leave to get the best conversion rates.
It is important to note that Sweden (along with all of the Nordic countries) is an expensive country to visit, so plan to spend more here than other places in mainland Europe.
Stockholm experiences mild annual temperatures, with lows in the winter around 30 degrees Fahrenheit and highs in summer around 70 degrees. Its sunlight hours, however, are more interesting. During the winter, the sun rises around 9am and sets just after 3pm, making it a long, dark span of months. The summer is drastically (and thankfully) different, with the city averaging around nineteen hours of sunlight per day. Unless you plan to visit up north for winter activities, visit Stockholm from May through September for ideal temperatures and light.
The city offers numerous hotel, Airbnb, and hostel accommodations based on price. STF af Chapman & Skeppsholmen Hostel is a budget friendly, clean hostel on a quieter island conveniently in between Gamla Stan and Djurgården (the museum island, as I affectionately call it). Instead of walking (which is still very convenient), take the Skeppsholmen ferry that leaves every twenty minutes to visit main points of interest.
Gamla Stan, the old town section of the city, is another great area to stay in. The Collector’s Lady Hamilton Hotel in this neighborhood is a Victorian-style hotel with modern updates. In addition, Hotel Tegnerlunden is an affordable option in the Norrmalm District, a busy downtown neighborhood home to many iconic landmarks.
To get from the Arlanda Airport to downtown (near Gamla Stan), skip Uber and take the Arlanda Express. Purchase a ticket at the airport for $27 USD one way and arrive at the Stockholm City stop within twenty minutes. The ride includes WiFi and clean bathrooms. A walk to Gamla Stan from there takes another ten minutes.
Once in the city, utilize the SL ferries for an easy and quick system that locals and tourists alike enjoy. Purchase a ticket at every ferry station for less than $2 USD one way. Walking between each island via bridges tends to take time, so this is a better option, especially when going from Gamla Stan to Djurgården.
We got lazy and ended up Ubering to further neighborhoods like Sodermalm from our hostel (with prices averaging that of mainstream US cities). However, we wish we had taken advantage of the metro system. Clean and accessible, it holds the title of the “world’s longest art gallery” so I’m kicking myself for skipping it.
Start your day with fresh squeezed orange juice and a deliciously lite breakfast at Café Schweizer in old town Gamla Stan. This neighborhood is one of the best preserved historic districts in Europe, so take your time sipping coffee while wandering the cobblestone streets in the early morning.
Next, experience a free walking tour to better understand the history of Gamla Stan. The guide will point out key points of interest such as the Stockholm Royal Palace, Stora Nygatan (a lively street with music), and the Swedish Parliament where environmental activist Greta Thunberg began her global protests. If time permits post-tour, stop by Tasty America for a good laugh at a large collection of the over-processed foods popular in the United States. This grocery store was both intriguing and embarrassing, as it really outlines the absurdity of American food culture.
For lunch, pop over to Restaurant Tradition to taste traditional Swedish and Nordic fare. The Hairy Pig, a pub, is another great option for good food and beer. Try the Swedish Meatballs — you won’t regret it. If not quite hungry yet, take the ferry from Gamla Stan to Djurgården and head straight to one of the most popular museums on the island, the Vasa Museum.
At only $18 USD/adult, this is arguably one of the coolest museums I’ve ever been to. Vasa displays a well preserved warship from 1628 that sank twenty minutes into its maiden voyage, drowning all but thirty people out of its 300 passengers. It took 333 years for the Swedes to retrieve the ship from the bottom of the harbor. Visitors can now view the ship from four different stories, along with numerous artifacts and skeletons from the wreckage. The experience typically takes one hour. Do not miss this.
Stockholm has numerous other museums scattered throughout Djurgården and the city in general that you could hit after Vasa. The Viking Museum showcases 9th century Viking ships and artifacts along with a Disneyworld-like Viking ride. The ABBA Museum, a well marketed but somewhat superficial excursion, outlines the rise and success of the famous band. The Nobel Prize Museum highlights key Nobel prizes and laureates. The one museum I would NOT recommend, however, is the Skansen Museum. Although it is the world’s oldest open air museum and is supposed to showcase Sweden pre-industrial era, it completely lacks signage and guides to teach and clarify what you’re looking at. Skip this.
If you plan on visiting several museums, consider purchasing the All-Inclusive Stockholm Pass which will give you discounts and ‘free’ access to many city landmarks and galleries.
End the evening with dinner at Restaurang Kryp In back in Gamla Stan for more traditional Swedish fare and a great espresso martini. Then, head to Winstrom’s Pub or O’Connell’s Irish Pub for drinks and live music.
Stockholm is home to a massive archipelago with over 24,000 islands. These island chains create plenty of options for fun day trips. Stora Fjäderholmarna, Grinda, and Vaxholm are all small islands within a 90 minute boat ride from the main city center.
I had a really hard time determining which island to visit. Stora Fjäderholmarna is charming and only thirty minutes by boat, but does not allow one to truly experience life deep in the archipelago. Grinda takes approximately 90 minutes and has gorgeous views with many adventure sports to take part in, including kayaking and swimming. I’m a bit regretful that we didn’t stop here. The island we did select, however, was Vaxholm and I am both happy and disappointed in our choice.
Considered the capital of the archipelago, Vaxholm is known for idyllic roads and quaint fisherman cottages. To get there, choose from one of two main ferries. The cheapest option utilizes the public ferry, Waxholmsbolaget. Located next to the Grand Hotel and operating year round, the ferry does not allow pre-purchasing tickets so simply purchase on arrival. The trip lasts an hour or so.
The second option, and the one we selected, involves the Cinderella ferry and a history tour. With a restaurant, bar, and guided cruise, this ferry is a bit nicer and lasts approximately 90 minutes each way. It leaves from a different location (Strandvägen berth no 14) and only runs from May through September. If planning to visit Vaxholm and appreciate history, choose this option.
One can also drive or bus to the town as there is a small bridge connecting it to the mainland — but you’d be remiss to skip exploring the archipelago via water.
On land, explore the little town for an hour or two with its boutiques and waterfront parks, especially Johannesbergsparken. When ready for food, indulge in a tasty burger on the docks at Winbergs Kök & Bar or down the road at Vaxholms Hembygdsgårds Café. The latter was closed when we visited, but we stopped by to sit on the picnic tables and enjoy the view. I would have loved to eat here — the location was idyllic and the menu looked delicious.
If you have time, take a quick water taxi to the Vaxholm Fortress Museum, a site that was once the Citadel for Swedish defense in the 19th century.
My day trip to Vaxholm was great, though I wonder what it would have been like to explore a different island with perhaps more to do. The tour allowed for four or five hours on the island, which was too much for what the island offered for activities. I would have preferred to take the Cinderella ferry there for the history and the public ferry home so we could have returned faster and on our own time.
Alternatively, discover additional island tours through Get Your Guide or simply get out on the water with a RIB tour.
Once back in Stockholm, spend the rest of the evening exploring Norrmalm, a modernized downtown neighborhood next to Gamla Stan. Be sure to walk through Kungsträdgården, the city’s oldest park, and Hötorgshallen, a local food market. Grab drinks at the Lydmar Hotel outdoor pop up bar, then dine alongside locals at Restaurant 1889 Fast Fine Pizza. Known for its ritzy decor yet laid back atmosphere, this restaurant simplifies ordering with a QR barcode and no true waitstaff.
Spend the last day in Stockholm choosing from a handful of excursions:
Regardless of what you decide, enjoy the afternoon/evening in Sodermalm, the “Brooklyn” of Stockholm. Visit Söderhallarna, a modern shopping hall with gourmet food stalls and restaurants, or try Mosebacketerrassen, a beer hall with gorgeous views of Stockholm’s skyline. Skinnarviksparken, a park with hills overlooking the city, is another great place for views and people watching. For a casual dinner, head to gastro-pub Honey Honey. We visited during the Eurovision competition and had a great time watching countries compete while chowing down on pork schnitzel and Swedish meatballs with lingonberry sauce. Later, stop by Häktet for lively drinks with a younger crowd.
After four nights in Stockholm, my next stop was Helsinki, Finland. I purchased a one way flight for $200 USD that was quick and easy. However, I wish I had taken the overnight ferry with either Viking Line or Tallink Silja that would have allowed me to see more of the archipelago and saved the cost of a hotel for a night.

This is not your romantic cruise! But a beer-soaked “The Love Boat” episode ala Viking style version with hard liquor and long parties.
We decided one weekend to celebrate family birthdays on the ferry trip from Helsinki-Åland-Stockholm. Two good, highly competitive lines, Viking Line and Tallink Silja, the Tallink Silja Viking Line connects Sweden’s capital with Finlands.
We took the Silja Line Promenade for 1–4 persons plus breakfast and grande buffets for each person during the trip. The promenade room is located in the middle and offers a view of the boat’s hallway.
In my honest opinion, Tallink Silja is more upscale and Viking Line is the less expensive one but also a popular one. The Helsinki to Stockholm cruise or vice-versa has a 2-nights and 3-day cruise and is one of the popular ferry trips.
For Finnish people, having a ferry ride from Helsinki to Stockholm is just as common as having a train ride between cities. One of the most popular routes between Sweden and Finland is the Stockholm-Helsinki ferry.

Because it strikes the chord between kidnapper and captor for meeting the needs.
The primal pangs of hunger are often the driving force of human bonds. Hunger for us, is more than growling stomach.
Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs explains that a humans are motivated by five basic hungers.
a) Physiological hunger for air, water, food, shelter, and sleep.
b)Security hunger for health, property, employment.
c) Connection hunger for family, love, intimacy, friendship.
d)Psychological hunger for esteem, respect.
e) Metaphysical hunger for self actualization.
Being the head of the community vocational program designed for providing employment opportunities to girls, I’ve come across some baffling cases of marriages. No matter what the degree of abuse, these women never fail to patronize their husbands.
After listening to few girls, I decided to take an inventory to write and see that NEEDS can be irrational and self-deprecating at times.
I talked to more than 10 women from abusive marriages apparently. And to my utter shock they were point blanc unwilling to walk out of the marriage because they thought that however barbaric, they were protected from outer terror-fueled world.
Besides safety, they had one more thing in common – strong attachment.
Just like the victims of Stockholm syndrome. As they fell for their captors and develop a soft bond of connection with them. Because mostly the captors are the one’s who fulfill their basic needs like food and medicine and often physical intimacy when the require to process the trauma of being hijacked or kidnapped.
This is not very common, to fall in love for your kidnapper or captor but happens with people with low self esteem and history of abuse.
When I talked to these women, they were rude and said – better worship one man than be a raw piece of meat to wolves out there.
One of the girl who’s hardly 25 years, told me that her husband after thrashing her hard, treats her with sex and restaurant food. After beating the shit out of her when she is in pain, he doesn’t allows her to cook food. Even takes her to the doctor for treating all the bloody bruises. In this situation when she is being treated so well, she thinks of him as an emergency God. Especially when there is no support from the family.
Psychologists says that terror-bonding and feeling empathy rather than rage towards your captor is the classic example of Stockholm Syndrome. It can also develop between abusive parents and children. Where the child may feel protective toward the parent and try mending the ways to keep the parents happy, unsuccessfully.
When I tried to educate these girls on the psychology of the syndrome, they were reluctant to understand.
As they feel that bonding with their captors( read husbands) after years of intimacy is their survival strategy and looking for normality within the framework of chaos and distress.
What’s wrong in choosing bad when you have the worst? Saying this one of the girl slaps her butt and walks off to stich a new pattern of dress she’s learning under the program.
Psychological abuse is much deeper than we can imagine. It becomes the way of life when the victims have never seen the other side.
Listening to some of the girls – and coming from non-psychological background – there were times I was compelled to see their POVs.
No financial independence and emotional part of the brains shackled tightly.
I believe in rewriting these narratives women needs exposure, life skills, and independence of all nature.
Education on self-esteem, respect. But on top of all education on self-discovery, non-reliance and then finances.

The first museum I visited in Stockholm (I am a museum enthusiast) is the Nordiska Museum, also known as the Nordic Museum, located in Djurgården, an island in central Stockholm. This museum mainly displays the traditions and lifestyle of Scandinavians from the 16th century. It has over one and a half million pieces! The exterior of the museum is fascinating. It was designed in the Dutch-Danish Renaissance style by Isak Gustaf Clason. Founded in the late 19th century by Artur Hazelius, a Swedish scholar and museum director, who also founded the Skansen open-air museum in Stockholm.
💰Free admission with Go City Pass
Regular admission: SEK 170 by 2024 and free admission for children
Opening Time: Almost open every day, even on Christmas from 10:00–17:00
Once you enter the museum, get your tickets with your Go City Pass and you will see an enormous sculpture of King Gustav Vasa. Gustav Vasa (born Gustav Eriksson of the Vasa noble family, also called Gustav I) was King of Sweden from 1523 to 1560 and the founding father of Sweden. He brought Protestantism to Sweden and outmaneuvered the power of the Catholic Church. Every year on the 6th of June, Gustav’s name day, is celebrated as the Swedish national day to honor the electron of King Gustav Vasa.
Besides the sculpture, there are multiple exhibitions you can explore in the museum including:
The Arctic (Arctic Traces: Nature and Culture in Motion), exhibits the tools used in the Arctic and how people have lived in the Arctic through the years. It also brings up the topic of climate change and global warming. Notably, this exhibition is based on 3 years of research under Lotten Gustafsson Reinius, a visiting professor at Stockholm University.
On the right side of the lobby, you can see another exhibition: Strinderg vs. Youssef. It was created by an artist Daniel Youssef with inspiration from August Strindbuerg’s autobiographical novel Inferno. Inferno was written in French from 1896 to 1897. The book talks a lot about Strindberg’s obsession, e.g. occultism, alchemy, and shows signs of paranoia. The story behind the exhibition is interesting, but I am not going to lie, I indeed find the exhibition confusing and hard to interpret the display.
Worth mentioning that there are audio guides available in multiple languages for free!
Another exhibition is called British — Ever So Nordic. It displays the Nordic fashion, clothes style, and lifestyle that was influenced by Britain. One exhibition that I found quite interesting is the “Traditions” located on Level 3. The exhibition constructs the scenes and details of how Nordics celebrate Midsummer, Christmas, and Easter, and the history behind it. Next to this exhibition is the “Table Settings”. Basically, this exhibition shows the interiors and the table setting from the 16th century to circa 1950, including coffee and tea parties, tables for aperitifs, aquavit, and banquets. (You can also see a “Swan” in the exhibition).
The last exhibition that I went to was on Level 2 (Lobby) right next to the Children’s Playhouse. It demonstrates the setting of a traditional Nordic family and most of the displays there are interactive. However, I did not see any description on the official website, but it is worth taking a look!
Before leaving the museum, go to the museum shop and see if there is anything that you want to get as a souvenir and maybe have a real Swedish “fika” in the cafe on level 2.
Recommendation: 🌟🌟🌟/ 5
A must for those who love Nordic history!

24–25 Sep remembered on 8 Oct
Writing memories is like racing with time. From the Hong Kong 18 days ago, to the Bangkok 16 days ago, to the Copenhagen 13 days ago, theoretically, I am catching up with time, but as I caught up, I found remembering what happened harder and harder. Shouldn’t it be another way around? Or just the memories of Skövde, as a new place, are replacing the old ones faster? Or simply, I am tired of remembering?
“I arrived at Stockholm airport at about 0:30am, in the dark of the new moon, on the coldest day of the year. The Swedish officials had been notified of my arrival, and I had no travel documents on me. I did not use the Japanese passport to avoid committing the offence of forgery and waited for all the other travellers to clear customs before I went to the officer, telling them that I had no documents. A young officer guided me to his office to talk, and I cleared customs in about ten minutes. At the airport, Mrs. Gawell and seven or eight other members who were in charge of my case at Amnesty International came to pick me up. The temperature was -25 degrees Celsius, and they brought a jumper, long boots, gloves, a scarf, and a leather hat for me. They probably thought that I came from the subtropics, that I must have been wearing only a flimsy southern jacket. They insisted that I wear all of these things on the spot. I am sure that I must looked ridiculous. The police simply took my name and then asked me to return the next day back to the airport to complete the formalities. I felt that I was truly in another world.” — “A Perfect Escape” by Peng Ming-Min
Here we arrived at a city without memories.
I had never been to Stockholm. This was my first time. I arrived at the Arlanda Airport in the evening. Since I was travelling from Copenhagen, I did not need to go through the border control. The public transportation was easy. I managed to reach the hotel smoothly.
The name of the hotel was Hotel Expo. It was slightly out of the city centre, around 30 minutes by public transportation. However, for someone who used to live in London, anywhere that can reach the centre within 30 minutes, is included in the concept of centre and considered convenient. In conclusion, I love the hotel, and I would recommend it to anyone who’s visiting, especially if you’re on a budget. It’s right in front of a commuter’s train station, Älvsjö. (Like you can literally see the hotel as you leave the station.) I spent 1250 SEK for 3 nights. It was the friendliest price I found. What I booked was a single room with shared toilets. The room was small but with everything one would need, including a clean towel and extra movable spaces (unlike the room F and I stayed in Hong Kong). The toilets were clean and close to the room. My favourite part was the breakfast, which was included in the price. And not only it was included, it was fancy, with everything one could expect from a four-star hotel breakfast buffet — various cold cuts, cheese, breads, coffee, juice, milk, yoghourt, eggs, fruits, oatmeals, cereals, jams…etc., I can continue listing. And what was crazier was that the gym on the ground floor was also included, that as a resident of the hotel, I could use it for free. Free laundry was also available. The surrounding environment was not massively exciting but convenient, with a huge supermarket, Co-op (I almost tried with my old British membership, wondering if it worked.), along with Subway, restaurants, bars, Chinese food…etc.
The checking process was slightly odd. The man behind the counter checked me in, but said I hadn’t paid for the room. I checked the booking record, and made sure that I had. And then he said, “Oh, then don’t worry about it, I will check it again tomorrow.” That was it. He didn’t come back to me afterwards.
After my joyous breakfast the next morning, I started visiting my long list of places related to Peng or Hedin.
My first stop was Norr Mälarstrand 66. The seemingly ordinary address was where Sven Hedin used to live. The walls of the entryway were covered with murals of a world map, as well as a Chinese-style temple to honour him. I was dying to go in, so after taking some photos from the glass door outside, I decided to sit on the staircases, hoping to bump into someone leaving or entering. After 15 minutes or so, I realised that the day was not my lucky day, so I moved on to what was next on my list, Adolf Fredriks kyrkogård, where Hedin was buried, with a 30-minute walk from where he used to live.
On my way there, I realised that I was in need of a toilet. This might be something to confess — I believe that I had this “pink bubble” filter when speaking of Scandinavia. I was imagining public toilets everywhere, clean and free, public Wifi, water cooler, power outlets, free at every corner. However, a free public toilet seemed to be harder to find than I expected. It was almost 11:00am. It took me a while until I found one, an isolated one on the street. It was free, so, hurray! However, it was not as clean and well-maintained as I expected. But well, that was on me. I am the one who chose to wear the pink goggles, and to be honest, comparing it with the ones in London or Paris, it was a tiny heaven on the street. I happily finished what I needed to do, and moved on with my day.
When I arrived at the Adolf Fredriks kyrkogård, it was around 11:15am. I realised that the church was closed. (It was closed between 11:00am — 11:45am daily.) Luckily, the garden, where the cemetery is, was opened. It was a small yard, with, I would say, a bit more than 100 tombstones as far as I could see, which means, it shouldn’t be difficult for me to find the one of Sven Hedin, especially him being a famous figure. I started to stroll around, one side at a time, one roll at a time, carefully trying to locate his name. Unexpectedly, I failed. I kept wondering why and how, thinking probably Hedin did not want me to find him, that probably he did not not approve of my project, or my criticism towards the concept of explorers and what he did.
Do you remember my internet drama? So, once I arrived in Stockholm, I changed my sim card from the British one to the Taiwanese one, and bought some credit so I can have internet access here in Europe. It was slightly more expensive than usual, so I decided that I was not going to use it unless it’s necessary.
After almost half an hour of trying to locate Hedin, I gave up. I sat down on a bench, turned on the internet on my phone, googling the images of the tombstone of Sven Hedin. From using the housing in the background as a clue, I found it. Turned out that it was covered by a van, the only car parked inside the cemetery. I stood in front of him, explaining the project, and apologising, hoping to have his approval. I told him that I am aware that I am not in any position to judge, and I know it was a different time. The project is not about him, not personally at least. Through talking to him, I started to ask myself why I wanted to do this project. What is it for? I suddenly realised that in a way, migration can be a privilege, even for the ones who were forced to. Peng had to escape, otherwise he would have been killed or imprisoned, but again, how many activists at the time couldn’t, ended up in jails or some random cemeteries in Liu Zhang Li. Refugees had to leave, but again, we all know that more of them didn’t make it. So, it’s a privilege, but it doesn’t mean it’s not hard. It doesn’t mean living in a foreign place, learning a new language, facing unfamiliar environments is not something hard. If I can offer something, some sharing, some talks, so we can feel a little bit better, with our lives, with our choices, probably the whole thing would be worth it? That there could be some meanings in all these?
After talking to him, I looked at my phone, it was 11:45am. The church would be opened by now. I suddenly realised, probably he did it on purpose. If I found his tombstone easily at 11:15am, would I have the patience to sit for 30 minutes to wait for the church to open? I might have decided to move on with my day. Feeling grateful at the coincidence, I walked into the church. It was beautiful. I was the only visitor in the church, however, someone started to play the organ. Not sure if it was a regular performance, or the person was practising, it was magnetising either way. I found a bronze plaque dedicated to Sven Hedin on the wall. I guess probably that was the reason he invited me to come in. I also found a LGBTQIA+ friendly rainbow pin at the souvenir store. How sweet. I guess that would fit in the pink bubble goggle that I was wearing. After a short stay, I moved on to my next spot — Historiska Museet.
I actually can’t remember why I put Historiska Museet on my list. I guess probably at some point I read something saying that part of Hedin’s collection was in the museum. When I arrived, I noticed that on Wednesdays, which was the day I visited, tickets were half priced after 5pm. So I decided to come back later.
Where I went next was the US embassy in Stockholm. This was where Peng applied for his US visa. Even though it sounds like an insignificant part of the story, he actually visited a number of times, detailedly remembered and documented in his book. It was also kind of the turning point for him to move on with his journey from Sweden to the USA. From what I found online, the one I visited should be the same one Peng visited. It was launched in 1955.
I was surprised when I arrived. I was expecting a house, or a building at most, like most of the embassies are. The US embassy in Stockholm took up the land of the size of a university campus, composed of buildings and a huge yard. And as expected, it was barricaded. I started to take photos of the entrance, and of course, caught the attention of the security guard. He gestured to me to go over in a friendly manner, and I believed it was time for me to play the innocent, Asian girl, the tourist card. I said, “Oh, I am not here for anything. I just want to have a look, is it okay if I take some photos?” He gave me a positive answer with a smile. And without anything else to do, or could do, I moved on soon after.

Earlier this year I quit my job as the VP of Platform at SoundCloud and moved back to Stockholm. Working at SoundCloud was a hell of a ride which began back in the summer of 2009. At the time, I’d just graduated from KTH and was doing some work at Propellerhead. I was dreaming about starting my own company after falling in love with entrepreneurship during my time at SSES. Through SSES, I’d also met Eric who’s the SoundCloud co-founder and CTO. We have a lot of shared interests and became great friends.
Knowing Eric was a good reason to frequently visit Berlin where SoundCloud is headquartered. I fell in love with the city and was lucky to experience one of the legendary rooftop parties in SoundCloud’s first office. The team was starting to grow and eventually I got an offer to join. The opportunity was perfect; a chance to join a music tech startup I really believed in, work with people I really liked, and finally make the move to Berlin. We agreed over the phone on a Wednesday and started working the week after.
When I joined SoundCloud, we were less than ten people in a scrappy office and the whole company was doing daily stand-ups together. My job was to build relationships with other companies, mainly music software makers, and get developers to hack on our API. There was so much to do and so much to learn. I loved it and was so excited about getting stuff done that I was almost running to work every day.
We thought we were the coolest thing since disco, but in the beginning it was really hard to convince other companies to partner with us. After all, we were just a small startup from Berlin with rapid growth but uncertain future. However, sending thousands of emails, doing hundreds of calls, taking tons of meetings, and traveling to as many conferences as possible, eventually started to pay off.
As we got bigger, things got a lot easier and eventually we reached a point where we couldn’t even handle all the incoming requests from potential partners. I learned the hard way that it takes time to build good relationships and get people to buy into your ideas, and that timing is super important when it comes to closing deals, so you have to be patient and persistent.
Since I was doing partnerships with other tech companies, I traveled a lot to the US. At a certain point, we needed to establish a permanent presence in the Bay Area, and it was natural for me to make the move to San Francisco and setup our new office there. I was of course stoked about the opportunity to work in SF and get a chance to build a small office from scratch.
It took some time to get things in order, but eventually we got the paperwork sorted, found a great space, and started bringing on new people. I got to obsess with things like office furniture, culture (introducing Friday fika), finding the right people, maintaining the connection to our other offices, and evangelizing SoundCloud in the bay area. It reminded me how naturally passionate I am when I get to coordinate things and craft them down to the details. In the end, things worked out great and I’m really proud of having brought the SoundCloud culture overseas and established so many great relationships in the US.
Over time, we expanded the platform team and scaled up our efforts, and over time we managed to connect the vast majority of music apps and a ton of different web services. We launched partnerships with companies like Apple, Twitter, and Facebook, and created a big developer community who built hundreds of hacks on the API. I was also part of the management team and an active contributor to the overall company strategy work.
Starting a company has always been close to my heart, and as things were running smoothly in SF, I felt the timing was right to leave and build something new. I can’t help loving to build things from scratch and I’m constantly looking for new challenges. In addition, taking some time off would give me a chance to charge my batteries and think about my longterm goals in life.
I’m super proud of having contributed to building a such a great company. Building a startup is an amazing experience that I really recommend. I don’t think there’s a better way to try and learn new things. I’ve learned so many great startup lessons along the way and now I want to take that experience and create something on my own.
A massive thanks to Alex and Eric for giving me the opportunity to support their mission and the freedom to do a great job, and to all the awesome people I’ve worked with along the way! I’ve had so much fun and learned so much.

Most of the human suffering in the modern world boils down to our fear of death. This is not surprising, since modern mythology stipulates that matter is primary and basically all there is.
If nothing exists beyond, above or beneath–whichever spatial metaphor you want to use–the physical universe, every physical and practical expression within its confines appears to be very important, such as gender, age, nationality, organizations, career, money, politics, laws, hospitals, formal education, formal science and titles.
Until it is not, because we all die. How unfair.
The good news is that death is merely a transition from one state to another, just like birth is. Death and birth are exactly the same kind of event, only experienced from opposite angles. We come in and we go out. It is like a long breath.*)
Suffering and the idea of an ultimate death both stem from the illusion of time.
The above means that when we are afraid to die, we are actually afraid to go home. We desperately hold on to this temporary existence, as if a temporary sojourn could ever be a true home. We persuade ourselves that the stage play we are in, this video game, this boot camp, is all we have. We anxiously pay attention to the sergeants of the boot camp who shout out their orders
One might even describe our predicament as a prison we fear leaving. This is actually a pertinent analogy, since this phenomenon is well documented — the psychology of it is well described in the wonderful film The Shawshank Redemption.
We desperately hold on to this temporary existence, as if a temporary sojourn could ever be a true home
When I look at our nonacceptance of death and unconscious rejection of home from a spiritual perspective, I see a collective Stockholm syndrome. A Stockholm syndrome on a species level, basically.
We have developed an understanding, even sympathy, for our prison guards, who constantly lead us to believe that this physical world with its societal structure, is all there is, and if we want to make the most of life, we’d better get out there and seize all the goodies we are able to lay our hands on and reach for as desirable a position in the structure we possibly can.
Of course, we can’t all acquire the same amount of things, and not everybody will be able to gain the most coveted positions. We learn this early on, and with that lesson comes another hard ”truth”: Life is not easy. Who said life should be easy? Some win, some lose, but hey, you just have to learn to bite the bullet and do the best of your situation.
But here is the truth: the essence of life is actually very simple. Life is a continuum.
Deep within, underneath the constant chaos of thoughts and feelings, you can sense that you simply are. You are conscious — you are consciousness itself. You experience — you are experience itself. Hence you exist, and you cannot not exist, because that is not an experience. This is all you can ever really, truly, know for certain is real.
Life unfolds from there, and that is all there is to it. All else are temporary mental or emotional constructs.
This physical experience is no doubt immensely important and in many ways a marvelous adventure. But it is not the whole story. Not even close. The best way to approach earthly life is with equanimous curiosity and joy. Not as if it were dead serious. When we open the door to our infinity, a weight is lifted from our hearts.
When we dismiss this simple and self-evident inner knowing life appears complicated. That is when we get the false idea we lack something, and we feel miserable and anxious. Neuroscientists have tried for decades to locate where in the brain consciousness is produced, to no avail, of course. It is in that futile physical search for meaning we become depressed, whether we try to find it in the brain or by hoarding things.
A basic prerequisite for upholding this elaborate matrix is the idea that humans are at the core selfish
We all come into this strange and wondrous place with the inner truth intact. An inkling remains for a few years, but we gradually forget who we really are. We identify with a name, a skill, a position, a story.
For thousands of years a plethora of societal structures have been imposed on us. The guardians of these structures — teachers, doctors, politicians, civil servants, lawyers, soldiers, journalists, researchers, priests, parents — are themselves involuntary pawns in the game, at least the vast majority of them.
A basic prerequisite for upholding this elaborate matrix is the idea that humans are at the core selfish and unreliable, which is why a structural order is needed. We learn that rules and regulations keep this flawed species in check to the benefit of us all. This is a tragic deception. This is, quite frankly, a big lie.
This big lie operates side by side with — and is fueled by — the widespread fear of death.
Someone might object that people were even more scared of death a few hundred years ago, before the introduction of a physicalist worldview, when almost everybody was religious, at least formally.
This might be true, but the difference would be in degree, not in kind, because that ”religiosity” was a very integral part of the matrix. In some ways the Church, for instance, was more materialistic than modern day atheism, whose proponents emphasize humanism. The Church was deeply in cahoots with the secular powers. Priests told people that God needed them to obey the lords of the world as well.
Adhering to a dogmatic, old-school religion is all about pleasing an external God and acquiescing to the hierarchy of His representatives on Earth. And if you don’t, you know which place you will be sent to.
The realization that we are all eternal sparks of God/Source/The One Consciousness is the most forbidden knowledge of all in the traditional Abrahamic religions.
We used science to drag us away from a system of outer oppression to a system of inner oppression
Wait, didn’t we liberate ourselves from all that when science broke with religion? It certainly looked like an attempt. But did we use our new scientific approach to find our way back to our true essence, our core of natural happiness? We did not. We used science to drag us in the opposite direction, away from a system of outer oppression to a system of inner oppression, called materialism.
Either your life is miserable because you are tormented by the constant condemnations of God and the Church, or your life is miserable because you feel the meaninglessness of being a randomly assembled flesh robot. In both cases you feel unfree. Imprisoned.
In the latter case, you may find temporary relief in embracing the system and its rulers, who tell you that all will be well if you just adjust a little bit more to fit into the intricate societal structures. So you try, once more, to do that. And to make the process smoother and less painful, you choose to sympathize with your prison guards.
This is psychologically very understandable as long as you don’t know that there is an alternative. But imagine the sea change in your perspective on life when you realize you can break out of it whenever you want. That all you have been told, and told yourself, about your identity is a chimera. That the essence of you is completely free.
If we all went there, no one would be afraid of death, and no one would want to control anyone or be controlled. The matrix would dissolve itself. It would be obvious there is no need for it.
*) I assume most readers of this essay are with me on what I state about a non-physical reality. However, if any readers are skeptical, simply imagine for a moment that there is a realm we temporarily leave when we are born into physical bodies and go back to when we leave those bodies, i.e. die. It may help to look into the well-documented accounts by people who have had near-death experiences, which by now count in the thousands; practically all of them say that the realm they have visited during those experiences feels very much like their real home and appears far more real than this physical one. New cases are being documented all the time. And then there is the research at the University of Virginia which, believe it or not, seems to confirm young children’s memories of previous lives. There is also other research pointing to a verifiable non-physical reality.

I just finished my 5 km run. The sky was grey the whole time, but it didn’t start raining until the moment I stopped — like the weather had been holding back, waiting for me. As the first drops landed on my skin, I stood there, catching my breath, and suddenly I was somewhere else entirely.
Do you remember that day in Stockholm? Outside the Vasa Museum, the first snow of the week had started to melt into rain. We didn’t have an umbrella — of course we didn’t — and we just walked, laughing at how unprepared we were. I was giggling the whole time, remember? It was my first time experiencing snow. I must’ve looked ridiculous — eyes wide, hands out like I could catch the whole sky. But you just smiled and let me take it in. It was cold, but you didn’t complain. I think we were too caught up in the quiet magic of it all.
I closed my eyes today in the rain, and for a second, I could feel your hand in mine again. That desperate little run we made, slipping on cobblestones, trying to find shelter — we never really cared if we found one. Just being there, soaked and smiling, was enough.
I miss the way you looked at me like you wanted to say something, but didn’t. Like the silence between us held more than words ever could. I miss how we didn’t need to explain anything. Everything felt full already.
It’s strange how the body remembers. A cold wind, a wet sleeve — and suddenly I’m there again, with you.
Where are you now? Are you somewhere it’s raining too?
Always,Me

If I have to sum up 2024 it has to be ‘adventure’!
In the quest of making a pivot in my life, I made more than hundred new contacts this year. Every time I spoke with someone, I was looking for a match of vibration. And it actually worked like a story!
I clearly remember the morning when I stood outside a building in central Stockholm, inquisitive about what to expect in the meeting that was about to happen. The door opened, I was welcomed in. A nice lounge, then a kitchen with bananas on a plate. I asked if I can have one. I ran in the morning after breakfast and was exhausted of energy. The urge to have a banana overpowered my self-consciousness. Exchanging a few more sentences, it felt like here I am welcome to be who I am. It was encouraging to leave self-consciousness at the door.
The interaction with a group of people running this new AI firm was particularly positive. I met them again in a few days and it felt like they are brimming with passion to make something work. They have just started a venture and they are looking for someone sharing the vision. And it felt good.
They were fast, it took 3 weeks from the first meeting to the decision. They said this was one of the longest process! I had many questions in my mind, but positivity the company protruded overpowered it all. I matched their vibe, I felt genuinely welcome. The CTO promised me a laptop by the end of my first day. Little did I know that he literally meant it, in the evening while I was out running, I got a call from him, he was standing outside my door.
Working at an AI startup means quite a lot of new information to process everyday by everyone. We don’t have time to sit an ponder over frictions. We chase a common goal and try to resolve issues fast, that means talking more, opening up and showing earnest interest in the goals, finding what will make it work without triggering each other. Feedback loops are faster, tighter and effective. We are always learning and sharing.
There is a high intensity of external communication. We reach outs to people across the industry, write articles, active on social media, give credit to one another. My colleagues were happy to act as photographers, editors and writers to engage with the public, creating a strong thought leadership that draws visitors to our website without any external marketing help. And we pick up the phone and call! We gather most of our leads through our contacts, we make sure to present ourselves as who we are and present the strong determination to make AI agenda work, and our enthusiasm is contagious. There is a touch of genuinity in our proposals, we are a young company, innovative, ready to work, flexible. And we keep those promises that we make. No BS.
Some days are full of self doubt, prospects disappear suddenly, makes one feel small. The internal chat channels are saviors, its a lively space with messages, memes and regular business updates. We keep track of each other, not chasing hours, rather than putting in efforts to collaboratively build the brand. Its rare to have a day without a roller coaster of emotions from ‘Yayyy’ moments to existential doubts. Our salaries includes a fat portion of ‘Resilience’ which is unmatched in numbers. And it just grows, and the best part it I can cash out in any situation of my life, the ‘Resilience’ is the best fund to invest in, it will be with me through thick and thin and will be passed on in generations!
A startup business requires scaling down on lot of aspects. Conferences are silent time eaters, the more you go, the more time you need to process the information and to realign the offset it brings in schedule is weighed by the impact it brings. We don’t ditch it altogether but we are extremely choosy on what to attend. Post work gatherings on the other hand are so exciting and lively! We look forward to it, take turns to organize, sit and talk passionately about our lives and challenges. The conversations fuels the energy needs for the next couple of weeks, reloaded with laughter.
Its been 6 months, the company has grown more than a 100%. Its a dynamic environment yet quite simple, non-pretentious. Everyone brings their own self at work, with their creativity and ideas flowing beyond their roles and titles. If you work at a startup or know anyone working at one, verify if my claims. I am all ears for ‘adventures’ !

Following on from part one of my Stockholm trip at the Vasa Museet, this post reflects on my visit to Nationalmuseum — Sweden’s museum of art and design — and a conversation with Lena Eriksson, Head of Education.
Unlike my earlier visit to the bustling Vasa, this experience offered a quiet contrast. I met Lena on a Monday, when the museum was closed to the public. So instead of wandering the galleries, I had the chance to sit with Lena over coffee for a visit filled with insights rather than artworks.
Nationalmuseum is not just a museum, but also a government authority. Our mandate is to preserve cultural heritage and promote art, public interest in art, and knowledge of art. This mandate is set out in an annual letter of instruction from the Swedish government.
We want to put social development in perspective and be an active player in contemporary society.
This made me wonder: how different is a government-funded museum like this from a university museum? One key difference Lena highlighted was how shifts in government can directly impact priorities, including decisions around accessibility and entry fees. At the time of my visit, admission was 160 SEK (around £12.50), free for under-20s, but with no concessions for older adults or disabled visitors. Navigating such changes with each new administration must be complex, especially when core principles like accessibility can shift with political tides.
Lena also shared insights into the museum’s education programme, which, like many institutions, focuses heavily on children, families, and schools. Their website features a dedicated page for families, with free studio sessions every Sunday, the Oculus Walk — a self-guided family tour — and Villa Curiosa, a playful, sensory exhibition designed to spark curiosity and philosophical questions in children.
Naturally, my own research interests led the conversation towards older audiences. I was curious about the museum’s engagement with older adults and community groups.
As is so often the case, Lena explained that while some great work has been done — including sessions for people living with dementia, inspired by Meet Me at MoMA — these projects are often reliant on short-term external funding. Engagement with older adults still isn’t widely seen as a core part of museum work, despite Sweden’s super-ageing population.
One standout project during the pandemic connected older adults in Sweden and Japan through creative online dialogue — a beautiful example of how digital innovation can support inclusive, cross-cultural exchange.
Before wrapping up, I took a moment to check out Nationalmuseum’s accessibility information online. I was pleased to find it easily — just one click from the homepage — and even more impressed by the friendly, human tone of the opening message:
“We want Nationalmuseum to be open to everyone and are always working to improve our accessibility. If you have any questions or suggestions, we would be happy to hear from you.”
A small but meaningful sign that the museum is open not only to visitors, but to conversation and change.

With my other daughters occupied by their own half-term adventures, I opted for a city getaway to Stockholm; the bargain £29pp return flights played a huge part in my decision. When I’m on the lookout for affordable flights, I make it a habit to browse Skyscanner daily. Despite having to drive from the Midlands to Stansted Airport, the journey proved financially viable as we got cheap flights. Thanks to clear skies over Northern Europe, the flight itself was a mere two hours.
Stockholm in February unfolds like a fairytale, its cobblestone streets dusted with snow and its historic buildings adorned with twinkling lights. For travellers seeking an affordable escape, surprisingly this Scandinavian gem can offer a treasure trove of experiences without breaking the bank.
Embarking on a Winter Boat Trip
No visit to Stockholm would be complete without experiencing its beautiful winter scenery from the water. Despite the cold, a boat trip around Stockholm’s archipelago allows you to capture stunning views of the city draped in snow. Wrap up warmly and sip on hot beverages from the onboard café as you, immerse yourself in the tranquillity of Stockholm’s winter wonderland.
Discovering Stockholm’s Cultural Marvels
Delve into Stockholm’s rich cultural tapestry with visits to its renowned museums, including the ABBA Museum and the Vasa Museum. Dive into the pop phenomenon at the ABBA Museum, where interactive exhibits and karaoke booths bring the iconic band’s music to life. The Abba silent disco was hilarious, and my daughter and I made lasting memories. For a more educational visit then, journey back in time to the Vasa Museum, marvelling at the remarkably preserved Vasa ship that sank centuries ago in the harbour on its first voyage.
Indulging in the Culinary Scene
Stockholm’s culinary scene offers something for everyone. Don’t miss the chance to savour meatballs, a Swedish classic, paired with lingonberry sauce and creamy mashed potatoes or fermented herring. I follow a vegetarian diet, but there were plenty of delicious alternatives available. From mouthwatering vegan meatballs to falafel wraps and the comforting tradition of Fika — a hot drink paired with something sweet for a boost in cold weather — Stockholm offers an abundance of tasty dishes that won’t break the bank.
Unique Accommodation Aboard the Red Boat Hostel
For an unforgettable stay, book a room aboard the Red Boat Hostel, a floating haven nestled in Stockholm’s heart. Enjoy cosy rooms and breathtaking views of the city skyline or tranquil frozen waters surrounding the boat. With its budget-friendly rates, the hostel is the perfect choice. Plus, it’s impeccably clean, cosy, and offers a fantastic buffet breakfast.
Embracing Free Attractions
Maximise your budget with free activities, such as the brilliant and informative walking tour of Gamla Stan, Stockholm’s captivating Old Town. Wander through narrow alleyways and picturesque squares as your guide shares stories of the city’s medieval history. The knowledgeable guides generously volunteer their time, so show your appreciation by tipping them at the end of the tour. Sweden is a cash-free society, even the guides accept card for their tips.
From exploring world-class museums to indulging in culinary delicacies and embarking on free walking tours, there’s no shortage of affordable experiences awaiting you in this Scandinavian gem. Pack your bags, wrap up warm, and prepare for a memorable excursion filled with culture, cuisine, and adventure. #stockholm #citybreak #budgettravel #wintercitybreaks #copysella

In January of 2019, I started at a new company, which has its headquarter in Stockholm. It was clear that I would — at some point — travel to the capital city of Sweden to pay a visit to the main office. The first opportunity for this was an internal two-day-workshop. There were several options for the date I could choose from. I decided for the Wednesday and Thursday directly after Easter. This way, I could do use the public holidays plus only two additional vacation days to have a ten-day-travel. Two of those days, of course, for the workshop. The remaining days were free for visiting Stockholm. But with eight days at disposal, I decided to spend the first few days (Good Friday until Easter Monday) in the Norwegian capital instead.
As my company also has an office in Oslo, the idea was to meet up with some colleagues for a coffee or lunch. What I wasn’t aware of is that the Easter days are used by the Norwegians usually to spend their time skiing in the mountains. So nearly no one was even in the city and my plan to meet the local colleagues didn’t work out as planned.
20.473 steps.
To get from Oslo-Gardermoen Airport to the central station, there are basically two options: the Flytorget express train (196 NOK; 22 min) and the regional trains operated by NSB (105 NOK; 23 min), such as the R10. I chose the latter. Due to the cancellation of the flight by EasyJet I had intended to take to Oslo, I had to travel a few hours earlier than planned. Which also meant to arrive more prior in Oslo. But as the hotel I booked only offered check-in from 15:00, I had to come up with something to kill time. Unfortunately, this also meant to carry my backpack around the city as well, weighing about eight kilograms. During my first walk through the town, I already visited the Munch museum, but the famous scream was not on display, unfortunately.
One of the things I usually try to do is having a walk around the neighborhood of my hotel on the first day. This gives me quite a good feeling about the area, and I can check out where I can get some snacks for the evening and more importantly: bottled water. It’s not about not trusting the hotels tap water. But when I’m walking around the city for sightseeing, I avoid buying food or drinks in places crowded with tourists, as the prices are a bit higher there. My recommendation is to walk the narrow, little side streets and try to take a different route each time. I usually start in a general direction and find the path as I go depending on which way look more appealing. This method will give you a better picture of the city, and you will find the restaurants where the locals eat. These typically serve good quality for more reasonable prices compared to the restaurants located directly at the usual tourist routes.
28.984 steps.
For the first full day in the city, I decided to book the Oslo Pass for 24 hours using their Android app, which was very convenient. This pass already included public transport. Using this, I took the bus 30 to the peninsula of Bygdøy for visiting the Viking Ship Museum, the Holocaust Center, the Norwegian Maritime Museum, the Fram Museum, and the Kon-Tiki Museum. The Fram Museum got built around the ship of the same name, which was used for polar explorations and the museum included many stories of exploratory expeditions for the north and south pole. All of the mentioned museums had excellent exhibitions and are also suitable for tourists as items are mostly labeled in Norwegian as well as English. I originally planned to include the Norwegian Museum of Cultural History while being in Bygdøy, but instead decided to take the ferry back to the central city. After leaving the boat, I headed for the Akershus fortress, where I wanted to visit Norway’s Resistance Museum and the Norwegian Military History Museum, but both were closed for Easter. Continuing the tour of museums, I took a streetcar to Frogner Plass, to visit the Vigeland Museum about the work of sculptor Gustav Vigeland. Oslo’s city museum is just around the corner, displaying the history of Oslo or Christiania, as the city was named between 1624 and 1924. After I had to leave (as they were closing), I went back with the streetcar and having my last stop for that day, the Nobel Peace Center. This museum was designed very nicely and worth a visit.
After being afoot for more than ten hours that day, I arrived back to my hotel. Although I already knew there was a high rate of electric cars in the Nordic countries, I was still really impressed by seeing at least one Tesla in every single street. There were electric cars of other brands as well but less prominent. Furthermore, there are also quite a lot of electric scooters in the city. Problematic in this context is that they seemed to be allowed on the sidewalks, which I think is pretty dangerous. In fact, Austria just banned them from the sidewalks for this reason, and France plans to do the same.
20.236 steps.
For Easter Sunday, I booked a boat tour around the Oslofjord in the week before traveling. This tour lasted about 2 hours and might have been one of the main factors for my sunburn that I took from Oslo as a souvenir. This tour also included some facts about the buildings at the shores of the fjord and some local history. The Oslofjord is distinctive among the fjords of Norway, as it is one of the oldest, and was not formed by a moving glacier but being part of the Olso rift. After returning to the harbor, I headed to the Royal Palace, as the changing of the guard was going to happen at 13:30.
Although the park around the royal palace is quite lovely and open to the public, I went to Vigelandparken afterward, to see the sculptures, of which I had only seen the models in the museum the day before. I wasn’t the only one with this idea that day. The sun attracted a lot of people, who wanted to enjoy the beautiful sunny weather in the park. There were also some people around which seemed to me as they would be geocaching. And after looking at the map of caches around, I also started to visit some of them in the park as well as outside, while walking back to the city center. The downside was I got so distracted with geocaching, that I left my DSLR camera on a bench next to one cache. As James May would say: C**k!
C**k!
— James May
So I walked back the route I just walked as I was trying to remember when the last time was I had the camera in my hands. Fortunately, a Norwegian couple walked towards me, while I was approaching Vigelandpark again. The guy is carrying a DSLR camera around his neck. Hm, that looks exactly like the one I just lost. It even has the bubble level on it. Wait. Is that mine? It was. He handed it over and explained that they left a note where I lost it, stating they would bring it to the next police station. After having a short chat, I thanked them again, and we split up. As this was enough stress for one day, I decided the next thing I would do is to have a burger and a beer. For this, I stepped in at “The Scotsman.” Like other Norwegian places, you have to get a table first, remember the table number, and then walk up to the bar for ordering. In the background, I could watch the Premier League, as Everton vs. Manchester United was ending, followed by Cardiff vs. Liverpool. A friendly way to end this day.
8.563 steps.
On Easter Monday it was already time to leave Oslo and get on the plane for Stockholm. Somehow, I thought my flight would take off at 10:30 in the morning. Therefore I tried to be at the airport at 9:00, which worked. But somehow I had the wrong time in mind, as my flight was actually scheduled for 12:40. Well, time to find a seat and continue reading my book. But first, let’s find a pharmacy to get something to treat my sunburn. As I don’t speak any Norwegian, I took some time and was switching between shelves back and forth. In the end, I settled for a product which seemed suitable and was small enough to take on the plane. At the cashier, I didn’t have to pay anything. I was confused. The clerk pointed to a sticker on the product, which explained (in Norwegian of course) that I just found an Easter egg. This kind of ‘hide and seek’ seems to be a common thing in some Norwegian shops. It reminded me of some chocolate hidden in the Akershus fortress I noticed when I was there two days before.
After arriving at Stockholm central station, I looked for a supermarket to get bottled water and some lunch/dinner to eat in the hotel. I found a coop with a nice salad bar. And as I was in Sweden now, I couldn’t resist buying about two kilograms of Swedish candy which I emptied over the next couple of evenings at the hotel.
26.940 steps.
As the hotel I stayed at in Stockholm is named “Hotel with Urban Deli,” you can imagine that the breakfast you get here is not standard. Italian-style salami, fresh bread, fruits, yogurt, smoothies, a good selection of loose tea. There was nothing I missed and nothing I could complain about. Everything was fresh and of high quality.
After the great breakfast, I walked a bit around the neighborhood, without a specific destination in mind. While walking towards Gamla Stan, the old city, I came by the Mediterranean Museum. It has a broad selection of items from different cultures around the Mediterranean Sea, including Egypt, ancient Rome, etc. It mainly showcased the evolution of beliefs for life after death and corresponding funeral rituals. After a short stop for a chat and coffee at my company’s main office, I visited the Swedish Army Museum. Showing the history of the Swedish military equipment in the context of the timeline of wars Sweden fought.
As it was already too late for visiting the Swedish History Museum or the Royal Armory, I decided to have a short break at the hotel, before attending a 1,5 h guided tour through Gamla Stan. The tour named “The Ghost Walk” explained some of the darker aspects of Stockholm’s history and was presented by a guide, who was loving his role and tried to send chills down our spines. If you do one guided tour in Stockholm, do this!
Combined: 13.259 steps.
Here it comes, the reason I planned to travel to Stockholm in the first place. A two-day-workshop about communication and personalities. There was a lot of input I received here and lots of things I have to recap after the travel. We were eleven people in this workshop including the facilitator, most of which Swedish. Apart from having fun during the workshop doing some role-plays, we also got to know each other during joined breakfast, lunch and dinner on both days.
17.878 steps.
As the workshop days were a bit exhausting, I started this day a bit later. The breakfast in the hotel was again a great way to do this. But I passed on coffee at the hotel, as I had an appointment for coffee with someone at the company’s office again. Even though this was during my official vacation days, I took to opportunity to have coffee with some colleagues I usually would not meet (as we work in different cities).
While walking to the Royal Palace, I already noticed military marching music playing somewhere. The royal music corps was already on the way to the palace half an hour before the changing of the guard would take place (scheduled for 12:30). I wasn’t the only one having the idea of watching this today. People flooded the area in front of the palace, barely being contained by a few guards to secure the ceremony would have enough room to take place. Although I didn’t understand a single word they said via the public speaker system, it was still quite a show to experience. As the same ceremony in Oslo didn’t contain a music corps, a comparison would be unfair.
One of the most famous landmarks of Stockholm is the city hall though, the Stadshus. The Nobel prizes are awarded here, except for the Nobel Peace Prize which we spoke of before. And there are also some geocaches around. After having spent the majority of the day in parks, I headed back to the office, where an event for new hires was going to happen including Swedish student’s drinking songs, occasionally interrupted by some 15-minute talks. Another opportunity for mingling with colleagues I usually wouldn’t meet.
26.420 steps.
All the things that usually would cost an entrance fee were left for today. Firstly, because I planned to use the Stockholm pass this day, which even gets cheaper if you buy it online and then use the QR code from the mail. Secondly, because of the Stockholm Kulturnatt. Between 18:00 and midnight, a lot of museums and other places were free to visit and offered special tours or exhibitions. But the first thing I had planned for this day was to take the ferry from Klara Mälarstrand to the Royal Domain of Drottningholm to visit the palace and its surrounding park which are part of UNESCO’s world heritage list. The richly decorated palace and its park are worth a visit. In contrast to my boat tour in Oslo, I was prepared with some sun blocker this time.
After arriving back to Klara Mälarstrand, I walked towards Gamla Stan to revisit the Royal Palace. This time also from the inside. With the Stockholm pass, I could directly walk up to the entrance without the need to buy a separate ticket at the desk located in a side wing. At the admission checkpoint, you will be asked to wear your backpack in front of you. I forgot to ask why. In nearly every room, there is a little sign explaining the purpose and history of that room, from bedrooms to audience rooms. As the monarchs introduced a few different orders of chivalry over the years, there are also some rooms dedicated to them. There is a room for the Order of the Polar Star, another room for the Royal Order of the Seraphim, and so on.
Maybe the most prestigious award in the world is the Nobel Prize. Apart from the Nobel Peace Prize, the Nobel Prizes are awarded in the city hall of Stockholm. In 2001, the Nobel Museum opened in Stockholm, which was the next place to visit for me. In here you can find the history of the inception of the Nobel Prizes and temporary exhibition about Martin Luther King Jr. who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, one year after his famous speech.
The probably most popular museum in Stockholm though is the Vasa Museum. The Vasa was a ship built in the 1620s by order of Swedish king for demonstrating the great power of his empire. As he was continually changing his mind about the design of the vessel and demanding to include a higher number of cannons every time, the ship’s buoyancy was put in danger. In fact, after being hit by a mild gust, she sank during her maiden voyage while still being in the harbor of Stockholm. 333 years later, she was recovered, and the museum was built around her.
As the museums had to prepare for the Kultunatt, they all closed at 17:00. During the one hour wait for them to reopen again, I went to eat real Swedish Köttbullar with mashed potatoes and lingonberries at Sjöcafeet. Afterward, I was fit again to continue with the Kultunatt, starting back at the Vasa Museum, as I didn’t manage to see everything on the first visit. Of course, there was quite a queue for the museum building up. On the same island, there is also the Spritmuseum showcasing alcoholic beverages in the context of culture and society. It also included a temporary exhibition about food consumption and consumer behavior in general. Just a few meters further, the Nordic Museum waited to be visited, showing the history of Swedish culture. The focus for the Kulturnatt was put on how Swedish people dressed throughout the decades.
4.500 steps.
Two days before, I coincidentally read a mail from SAS stating that strikes might occur due to ongoing negotiations with their pilots. As my flight wasn’t booked with SAS directly, but via a travel agency, I had to talk to them for asking what was going to happen now. But my flight was not officially canceled yet. So I had to wait. On the next day, I rechecked the status of my flight and saw that it was canceled now. After talking to the agency again, they couldn’t book an alternative flight for me, for organizational reasons. So I had to see for myself how I would be traveling back home. I found a flight operated by a company I never heard of before, with a stop in a city I have never heard if before. And I started at Stockholm Bromma Airport now, instead of Arlanda, which in the end didn’t make any difference in my travel time though. But the 2,5 h stop in Växjö did.
Unfortunately, the Växjö Småland Airport didn’t have a transit area, so after having walked from the aircraft to the airport building, I was already out of the security area. So I had to go through another security check for getting to the gate. THE gate. There was exactly one. As only five flights departed from that airport in total on that day, they don’t need more. It’s the smallest international airport I ever visited. But it was relaxing as well. I used the time to continue the book I was reading, and soon enough it was time to board the same aircraft again for the flight to Berlin. In the end, I landed safely at Berlin-Tegel Airport and was happy to be back home.

So, it’s taken a bit of time to get this blog up… but, in this forth blog post in my #StockholmSeries, I reflect on visits to two neighbouring museums in Stockholm — ArkDes and Moderna Museet…
I came across ArkDes — the Swedish Centre for Architecture and Design — while I was exploring places to visit on this research trip.
I saw that “Admission to ArkDes is free throughout 2025” which was fantastic, but I was also really intrigued by a project they’re running — Unboxing, which runs every day for two hours enabling you to meet and chat to one of the museum’s curators.
Unboxing is the place where you, together with the museum’s curators, unpack and explore never-before-seen items from the museum’s underground archives.
I was interested by the concept of bringing the collection into a different space, giving visitors the opportunity to see behind the scenes, and the museum’s commitment to this being available to everyone, everyday. It blurred the line between exhibit and experience — a quiet but clever way to shift how people relate to the space.
I went straight to the space, which was easy to navigate to from the front of the gallery. Unboxing provides the opportunity for the museum to engage with visitors in a different way, gives curators the chance to talk about their passion, and for visitors to experience objects from the collection — for me, this was seeing architectural drawings — in a different way.
Next door at Moderna Museet, the invitation to engage was everywhere: tables with drawing paper, sketchbook stations, scattered books and varied seating. Each space offered a different kind of welcome, always with a gentle prompt to pause, reflect or create. I loved the moments of rest — especially a bench by a floor-to-ceiling window tucked behind a door marked “staff only” — an unintentional but beautiful in-between space.
I also met with staff from both museums, who spoke about the challenges (and small wins) of increasing access and inclusion, from updating signage to navigating funding and policy shifts. It was a reminder that innovation doesn’t always come from big gestures — it often lives in the details.

More than 100 miles north of the Arctic Circle, our Vy train to Narvik climbed an other-worldly landscape of lakes, rivers and waterfalls, dotted with cabins painted in Scandinavia’s iconic Falu red with white trim.
I was thousands of miles from home, and I felt as if I were on another planet.
Population and vegetation were sparse as we climbed in latitude and altitude, crossing through the Scandinavian Mountain range that forms the border between Sweden and Norway.
I have logged more than 40,000 miles by rail, and love trains so much that I’ve made slow train travel the subject of my master’s capstone. I have always been intrigued by the Arctic, drawn to the northern reaches when looking at maps. And for 24 hours in mid-October, I had the privilege of bringing these two interests together with a 637-mile train trip from Stockholm, Sweden, to Narvik, Norway.
After 48 hours in Stockholm with our cousins, my brother Michael and I arrived at Stockholms Centralstation — a 151-year-old transportation hub that draws 200,000 visitors every day — with about 45 minutes to spare, my bags a little heavier than when I first arrived in the Swedish capital.
Our sleeper train would take us through Swedish forests, over steep mountains and down to the Norwegian port city of Narvik, where we would catch a 4-hour bus ride even farther north to Tromsø, the third largest city above the Arctic Circle.
I grabbed one last cardamom bun at Stockholms Centralstation — my fourth in 48 hours — before we boarded. I had always associated cardamom with Middle Eastern food, but Sweden and Norway consume 18 and 30 times more cardamom than the global median, and cardamom buns were everywhere in Stockholm. Not knowing where I would find one again, I couldn’t resist one more.
When the train rolled in to the station, we found our car and boarded, joining a crowd of passengers from other parts of the world. I heard Italian, Chinese, and a lot of non-native English.
We had booked a couchette, a small space for six people, two benches facing each other by day, three beds on each side by night. I was hoping we’d have the space to ourselves, but we had the next best thing: just one other passenger, a quiet youngish man in a striped t-shirt and a baseball cap who had a bunk at the very top.
Mike and I didn’t stay long in the couchette. As soon as the attendant checked our tickets, we headed to the dining car, where we could sit at a table and enjoy some Bottenvikkens brews from northern Sweden and be around other passengers.
For dinner, I couldn’t pass up the most unique dish — reindeer stew with potatoes, mushrooms and lingonberries. Other offerings included folded flatbread with fried egg and Jokkmokk-sausage, and classic Swedish shrimp sandwich. Each boxed dinner bore the words “We proudly serve food made from scratch in Luleå.”
After dinner, I broke into the sampler pack of aquavit that I had purchased at the liquor store in the Åhléns department store in Stockholm.
One after another, we split four tiny bottles, each one with a different combination of flavors, including dill, caraway, rosemary, citrus, cumin, anise, sherry and cinnamon.
I split each between two glasses, and as we would do throughout our weeklong trip, Mike and I toasted with the Scandinavian “skål” first tapping each other’s glass, then tapping our own glass to the table as a toast to the house before taking the first sip.
Back at the couchette, we made our beds as quietly as we could, knowing that someone else was above us. I would have hated to be in his position, so close to the ceiling. I slept relatively well, waking up every so often to peek outside, in vain, to see if I could see the Northern Lights.
I knew that the restaurant car would open at 5 am and, wanting to be among the early risers, I got up at 5:30 to head down there.
The train was stopped at the Älvsbyn station, and as I made my way to the restaurant car, I found an open door and stuck my head out for fresh air. There I met a train attendant who told me we were stuck for a bit, awaiting information on when we could proceed. I sat and had my tea, texting with my mom and waiting — and waiting — and waiting.
I had oatmeal with cardamom, granola and lingonberries, and we waited some more.
After an hour of “we will know soon,” we were told that due to track problems ahead, we would have to take a bus to Boden and board a new train there, not arriving in Narvik until after 5 pm, long after our bus — and a final subsequent bus — to Tromsø would have departed.
At around 9:30 am, a bus arrived to take us to Boden. It meandered through Swedish forestland, the first of many, many, many miles of it that we would see in the coming hours.
I was disappointed to learn that the train we would board at Boden was a day train, lacking many of the amenities of our night train, namely, my favorite one, the restaurant car. We could buy food and drinks, but with no communal place to eat, we would have to take them back to our seats. We were assigned two window seats, one behind another.
The portion of the trip north of Boden is on a stretch of track known as the Iron Ore Line, which connects Luleå, Sweden, on the Gulf of Bothnia, with Narvik, Norway, on the North Sea.
The line was completed in 1903 to bring iron ore from Sweden to Narvik. Trains on this line have run on electric power since at least 1923 (while the vast majority of track in the United States remains non-electrified a century later). The line still transports iron ore from Kiruna, Svappavaara and Malmberget, as well as shipments of food, to the north, and fish to the south.
Watching the forests pass us by, I tried to detect changes as we moved north into a different climate. Most of the route seemed to be a dense mix of birches that were losing their leaves — a few weeks ahead of the brilliant yellow trees in Stockholm — and conifers.
As we neared the Arctic Circle, the birches had lost all their leaves, and they seemed to be fewer in number. The conifers, too, were fewer, as the dense forests grew more sparse.
What was also sparse here — noise. I like to chat with other people on trains, but this car was silent. We seemed to be the only Americans on board. Other passengers included a young British couple, a middle aged Scottish couple that we would bump into outside a pub in Narvik later that night, a group of about eight Asian people, and the rest seemed Norwegian, Swedish or German.
A walk to the coach area adjacent to the bistro was a much different story — a group of Italians were talking loudly and fast. I loved to hear it and wished we were seated with them.
Crossing the Arctic Circle was not as eventful as I expected. I had marked the spot on my Google maps a couple weeks prior to the trip so that I would know the exact moment we crossed. We passed a sign marking the spot — Polcirkeln — just before the mark on my phone. In any case, I had never before been above the Arctic Circle, so it was an exciting moment — and we still had miles and miles and miles to go.
Most of my long-distance train travel has been in the United States, where I marvel at the vast expanses of open space. With an average density of 35 people per square kilometer, the United States is half as dense as Europe, which has 73 people per square kilometer. However, for this trip, I was traveling through countries far less dense than even the United States: Sweden has 23 people per square kilometer, and Norway has only 17, about half the density of the United States. The land here was wide open.
As we pressed farther north, the train did not take on many new passengers, meaning the train, too, was not densely populated. We mostly discharged passengers, especially at Kiruna, a mining town in Swedish Lapland with about 23,000 inhabitants.
The landscape continued to change. The forested hills of southern Sweden were replaced by flatter land, shorter trees, and lots of lakes. In the distance, we could begin to see the Scandinavian Mountains, the range that runs the length of the border between Sweden and Norway, which we would soon be crossing.
After Kiruna, we could really spread out, which for me meant that I could move from the left side of the train to the right to take photos and video. It was here that we engaged in conversation with some fellow passengers.
Lars, from Bavaria, was going to Abisko, where he planned to take two 20-km hikes before continuing on to the Lofoten archipelago for a few days, and then down to Bodø by bus, and by train farther the south, to be possibly followed by a ferry to Denmark. He was clearly a fan of traveling by land and sea — and had the time to do so.
Ann, from Aarhus, was now living in Tromsø, traveling back north by land because of the detrimental effects air travel has on the climate. She was frustrated by how long and expensive the ride was, and how governments fell short of making it easier for people to make the right choices. Our delay would make her long trip longer and more costly for her. I shared her frustration, but reminded her that much of Europe is light years ahead of the United States when it comes to climate-friendly travel options.
I can’t say enough about the last few hours of that train ride.
After Abisko, the train began to climb the Scandinavian Mountains, reaching a height of about 1,700 feet above sea level, alongside mountains that towered much higher.
The word tundra always connoted to me some distant exotic landscape, something one finds in a nature book or a textbook. Now, I was riding through it, seeing it with my own eyes.
Mosses, lichens and low shrubs offered some color against the rugged, exposed rock. Birches that had long lost their leaves appeared here and there. If not for the sporadic red and gray cabins, I would have thought that a wildfire had recently wiped out this area.
To be more specific, we were crossing through a biome known as the Scandinavian Montane Birch Forests and Grasslands, a tundra ecoregion that spans much of Norway, as well as parts of northern Sweden and Finland.
Though I couldn’t identify them at the time, I later learned that many of the low shrubs I was seeing was likely a mix of crowberry, reindeer lichen, cloudberry, bilberry and wolf’s bane.
The trees were largely downy birches — I could easily identify birches by their white bark — that would grow no taller than 2 to 3 meters, but also may have included aspen, Scots pine, juniper, grey alder, rowan, goat willow and bird cherry.
We passed many alpine lakes that would soon freeze over under the coming polar night. Under the surface likely swam char, trout, tench and minnow.
In Sweden, the lakes all ended in -jávri (Báktájávri, Loktajávri, Vássejávri) the word for “lake” in the Northern Sami language. Once we crossed to Norway, they ended -vatnet (Brudeslørvatnet, Hansenvatnet, Telegrafvatnet) Norwegian for “the water.”
The sun hung low near the horizon, and I was grateful that despite the delay, we were not passing through this stretch in darkness. As I publish this in mid-November, sunset in Kiruna is 1:57 pm. On December 10, the sun will set at 11:48 am, and not rise again until 11:25 am on January 2.
In our destination of Narvik, the sun remains below the horizon from December 6 to January 7.
As we continued westward toward Norway, we hugged the side of mountains, going through several tunnels and snow sheds. Across the valley, I could see waterfalls, like ribbons spaced out on the side of the mountains. I spent much of the last hour or so in the back of the train, where I had space to myself to open and close windows on either side, and take video out of the left, right and rear of the train.
We made several stops in remote towns I could neither pronounce — Låktatjåkka, Vassijaure, Katterkåkk, Riksgränsen — nor imagine living in.
We crossed the Sweden-Norway border inside a tunnel, with the colors of the Swedish flag painted inside, changing over to the colors of the Norwegian flag.
The rail line from the border to Narvik is known as the Ofoten line, and it brought us from an elevation of 1,700 feet down to sea level over the course of 27 miles, as we made the final stretch to our destination.
Soon, we could see a body of water below, the Rombaken, a 12-mile long fjord that was the site of several naval battles during the 1940 Battle of Narvik. The fjord branches out from Narvik’s Ofotfjorden.
As we passed the massive suspension bridge that connects Narvik to Øyjorda across the fjord, we knew it was time for us to gather our bags, say farewell to Ann — with the chance we might see her on our predawn bus ride 12 hours later — and disembark, 637 miles from Stockholm and 130 miles above the Arctic circle.
At Narvik, we walked a half mile through a cloudy mist to the Scandic hotel. At nearly $200, it was the most expensive place to stay, but it was also closest to the bus station, it had a sky bar, and I was fairly confident it could be reimbursed by either the rail company or my credit card insurance.
It didn’t disappoint. The sky bar was amazing, with a nearly 360-degree view of the city. I can’t imagine being there to see either the Northern Lights or the midnight sun. But in our case, it was a cloudy and drizzly night, without much to see in the sky, but the view of the town was nonetheless fascinating.
After a drink and a massive charcuterie board, we left for Narvikguten pub, making a small loop up a hill to see what we could of the full moon. As we entered the pub, we ran into a Scottish couple from the train. I felt bad that they didn’t stick around, saying the prices were “too dear” for them, and that their pounds were especially weak these days. They were in Narvik just to check out the Arctic, heading back south soon and continuing on to Spain after.
We took seats at the bar, realizing quickly that not food would be served there. Into our second beer, we decided that dinner was not entirely necessary after the charcuterie board. We struck up a conversation with the guy next to me, Gus, originally from Oslo and now living in the north with his fiancé. He was a bartender at the bar, drinking there on his day off, stepping out occasionally for a hand-rolled cigarette.
It was interesting — and refreshing — to hear his impressions of Americans. He saw a disconnect between Americans’ personalities and what he reads in the news. We are a welcoming people, he said, based on the conversations he had with Americans on all sides of the political spectrum. But if you judged us based on what you saw in the news, what would you think, I asked? I’d think you were absolutely out of your minds crazy, he said.
During our conversation, our bartender handed Gus two buttons, meant for Mike and me. They bore the name and logo of the pub. They said it was their stamp of approval on us as visitors, and that they welcomed us back any time.
After three or four or more beers, we called it a night, returned the to sky bar for a nightcap and a bag of chips — and then turned in, alarms set for 4:15 am to make our 5:30 am bus ride, an additional four hours to the North.

Have you ever found yourself sympathizing with a known racist person or group of people? If so, this article will provide you with a lantern to make it out of the mental fog. Racism is a form of abuse. While most people do not develop Stockholm Syndrome during an abusive encounter, some do. They produce a psychological response that causes them to develop positive associations with an abuser.
You’ve probably heard about examples of Stockholm Syndrome in bank robberies, kidnappings, and domestic violence circumstances. However, there is no reason why we shouldn’t analyze how race factors into abusive relationships. I suggest that Black people and people of color who develop positive feelings about racists actually suffer from Racial Stockholm Syndrome.
Consider Uncle Ruckus from The Boondocks animated series. He is a dark-skinned Black man who often denies his Blackness, praises white people while condemning Black people. For example, Uncle Ruckus sang, “Colored folks talkin’ about ‘Save Me!’ / Wasn’t nothin’ wrong with slavery! / At least we got good food back then — uh huh, uh huh! / White man sho could be yo friend.”

In Los Angeles, the suburbs would always grow boring- a boredom similar to the tiring feeling of hearing the same song played over and over. At Princeton, you feel like you’re living in Neverland- nothing seems to change, and you always have this warm sense of quiet comfort. In Beijing, the weekends are occupied with sight seeing and night life, and the weekdays always seem to be moving in some direction.
Stockholm, Sweden is the most stable place I have ever lived. It’s also one of the most beautiful. Here’s a quick peep of the fountain right outside of my apartment:
Whenever I need a break from life, I always take a few minutes to sit by the water. Every few seconds, the wind blows the mist in your direction and you feel a momentary, gentle spray. It feels nice, like a cool, refreshing blanket that wraps around your shoulders. This is especially comforting when I think about home and the happier, safer days at Princeton.
And here’s a little view of the bridge connecting the main island with Gamla stan, the “old town” of Stockholm that’s apparently a tourist trap:
During breaks and weekends, my friends and I would take short strolls around the city, and since the majority of Stockholm is built on water, the beautiful views are never-ending. Occasionally, I would find time to walk around the city on my own. As much as I hate being alone, I could explore this place for hours, aimlessly wandering and appreciating the bits and pieces of Europe.
For those of you who don’t know, I’m here interning for a company called Nova Global, a top-talent network that finds talented people around the world and yada yada yada. Work has been amazing, and I absolutely love my coworkers-they’ve been a family to me.
But oddly enough, the memories that I’ve appreciated the most belong to the little lessons of the day-to-day life. Every single morning, I find time to go to the gym and exercise before work. And every single afternoon when I get back from work, I do the same. I’ve cooked nearly every other meal (Nikita, my friend/roommate, cooks the other half), and when the sink looks a little messy I’ll hop right on the dishes. Thanks to Nikita (he used to be a Latvian pro swimmer), I’ve learned how to prepare huge meals that are so healthy, you’d definitely have plenty left over unless you see the guy next to you scarfing down each last bit. I’m really grateful he’s here- he’s been like an older brother to me.
After reading this over, part of me wants to cringe at how spoiled I probably sound, but I don’t think I’ve been this happy for months. The first week was hard, but I finally feel like the background noise is subsiding and I’m regaining clarity and focus again. I’m finally back in my own skin.
Part of me will always be a little sad that I can’t return to the naive, safe-haven of my Sophomore year at Princeton, but I’m happy, and I’m remembering what it means to take life in strides. Week one has done me well, and I know that I’ll always find some way to appreciate each day.
A few notes about Stockholm:
Yesterday, my friends and I decided to take an impromptu cycling trip through Lidingö, a nature reserve slightly northeast of where we lived. Within half an hour, our surroundings transformed from high-rises and busy city intersections into miles and miles of forest and greenery.
Needless to say, it didn’t take long for a group of foreigners to get unbelievably lost on a never-ending trail of that. And every time I shouted to Nikita and asked if he knew where we were, we just laughed and shrugged. It was pure exploration, with no direction and no destination. It’s really been quite some time since I’ve felt so free.
Saturday afternoon, a day prior to the three hour excursion through “fucking” Lidingö (sorry folks, it’s an inside joke), Lucy and Tara convinced me to explore parts of Söldermalm with them. Similar to my little cycling adventure, most of our trip consisted of aimless wandering, letting our minds digest all the “new” that was around us.
For some reason, the entire time I wouldn’t stop chirping about how I wanted to walk along the water. Söldermalm was beautiful- arguably the most beautiful area of Stockholm I’ve seen yet- but part of me was drawn so strongly toward the water. And somehow, we eventually found ourselves standing near a cliffside that held the most breath-taking view I’ve ever seen. There was something special about the sight that restored that warm, comforting feeling that I’ve felt lacking for a while. It’s probably the happiest moment that I’ve had since I’ve landed in Stockholm.
That was when I decided that I wanted my summer to be characterized by serendipity. Week One was characterized by routine and stability, and it’s done me well. But weeks Two through Ten are going to be filled with aimless exploration and travel. I’m booked to fly off to some new country nearly every weekend, and I’m searching for something “new” everyday. It’s almost like I’ve grown an addiction to novelty.
If there’s anything I’ve learned from “fucking” Lindingö, it’s that it’s OK to get incredibly dehydrated and lost in a forest for three hours. We made more than a few wrong turns, but everyone made it out (more-or-less) alright.
Here’s a list of “new” things I’ve checked off or have yet to check off:
Part of me wishes that my mind read like a book, and that it would scribble down every moment I encountered just as it happened- a Carpe Diem recorder of some sort, I guess. But it doesn’t and it can’t, so I’ll do my best to capture how important this weekend in Amsterdam was to me.
Better yet, let me clarify: I’ll do my best to capture how important this burger-loving fiend is to me (sorry JD, but the picture’s gotta go online):
On July 15, 2015, JD Case touched down in Stockholm, and that’s when the (stupid decisions) adventures of Nathan in Europe really began. Europe, or at least the small portion of it I’ve seen, is great, but there’s always this thin cloak of nostalgia for the lazy, naïve days of year two at Princeton. There’s plenty I miss- the spontaneous trips to Starbucks, the 3 AM League games, the Papa Johns, the 3 AM Papa Johns- and I couldn’t have been more grateful that a part of that was able to visit me halfway around the world.
Last week, I surrendered my summer to serendipity, and the aimless exploration continued when we landed in Amsterdam. We hadn’t booked a place to stay until the day of, but JD was able to nab us a few nice spots for a really good price. Here’s a glimpse of the view outside of the aptly named “RoomMate Hotel”:
If Stockholm’s a stable, structured meeting where everyone in the room is prim, proper, and on time, Amsterdam’s a massive, rambunctious bar where everyone’s intoxicated by early evening. Perhaps it was the company, but the city of bikes and beer is definitely one of my favorite places to be. For those of you who don’t know, JD’s spending this summer traveling the entire world. During our conversations, he mentioned that he never missed home much because with every new place, there was always something new to see and experience. And in Amsterdam, that statement couldn’t be any more true.
Wherever you go, the bright lights that reflect off the canal waters always seem to follow you- it really makes the city feel alive by night. When we weren’t lost or eating massive amounts of food, we were in some interesting bar sipping on beers or fancy cocktails. At Vesper Bar (a place that James Bond would go to for cocktails, and with good reason), I noticed their genius motto written on the blackboard after a few drinks in: “Summer is a time when you drink triple, see double, and act single.” It’s been a few days since I’ve been back, and I think I can speak for both of us when I say that we respected that quote quite well.
Of course, the trip ended exactly as any adventure with JD Case and Nathan Lam would: food poisoning. The burger place we ate at above was great, but for some stupid reason we decided to hike twenty minutes to this other place called “Burgermeester” to grab dinner before I left, and that decision absolutely killed us. After an hour of (puking) lying on our beds in the room, we stumbled outside to enjoy a bit of Amsterdam minutes before I had to leave.
We sat by the water and talked about the “strange corners of life,” tossing little pebbles off the edge to see ripples across the surface. Moments before my Uber arrived to take me to the airport, a little lady bug landed on my hand.
They say that’s supposed to be a sign of good luck, and I sure hope it’s true. I’ve got eight weeks left to do and see everything.
A few things that serendipity brought us:
P.S. Don’t worry Chris and Jerry, there’s no way we forgot about you guys:
Here we have Chris 2Changz, shirtless as ever and with us in spirit and Snapchat. Don’t worry buddy, I’ve collected a few bottle caps, and JD and I have something way better for you when we get back to campus. Jerry, you lucked out. I couldn’t find any embarrassing pictures, but I’ll fix that up soon. I can’t wait to see what happens next year in Brown 423.
As you can see, it’s well into week five, but I’m going to do my best to do last week justice. Life in Europe hasn’t grown any less interesting, but it’s been raining lately, and the days in Stockholm feel as though they’re growing shorter and shorter. It’s not a bad thing — rather, it’s as though time has simply lost the weight that it held weeks prior, and that I’ve stopped counting the days. Novelty is always perfect for tying your mind to the present, and when you travel, you become fixated on exploration. It’s addicting, really.
Copenhagen, unlike Amsterdam, was peaceful, and I often found myself subsumed by random thoughts and musings about all the things that’ve happened the past few weeks. Even though it really hasn’t been long, I think it’s fair to say that I’ve matured a considerable amount. The bulk of the trip was spent with Lucy and Tara, but there were pockets of time where I wandered off, as usual, and stumbled upon those little treasures that make traveling worthwhile.
But I’ll get to that later. First, I want to share all the weird things that happened. I feel like that’s more fun.
“It’s like a theme park, and the theme is weed.” — Tara Ramdonee
Last week, JD and I stumbled into the Red Light District. This week, Tara, Lucy, and I discovered the Green Light District. Taking Nikita’s wonderful advice, we made it an obligation to explore Christiania, the “most ghetto, but safe” place in Copenhagen. Two things ran through my mind when I heard that statement. First, everywhere is probably safe for Nikita (the Latvian White Bear), because nobody in their right mind would threaten him. Second, if it was a ghetto, safe place, I imagined that Nikita probably was talking about some hipster hangout.
What we found was exactly as Tara aptly described above. I would’ve taken a few photos, but there’re signs posted everywhere that have a cancel sign over a camera, indicating that I would probably be badly harmed if I let the camera whore inside of me take over. There was weed. Everywhere. If you bought two burgers, you’d get a joint for free. I could probably count the number of people who weren’t high out of their minds on my hand. Don’t worry mum, we didn’t smoke. We did, however, grab a few beers and have a pretty great conversation. However, the rest of the night wasn’t exactly noteworthy. While looking for some clubs in the area, we somehow stumbled upon some eighteen year old’s Danish birthday party where they played Soulja Boy Tell ‘Em.
On Sunday morning, Lucy recommended that we go to this nice little cafe called Bankeraat for lunch. She kept talking about these “stuffed animals” and how these things were dressed up, and knowing the Hello Kitty die-hard that Lucy is, I expected something similar to Sanrio. What we found was this:
Going to the restroom was an even more interesting experience. First off, the rooms with toilets don’t have lights. Second, they have jump scares like this around the corner when you go down this steep, curled staircase into the secluded basement that houses the restroom that people use on a day to day basis:
But other than the fact that I felt like I’ve just stumbled upon the set of American Horror Story, the food was good.
All of these experiences were humorous and interesting, in a way, simply because they didn’t align with expectations. What I’m learning from all this traveling is that the world becomes unbelievably exciting when you escape expectation and let yourself float off in any direction you feel is right. I’ll talk about one last experience, and it’ll be the more sentimental of the three. Ready yourself for the strange abstractions.
Lucy was convinced- absolutely convinced- that the Little Mermaid Statue would be one of the prime tourist attractions of København. And she was right, but not for the reasons she thought were right. Here’s a picture of the Little Mermaid and all its glory:
That’s it. A dinky boulder with Ariel chilling up top. I think my friend Eric Sohng actually would’ve made a much better mermaid than the statue itself. In fact, I have photographic evidence (Warning: Adult Content). What was amazing about it was that heaps and crowds of tourists huddled around the rock, fighting for a prize spot with the star of Copenhagen.
However, there was value there, and it was in the water. I think I’ve slowly come to realize that if I were to belong to any element in the world, I belonged to the water. Right next to the statue, there was a small, unassuming strip of land where the water met Copenhagen.
For a good while, I sat there alone and retreated far beneath the surface into my thoughts. The water felt so vast and immense, and it kept me entranced during the entirety of Lucy’s photo-op (probably thirty minutes). And somehow, something unexplainable in me clicked, and I felt a pull from the world to explore everything. By that, I mean parts of South America and the rest of Asia sometime next year, etc. You can’t really explain moments like these, but they shape you and change you, and they grant you new freedoms that slowly become part of your basic human needs.
Quote of the trip:
“Shall we summon an Über?”
- Tara Ramdonee, our British friend
Perhaps it’s that I’ve grown too busy with work and travel. Perhaps it’s that I’ve really just stopped counting the weeks as I have the past month and fully adopted that Carpé Diem lifestyle. Perhaps it’s both (it’s probably both), but for some odd reason, I have been finding it so much more difficult to sit myself down to continue documenting my trip here. But I’ve started it, and I wouldn’t be proud of myself if I stopped it mid-way. Old Nathan would be fine with that. New Nathan is too, but for some reason there’s a bit more guilt attached to quitting midway.

Berlin is fucking rebellious, and I love it. In Stockholm, if you act slightly out of place in a public setting, you’ll probably be arrested shortly afterward for disturbing the peace (of course I’m exaggerating, but you get what I’m saying). So being in a city where there’s graffiti on every building, drug dealers at every metro stop, and amazing street performers scattered throughout sidewalks was especially refreshing for me.
Story time: As short-lived as the trip was, it was full of unexpected encounters, and not in the same respect as the other trips have been. Because rather than encountering beautiful vantage points and little local treasures, I shared some odd coincidences with people who I either met or, more or less, shared ‘peculiar’ ties with.
These coincidences happened a few times, but I’m only going to talk about the mind-blowing one because, well, who the hell wants to hear about anything else. On the last night I was staying in Berlin, Ray decided to stay at home. Makes total sense for him, because he doesn’t enjoy going out all that much. But for me, staying in would have been a crime because, well, I was in Berlin. And Berlin’s insane.
So I had a two options. I could try and make friends with strangers at the hostel and venture through the night with them, or I could go solo and pray that I would have fun and not look like that creepy lonely rando that you make a conscious effort to avoid on a night out.
Option One failed miserably, because everyone I spoke with in the hostel was 30+ years old and talking about heroine/death metal. Left with Option Two, I went off in some random direction and, as per the advice of my brilliant friend Stefan, just followed crowds. When I got off the metro, I saw a group of people speaking English with pretty strong American accents (yes, we have accents), and my first reaction was “Those kids are definitely in high school.” My second reaction was “Those kids are definitely from California.” I was completely off with the first guess, but spot on for the second one.
Ironically, when I passed by the group, I overheard one of the girls whisper to her friend that I was definitely from California. I guess cut-off tank tops and joggers throw you right in that bucket. And effectively, me being the desperate, lonely rando looking for friends, I turned around and, well, made friends.
Two of them were from Orange County, and all of them were juniors at Northwestern. And the crazy part is that they’re all relatively good friends with the group of Northwestern students that I met in Beijing last summer. Details aside, we had a pretty fun night, and I’m meeting up with a few of them when I get back to California in September. Despite all the wanderlust I’ve been feeling lately, there was always this anxiety attached to the thought of traveling alone. But that night helped me realize that when you’re more or less screwed with no friends, you’ll find ways to meet people.
—
Other than that, most of the trip consisted of photo-ops and (even more) aimless wandering. You could probably get the gist of the trip by scrolling through my album, since I upload enough photos to irritate the majority of my friends list, but I’ll skim through a few highlights.
Bonanza Cafe. Cool place. It’s where I wrote the Week 4 post, so if I seemed over dramatic/sentimental, it’s because they were playing in Nils Frahm in the background.
I always have these recurring nightmares where I either get hit by a car or drive off a cliff. So, being the grim and morbid child that I am, this photo’s actually pretty important to me.
For some reason, this section of East Side Gallery made me so happy I almost cried. Not entirely sure why, but I guess it was a short reassurance that even if things go to shit, everything will more or less be OK.
Random Notes:
The thing with counting is that people usually count what they’re not all too fond of. We count push ups, the minutes of a long, boring meeting, the number of days before we can see a loved one again- we count because, in those few moments, our mind becomes fixated on the passing of time.
And quite frankly, when I first landed in Stockholm, I started counting. I counted the few hours I slept each night when getting accustomed to the early rise and late shine of Stockholm Sun. I counted the number of weeks until JD arrived, and the number of surface-level trips to various countries that I used as superficial fuel to rejuvenate myself. And, by nature of this blog, I counted the weeks. Each week was tinted with its own ordeal that made me mildly uncomfortable at best, and to compensate for the discomfort, I wrote. Every point in your life- even the dry bits- can seem so much more interesting when you put pen to paper and document it all in story. Unfortunately, when that happens, you run the risk of living for photographs and “serendipity,” while casting everything else off as mundane. Trust me, it’s a pretty miserable perspective to have on life. Happiness becomes short-lived.
Roughly two weeks ago, I had a conversation with Nicole (Andrea’s Girlfriend! Go Andrea :D!) about how we’re both restless souls- the way four walls can transform into prison bars if too much time is spent at home. Eventually, we also spoke about how ridiculously unsustainable that is. And thankfully, when I started complaining about the the ‘vanilla-ness’ of Sweden and ranting about my wonderful wanderlust and need for novelty, she called me out on, well, how ridiculously unsustainable I was. Well Nicole, you got through to me pretty well, and I am infinitely grateful for that.
Recently, I haven’t written much, and I think it’s because I’ve stopped counting. I still love seeing the world and exploring and wandering, but it’s no longer what keeps me afloat. It’s been a process, and I can’t deny that, but I’ve really learned to find joy in the bits and pieces of life that I would have otherwise disregarded as ‘boring.’ Here’s a short list to give you an idea:
Come Friday, and I’ll be in London with my supposed ‘fiancée’, and come September 4th, I’ll be home. I can’t say that I’ve emerged a completely different person, but I can say that right now, I feel happy- sustainably happy- in the way that almost seems infectious enough to drown out the white noise.
How I’ve Changed:

“If life were as simple as a day in July, would we honor it so?” — P. J. Gordon
Can we honor the act of doing nothing more often? Would we tire of the nothingness? This reminds me of what some people picture retirement as, and I’ve witnessed many who tire from nothingness; they yearn for regimented days of rules and restrictions. They worked all of their lives to be free, and now that they’re free, they miss their cage. It reminded me of Stockholm Syndrome. When someone has been held captive, they develop a psychological bond of trust and belonging with their captor. In my poem, I put the captor as our life’s occupation.
Stockholm Syndrome is what retirees fear.
We worked all our lives waiting on the year
“What will we do with all the extra hours?”
“Guess we can finally tend the flowers.”
“What will become of the position I held?”
“Will they remember me? All I regaled?”
Years gone, time spent being fully engaged,
Almost free, but it’s hard to leave the cage.
~ P. J. Gordon
Retirement can be likened to graduation from high school. You worked hard for it, you’ve done it, now what?

I wasn’t going to write about the election since it gets exhausting. But if you’re like me, you find it increasingly difficult to understand how some of your friends, co-workers, and family members continue to support President Trump. Not because of policy disagreements over everything, although there’s plenty to go around, but because of who Trump is.
Stockholm, Wisconsin is a town of 88 people last time I checked. Almost 70% of them voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012. But most voted for Trump in 2016.
Four years later, it’s time to take an audit of this president before you vote again.
It’s not that everything Trump’s ever done is horrific, although there’s plenty of that to go around, too.
I’m not oblivious to the fact that he got NATO to pay their fair share of expenses defending Europe, despite decades of American presidents asking deaf European nations to pay more. Trump defeated ISIS in Syria. I mean, when’s the last time you even heard of that group since Trump. He brought Israel and numerous Arab countries together. UAE and Bahrain to start, but I have no doubt that we’ll see another four or five peace agreements follow soon. Maybe more.

25–27 Sep remembered on 8 Oct
After another 12-minute walk from the US embassy, I arrived at Etnografiska Museet, where everything converged.
This was where Peng worked during his time in Sweden, also the home of most of Sven Hedin’s collection. I spent 150 SEK for the ticket. The size of the museum is slightly smaller than I expected, but of course, it wouldn’t be fair to compare it with the British Museum or Musée du quai Branly. The first exhibition I encountered on the ground floor was Yokai, an exhibition about the Japanese Yokai culture (something ghostly or monstrous, but not exactly ghosts or monsters). It was well-curated, informational while entertaining. I was not sure if the credit should go to the Etnografiska Museet or other institutions who co-curated it. However, it was recommendable.
Despite its good quality, for a Taiwanese, Yokai culture is not something unfamiliar, and it also wasn’t the reason of my visit. So I quickly browsed through, and moved upstairs to continue my search.
When I was at the entrance, I saw one of the current exhibitions called “We are Seediq”. I thought to myself that “Oh, there is an indigenous group in Taiwan also called Seediq. What a coincidence.” Turned out that the exhibition was about the indigenous group in Taiwan. The exhibition was small, but again, well-curated and informational.
It is hard to describe how moved I was. I believe that it was the first exhibition that I’ve ever liked in any ethnographic museum. I am sure by now you can imagine, as someone like me, it’s impossible to be completely comfortable, seeing how these items were raided by Eurocentric collectors, explorers, or let’s be honest, colonisers, in the past, and seeing how the cultures were interpreted, as if there weren’t, or aren’t, any actual human beings attached to the said culture. It has always been something fascinating while irritating for me to visit ethnographic museums.
The curatorial concept of this exhibition started with a number of mysterious items as part of the museum collection, from an unsurprisingly problematic source. (What I love about it was also that the “problematic source” was clearly stated in the exhibition.) The reason I said “mysterious”, was because it was actually wrongly labelled as items from Atayal originally, instead of Seediq, due to the mis-categorization from the Japanese colonisation.
“We are Seediq” was co-curated among a number of institutions, including the Seediq National Assembly, and the Indigenous Cultural Heritage Master’s Program of Providence University in Taiwan. The involvement of the “subject’ themselves could be seen everywhere.
First, the title, the “we” implies the existence of human subjects, instead of merely culture or items. It was coming from the mouth of the subjects, not observers. And all the texts written were in three languages — Swedish, English and Chinese. (I know it’s not Seediq, but at least it’s a language that most of the Seediq nowadays can understand.) The interviews of Seediq people were presented as one of the major elements in the centre of the room. The faces and voices were unavoidably seen and heard. What moved me the most was that one of the weaved fabrics in the collection was considered the oldest, documented Seediq weaving pattern preserved in the world. And the museum is working with the organisations in Taiwan to study the pattern in order to recreate them. Even writing about these is making me emotional.
The “collection” here is no longer some “dead” items lying inside a glass vitrine. The “culture” has become alive, moving, working, involving. Then there is a meaning. There is a reason for all of these to happen. I know one might say that the museum should return the stolen items to Taiwan for good. (The texts mentioned that the items were in Taiwan for a time being before being returned to the museum.) I understand it’s not perfect. But honestly, despite the problematic, upsetting source, can we, as Taiwanese, be confident that the items would be well-stored forever, in a professional context on the island? And just reading the texts in the exhibition of a culture that somehow I found adjacent to (I wouldn’t dare to say that it’s mine) in my native language, already gave me goosebumps, which is something I can never dream of seeing in places like the British Museum. I haven’t even started to mention how Taiwan, as a country, as an island with adjacent islands, was being presented correctly in the exhibition, which is again, something I can not dream of in a European context.
After seeing the exhibition, I couldn’t help but make an Instagram story, recommending it, tagging the museum. I received a kind message from someone who runs the account. I genuinely hope that all the exhibitions in ethnographic museums could make me feel this way. I also heard that there is someone from Taiwan working at Etnografiska Museet at the moment. I am sure that helped with what I saw.
Finally, at a corner on the 2nd floor, I found something from Sven Hedin, titled Golden Temple. It’s a model temple he commissioned to make, identical to a temple he encountered in Chengde, China.
I was surprised about how little collections from him were on display, so I asked the friendly staff at the information desk in case I missed anything. She explained that on the ground floor, where the Yokai exhibition is, was Hedin’s collection. but it was removed for the Yokai exhibition. I asked if the collection will come back after Yokai ends. She replied, slightly awkwardly, with a no. I was curious about her reaction, so I googled afterwards. Turned out that the Swedish historian Tommy Lundmark published a book recently, criticising the display of Hedin’s collection in the museum. He believed that the way the collection was displayed touched only lightly, perhaps too lightly, on Hedin’s support of Nazism. Despite that Hedin being a Nazi supporter was not a news anymore, the book seemed to stir more controversies than there was. And the museum, using the coming exhibitions as a cover, removed all the Hedin’s collection, with only the temple left.
It’s a complicated issue. I don’t feel like I have any position to judge. As a researcher, of course I would like to see his collection. However, I also believe that before figuring out a proper way to deal with the problematic history, removing the collection for the time being, was more than understandable.
After the conversation with the helpful staff, I moved on with my day.
The next stop was Hedinsgatan. After I arrived, I found out that “gatan” means “street” in Swedish, instead of “garden”, as I originally thought due to its pronunciation. So, Hedinsgatan, is a street named after Sven Hedin in Stockholm. It was just an ordinary street. I couldn’t find anything special. I also couldn’t figure out the reason why this street in particular was chosen to be given the name. It was not specially close to where he used to live, or the cemetery, or the museum. It remained a mystery to me till this day.
Finally, it was five. We were back to Historiska Museet. I couldn’t find anything from Sven Hedin here, however, after knowing what happened to Etnografiska Museet, I doubt if the museum would want to point out which items were actually from Hedin anyway.
A cute anecdote happened was that, when I arrived, there was a celebratory event of the independence day of Armenia. A lady downstairs asked me to sign on the RSVP list, and I was confused, saying that I was only here to see the exhibition, so she let me pass. After going upstairs, witnessing the champaign and catering of the party, I wished I had signed so I could join. I thought about blending in, however, with my cheap, slightly torn out jeans, and the oversized jacket as a charity from my friend in Berlin last year after losing all my clothes in a luggage, I had a feeling that the plan of blending in naturally would fail. So, I tearfully walked away from the champaign and the finger food.
After the museum, I stopped by a supermarket to grab some bread, cold cuts, spreads and a light beer (which had a significant meaning that I only understood in a few days). I sat down by a beautiful harbour, and started my dinner. I was surprised that I couldn’t see anyone else doing what I was doing. The view was stunning. I remembered sitting by the Seine everyday with friends, enjoying wines and picnic-made sandwich in Paris. After a while, the wind started to blow into my bones, and despite the sunny weather during the day, my fingers started to freeze, and suddenly I realised why I was the only person sitting on the floor at this harbour, picnicking.
The next day, I visited the Konstmuseet in Skövde by train, to drop my large suitcase, so I wouldn’t have to travel in Europe inconveniently while paying for the overpriced luggage fee charged by the budget airlines (and not to mention the fear of losing it again). The trip took me almost the whole day. The 10:30am train was delayed for half an hour, so I arrived at Skövde at around 1pm. After a pleasant chat with David, the technician of the museum, who is also someone from Goldsmiths Fine Art, I went back to the station for my 14:28 train, which was again delayed for 45 minutes, and I ended up arriving at Stockholm Central after 5pm.
With some not-so-worth-mentioning anecdotes happening on the train, I arrived back at the hotel with a sense of relief, since everything I needed to do for work in Stockholm these days was done. To celebrate, I decided to take advantage of the gym downstairs. After spending 30 minutes on treadmills and other machines that I can not name, I felt like a human again. I know the ecstasy was all psychological, as a relief from the anxiety of aging and weight-gaining. Gym is a middle-class fantasy of a healthy life. When I was running on the treadmill, I believed that I was no longer the girl wearing the torn-out jeans, having cheap sandwiches and light beer sitting by the harbour, freezing, fantasising about the free champagne at other people’s parties. Whatever that was, it helped. I loved going to gyms, delusional or not.
I decided to spend my last day in Stockholm (this time) with art. After my last luxurious breakfast at Hotel Expo, I sadly said goodbye to it, and took a train and a bus to Karolinska Institute. It was where Carl Gustaf Bernhard, the host of Peng during his stay in Sweden, worked. I took some photos, and moved on to the Moderna Museet. Moderna Museet is a modern and contemporary art museum in Stockholm, connected to Arkdes, a design and architecture museum. Luckily, Arkdes offers free admission throughout the year of 2024, so I visited both museums in the afternoon, before heading to the airport, taking my 19:45, SAS flight to Heathrow, London.
I guess it’s about time to face this.

Aftab
We begin with Aftab (Persian for ‘sun’s beautiful rays). Let’s send Aftab to a school friend you’ve lost touch with and would like to reconnect to.
How do you send Aftab — close your eyes for 10 secs and send the suns rays to those you have in your heart. And add to this “<name> may you be at peace, may you be happy” and turn that to yourself “may I be happy, may I be at peace”
For the past 2–3 years, I’ve had the privilege of coaching a tremendously talented former colleague on and off. Our most recent engagement concluded last Friday, and I’ve come to realize that one of the most valuable words she needs in her life right now is “No.”….and that too for turning clients away who are no longer a match for her. This message is for her and for any of you as it may offer guidance to some of you in similar situations.
No, Nada, Nee, Nej, Non
“Really successful people say no to almost everything.” — Warren Buffett
What perhaps got you to the level of success you’re at today is saying YES to almost every opportunity. What will get you to your next level of success is saying NO to almost every opportunity.
Which is why I’m going to share with you the single most powerful tool to take your life, career and…

Before I go on with these holy thoughts, I must mention — Everything in KFC is overpriced. I think they are doing child trafficking for the chickens they serve their customers. So small, you start to wonder if they even allowed the chicken to walk before cooking it.
I even battled a bit of food poisoning in the end. What a way to start the week.
That said, if we stretch it far enough, it’s not hard to see how the whole Stockholm Syndrome narrative could be pushed into some rather unholy territory. I find myself thinking about how people grow up loving the very parents who used to beat the living daylight out of them.
If you’ll allow me the looseness, it doesn’t feel like a huge leap to draw a parallel with those who stay in abusive relationships, covering bruises with excuses and clinging to the people who hurt them.
Few things unsettle me more than watching a person tenderly unpack the logic behind getting brutalized by the very hands that claim to love them. It feels like a kind of demonic possession — something ancient, cruel, and crawling beneath the skin. And if we’re ranking horrors, this one isn’t coming in second.
I think it's Stockholm Syndrome, just nuanced a little.
I’m beginning to understand that there are some gentle themes to healthy living, and it…

Ever had the sneaking suspicion that the corporations you hate have trapped you in an endless buying cycle?
You’re confronted with sobering stats about the effects of smartphone addiction on mental health, but your phone’s the first thing you reach for in the morning. You’ve watched that documentary about the true cost of fast fashion to the environment, but you can’t resist those $10 yoga pants. You’re appalled by the piles of waste generated by single-use plastic, but you still get your coffee to-go in disposable cups and your food delivered every day. You fully understand how algorithms are designed to harvest your attention online for profit, but you feverishly refresh your Instagram feed.
Why does the captive start falling in love with the captor, who suddenly seems so indispensable and necessary for survival? Why do we hate how brands use and treat us, but keep going back for more? Consider this: your brand loyalty and relationship with monolithic corporations might actually be a version of Stockholm Syndrome.
First, big brands lure you in with the product and create the illusion of scarcity, making you feel like doing without it isn’t an option. And then, when you’re finally held hostage, even the slightest act of generosity will get the company in your good graces (see: corporate social responsibility and activist ad campaigns). In time there’s some scandal or controversy with clear evidence that the brand is causing unnecessary harm to reap immense profits — but you remain loyal through it all, even feeling friendliness where there should be fear, admiration where there should be contempt.
This is one of the most despair-inducing aspects of Stockholm Syndrome: in the end, even after being released, the captive defends the captor.
Various scholars and experts have tried to put a finger on why. A book on surveillance capitalism by Shoshana Zuboff here, an explosive Medium article on Capitalist Stockholm Syndrome by Umair Haque there. Trouble is, we often don’t even realize we’re being held hostage. The recently viral, user-generated “10 Year Challenge,” where people post then-and-now photos of themselves on social media, is actually an astroturfed meme to train Facebook’s facial recognition capabilities, speculates Kate O’Neill from Wired. In 2009, you logged into Facebook. In 2019, Facebook logs into you.
Worse yet, brands themselves admit they aren’t good for us — it’s one of the ways they keep us in line, so to speak. Apple wants to help curb your iPhone addiction with Screen Time, a new feature that breaks your smartphone usage down to the specific apps in the hopes of motivating you to spend your time differently. Cigarette conglomerate Philip Morris International just embarked on an anti-smoking campaign as part of their vision of a smoke-free future. And in what sounds like a headline from The Onion, Coca-Cola and other junk food giants in China have successfully been funding the narrative that exercise — not cutting down on sugar — can fight obesity. They use their role in creating “solutions” to problems in which they, themselves, are complicit to generate positive PR, reeling us right back in.
Why, despite all this, do we remain brand-loyal? In the 2018 dark comedy Sorry To Bother You, union organizer Squeeze explains, “If you get shown a problem but have no idea how to control it, then you just decide to get used to the problem.”
There’s also nobody else for us to go to. A protest sign spotted at the 2019 Women’s March highlighted the fact that that there’s more public trust in gas station sushi than in President Trump, which isn’t a total exaggeration. Amazon and Google beat political parties and the state government as some of the most trusted entities in an American Institutional Confidence Poll conducted online by YouGov in 2018.
In recent years, capitalism’s sheen has (finally) started fading. Today only 19% of Americans ages 18 to 29 identify themselves as “capitalists”, and the trend goes hand-in-hand with the rising popularity of the Democratic Socialist values espoused by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.
This week marks the start of the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting, attended by hundreds of the world’s most powerful leaders. The United States’ Trump, France’s Macron and Britain’s May could not make it because they are busy tending to crises at home with big economic implications — the partial government shutdown, Yellow Vest protests and Brexit. It behooves the meeting’s attendees to acknowledge that our economic systems are in serious disrepair, and that rapidly rising income inequality is a feature, not a bug, of late stage capitalism.
So how do we ensure that we don’t fall prey to Stockholm Syndrome yet again, making new excuses and justifications for the next generation of brands as we wrestle free from the mega-corporations that control so much of our lives today?
As we enter the fourth industrial revolution, we need to reconsider the role and purpose of the corporation on our planet, and weed out the put-up-or-shut-up variety of consumerism. In his new book Prosperity, Colin Mayer of Oxford’s Saïd Business School offers a new definition for private companies: “Producing profitable solutions to problems of people and planet.” Will we keep condoning the harm that some corporations inflict on society and the environment, or will we demand that they do more, do better? It’s time for the captive to thwart the captor.

Long time no see, or at least on English. I have started to write a bit more on Swedish and more company and It-security focused articles. The reasons behind it is somewhat because of i have started a company! Finally i have teased about it for some time now, am i right?!
So https://lysellssecurityandtech.com aka Lysells Security And Tech AB is live and up and running as a fully working company with stocks and CEO and management and so on, “only” me and my wife still but it is a real company :D
Therefore i will move and probably write a bit more on my new website, with a bit more focus on Security parts and what is happening within security, more focus on companies and Enterprises. But fear not i will write more here on Medium but probably a bit more like write-ups, personal thoughts and stuff that maybe not is compliant with company blogs and stuff.
So as of 12th of august i am traveling to Stockholm, Solna to be precise, every Sunday i take the train up and Thursday i travel home again, it is a lot of time being spent in Stockholm where i am work as an It-security Architect for a financial company and during the nights i try to be busy writing articles, Talks and trying to get a bit more customers where i can help out with Security work. Just to keep busy and i love to work with Security so it is a win-win situation, and if i can work as much as i want to on the evenings when i am in Stockholm that means i can focus fully on Wife, Dogs and Family when i am home, i may even not need to work on Fridays either, so that means i will have 2.5 days home with family and wifey.
But the thing is because i am working and travelling that much i have setup some timeplanning as well, so Sunday and Saturday is full family time the phone is “off” and i focus on private time, Fridays will be a mix, i will often sleep in a bit because i often get home at midnight or even later but then on Friday i will be available for calls and some work-meetings, i do have planned some talks and lunch meetings often on Fridays so often half days.
That is one thing i recommend, plan your time so you get recovery and quality time with the loved ones, for me as a workoholic i work best to do some work on Fridays just for my own sanity and that is the time i have NOT being on other assignments so it is the right thing for me do some work and often many clients wind down on the afternoon of a Friday so friday until lunch is a way to get some stuff done.
But then be able to have the Friday evening, Saturday and Sunday off and get that quality time is golden. I will probably do some every other week in the future not doing it every week as i am doing now, because it costs a lot of money living at hotels and being away from family is tough. But for now it is a fun adventure and the travel home 5–6 hours is often a good way to wind down even if the way home is the worst one, you just want to get home and you cannot get there fast enough!
This was just a word blob, basically a brain dump of my thoughts and some tips and tricks.
But until next time! Be safe on the internet and be safe!

Disclaimer: My story tackles racial prejudice, not to downplay the seriousness of the issue but to highlight its absurdity. So grab your fika or popcorn, and let’s discover the absurdity of racism.
This is my story of how an unpleasant incident had an influencing impact on my life forever.
In 1980, in Stockholm, Sweden, two Swedish colleagues and I decided to walk to the harbour for coffee. We chatted about work, Swedish girls, and beer, matching our quick steps down the lane.
Suddenly, out of nowhere, a white stranger started shouting, “Du, svarta hund, försvinn från min stad.” We froze!
My two colleagues realised that the racial slur was directed at me since I was darker than them. The stranger noticed I didn’t speak Swedish and shouted, “You, black dog, get out of my town!” Those words were sharp and hurtful. It was the first time anyone had called me a black dog.
I felt angry and sad about what had happened.
I was enraged at the ignorance behind the words and sorry for the man who said them. It made me realise that some people will…

The only thing worse than being taken captive is sympathizing and bonding with your captor. But what if our captors are our own beliefs and aspirations?
A friend sent me a blog post that stopped me in my tracks. After reading Chip’s Wounded Entrepreneur post, I immediately went to LinkedIn to reach out to him.
His lived experience and deeply personal message resembled the lives of so many of the founders and entrepreneurs I work with. Touching upon the topic of suicide, that post was a wake-up call.
That’s the driving energy behind Founders Thriving. I wanted to create a space for entrepreneurs and founders to begin developing a healthier relationship between themselves and their companies. A place to build and grow your company but be happy doing it.
The Cult of Ourselves
We all need to begin addressing the cultish beliefs that make up the abusive relationships we so willingly endure with the companies we run. What these stories represent is how easy it is to be held captive by the companies we run; physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.
Most entrepreneurs launch their endeavor with dreams F-R-E-E-D-O-M. Financial freedom, schedule freedom, and the freedom not to report to a boss.
At least those were their original north-star goals.
But ever-so-slowly we silently mortgage away that freedom until we’re caged in by the one thing we thought would free us from the trappings of a normal 9 to 5.
Then like many long-term hostage situations, we begin to bond and sympathize with our captor. Gradually abandoning the people who love and support us in our greatest times of need.
Vicious Cycle
Unfortunately, after launching startups for freedom, what usually happens is entrepreneurs slowly trade in these opportunities to assert our freedom for personal ultimatums: “I’ve gotta do this to [insert infinite to-do-list here]” scenarios. Before they know it they’re reporting to employees and investors, working more hours, and making less money than many of their own staff. #founderseatlast
Version 1.0 of our early programming usually has two hard-coded beliefs. First, putting ourselves first is selfish. Second, our self-worth is largely dependent on our net worth.
If we get good grades we’ll go to a good school. If we go to a good school, we’ll get a high-paying job. If we get a high-paying job, we’ll simply acquire everything we need to be happy.
Now layer on the toxic startup tropes of kill it, crush it, hustle, and struggle and you have a perfect recipe for an emotional or mental meltdown.
I can’t count the number of founders I work with whose goal is to “make their first million.” I call this the “Miserable Millionaire Fallacy.”
Rarely do these founders know where this thought comes from. It’s simply always been there. It’s like a hidden feature that was included in Version 1.0 and bug fixed and patched to fix our current life circumstances.
It’s not until they’ve gotten everything they dreamed of, and are still unhappy, that they begin exploring other means of happiness, purpose, and fulfillment.
Exorcise Exercise
One good way to assess this in yourself or an entrepreneur you’re working with is to have them visualize their company as a real person. Then imagine having an intimate and honest conversation with that person.
Are they kind, encouraging, and supportive? Or are they negative and condescending; taking every opportunity to remind you you’re an imposter?
When you use this personified entity approach and add a dollop of psychology you’ll find that many entrepreneurs begin to sympathize with their captor and have begun to develop deep feelings of codependency with their personified company.
When the company is successful, they are well. When the company is suffering, so do they.
The beauty of this simple exercise is that once an entrepreneur recognizes the pattern, the turn-around can be incredibly fast. The first step is acknowledging your company is not human; therefore it is not capable of taking actions for or against you or making you think or feel anything.
The second requires an acknowledgment that you are wholly responsible for your thoughts and the resulting emotions that come from those thoughts. Based on those two steps, it is 100% within your control to change the relationship you have with your company.
To unwind the default programming of our formative years we need to encourage founders to normalize new behavior and make it ok to prioritize their needs first; essentially, an upgrade to Founder Version 2.0. By prioritizing their needs above the needs of the business, their co-founders, and their investors, business owners regain the agency needed to heal the relationship with their business.
The mission of the MEA is to reframe midlife — from a crisis to a calling. And if that calling is to share your wisdom with up-and-coming entrepreneurs then let’s create a safe space to meet in the middle.
My dream is for Founders Thriving to help prepare those entrepreneurs to work with all of you. I believe that if we take care of ourselves first we can show up more fully resourced for our teams, our families, and our community. Then together, we can all Build Something Better!
If you know a business owner stuck in their own Startup Stockholm Syndrome or someone ready and willing to prioritize their needs first, please send them over to Founders Thriving and join the movement.

Ahh Disney.. The corporate machine that’s been printing money by selling your dreams back to you is a .. tale as old as time.. you could say.
But while I’m always ready to engage in good faith and justified criticism of this behemoth marketing machine, I’m not in love with criticism that points the finger at problems that don’t exist.
Today, I had a conversation with a dear friend who brought up one of the original criticisms of Beauty and the Beast that I haven’t heard mentioned in years. This friend brought up the belief that some people have alleging Belle was suffering from Stockholm syndrome, that she didn’t have enough agency in the film, and that the story is problematic in the world that exists in 2021.
Since this friend of mine is in the process of producing a live theatrical production of Beauty and the Beast, it immediately became my highest priority to disabuse her of this belief.
I, of course, sent her some rambling messages to get my point across, but after making my point, I still wasn’t satisfied. So here I am.

I love Chigozie Obi’s artistry and I love her personality even more, so it made so much sense that I desired to have a conversation with her.
Two failed attempts at meeting and a birthday pool party after, Chigozie and I finally linked, and we had a conversation about everything — from love to relationship dynamics, fitness, friendships, work and her love for Lagos that may suggest she has Stockholm syndrome. The conversation was so good that we planned a second date.
I walked into Basilico — where Chigozie had been working all afternoon — some minutes before 4pm. I scanned through the floor but couldn’t find her until she popped up from the lounge in a corner, wearing a smile so wide and looking so good, as ever, in a lovely dress. She was excitingly taller than I pictured or, if I’m being honest, I was probably shorter than I thought.“Oh my God, you look so beautiful in person,” I said. Chigozie is more beautiful in person.“You too!” She exclaimed in a smile. “I love your top,” she said.“Thank you!”“I’m so sorry I dressed down. Had a crazy gym session,” she said, walking in a limp. Chigozie has been in the gym for a year now and is notorious for tweeting about the woes of exercising, whilst showing up everyday.“That’s so true! I should have worn slippers,” I said, looking at my flat heels and then back at her pair of white slippers. “Sorry about your pain. You’re really trying o. I’ve attempted the gym twice and I’ve quit twice,” I said, chuckling.She laughed. “How?”“I didn’t have a trainer and thought I could wing it like people say. Although the first time, a friend was my gym partner until she moved. The second time, I was checking out YouTube and stuff for routines. So both were sort of epic fails. I think I lasted two weeks for both,” I said, chuckling.Chigozie laughed. “I have a trainer though.”“Yea, I saw. How has that been for you?”“I really like it. I like that I can just go in there without having to think of what I want to do, and just let someone else think for me and instruct me. My only job is to just show up.”I giggled. “I like that.”“Yeah,” she said. “I see you have a new hair done,” I said, looking at her black braids.Chigozie’s eyes beamed. “Yea, I did it yesterday,” she said, excitedly. Her excitement was so real, it was contagious.“It’s really pretty,” I continued in admiration.“Thank you. I like your beads too. You look like an African Queen.”I chuckled in excitement. “Thank you!”Compliments are ten times better when they come from women.
“How are you? How has Lagos been for you?” Chigozie asked, looking at me.“It’s been okay, it’s been chill. I miss my family sometimes though,” I replied.“Where’s family?”“My family home’s at Ekiti.”“Oh okay.”“What?” I asked chuckling.“No, Ekiti is very chill.”“Yeah, it’s very slow too, and then Lagos is pretty fast. Too fast.”“Yeah, I really love the mountains as well. It’s very serene.”“Have you been?”“Yeah. I went in secondary school to…”“Ikogosi,” I finished her statement and we burst out laughing.“Exactly, exactly,” she said in a smile. “Then I went again for an Art Bootcamp. I think that was when I really explored. I went to Ikogosi again, but I also went around town and stuff, and I was a bit older. It wasn’t like a school thing, so we had more freedom. It’s a really beautiful place.”“Lots of mountains everywhere.”“Yeah. When I travel outside of Lagos I discover we’re not chilling here at all. It’s so fast-paced and so chaotic.” Chigozie laughed.“Very chaotic.”“But the thing is that I feel like I have stockholm syndrome. Anytime I leave Lagos, I get homesick and want to come back almost immediately.”“Really?”“Yeah. For example, when I went to Abuja, I was homesick in the first couple of days. It was pretty slow and I was shocked because I thought Abuja was like the ‘next Lagos’ or something, but nah.”“Abuja is actually so dead, not gonna lie,” I said, chuckling.“For real, but apparently, the people who live there like it so much.”“And when they come here also, they want to go back. They basically can’t stand Lagos either,” I said.“Exactly. When we tweet about Abuja, they’re usually like, “No, don’t come o. We don’t want you here.”I laughed. “For real.”“I want to go back again though; just to chill or relax.”“How many times have you been?” I asked.“Once.”“Me too.”“It’s crazy how I got really home sick when I traveled to London last year for a residency, too. I think the best time to travel to London is summer, maybe June or July, when everywhere is bright. It’s very beautiful then.”“When did you go?”“I went in April. There was a lot of rain and the weather was so gloomy,” Chigozie said, irritated at the thought of it. “I get. I hate gloomy weather so much. It’s such a mood dampener.”“Exacly! I made a lot of friends though, but depression was really… was really hitting. I was like ‘Ahahn.’” It felt like she was recounting a traumatic experience.I laughed. “I was so happy on the night I got back to Lagos,” Chigozie said, shaking her head.“You were like ‘freedom at last!’” I exclaimed in a chuckle.“Yes o. Lagos is very chaotic, but it’s still home.”“If you could live in anywhere else asides Lagos, where would you live?”“I think Ghana.”“Yeah? You traveled there earlier this year right?”“Yeah, I did,” Chigozie said. “Ghana is kind of like Nigeria in some sense. Asides the borders being close, there’s a lot of similarities between us in some ways, with the people and culture.”“Yeah. That makes sense.”
We continued our talk about how chaotic Lagos is and how comfortable it is to take walks in Abuja compared to how abysmal it is to do so in Lagos without being catcalled or enraged by drivers who threaten to hit you with their cars. Chigozie then tells me that she would love to move to a place large enough to ride a bicycle in.
“Oh you can ride a bike?”She puts on a slightly judgmental look. “Yes I can. Funnily enough, whenever people tell me they can’t ride a bike, I’m like how?” she asked squinting in disbelief.“What do you mean?” I was almost ready to fight.“What were you doing when you were younger?” Chigozie asked, confused.“Not riding a bike, I guess?” I giggled. “When did you start riding a bike?”“I can’t really remember, but I was pretty young.”“Do you have a bike?”“No I don’t have a bike right now,” Chigozie said. “Bikes are so expensive now, so I’ve heard.”“Yea, I heard too. Me, I was thinking maybe it was like 100k or something.”“Me, I thought it was 30k o, I swear.”We let out a laugh. “Even bikes are expensive right now. Everything is so expensive”“For real. Funny thing is that I made a tweet one time; something in the line of ‘How come you don’t know how to ride a bicycle?’ That’s how some people took it personally. I was like please nau.”I chuckled. “You were like ‘Sorry, I didn’t mean to.’”“See. One person said I was classist or something.”I laughed out loudly. “How did we get here?”Chigozie chuckled. “It was crazy because my friends and I would joke about it and we’d laugh, you get? After I gave the girl my reply, I just blocked her. That’s alright, that’s alright.”I chuckled.“It was obviously a joke, you know? Me, I don’t know how to swim and I’m 26 right now.”“I can’t swim either. I attempted one time and I almost drowned,” I said.“Me too! I’ve almost drowned as well,” she said in a knowing tone. I gasped like I had just made a fun discovery of shared trauma. “It was a terrible day. It was very scary.”“Exactly. And you wouldn’t be able to do anything.”“You’re just there!”“For real.”
We spoke for a while longer about swimming, the injury she sustained on her knee — that led to the failure of our first attempt at meeting— and how random events can make efforts on skincare futile.Chigozie also told me about how she had initially planned to have a birthday pool party at the restaurant we were, until she was told that there was a minimum spend of 500k.“That’s so crazy because you didn’t even know what you were going to order for yet,” I said with a surprised look on my face.“Thank you. It didn’t make sense at all. And I was so disappointed because the guy who initially told me it was okay didn’t apologize for the inconvenience or whatever. I felt bad about it until a friend linked me to another location. It’s called 37 Lagos, and it was so good! Plus their pool is way larger than the one they have here.”“Oh real? Lagos restaurants are really coming up with this minimum spend thing and it’s so annoying,” I said, recounting my own experience.“It’s unnecessarily classist and annoying. I almost cancelled my birthday plans, but a friend linked me to another location.”“Do you have pictures from that day? I don’t think I saw them.”“Oh real? Are you sure?” “Yea. I think I only saw the pictures where you said you had a good day.”“Let me show you,” Chigozie said, opening her Twitter app and scrolling through her media. I spotted a viral video of Trevor Jackson covering Tyla’s Water — Chigozie had posted the video earlier that day, and we laughed about it, knowingly.“You’re such a menace,” I said in a giggle.She laughed. “That video is so funny. I laugh every time I think about it.”
“How did you have a pool party without knowing how to swim though?” I asked on a lighter note while looking through the videos of her pool party, but I was genuinely curious. The pool was truly large.Chigozie chuckled. “So I basically just stood in the shallow end and was kicking my feet. I don’t know how to swim, but I love water. I love being in water.”“Interesting.”I found it even more interesting because she loved something that she almost drowned in.“Yeah.”
“So how are you right now?” I asked.She hesitated. “I’m just here. I’m okay. Turned a new age.”“How does that feel for you?”“In my head, I feel like I’m still 22, to be honest. Or 23. Every time, I’m like ‘Wow, I’m 26.’ Obviously, I don’t behave like a 22 or 23 year old, but in my head I feel like a baby. Like I’m still quite young.”“Like you’re just a girl,” I said amused.Chigozie smiled. “Exactly! Like I’m just a girl,” she said. “It doesn’t feel that much different, to be fair, but next year, especially with my work, I want it to be more successful. I feel like this year was calm, basically for resting. It was easy, more about figuring stuff out. I’m slowly getting into work mode already though, but next year will be awesome.”“Were you excited about your birthday?”“Yes, I was, actually. Usually, I’m not necessarily excited for my birthday, but this year I decided to be. Even when the plans for my birthday location fell through and I was sad, the next day, I got up and decided to be happy,” she said. “You only get one day to truly celebrate yourself — one day that’s for you, so I believe we should try to really enjoy those special days.”“Yea exactly. You’re not lying.”
Chigozie got a call that lasted for about a minute. A call that started with “Hi baby…” and sounded pretty intimate too.
“Are you in a relationship?”“So I got into one recently,” she said.“Oh so you’re new,” I said chuckling.She smiled — or blushed. “Yeah. I feel like I’ve known him for a while though. Like I’ve known him for the longest, which is really great because we kind of like eased into it.”“Yeah. I feel like going into relationships slowly makes a lot of sense; instead of just rushing into it.”“Exactly,” Chigozie said. “So it’s really nice. I feel like it’s one of those things that make life less difficult and crazy.”“I feel you. Having someone to text on those crazy days can be very sweet.”“For real,” she said. “Are you in a relationship?” “No,” I replied almost immediately and we both burst into a long laugh.“It’s the way you replied so fast for me,” Chigozie said in a laugh.“Oh my God. I didn’t know it came out so fast either,” I said, still laughing.“Are you like searching or something?”I hesitated. “I don’t know. I don’t think I’m actively searching,” I started. “I enjoy having crushes though,” I continued in a grin.“Crushes can be fun,” Chigozie said.“Yeah. I’m so done with situationships though. Like it’s enough.”“Thank you please!” She exclaimed in alliance.“I want something really sweet.”“You’ll find it.”“Were you looking for love when you found it?”“Not necessarily. I had gotten out of a thing when it happened.”“Oh you got out of a relationship this year?”“Yeah.” Chigozie paused. “Well, no.” She smiled. “We were pretty much undefined.”“A situationship?”She laughed. “More or less. Exactly.”I chuckled. “How was that?”“Never again o!” Chigozie exclaimed.We burst out into a laugh that said a lot about the crazy experiences we’ve both had.“Literally never again. I tell everyone I know not to go into situationships. Unless you’re both really okay with it, it’s fine,” Chigozie said.“Yeah.”“I think I’m a lover, to be honest. I’m a very big lover girl. So situationships are not my thing. I’ve not had a lot of them so when people talked about them, I was like ‘I can’t relate,’ until I related and was like ‘Omo, this thing is crazy o!’ I can’t be doing this please.”I laughed.“And I feel like situationship breakups hurt even more than relationship breakups. With relationships, you had that person, you experienced that person, but with situationships, it’s just something that never was.”“Exactly. It didn’t even happen, but like it was so exciting.”“Yeah, like so much impact still. So I don’t recommend for people who love love and are very soft because they’ll definitely fall in love. It’s even more risky when sex gets involved.”“For real. There’s this bond that’ll be created. A bond that might only be in your head. Like it’d be only you catching feelings.”“Yeah. So I think it’s best to just save yourself while it’s still early because the deeper you fall into it, the more hopeful you get and the more tragic the end is,” Chigozie said.She made a lot of sense.“I saw a video one time and it described how, with men, loving occurs in a process, but with women, they most likely have feelings for a man before they even start dating. There’s this rush already.”“Yeah! That’s so accurate. I think we get too emotionally connected and sometimes we don’t even know how connected we got until much later and we’re like ‘Wow. This thing really impacted and affected me.’”“Another thing I don’t like about situationships is how you can’t hold the other person accountable for the stuff they do that may have offended you, but with relationships, you can sit your partner down and explain in detail,” I said, tapping on the couch we were sitting on.Chigozie chuckled. “You would even have the right to have the conversation. Honestly, I feel like I can be so self aware with people, so I always like to check in. I never want to overstep my boundary or feel like I’m doing too much, so I always try to be clear. That’s not something I can enjoy doing in situationships.”“Yeah, for real.”“And when you get into healthy relationships, you realize you wasted so much time holding on to half-assed love,” Chigozie said.“Right?”
We talked further about how relationships hold so much weight and how important it is to be with someone who, according to Chigozie, would not be one of your 99 problems and would love communicating with you, even during fights.“The worst thing is when you’re an overthinker and you’re not with someone who loves listening to you and is interested in validating your feelings. Every action weighs on you,” Chigozie said.“Yeah, that’s so true,” I said. “I think that when somebody raises an issue or talks about a weird way you treated them, it’s not because they hate you. I think that if they tell you that you did this, it’s because they like you enough to talk about it and they still want you to be in their life.”“Exactly.”“And most times, how you see things might be different, but it’s so important to validate those feelings still. They’re not talking about what you meant or your intent, instead, they’re talking about how you made them feel.”“Yeah. And I feel it’s so important to be considerate in expressing your feelings too. I also believe it’s important to lay your feelings down on the table and talk things out — my friends have really helped me with this. You know, you might even end up apologizing, but at the end of the day, your connection grows stronger and that’s better than any ‘win.’”“For real. I really feel you on that.”
We talked more about conflict in relationships — be it romance or friendships — and how important it is to address issues with the other person in mind. We also talked about knowing when to let go of certain people when issues keep recurring and there’s no potential of a better relationship with them.
“So I want to ask a question about your artistry. How come all your paintings look like you?” My question was almost accusatory.
“It’s not even intentional,” Chigozie replied, giggling. “I’m not even doing it on purpose all the time. A lot of my paintings speak on things concerning me, so yeah those ones, but I actually don’t do it on purpose.” She paused. “Yeah, maybe I know my face so well and the way I paint sometimes reflects that, but I don’t mind it though because at the end of the day, a lot of the things I paint speak to me, so I feel like in that way, I’m just sharing pieces of myself with people and then, even though it’s unintentional, it makes my art more recognizable. So whenever people see my painting, they know it’s Chigozie that did that.”I smiled. “Yeah like ‘That’s Chigozie Obi’s art!’ I think that’s unique.”“Yeah.”“So have you ever had a solo exhibition in Lagos?”“So I had one at the Art X Lagos Fair. That was my first, but I want to have one next year. One that isn’t attached to an organization or body or something. Just completely mine. So hopefully that goes well.”“Yeah, it’ll go well. I’ll come.”“Yes, you have to come!” Chigozie exclaimed. “I have so many ideas I want to bring to life. Four fingers crossed that it goes well.” She chuckled, crossing her fingers.I laughed.
“So you’re a first daughter. Did you see those tweets about first daughters and pieces of advice for them?” I asked referencing a Twitter trend.“I saw a few and there was one I saw that said ‘Learn when to detach from people,’ and it really hit me,” Chigozie started. I feel like I hold on to people and give them multiple chances and I feel like that may have stemmed from my experience as a first daughter. I’ve learnt that I have to learn how to be myself first, and when I lost my Mum, I think it became a thing of ‘You’re the Mum now and you have to take care of your brother and your Dad,’ but eventually, I was like I still have my own life whilst still checking in and making sure they’re good.”“When did you lose your Mum?”“2019.”“Oh really?”“Yeah,” she paused. “After my Mum died, it sunk in that you can literally die at any moment, and when you die, nothing matters. Not the money, nothing at all. And even if people celebrate you on Earth, you’ll never know. So I find enjoying myself a big deal. It’s so important to me. I might not do it in the most extravagant way because money is so important, but I always try to find pockets of joy.”“And I think you have a lot of fun too,” I said.“Yeah, I try,” Chigozie said. “I think the misconception people have of me though, is that they think my life is so soft, like I have people who will dm me and be like ‘Chigozie, you just dey chop life o,’ but I’m like, I’m out here busting my ass o. I might not just show all the processes, but underneath all of that, it’s still work,” she said. I chuckled. “Yeah, I feel you.”“I take and post a lot of pictures though. When my Mum died, we only had about three pictures together.”“Oh my God.” That was sad.“I know right? So I told myself I want to start documenting everything, from my friends, to what I’m doing, places I visit, everything actually.”“Yeah. I’ve seen your Instagram page dedicated to pictures of places and things too,” I said, referencing Le Journal De Gozie. “Yeah. Sometimes, when I’m feeling down, all I need to do is scroll through my Instagram accounts, and it’s pretty easy to document on Instagram and Twitter too.”“I think that’s very intentional. It’s really nice and I love the concept of it.”“Thank you,” she said, smiling.
“I think you’ve really hacked your style too. I notice you love clothes,” I said.“Yeah, I do.”“Your outfits are pretty.”“Right? Thank you. I think that I’m evolving too. One thing I don’t want to do is feel like I can’t wear certain outfits because I’m growing older. I want my style to remain like this forever. One day, I’m wearing ashewo clothes, the next day, I’m dressed like a boss lady. The next day, I’m doing office worker. The next day I’m doing stripper.”“Does it depend your mood?” I asked before realizing the last thing she mentioned, and I laughed.“Sometimes,” she said, laughing. “I notice that when I’m feeling down, I wear black a lot.”“Now I’m going to be on the lookout for you in black,” I said, joking.She laughed. “No no, it’s not all the time. I’m wearing black tomorrow for my birthday dinner.”“Okay. After tomorrow, I’ll be on the lookout for you in black.”Chigozie laughed.
“So you mentioned earlier how expectations have shaped you in some way as a first daughter and how you’ve managed them. Are there childhood events or trauma that you feel have, in some way, affected your current view of the world or how you relate to people?”Chigozie hesitated for a second. “Hmmm not particularly, but I know that growing up introverted, it took me having female friends to open up to certain things. I grew up with so many boys around me and I didn’t really lean into my feminine side while growing up as well. I think I was a late bloomer too. Growing up like that didn’t make me feel so great or feminine in a way, but my female friends have helped me to open up more and appreciate my body more. It’s also much easier to talk to them about topics like sex. I had to become more confident with saying how I feel and sharing how I certain things affect me too,” she said. “I did like a 180. Is it 180 or 360?” Chigozie asked. She was trying to describe the turning point in her life and I found it hilarious.“You sha did something,” I replied, laughing. My brain was not processing that either, to be honest.She laughed. “I sha did something,” she said. “I feel like younger Chigozie would be happy with where I am right now.”“I’m sure she is.”
I listened to Chigozie tell me about how growing up introverted made her self aware, and maybe a little too much in some cases, as she has now grown to be more calculative of the things she says, who she says them too and where she says them. It’s not exactly a problem though because she would never be silent when she needs to speak. It was then I realized that I hadn’t ordered for a drink or food yet.
“I think I’m ready to have a drink now,” I said. “You should have the chapman. It’s really good.”I was staring at the menu. “Oh really?” “Yeah. People say the pineapple juice is good too though.”“Nah, I’ll have the Chapman. What’s their pizza like?”“It’s so good, but disclaimer: It’s really simple. There’s nothing much happening with it.”“I love my pizza like that though. Is it flat?”“Yeah, it is. I usually have the pepperoni,” Chigozie said. “My boyfriend’s not a fan of it like I am though.”I chuckled. We had two pepperoni pizzas to go and the Chapman was really good. I tried not to finish it in one sip. Chigozie said I did a good job for not finishing it all at once.
“I really like this space,” I said, scanning through the restaurant.“Yeah it’s pretty chill. Have you been to Godaïf?”“Nah I haven’t.”“We should go there next.”I squealed in faux excitement. “Is that a second date?” Chigozie laughed.“You know those moments when you go out on a date and you get excited when they start planning a second date before the end of the first?” I asked.“Yeah,” Chigozie replied, smiling.“That’s how I feel right now.”

Perhaps I should have been more compassionate towards the Stockholm inflicted ones. I tried. Not hard but I tried. I couldn't do it. I couldn't look into the inhuman eyes of the corporate bot and feel anything but loathing.

Stockholm Syndrome, a perplexing psychological phenomenon, has captured the attention of experts and the public alike due to its intricate interplay between captive and captor. This psychological response, which was first observed during a bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden in 1973, continues to raise questions about human behavior under duress.
When individuals find themselves in situations of extreme vulnerability and captivity, they may develop a peculiar bond with their captors. This bond appears counterintuitive, as one might expect fear and aversion to predominate in such scenarios. However, Stockholm Syndrome highlights the complexity of human coping mechanisms, shedding light on the psychological mechanisms that drive these unexpected emotional connections.
Victims of Stockholm Syndrome often display empathy and loyalty towards their captors, perceiving them as protectors or guardians rather than aggressors. This psychological shift can be attributed to several factors, including perceived dependency on the captor for basic needs, isolation…

We are at our best when we establish authentic connections with one another, lifting each other up. Two incredible highlights this week: ⭐Helping a dear friend securing an interview and watching him shine bright after listening to him painfully talk himself down for months; ⭐My call with Giulia Fiorista has become a weekly opportunity for me to brainstorm, be inspired, and inspire. This time around, I shared some input that might’ve turned out more useful than I expected. And that’s why it’s usually a good idea to share your knowledge: you might be sitting on someone’s goldmine taking it completely for granted.
I posted about it on LinkedIn earlier this week: I was sorting some ancient papers and documents and unearthed one of my first CVs ever! The “good old days” when: 1) You printed and handed your CV in person wherever you wished to apply; 2) I didn’t realise I could be creative and make up a format of my own (and remove the headshot altogether); 3) LinkedIn wasn’t really a thing. So much has changed in 10 years uh?!
Talking with colleagues in tech, it seems there’s a pattern of communication issues between Product and Commercial across the industry. How many opportunities is this incommunicability costing us? Something to think about…
My final thought is coming from a place of distrust. Some weeks ago I reached out to a popular pre-employment testing company with some questions about what steps they take to make your their timed logics test is “neurodiverse-friendly”. For example, people with dyslexia are known to underperform on timed tests, is there an option for a time-extension? It’s something simple that can make a huge difference for a candidate. I reached out to them through 4 different sources and was ignored for the most part until I was told someone would get in contact. So far, it’s only been silence on their part… If this lack of response equals to a “no”, wouldn’t these tests be highly discriminatory?
Thanks for reading, happy weekend! 👒

No trip to Stockholm is complete with a visit to the archipelago. Let me guide you to some of my favourite spots…
“Stockholm i mitt hjärta, Stockholm in my heart — a city of islands, that is you.” Those are the words by Lasse Berghagen that fill the air every Tuesday summer night as thousands of people, gathered at open air museum Skansen for the popular singalong TV show Allsång på Skansen, take tune. As their words travel across the bay below, the cameras pan over the stunning water landscape and one wonders if the melody manages to reach all of the 14 islands that make up the capital of Scandinavia — or indeed the patchwork of 30,000 islands that spread out beyond that.
Stockholm is beautiful any time of the year, but the magical, seemingly endless, summer light sees the capital come to life more than ever — and at this time of the year there is only one place to be. Outside.
Whether it’s a walk through the national park and museum island of Royal Djurgården or a stroll along the picturesque Söder Mälarstrand, a run along Årstaviken or a panoramic tour of Fjällgatan, the inner city waterfront views are breathtaking. However, a summer trip to Stockholm is not complete without a trip to skärgården, the archipelago.
To explore the 30,000 islands that make up the Stockholm archipelago (all accessible thanks to the Swedish Right To Roam), simply hop on a traditional white, wooden boat from Waxholmsbolaget or a speedier Cinderella ferry from Strömma. Once on board, the archipelago world is your oyster.
Where to go? Here are a few suggestions.
Fjäderholmarna is a good start. Located 30 minutes from Stockholm’s Nybrokajen, this cluster of islands is the closest archipelago destination and it offers both beautiful countryside and bustling town life. Here you can explore traditional handicraft, sample beer at the local brewery, try handmade sweets at the chocolate factory and indulge in delicious ice cream from Systrana Degens Glassstuga. Once you’ve tasted what the town has to offer, why not stroll along the beaches, take a dip in the sea and spend the evening unwinding with a glass of wine and fresh seafood at one of the many restaurants? Life could be worse.
Waxholm is without a doubt the capital of the archipelago. Complete with its own castle, built in 1549 to defend King Gustaf Vasa, this historic old town comes with pastel-coloured houses, art, shopping and good food. It’s a great option if you want to mix nature with culture and it is also accessible via car or bus, should you prefer getting around on land.
Grinda sits at the heart of the archipelago and is an island that, located about an hour from Stockholm, just epitomises serene Swedish countryside. Step back in time as you step off the boat and find yourself in a nature reserve decorated with idyllic, old-school red and yellow houses, wild nature and beautiful beaches. The art nouvaeu style Grinda Wärdshus restaurant is open weekends and holidays and you will not struggle to find a blissful place to picnic on the rest of Grinda. Just lush.
Möja is the spot for the active traveller. Ideal if you want to do more than just chill by the beach, this large island is well suited for bike trips and day hikes — and do make sure you climb to the top of Vårdkaseberget and enjoy a stunning view of the surrounding scenery. Beaches are less accessible here, so it’s not necessarily one for swimming, but you can eat freshly caught seafood at Wikströms Fisk, a tavern run by the archipelago’s only professional fisherman.
Sandhamn is a well-known, idyllic harbour and popular destination for big yachts and their owners. Located about an hour from Stockholm city, Sandhamn offers sandy beaches (as indicated by the name — it literally means Sand Harbour), bike trails, kayaking and spa, not to mention plenty of restaurants and bars; this is without a doubt the party central of the archipelago.
Finnhamn is your destination if you want to see more of the archipelago as part of your trip. Getting here takes about 2.5 hours by boat so you want to set off in time — but what a journey it is. Expect plenty of photo opportunities on board, and do try to get a good seat outside if the weather is nice; there are few things as peaceful as tanning on a boat gliding through skärgården. (Though it can get windy so do pack a jumper in case.) Bring a picnic blanket, snacks and bikini for a day of ultimate relaxation — once on the island you will find perfect trekking conditions and many a private bay to picnic, tan and swim. Just don’t miss the last boat back, though if you do you can always stay overnight at the local hostel.
Utö, meaning Outer Island, sits farthest out in the Southern part of the archipelago and so offers a very wild, natural experience. A visit here is all about enjoying the elements. Renowned for the many hours of sunshine that it gets, the island serves up white sand beaches, cliffs and various sporting opportunities including canoeing, biking, tennis, beach volleyball and boules. Hike around the island and get the best view from the 18th Century windmill.
As you can tell there is plenty of option in the Stockholm archipelago, but regardless of your choice, you will find yourself unwinding with every breath of fresh sea air — and returning back home you may just find yourself singing about your love for Stockholm…

Freedom is scary.
That is the thought I left you with last time.
As much as we want freedom, getting there requires that we sever the umbilical cord that connects us to the lies and limiting beliefs that we have come to rely on from day to day.
And that is scary.
I believe this is why people cling so tightly to their guns and their religion and their political affiliations.
Fear.
The thing about fear, though, is that, in most cases, it is not based in tangible reality. It is not the result of something that has actually happened to an individual. But, rather, it is centered in some kind of what-if or hypothetical scenario.
Fear finds its sustenance in the straw man.
Let us take guns for example.
People cling extremely tightly to their guns and their right to own them. So much so that they are unwilling even to restrict other’s access to them, even if those people legitimately should not be allowed that responsibility.
Even at the expense of other’s lives, these people will defend their guns.
Why?
Because of a perceived need to protect themselves from a tyrannical government or from the off chance that a fully armed intruder will break in to their home. Neither of these things are terribly likely to happen in the grand scheme of things.
But the fear is there. And someone has told them that the solution for these fears is a gun.
And so their beliefs about the world have become restricted and limiting. And therefore how they view the world has become warped.
And that distorted view of the world creates more fear and therefore a tighter grasp on what is perceived as the solution to that fear.
And so on and so on it goes.
Fear causes us to believe only the most limited of things about the world and ourselves. And these limiting beliefs act to keep us chained to a radiator in the dark basement of our souls.
And there we believe we must stay, no matter what.

Nashville. Seattle. Detroit. London. New York. London. Stockholm. All of these are key cities in the music of the 20th century.
But hang on a minute. Stockholm??
Yeah, I wouldn’t have thought so either. Aside from the obvious example and a few bands from the early 2000s, like Eskobar and Kent, still in my record collection, I never would have associated the Swedish capital city with music.
That changed when I spent some time there in the summer of 2024.
Like any good trip to a city I’ve never been in, my initial walk in the neighbourhood in which I’m staying revolves around tracking down record stores.
“But aren’t they all the same as the ones at home?” someone might ask. “Don’t be silly” is the only logical answer.
I walked out of the first one with two Charlatans records that I’ve never seen at any other store anywhere in the world. The fact that one was their second album…

I’m sitting on my favorite aircraft, Delta Air Lines A330–900 Neo, headed to a place that I also love to visit. Amsterdam. Although it’s not our final destination, it’s a fantastic location for a layover in the KLM lounge, a Delta Air Lines partner, where services are also top-notch.
There’s plenty of space to find a wonderful temporary home for relaxation, sleep, meals, reflection, or anything your spirit craves related to your travel desires.
Okay, I’ve skipped a little too far ahead because, in the meantime, we’re still sitting in my favorite seat, Delta One, on my favorite airline. If you haven’t experienced D-1, well, let me give you a sneak preview. In this seating configuration, my desk is to the right, with a plug-in for my laptop, and a convenient port for headphones to listen to entertainment options, including music, movies, TV Series, and family entertainment.
If you’re feeling a bit tired and need to catch some z’s, there’s a pillow, blanket, and comfortable eye mask available. The most fantastic feature is that the seat converts into a lie-flat bed, making it easy to find your comfort zone.
Passengers must wait until the plane reaches the appropriate altitude and the pilot gives the okay to move about the cabin…

When I was in ninth standard, I first came across him. He was from another school. People called him Andrew. He was not the tallest, but was the strongest. He was unbeaten at arm wrestling. There was a certain charm about him that all the boys flocked around him. They all looked forward to be with him. To be in his company, was considered privilege by clueless fourteen-year-olds. He would influence major decisions, dictate terms, bring in new trends and wore the best clothes because his father was a rich man. He always had at least half-a-dozen boys hanging out with him. After school, he would form a circle with those boys and pick two of them and made them fight. Like a referee, he would signal the start of the bout and wait until one of them was completely on the ground, and gave up. He enjoyed while the boys fought and after the fight, both of them would continue to walk around him, like nothing happened. They were just following orders and it didn’t affect them emotionally, although I’m sure physical pain lasted.
One day at school, Andrew was caught copying in the English exam. And in those days, punishments were ruthless. Especially, in that school, they had a public-shaming vice-principal who would beat the shit out of the kid in assembly if the crime was grave enough. The next day, before the start of the Maths exam, the vice-principal called Andrew out and announced to the whole school that he had copied in the English exam. And he began to hit him with a cane. After seven or eight blows, the stick broke and the beating continued by hand. There was hair pulling and ear pulling and unlimited supply of swearing. After about five minutes, the beating stopped and everyone was allowed inside the exam halls. After the exam, all the seven or eight boys who hung around him, returned to their duty — standing beside him. And the first thing Andrew said to them, ‘I didn’t get hurt at all. In fact, the stick broke!’ and everyone hailed him as a legend. That was my introduction to blind followers.
Now extrapolate this story to the current crisis in North India. Everyone knows that their chief has been convicted of rapes without any reasonable doubt and still, they continue to take his side. And they will defend to death, their leader, who is their only sense of self-worth and identity. Young, old, men, women and even young girls have come out in his support in lakhs and they think he is innocent. They don’t just think, they believe the whole thing to be a conspiracy against him, perpetrated by the state.
In psychology, there’s a concept called the ‘Stockholm Syndrome’, where the hostages start liking their kidnappers and form a psychological alliance with them. Sometimes, very strong emotional develop between two persons where one person intermittently harasses, beats, threatens, abuses, or intimidates the other. In this case, although it is legally proved that the so called saint is a rapist, somehow it puts into question, the years of dedication they have displayed towards him. It is like you pet a snake since the day it hatched and one day, it grows big enough to bite you, the the only person who loves it. But then, you like the snake so much that you are ready to die by its poison.
In 2010, I was working with a film director helping him complete a paranormal/horror movie script. During those sittings, we happened to discuss a god-man from Andhra Pradesh who charged about five lakhs for a darshan. That is, you have to pay that money just to see him. And there is a long queue of people willing to do that. In fact, people wait for months for their turn. Then, I asked him, what about poor people, don’t they have access? He said, ‘If you can’t afford him, you can pay two lakhs and see his wife.’
His answer blew my mind. Then, I asked him, what is so special about meeting him? Why should one pay that kind of money? To which, he said, ‘I have a friend who pays five lakhs every now and then. He says, it is his aura. The moment you enter the room, you can feel his aura. And if he touches you, his aura stays with you for a long time and it will attract all the positive things, makes you rich, literally and mentally.’
To an extent, I believe in the concept of aura and positive vibes. But people willing to pay for it? That was a new. An eye-opener. So while we’re at it, if you go and tell this friend of the director, that the god-man is a fraud and that he’s been exploiting the vulnerabilities of gullible disciples, what do you think will happen? He will tell you to get the hell out.
That’s what cults do. When a person gets indoctrinated into a belief system and start following a guru, or a god-man, what actually happens is that they build a strong, unbreakable bridge with them. And in the process of building that bridge, they shut off all roads toward rationality and ability for freedom of thought. It’s a tunnel with no other outlets. And that liberates people, because this sense of belonging to that cult, it’s better than their current life. And what looks like liberation, is actually, a long, endless, incarceration of the mind.

Hello and Hi!
This is the first dataviz challenge for the Data Visualisation Stockholm (DVS) Meetup group. We’ve been discussing holding a challenge for at least a year and FINALLY we’ve finished the first one!
DVS was founded two years ago when the two original organisers started their own two dataviz Meetup groups just a few days apart in Stockholm, Sweden, but then decided that Stockholm was a one-dataviz-Meetup-group town and joined forces. We both wanted to create a space where we would gather enthusiastic designers, developers, artists, statisticians, journalists, and all kinds of amazing people interested in data to network and get to know each other. We also wanted our members to have the opportunity to grow as data designers.
We have discussed holding challenges for a while now, but it took an enthusiastic member asking us to stop procrastinating (Thanks!) and get on with it. But the discussions were not fruitless; they got us talking about the types of dataviz challenges we liked and the kind wanted to run. We determined that a fun and engaging challenge, one that we would want to participate in, had two equally important parts, an interesting theme and a design constraint. The theme would attract participants and the design constraint would challenge them to be creative.
This first challenge was all about Stockholm winters. The dataset had data on snow depth and temperature in Stockholm stretching from January 2021 all the way back to the beginning of the early 20th century.
I must say that I was quite impressed with the variety of submissions we got!
So in no particular order lets go through the charts and see all submissions. Descriptions were written by the respective authors.
WhoMatthias Stahl. Freelance data visualisation designer with a history in bioinformatics, passionate about the combination of data, code, art and design to craft beautiful and impactful visuals.Twitter: @h_i_g_s_c_hLink to the interactive viz
CommentI wanted to go for a spiral layout as this enables the year-wise comparison of this periodic data. I then transformed the temperature and snow data into binary variables — fitting to the overall black-and-white theme. Is there snow: yes/no; and is the temperature higher than 10 °C: yes/no. The best way to encode the temperature turned out to be the spiral line thickness. The circles for the snowy days are apparently inspired by snowflakes. In order to make it clearer that circles represent snowy days, I added a snowing animation.
Tools: Sketch on paper, then Svelte and D3
WhoAlenka Gucek. Postdoc at Uppsala University, studying diabetes and cell biology. I’ve always enjoyed doing visualisations for research and now I’m looking for ways to change career to dataviz.Twitter: @alenka_gucek
CommentOriginally I was planning for a gif with falling snow, but it looked like too much of chart junk. Then I switched to do something simple and informative, inspired by Evelina Judeikyte’s talk [at one of the Meetup events] on simplicity, annotations in The Economist and spark lines by Edward Tufte.
Tools: Excel, Origin and CorelDraw
WhoNina Lindell. Data visualisation engineer at Telia, building products based on mobility data.Twitter: @ninatsutsLink to the code
CommentI wanted to make the data look like piles of snow, and finally create a ridge-line plot (aka joy plot). I have recently started learning D3 and the challenge seemed like a good opportunity to try out my skills on a real dataset. I decided to keep the last 50 years of data and only look at the snow depth. There are still some things I would like to improve upon — highlight interesting data points with annotations, mark the scale, and make winters continuous so that at least November — March are on the same row. That is something for the next iteration.
Tools: Tableau for prototyping, D3 for the final chart
WhoTyler Wolf. Data visualisation specialist at King Games.Twitter: @tylernwolf
CommentI thought about the question “what does a month look like?” And then broke it into the two pieces of data we had in the dataset: temperature and snowfall. But then I wanted to give it context and look for patterns, specifically thinking of the question, are days getting hotter? — obviously thinking of climate change. So I ran a moving average on temperatures to break the temperature component into above or below average for that month. I did this because we can conclude that it’s cold in the winter and hot in the summer already, so a relative comparison gives more context. That made three pieces of data. Finally, I thought about how much I like it when it snows, so it would be nice to get an idea of how many days it was actually snowing in each month. So with those pieces of data and the limitation of black and white only, I experimented with rectangles and lines until I arrived at something that felt right and could condense the data, making each month look unique and allowing their elements to interact with each other. The aesthetic was inspired partially by some of giorgia lupi’s work.
Tools: D3 to draw the graphics, observablehq to get up and experimenting quickly and Figma for early sketching and to draw the legend and title.
WhoPatrick Wojda. Data visualisation and front-end engineer at Aftonbladet, Swedens largest online newspaper.
CommentLooking through the data I realised that there were too many years in the dataset to visualise without losing the personal perspective so I filtered the data on a personal question… were my childhood winters snowier than what my kids get to experience? I did all of the data cleaning and formatting using Javascript (lodash and D3). The most fun aspect of the challenge was figuring out the design, but I spent almost all of the time on data processing. I iterated over the design multiple times, both hand-drawn and in code before I got to where I wanted.
Tools: Javascript, lodash, D3, Svelte, Paper app on IOS for sketching.
That’s a wrap!
Stay tuned for more challenges, we will be announcing them on our GitHub repo (https://github.com/Dataviz-Stockholm/challenges).
Take care and stay safe.

According to Wikipedia, there are four components that comprise Stockholm syndrome:
I was never a huge Javascript guy. I’d use jQuery from time to time. Sometimes, I’d use it to make some AJAX calls and maybe change an element or two on a Rails app I was working on. Life was simple, with jQuery doing most of the grunt work and me doing nothing at all. I didn’t need to know much about Javascript at all and that was the way I liked it.
I was eventually asked to develop a desktop application for authoring media-heavy multi-language content. Not wanting to descend into the waking nightmare that is Java Swing that I had learned to hate in graduate school, I quickly picked up Angular (1) and Electron. It was magical.
I loved how simple everything was. I could write to disk as often as I wanted using Node’s NON-BLOCKING IO (very web-scale). Callback hell was a little difficult to deal with, but then I learned about Promises and entered Promise hell. The fires in this hell were a little less intense, so it was all good. Even better, I now reside in the promised (haha get it) land of Async Await.
Anyhow, Angular truly felt like magic the first time I used it. I would change the application’s state and things would just appear! I didn’t have to use selectors or iterate through DOM elements like some sort of neanderthal. I didn’t understand how the lifecycle worked at all, but who really wants to? Not me. I want to keep the magic alive.
Nobody wants (Angular) sausage after they see how it’s made.
— a very wise person
Of course, this quickly bit me in the ass. My completely unoptimized code was slow sometimes (all the time). So, like any responsible and capable developer, I arrived at an obvious conclusion: Angular was the problem and there was nothing I could do to fix it. I needed to switch frameworks, to use something faster, more performant, and most importantly, with better benchmark scores.
I moved onto React. With React came stage-0 proposals, Babel, Webpack, boilerplates, functional programming, great hair, Redux, GraphQL, CSS in JS, and much more. I now spend my time away from work preparing for work, reading about the hottest new packages, jumping on every bandwagon I can. Maybe I should use Parcel, it’s zero configuration and probably knows what’s best for me. I’ve abandoned all non-Javascript languages for the backend. How else am I going to get my SSR-game on? Javascript is all I need.
I think Javascript is a pretty good guy. You can iterate SO FAST. Compiling? What’s that? Think of all the time you’ll save not waiting for stuff to compile. Sure, there’s essentially no native type system and all sorts of dangerous type coercions can happen, but hey, that’s what Flow and Typescript are for, right? Transpiling is fine and very fast! There are no problems here.
Sure, bugs in the original Javascript implementation have become part of the spec. But look, Brendan Eich had to hack together all of Javascript in a few days. Can you blame him? No. Nobody’s perfect. Except for Javascript. Javascript is perfect.
Javascript is very human. Most teams I’ve worked with are fluent in Javascript. Look at all of the NPM packages. I’d wager that it encompasses all of human knowledge. If there was to be a language to transcend all languages and bring all of humanity together, I would bet on Javascript. Is there a Babel transform for Esperanto? That’d probably be a good start.
To Javascript is human.
— Alexander Pope
I feel this point about ‘belief in humanity’ is somewhat tenuous. You can tell I’m really stretching. Javascript isn’t a human being. Although, Javascript is pretty weird and unpredictable, as are humans.
The local police have been in a standoff outside of where Javascript and I have been holed up for the last 47 hours. I can’t be sure if I’m actually suffering from Stockholm syndrome because I’m not just a very cooperative person in general. But what I do know is that I’m not coming out of the deep, dark hole that I’ve dug myself into.
I like it here. There’s everything I could need or want. I’m very comfortable here. This is who I am now. If anyone is feeling charitable, please throw some food down here if you can. In the meantime, I think I’m going to take a nap. I’m very tired from all of this Javascripting.

This is my 28-day journey of living a temporary life in Helsinki, Tallinn, Stockholm, and Copenhagen.
🇸🇪 August 5, 2019
Look closely at the present you are constructing: it should look like the future you are dreaming. (Alice Walker)
Finding gratitude in small things and injecting a little randomness into my life is one of my 2018 and 2019 resolutions. And a lot of small wonders coincidently happened every day. Because I am in a different country and experiencing different culture? Well, it might be true, but might not.
I went to Gamla Stan and looked around the old town. Sometimes I stopped by souvenir shops to buy a Sweden flag pin because I’m collecting flag pins of countries that I visited. But today I had a bigger mission from my niece. We had a chat on Instagram yesterday, and she told me that she wanted to get a beautiful Swedish style pencil case. Well, what is the Swedish style and where can I find that style? I just went around some shops and found a beautiful pencil case. Surprisingly, it was the same style pencil case as the one that she wanted to have. Today’s small wonder started like that.
While I was looking around, I saw a bunch of people gathering in front of the palace. It seemed like they were waiting for something. So, I joined in the line of people and waited together. Some minutes later, the palace guards riding on horses started marching with music. I never imagined that I could see the Changing of the Guard at Gamla Stan. The second small wonder accidentally happened, too.
I got to a small square and saw old buildings painted with beautiful colors next to the Noble Prize Museum. When I took some pictures and started keep walking, I saw a young boy drawing buildings that I took pictures of just now. I came to him quietly and looked at his painting. It was really beautiful, more beautiful than the original ones. I saw a small donation box beside him, took 20 SEK from my pocket and put it into his box. He looked at me with smile and said, “Thank you.” It was a small donation for rooting for his dream. I prayed with all my heart, recalling his big innocent grin that he will be a great artist who will make our world better with his great ability. That was my third small wonder that I came across in Gamla Stan.
After wandering at Gamla Stan, I bought a cinnamon roll, went to Humlegarden, a park near my hotel, sat on a bench, and read a book, eating the cinnamon roll. If a park like this was near my home in Seoul, I would be really happy. Building a library, a park, and a stage that anyone comes and uses for free — building a free culture park — is one of my dreams, but can I construct this wonder in the future?

For the final project of this 12-week UI sprint, my peers and I were asked to create a passion project based on a travel campaign. This campaign’s deliverables would be executed through a 4 screen website, branding assets, and printed/digital media marketing; all targeted towards a specific demographic to promote possible visitors to visit that location.
I chose to focus my final project on Stockholm, Sweden. Over the last few years, it’s one of the cities I’ve set my heart on. With a deep love for all things Scandinavian design (both interior, industrial, and graphic), it was only natural that I wanted to infuse my personal interests into this project. Although I have never been, I asked myself why I would want to visit this city rich in arts & culture, and what my itinerary would possibly include while I was there. In my younger years growing up, I spent multiple weekends off school and during summer vacations obsessing over museums. My brother and I had no problem wasting away the day exploring each exhibit on display — he loved learning about dinosaurs, I was interested in arts & crafts. Under the same roof, we always found a middle ground.
During the initial research phase of this project, I came across an article that defined Stockholm as a “mecca of museums”. It is home to over 100+ museums within the city limits. Both national collections, and independent institutions that celebrate an array of topics — from ABBA, marine biology, photography, alcohol distillery, etc., Stockholm has a museum that would peak every type of interest for a potential tourist. Here I found the niche demographic I would design for. My goal was to highlight this special collection of institutions (for both museum lovers and those not familiar), and give the general public a streamlined resource for planning their visit in the city.
Moving forward, I created a fictional persona to design for the campaign — meet Joel Pryor. He’s 26 years old, and currently living, working, and playing in the city of Vancouver. He is a recent Architectural Technologist graduate, interning as a junior A/T at a firm. In the evenings he works part time at an East Van cocktail bar, where he connects with other likeminded peers that join his interests in film photography, design, biking, jazz music, and fashion. Listed below is his motivations/frustrations correlating to both travel planning in general, and visiting Stockholm for the first time. My goal was to create a realistic persona with flexible ideals that would be found in his demographic. Joel is knowledgeable in all things niche, and I wanted to create a campaign that reflected that altruistic path.
Before navigating artistic directions for the project, I already knew the route I wanted to take it in in terms of composition in typography. I wanted the project to be an ode to Swiss type, through the applications of poster and print. The Swiss design identity is bold and robust, yet simplified through its modern form and function of sans serif type. Below is the graphic inspiration and composition I collected moving forward in deciding the application of art directions.
Art direction #1: playful, bright, young, quirky, primary
Art direction #2: unapologetic, contrasting, provocative, strong
In the end, I decided to apply the second art direction due to the sensibility of black and white to contrast the colorful imagery that goes along with museums. Looping back to the persona, Joel, it would align with Swedish brands he’d identify with, and the “in your face” and “tongue and cheek” language of the campaign. Museums aren’t the most exciting attraction at the top of mind for people unlike Joel, and I felt that in order for it to resonate with a larger demographic, it would have to be striking.
For the logo, I played on the symmetry of stacked letters within the word “museums” to mimic the level of weights within the site branding. I went through multiple iterations of movement when it came to the letters, and thought that since the site followed a grid system, the logotype should also follow suit.
Circular STD was the singular font chosen for all the branding and application of the campaign. Carrying on with the sans serif typefaces known in Swiss design, it replicates a weighted presence without feeling intimidating. Black and bold is used for all the H1 and H2 headers, with book supplementing body text. All capitals are used on the headers to emphasize the urgency and weight.
As previous mentioned; the art direction I continued with carries a black and white narrative that is minimalistic, modern, and clean. Due to the variety of images hypothetically added by the museums themselves, I wanted a clean slate for the content to speak for itself. The only pattern that would contrast the two tones is a pinstripe; made up of a list of the museums within the city.
For collateral purposes, I chose products that would continue the conversation of the city and the findings at these museums past Stockholm city limits. Travellers would have the capability to carry their discoveries back home with them, and discuss their trip through the points of contact.
Below are the multiple levels of the Design Inception that I created for the campaign. The outer layer describes the environment of all UI assets, and as you go further into the center it breaks down the tone of the campaign through the tone. At the center of the Design Inception is the over arching why; why that target demo would find this campaign useful, and the overall purpose moving forward. My final why is as follows: “Connecting past and present”. Humanity wants to see a visual representation of change through time. Evolution, progression, succession — all documented and on view for the mass public. In the ethos section of the “About”, I created a spiral visual that lists the words “Remarkable. Relevant. Educational.” These three words summarize the levels of the inception on a digestable level.
Before unveiling the prototype, I wanted to outline the primary user flow that Joel, would walk through on the site. From the home page, the user would have the option to click the “About” page, which tells the ethos of the campaign, a “Registry” that lists the filter of museums within Stockholm, and finally, a “Web Shop”. For the sake of the prototype, the user would click “Registry” if they were interested in seeing the hub of locations, then from there their desired topic would filter their results into an event calendar, social media links, or that 3rd party museum site. The black squares are the screens made for the prototype and the white outlined boxes are future considerations.
As a final deliverable for the project, I compiled mockups for how Google Adwords would advertise the campaign. Keeping in mind the persona, I chose 4 different sites that Joel would frequently visit as his choice of media. The exemplary image below showcases the banner on Dezeen (both upper top and right of the navigation) but similar banners would be displayed on sites like Vice and Monocle. In terms of Instagram, I also wanted to imply that my target user frequents social media to see what’s current in the media and the influence it has on day to day. The Museums of Stockholm Instagram would emulate the feel of the site, and update users on new exhibitions, events, and restock of product.

full Travel Portfolio
Stockholm Syndrome, in case you didn't know, is the phenomenon of a captive becoming attached to, or at least developing feelings of trust or affection toward their captor. It was perhaps fitting/ironic/coincidental then, that as we landed in the Swedish capital our only organised activity for the weekend was a game of RoomEscape — a live action, “escape-the-room” puzzle-cum-teambuilding challenge.
However before I digress with this tenuous attempt to fit some sort of play on words into the blog title, let’s rewind the weekend and run things through chronologically.
← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ←
We flew out around lunchtime on Friday. If you book flights an appropriate amount of time in advance you can get from London to Stockholm for as little as £20 return. Which is great, but there are sacrifices to make elsewhere…getting from Skavsta Airport to Stockholm is actually more expensive than the flight (£22 return), and for us getting from Surrey to Stansted was even more expensive than that. But the journey is the destination, right…?
I always loathe arriving in a new place at night-time (or rather in darkness — it was only 16:30) as it totally inhibits one’s ability to soak up the local atmosphere — the vibe. And on a more practical level it makes it just that little bit trickier to get one’s bearings. We had no problem finding our AirBnb though — located one tube stop from the Central station and then barely 100m from the station to our front door.
The Friday night was not entirely different to our typical London Friday night — it was messy. Huge shout out to Helle for curating our insobriety and taking us to the Party Arena. I can confirm, Sweden definitely knows how to get trolleyed. And how to Salsa. I would go into more detail if I my memory would permit it.
Our most impressive feat of the weekend was perhaps waking up in time the next morning to catch Stockholm in the daylight (roughly 08:30 to 15:00). Our cultural custodians, Usman and Jordan (with the aid of Trip Advisor) guided us around the old town, and to Stockholm’s City Hall, the site of the annual Nobel Prize Banquet, which we missed by one day. Invites must’ve got lost in the post.
A pretty cool thing that was going on was this, an artificial “star” hoisted into the Swedish night sky, generated by solar energy from last summer. Using a sunny summer’s day to light up a cold winter’s night — neat.
☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀ ☀
Walking through the shopping areas of the city we stopped in at an American-themed clothes shop. For the life of me I can’t remember the name of the shop — but it was somewhere in the Norrmalm region of the city. Anyway I want to plug this shop as there brilliant offer was fill up a shopping bag full of anything in the shop for just 300 SEK (£25). The centrepiece of my shopping bag was a bowling shirt/short sleeved lab coat that was previously owned by Fernando, Assistant Logistics Manager at Hostess Brands. Yup.
Saturday night we decided to go on an organized bar crawl. For 200 SEK (roughly £18) you get a free shot in 4 bars, 20% off drinks and club entry. Whilst I’m usually the first to object to forced fun of any sort there was no denying that this was a pretty good way to explore the nightlife and meet new people. Of note was an English fireman who threw up on the dancefloor in the second bar we stopped in. Sean Kingston knows.
On to Sunday and we again forced ourselves out into the open to maximize the daylight. Whereas Saturday had been chilly but sunny, Sunday was a more overcast affair. We were however blessed with the first snowfall of the season, which felt like another thing checked off the checklist, even if it was just a few millimetres.
After a reindeer sandwich (seemed more interesting than the traditional Swedish meatballs) we headed to RoomEscape (not to be confused with the online role-playing game RuneScape…). Personally (and I think the others will probably agree), this was the hidden gem of the trip. The game was really well-designed so as to be intricate but not impossible, and the level of detail in the room made for a tense and almost realistic experience. Our scenario featured us trying to disarm nuclear weapons in a Cold War bunker. Despite requiring a few hints to cross the finish line we disabled the bomb and saved the world with 6 minutes to spare! You’re welcome.
So yeah, this was a great trip. No regrets, no “wrong” or “right” decisions, just a bucket load of deeds done. Amen.

Almost jealous of the Swedes
A couple of weeks back I had the pleasure of spending two days in Stockholm, Sweden. As you might already know, Finland used to be part of the great Swedish empire from the 12th century to 1809, so as a Swedish speaking Finn it is always a special feeling to visit Stockholm. It is as close to coming home to as anything that actually isn’t one’s home, this feeling being further enhanced by the many close friends I always get to catch-up with in Stockholm.
It is still almost difficult not to be jealous of my Swedish buddies: the Swedish economy is still strong, the Swedes are tall and beautiful, the tech ecosystem overall is vibrant, and some of the most exciting tech start-ups in the world are from Sweden (Spotify, Klarna, King.com, Pingdom, and many more). Although Creandum and Northzone are really great early stage VCs, I do however hear rumblings that there definitely would be room for more active seed stage investment. At least that seems to be the common message at SUP46, the SUPeractive start-up space smack in the middle of Stockholm. On this trip I also got to meet a few really interesting software companies. I really do hope we will soon find another Swedish investment for Open Ocean, our only current one of course being our rapidly growing superstar Truecaller (www.truecaller.com).
Luckily I haven’t yet had to turn completely green with envy of the Swedes, as my Finnish buddy Mikko Ilonen three weeks ago beat world number four Henrik Stenson in the World Matchplay golf final!

Landed Stockholm and went straight from Arlanda to Viggsö aka “Abba Island”.
Somehow I’m right outside ABBA’s hit-writing cottage on the island. Over the course of days I got subsumed by the breakdown of Björn and Agnetha’s marriage, as documented in ‘The winner takes it all’.
After 3 straight days of listening on repeat, the reductive zero-sum nature of the winner taking it all meaning that the loser *has* to fall weighed me down to exhaustion and I left Sweden, never to return.
Stockholm set off a bizarre mix of city-syndromes in my travels.
Medellin, Colombia: 24 hours in I began to suffer Netflix-induced delusions that I knew more about the #rise #fall of Pablo Escobar than anyone, including locals who actually knew him. I’d casually hang around the [since] demolished house where he was killed on December 2, 1993 and offer visiting tourists free guidance to the rest of Pablo’s Medellin. All but 3 refused me.
Beirut, Lebanon: Guns pointed at my head at a Hezbollah checkpoint near the airport after arrival and I developed some kind of fatalistic swagger, as if death could come at any time and I’d be just fine. So I pushed it. I went to the Bekaa Valley on the Syrian border with an American lady I met in a Beirut lesbian bar. I survived (everything), despite accidentally nudging a soldier’s Kalashnikov on the way to fly out.
Seoul, South Korea: Apart from the DMZ, all I really wanted to do in Seoul was to consume lots of nakji-bokkeum (super-spicy stir-fried octopus dish). Developing quickly into a tentacle-eating obsession in every form and for every meal. Within 24 hours of my first octopus dish I left my luxury Gangnam hotel and started sleeping rough at the Noryangjin fish market, focused on eating Sannajki (live octopus) as it came off the boats. Hallucinations and misunderstandings followed in that order and I hurriedly flew out of Incheon.
Melbourne, Australia: Obsessing crossing the Yarra river, repeatedly (crossing not obsessing). It’s not the Yangtze or the Mississippi but after a few days of hearing about the massive logistical challenges of “crossing the river”, I began to plot out a journey from one end to the other. Also sought out easier crossing points, knowing the stress that these people seem to have about “crossing”. I biked across every bridge crossing from Princes Bridge to the Johnston street bridge in Abbotsford. Not a single friend appeared interested in my views on where and how to cross the river. So I stopped obsessing and left for Sydney.
Tashkent, Ubzbekistan: Modernist architecture I know. Behren’s 1909 AEG factory in Berlin, Corbusier’s 1928 Villa Savoye in France and the Guggenheim here in NYC (guess the year) I’ve all seen. So arriving in Tashkent en route to a road trip around the Aral Sea and the former Soviet chemical weapons testing center on Vozrozhdeniya Island was just transiting. Abrubtly, a parallel world of Tashkent Modernism beckoned. Simple geometric shapes fused with large slabs of reinforced concrete. The exquisite latticework of the State Museum of History and then I checked into something even better from 1974: The Hotel Uzbekistan. I stayed until I ran out of funds and was deported back to Russia.
Granada, Spain: Uncovering what’s underneath; that was the obsession. Specifically what’s underneath the Christian surface and digging (figuratively) into Granada’s rich Islamic and Jewish past. Not just the obvious like the churches built over mosques, but the origins of what locals say. Like when they talk about going to barrio de los greñúos they actually are referring to the Realejo neighborhood with greñúo possibly being a reference to Jewish curls. Alas my few friends here got bored with my obsession with the underneath. One in particular caused me to leave town immediately when she suggested that Stranger Things would be a more appropriate place for me to visit The Upside Down.
Memphis, Tennessee: From aspiring vegetarian and practicing atheist it took only 3 days to become obsessed with meat and megachurches (M&Ms). A meat dish was not enough, I wanted my meat to be coated in meat sauce with a side of meat. And then the possibilities of horizontal integration hit me — everyone you meet in Memphis eventually tells you that their Grandma makes the best fried chicken you’ve ever had. So of course I ended up cruising megachurches and being inadvertently invited back to suburban Sunday fried chicken lunches cooked by real life grannies. Not nearly as creepy as it may sound and I remain generally welcome there to this day.
Johannesburg, South Africa: A sudden deep and abiding passion for security and for planning escape routes/rooms. Plotting out safe routes through town and excessive thinking about how to respond to carjacking attempts — do we floor the car when AK47s are pointed at us or do we immediately go limp and say ‘take whatever you want just leave us alone’. Asking in advance about where the safe room is seemed reasonable to me but some locals seemed to think I was overthinking. And then I was carjacked in mid-morning traffic and my continuous thought during the ensuing 24 minute firefight was ‘I told you so’.
Ciudad Juarez, Mexico: A day trip from joint city El Paso ended up as a days long foray into excessive medical tourism. I’d never really loved my chubby cheeks and really wanted a chiseled sculptured face, so day one ended up under that knife. I’d planned to walk across the Texas border back to El Paso but I spotted a street advertisement for a $100 nose job. That’s less than a boozy lunch so I tried that. Day 3 involved a $800 tummy tuck ($9,500 cheaper than NYC) and a breast augmentation ‘taster’ (don’t ask). I look good.
Kyiv, Ukraine: An unexplained sudden and deep interest in Metro stations and steam baths (Banyas). Peaked in one day spent exploring every corner of ‘Arsenala’, the deepest station in the Kyiv subway system and the second deepest in the world. Followed by an evening of having the shit beaten outta me with birch twigs whilst sipping on Kozak Ukrainian vodka made from dried wheat bread. This time they let me stay. I’m still here, red raw and smashed in every sense.

Amid thousands of coastal islands and inland lakes
Where boreal forests and glaciated mountains take
Stockholm to the East, Gothenburg to the South
The garrison town lingers on me in the shadows of a vintage movie
I check the ghost white newspapers for occurring theatre dates
Without pre-thought, I remade my African life into a Swedish life
Snapping photos in rare destinations is prohibited
Karlsborg! I am in Karlsborg! Why am I here?
Untouched by all the crowded dances
Fika, are you a sacred religion?
The relationships atypical
Atlas and I, discovering ourselves by the water’s edge
Spring has sprung, I’m grateful to be here among the young
In this very moment, I banish all gloom
My mucous membranes inflamed
My clouds scattered in Yahoo hues
May, may my Triumph tulips never die
Here eye to eye, unbound by earth and sky
I cannot lie, I thought by now I’d left up and fly
The victories have begun
Come along and let’s abide by the unsung
Many moons will fall my fragile Atlas, but tonight I’ll lull you to sleep
And tomorrow we’ll continue to give it our all
The little moments shared in silence,
thank God there’s no loud violence
Fika!
You’ve become a sacred religion.

Stockholm Design Week 2018: Five Highlights from the Scandinavian Furniture & Light Fair,https://medium.com/@FaSBlog/stockholm-design-week-2018-five-highlights-from-the-scandinavian-furniture-light-fair-a57f1c6f89da,"Sign up

Stockholm Design Week wrapped up yesterday and reports of the amazing designs presented are flooding in. Started in 2002, Stockholm Design Week has become the most important week of the year for Scandinavian Design, where just about everyone in any way connected to or interested in Scandinavian design meet and bring home new trends, contacts and inspiration. The design week runs in parallel to and supports the Stockholm Furniture & Light Fair, the world’s leading event for Scandinavian design. Today we’re going to take a look at some of our favorite designs we’ve seen from the even so far.
The Jin Chair
Created by Japanese designer Jin Kuramoto, this chair was named the best product at the Stockholm Furniture and Light Fair. The chair is made using flax fibers which are a completely biodegradable material that is most commonly used for money, tea bags and linen. Kuramoto devised a method that involves building and shaping thin flax fiber layers on top of each other to form both the seat and frame. A resin is then used to solidify the structure. The resin is also a bio-resin which can biodegrade or be burned. Kuramoto designed the Jin chair for Swedish furniture brand Offecct.
Apollo Lamp
Swedish design brand Phloc presented these elegant new lights. The super clean Scandinavian design is highlighted by the beautiful pastel color palette. The line was designed by Swedish architects Mats Broberg and John Ridderstråle who were inspired by a plumb bob, a tool with a pointed weight on its end that architects use to ensure a vertical hang. The lights are available in a range of colors and finished and can be hung individually or grouped together.
Snøhetta Lighting Range
The Norwegian architects Snøhetta launched their first lighting range at the design fair. Called the Flik Flak collection, the line is comprised of hinged wooden lamps. The lamps were originally designed for Sweden’s Treehotel and they were inspired by the building’s exterior. The lamps feature an LED strip that is sandwiched between black birch veneer and can be opened and closed at 180-degree angle as the planks are held together by a piano hinge. In its closed state, the lamplight is focused and when opened, it disperses across space.
Yoma by Zeitraum
This sleek bed has a very flexible design that we think will be popular as more and more people look for versatile furniture. The long side of the bed serves as a shelf, while the back cushions can be fixed in different positions and arranged to feel comfortable while sleeping, reading or just lounging. The mattress only sinks down a few centimeters, making it appear to be lying on top, giving the bed a sense of weightlessness.
The Barn & Fences
Created by Swedish designer Johan Kauppi, the Barn & Fences were inspired by the winter environment of Swedish Lapland. Intended to be used in office settings, the little houses and space dividers are semi-transparent, yet sound absorbent. Kauppi suggests using the barns for meeting and workplaces, and combining them to suit the office’s needs. The fences have standalone stability and great flexibility, making the system easy to use when creating temporary areas, walkways, angled shapes or zig-zag corners.
These are just some of the great designs that came out of this year’s Stockholm Design Week. What are your favorites? Personally we’d love to have our own personal little work barns. We’re interested to see how interior designers start using these pieces in their work, and look forward to seeing these designs used in interiors going forward.

(Reprinted from NUVO Magazine, June 2003.)
There are a few ways to get to the old town square in Stockholm, Sweden. You can walk up from the water, where Lake Malaren meets the Baltic Sea, calves feeling the steep incline up past the palace, a bright tableau of the city framed in a glance over your shoulder. Or, you can walk the twisty paths of Gamla Stan’s narrow streets (literally the “old town”), cobblestones uneven beneath your feet, past the purveyors of souvenirs, fine crystal and strong Swedish coffee. The practical traveler might opt for the subway (“Tunnelbana” or “T-Bana” for those in the know), emerging on the sunlit southern side of Gamla Stan and retracing steps northward in a straight line uphill. Whatever path you choose, it will eventually open up into the Stortorget — the “Great Square” — and the epicenter of Stockholm’s ancient self.
Four hundred years ago where a bloody coup was staged is now a bright and bustling square, with camera-wielding tourists and Swedes lingering the cafés, faces upturned to the perma-sun in summer or candle-warmed in winter. On their way through, many of them will alight on the steps of a building that bounces sunlight off its coral-coloured walls and classic white pillars, all across the west side of the Great Square. Like Stortorget, it is a combination of the old and the new — the eighteenth-century Old Stockholm Stock Exchange, meeting place of traders and burghers — to which has been attached a sleek pane of glass, affixed with spare steel rods and bearing simple white lettering, modern and minimalist, that let you know not only that you’ve arrived at the “Nobelmuseet” but that what is contained therein will fuse history with modernity and wrap it all up in a crisp, clean Nordic aesthetic. You may have to be a genius to be featured in this museum, but you needn’t be one to appreciate what it has to offer.
Officially it’s called the Nobelmuseet — i.e. “Nobel Museum” as written in the agglutinated Swedish style — but it consists of a single exhibition, “Cultures of Creativity: The Centennial Exhibition of the Nobel Prize,” which opened in April, 2001 to commemorate one hundred years of achievement. It is a topic of breadth and depth, and the exhibit opts for both, layering headlines and highlights over troves of information and esoterica, easily skimmed for the ADD-afflicted but rich in detail for the more questioning intellect (or for salonistas in search of clever cocktail conversation). Either way, it presents a century of Nobel-winning exploits in the context of the individual and the collaborative creative processes. Some conclusions are neatly drawn for visitor consumption (i.e. “creative milieus breed creative thinkers”) but most are left to the thoughtful museet-goer, who may or may not leave with an understanding of Pavlov’s Dog, Schrödinger’s Cat or how the heck Arafat ever won that Peace Prize.
That is the essence of the Nobel Prize: genius, and controversy. The museum does an excellent job of showcasing the first and alluding to the second. Taking in the cool, airy space, all metallic curves and shafts of light, the eye is drawn upward to a kind of conveyor belt on the ceiling, moving panels along like venetian blinds, each featuring the likeness of a Nobel laureate. Fritz Pregl, Chemistry, 1923. Luis Walter Alvarez, Physics, 1968. Naguib Mahfouz, Literature, 1988. Past the reception desk (50 Swedish krona buys you an afternoon of one-way intellectual hobnobbing) there are options: look straight ahead, and you will see an elegant row of plexiglass panels containing newspaper clippings in English and Swedish, each panel representing a decade of Nobel news. Look to the left and find a theatre showing eight vignettes featuring creative Nobel-spawning milieus (think Hemingway’s Paris and Bohr’s Copenhagen); look right and find a theatre showing thirty-two short films about not Glenn Gould but winners like X-Ray pioneer (and physics prize pioneer as the first laureate) Wilhelm Röntgen (1901), writer Wole Soyinka (1986), and Swedish statesman Dag Hammarskjöld (1961). On the other side of this theatre, an interactive multi-media room with headphones and individual flatscreen computers.
Perhaps the best place to begin, though, is at the back of the museum’s spacious single floor, past the sample banquet place-setting and on to the exhibit detailing the life of Alfred Nobel. It is the Nobel Museum after all, and indeed Stockholm’s only monument to the industrialist who made his home in many places other than Sweden yet somehow settled on his out-of-the-way homeland to administer and bestow the world’s most prestigious prizes. The sepia-toned display provides a fairly pristine account of Nobel’s life — his childhood in Stockholm and then St. Petersburg; his difficult inventor/industrialist father and brothers; the tragic loss of his younger brother, Emil, in a nitroglycerine explosion connected to Alfred’s experiments; his uneven and lonely romantic life; and the innovations he developed that advanced the industrial age and built the fortune that would eventually bankroll five distinguished prizes.
(It should be noted here that the so-called Nobel Prize in Economics is actually not a Nobel prize at all, but rather an award established by the Central Bank of Sweden in 1968 to honour Nobel’s memory, with a prize purse guaranteed to match that of the other laureates. It is adjudicated by the Swedish Academy of Sciences which is also responsible for the Physics and Chemistry prizes).
Nobel was, by most accounts, a difficult man — lonely, caustic, closed, not overwhelmingly happy (one of the best of these accounts is in Burton Feldman’s excellent The Nobel Prize which is a 489-page treasure trove of Nobel facts and factoids). He was a workhorse, traveling constantly, establishing dynamite factories across Europe and in the United States, where he spoke Swedish, English, French, Italian, or German depending on the locale. He wrote poetry and plays, patented his multifarious inventions, read widely, kept his own counsel. He died in San Remo, Italy, basically alone — childless, unmarried, brothers and parents deceased. And then, with his will, he gained an entirely new life in the form of the Nobel Prize.
Closed as he was, who can know what exactly motivated his now-famous will. Perhaps the erroneous obituaries, published on the death of his brother, by a few confused journalists — and not overwhelmingly complimentary. Perhaps guilt based on the deaths with which he was associated — dynamite accidents, an ill-fated balloon expedition he bankrolled, the loss of his own brother. Perhaps a desire for expiation, or for admiration — the kind that escaped him in life.
Whatever his reasons, they were enough to direct his entire fortune toward prizes — though only after five years of legal wrangling and painfully-wrought administration of a huge fund with scant guidance. Alfred Nobel’s Last Will and Testament consisted of a single wordy paragraph directing his accrued wealth to a fund which would annually provide for five prizes to “those persons who shall have contributed most materially to benefit mankind during the year immediately preceding” in the areas of Physics, Chemistry, Physiology/Medicine; Literature, and one “to the person who shall have most or best promoted the Fraternity of Nations and the Abolishment or Dimunition of Standing Armies and the Promotion and Increase of Peace Congresses.” The first four prizes were assigned to various distinguished Swedish academic organizations; the Peace Prize was to be selected by a committee determined, inexplicably, by the Norwegian Parliament. So indeed, from the very beginning this was a prize marked by drama and controversy (and who knows? Perhaps Nobel had thought of that, too).
Walking through the newspaper-clipping exhibit decade by decade reveals just how fraught with controversy it was. Here was a so-called global prize, being adjudicated by an exclusively Scandinavian body of bodies (and, except for the Oslo-centric Peace Prize, bestowed to this day by the Swedish king in a lavish ceremony in Stockholm on December 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel’s death). Entrusted to judge the forefront but geographically peripheral, the judges were not always fully informed of cutting-edge work (and as a result many prizes across the board were awarded years and sometimes even decades after the ‘winning’ work had been performed). There was a northern slant, felt almost immediately with a disproportionately high number of Nordic winners (this is seen particularly in the Literature prize, with fifteen Nordic laureates (including Iceland) to France’s twelve and the US’ eleven). Unlike the prefix “Oscar-nominated” there are no plaudits for runners up. Accordingly, competition was fierce and politics fiercer.
Of course, hindsight is always 20/20 but in a museum celebrating a century of prizes one can’t help but look back. While the actual exhibit does not render judgment on this prize or that — its purpose is to celebrate the Nobel Prize as an institution — it does not whitewash its chequered past of backroom politicking, uncredited (and unawarded) inventors, scandals, and shockingly bad choices (though of course you have to look for it!). Moreover, the prizes cannot be rescinded, and the deliberations are secret — so the mistakes of history stick. There was the prize for nuclear fission, awarded to German Otto Hahn in 1944, which completely excluded his decades-long partner Lise Meitner (who had fled, ironically, to Sweden at the outbreak of the war). There was the passing over of Dimitri Mendeleev, whose Periodic Table of the Elements hangs in every science classroom worth its salt, for chemist Henri Moissan who discovered fluorine — as it had already been predicted by Mendeleev’s chart! And Banting and Best — names that are inextricably linked in the Canadian lexicon — were not, in fact, honoured in 1923 for the discovery of insulin — that award actually went to Banting and J.J.R. Macleod (though Banting made a big show of splitting the prize money with Best, his graduate student assistant, and sharing the credit — not to mention that in 1962, theNobel Foundation publicly admitted that Macleod had erroneously been honoured). These were not isolated incidents.
Also common were dramas surrounding the prizes once awarded, based on the merits. Mikhael Gorbachev’s 1986 peace prize was hailed globally but received mixed reactions in the Motherland. Ditto Linus Pauling, who besides Marie Curie is the only laureate to have received a prize in two different categories — first Chemistry in 1954, and then the Peace Prize for his anti-nuclear agitation in 1962 was seen as an international slap in the face to the U.S. (not unlike how last year’s prize to Jimmy Carter was seen as a not-so-subtle rebuke of the Bush Administration’s hawklike foreign policy). Portuguese neurologist Antonio Egas Moniz was honoured with the Medicine prize in 1949 for pioneering the lobotomy, a horrendous procedure that mentally neutered thousands of patients before mercifully falling out of favour within a decade.
Some prizes were even so hotly debated within the supposed coolly objective minds of the adjudicating committees that resignations ensued: in 1989, two members of the Swedish Academy (which judges Literature) resigned over the committee’s decision not to name Salman Rushdie and take a stand against the Iranian fatwah against him — up from one resignation in 1989 for naming William Golding. And back to Arafat: a member of the ’94 Peace Committee publicly resigned and denounced him as a terrorist. Omissions, too, make up as distinguished a list as any collection of laureates: Sigmund Freud. J. Robert Oppenheimer. Henrik Ibsen. Leo Tolstoy. Virginia Woolf. Dimitri Mendeleev. Mahatma Ghandi.
Even more poignant were other omissions — omissions on the dais accepting the award. German-Jewish journalist Carl von Ossietsky was not available to accept his 1935 Peace Prize as he was incarcerated in a concentration camp, where he died. The uproar over the episode prompted Hitler to forbid Germans or Austrians to accept their prizes (beginning in 1938) which resulted in at least three laureates having to forfeit their prize money (still extremely lucky compared to Ossietsky). Controversial, outspoken laureates from the USSR were also precluded from attending — Boris Pasternak in 1958, Andrei Sakharov in 1975. The Nobel Prize is bigger than the laureate alone.
That fact is at its most affecting in the corners of the exhibit, quietly regarding the balance Marie Curie used to weigh her newly-discovered radium, the well-worn Underwood typewriter used by Isaac Bashevis Singer, complete with Yiddish lettering, or listening to Toni Morrison’s beautiful and richly-toned Nobel lecture on headphones in the multi-media room, then Nelson Mandela’s, then Bashevis Singer in his voice aged with patience: “People are asking me often, why do you write in a dying language? Firstly, I like to write ghost stories, and nothing works like a dead language. Ghosts love Yiddish, they all speak it.”
As fascinating as a wander through the Nobelmuseet inevitably is, the museum-going experience is taken to an entirely new plane by virtue of the gift shop. In addition to a fine array of the usual — postcards with distinguished-looking laureates, to whom are attributed elegant-sounding quotes; books about Alfred Nobel, the Nobel Prize and various laureates; posters of exhibited pieces — it offers a creative selection of souvenirs. Highlights include the peculiarly Swedish salty licorice treat, “salt lakrits,” quaintly packaged in the form of a long stick of dynamite (perhaps in a nod to how you’d feel if you actually ate the whole thing) and gold foil-wrapped chocolate coins fashioned after the Nobel medallions (surely a necessary chaser of the aforementioned lakrits!). Also of note is a particularly charming postcard of Albert Einstein reclining against a rock in summer shorts, looking oddly fetching with his slender calves and strappy summer sandals (the quote — “It is harder to crack a prejudice than an atom” — is pure Einstein, who was a passionate advocate for peace and submitted as many nominations for the Peace Prize as he did for physics).
My favorite Nobel keepsake, however, is a Nobel-inspired cookbook for those who would replicate the ceremonial banquet at home, minus the average IQ (The Nobel Banquets: Modern Recipes from the Classic Menus, by Hélène Bodin and Stefan Bjur). The book pairs menu selections from various years with information about the laureates being so honoured and the historical background of the era. 1954, for example, was a banner year celebrating German physicists Max Born and Walther Bothe, Linus Pauling’s Chemistry prize and John Enders, Thomas H. Weller and Frederick C. Robbins, three distinguished U.S. virologists. Had literature laureate Ernest Hemingway been well enough to attend the inter-laureate conversation would probably have been very different. As it was, he missed out on hot smoked rainbow trout with spinach chanterelle mushroom sauce, grilled filet of beef with tagliatelle vegetable and red wine sauce, and green pears accompanied by pistachio nut ice cream (perhaps one of the German physicists ate enough for Bothe of them).
Souvenirs in hand and laureate-worthy thoughts in head, the Nobelmuseet has hopefully provoked thoughts more compelling than weak puns on physics laureates (I hope I’m not Bohr-ing you). Outside, the sun is surely still shining; it’s summer after all, and that’s what the sun does in a Stockholm summer. Stotorget is still bustling and the cafés still do a brisk business. Walking out into the square, there are a few ways you can go — down toward the water, south to the subway, lazily through the rabbit-warren streets of Gamla Stan. Moving away, you throw a glance over your shoulder — framed there is the Nobelmuseet, pillars and glass gleaming in the sunlight, fusion of things old and new from these past hundred years.
Rachel Sklar is the co-founder of TheLi.st. She wrote this in 2003 after living in Stockholm for six months. In addition to writing about the Nobel Museum, Rachel also gained 15 pounds from delicious Swedish chocolate, recorded four tracks for a Swedish dance club and invested in H&M. Her favorite Swedish phrase was “Jag har inte pojkvan.” She thinks Sweden rules.

In this blog, I want to share my recent trip to Stockholm and all the experiences I had during my journey.
The whole trip started because I wanted to plan something good for a UK bank holiday. Sweden was never on my travel list, and I also had a childhood friend living there with his family whom I hadn’t seen in more than four years. So, it felt like the perfect opportunity to catch up and explore a new place at the same time.
On the day of my journey, I took a Norwegian flight from London Gatwick to Stockholm Arlanda. The flight had a slight delay leaving Gatwick but still arrived almost on time. From Arlanda, I hopped on a Flygbussarna bus to reach Stockholm central, and the journey was smooth, taking just 50 minutes. It was already past 10 in the evening when I arrived, but my friend, who lives about 20 minutes away, kindly came to pick me up. We used trams and the metro to get to his place.
One interesting thing I noticed was that you could purchase tickets for most forms of transportation using your mobile phone and scan a QR code when boarding. It was a convenient use of technology and saved me the hassle of buying tickets in person or carrying a separate travel card, like in London.
On Day 2, we bought a single SL ticket for 39 SEK (approximately £2.89) to get to Stockholm central and then decided to walk around. We covered around 20 kilometers, exploring significant historical places like Stockholm City Hall, where Nobel Laureates have their dinner after receiving their prizes. We also visited Gamla Stan, the Royal Palace, Parliament, and many beautiful islands. What stood out to me was the Stockholm Archipelago concept, where many small islands are connected by bridges or ferries, creating a vibrant and unique city. It’s different from many other European cities I’ve been to.
Day 3 took us to Djurgarden. We loved the Open Air museum, where they’ve preserved or recreated life from the 16th-17th centuries. It’s a fantastic way to keep history alive and attract tourists. Skansen, in the same area, had a cool zoo with Swedish and Nordic wild animals. Our next stop was the Vasa Museum, the highest-rated place on Google and TripAdvisor. It’s a treasure trove of interesting historical facts, showcasing a 300+ year-old sunken ship and its history. What amazed me was how they turned a “FAILURE” into a celebration and learning opportunity.
Day 4 was all about visiting Drottningholm Palace and its surroundings in the morning before my evening flight back to London. The palace is where the Swedish Royal family still resides, and it’s a well-maintained place with beautiful gardens. The whole area is so large that it can take hours to explore.
But, as my great trip was coming to an end, some miseries had to balance the good and bad in life! I received notifications on my mobile that my return flight, scheduled for 21:00, had been delayed until 05:33 the next morning. After contacting British Airways customer care and checking the news, I learned that there was a UK-wide Air Traffic Control ‘technical glitch’ causing flight delays and cancellations. The customer care representative advised me to reach the airport as per my original schedule, as they were working to make things right. However, upon arriving at the airport, I found out that the flight was canceled, and no one knew the next steps. The check-in counter gave me an apology letter with vague instructions that essentially said, “figure things out on your own, and we might reimburse you later.” Other passengers said there were no available BA flights to London for at least the next three days. Customer care calls were rejected, and the British Airways app and website crashed due to high traffic. I was essentially stuck in a city without knowing when I could leave.
Luckily, I was able to return to my friend’s place instead of searching for a hotel. I continuously followed the news, which reported thousands of UK-bound flights canceled and the chaos continuing for days. In this situation, I started looking for all available options to get back, including buses, trains, ferries, and routes through other cities. Fortunately, I found an available but expensive option with SAS Airlines for the next day via Stavanger, Norway. So, I decided to go for it instead of getting stuck in Stockholm, which would have affected everything, including my work.
On Day 5, I left my friend’s place with a lot of uncertainty about what lay ahead. Fortunately, the first flight from Stockholm to Stavanger went smoothly. However, before boarding the next flight, I heard an announcement that the flight was overbooked, and they were looking for volunteers to take the next day’s flight along with a 250 Euro compensation! I quickly moved to the front of the boarding queue, just in case they asked me to volunteer if no one else did. I saw the boarding process begin, and the flight was very full. The flight waited for over 40 minutes due to the overbooking issue, and the pilot announced that they had to remove luggage for those who couldn’t make it, causing further delays. After all the chaos, I finally reached London after almost eight hours of travel, which was initially planned for just two hours!

On the outskirts of Stockholm, the Stockholmsmässan convention center played host to one of this year’s much anticipated AWS Summits — it was a day packed with innovation, insights, and conversations around what AWS has been most recently working on for the Cloud. With keynotes about generative AI, hands-on demos, and real-world use cases from the some big names, the event offered a deep dive into how AWS is shaping the future of tech, how companies are leveraging LLM’s and generative AI to build exciting new features, and how they save costs while scaling to a global audience.
I was impressed to see how global companies like Booking.com have already deeply integrated AI into their products and development processes — a clear reminder that those who don’t embrace it, risk falling behind.
Here are a few highlighted talks that I attended with Thibault, my teammate at ACTUM Digital!
We kicked off our packed day of sessions with a talk from Tom Soderstrom, — an AWS Enterprise Strategist and former CTO at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory! Tom’s talk was absolutely packed with interesting stories and experiences from his extensive career with NASA — he gave some insights on how we can experiment better by optimising for speed, reducing cost and risk, and not aiming for perfection the first time around. I really enjoy the kind of talks that don’t try to teach you a specific technology, but instead inspire you to go and think about work in a different way, or approach ideas with a different mindset. I found a shorter version of Tom’s presentation on the AWS Events YouTube Channel — I highly recommend giving it a watch!
From less technical to very technical — this talk about how Booking.com utilises SageMaker was incredibly in-depth, the team of speakers managed to pack so much into an hour! After a brief introduction explaining the trade-offs between different LLM inference options, we were walked through two new GenAI features that Booking.com implemented into it’s product, and then how they fine-tuned the specific needs of each with the help of Amazon SageMaker AI. First, how they reduced the cost of their accommodation description generator by 180x, and second, how they made their intuitive, prompt-based filter search tool 15x faster. You can read more about this in their very detailed AWS Blog post.
As part of a cross-functional team responsible for monitoring and investigating ops issues in our environments, we are all too familiar with the art of getting alarm thresholds into the “sweet spot” where they’re actually alerting for potential issues, and not for some expected window of peak traffic. Alex Livingstone and Mohamed Wali of AWS gave us some great ideas how we can use several “anomaly detection” features of CloudWatch to learn from expected behaviour patterns, and minimise intervention. The models are retrained on AWS automatically without any need for user input, but specific periods can also be excluded from training if you don’t want them to impact the results.
We also saw a demo of Amazon Q Developer operational investigations, a much anticipated CloudWatch feature currently in preview, that instructs Amazon Q to automatically investigate alarms on your behalf. This way, when you go to your dashboard after an alert, you’re already presented with key observations highlighted to aid your investigation why an alarm was triggered. You can see the logs of which services Amazon Q inspected, what information it discovered, and what suggestions it has generated to fix the issue. In some cases, it can even provide runbook suggestions in Systems Manager that can execute steps to resolve the issue automatically! Care must be taken to review these before executing — but as the models behind detection/resolution get smarter, these could start saving developers a lot of time when investigating root causes of issues.
As usual — AWS delivered with a Summit packed full of news, updates, and new technologies to try out, while also sharing some real-world customer success stories as inspiration how we can better leverage AI in our products — If you’re interested in AWS or the cloud at any level, we highly recommend the trip to an AWS Summit near you!

Petra Gardafjord, founder of beautiful Swedish kids brand Beton Studios shares her daily life in Stockholm for a little travel inspiration
My family and I live in a suburb to Stockholm called Sundbyberg, or Sumpan as we like to call it. It’s like its own little town, a little quiet, but still lots going on! Since we live outside the big city we ride the tube everyday. The kids have grown up with it and could probably go by themselves if we let them!
Sumpan is a mix between old and new. It used to be real industrial town but is getting really modern by the years. It’s growing like mad, housing hundreds of families.
On the weekends we like to play outdoors. There’s a park called Tornparken, where the kids can play for hours. In the summer there’s a good sized toddler pool, perfect to splash around in.
Just close by the park is an old water tower rebuilt just recently into a restaurant, Delibruket. They have the most amazing flatbread pizza buffet during weekends and we can sit for hours. Outside is the most amazing view across the town and we can see our house from there.
The library is the perfect spot for changing diapers, nursing, feeding, coffee and just hit the couches with a few good children’s books. It’s a great place to get a little down time since the kids know they can’t be loud in there.
My most favorite place here is Marabouparken. It has a big beautiful park, full of life during the weekends. In the warmer days we bring our towels and picnic baskets and eat fruit and a good fika (Swedish for coffee and buns/cookies) in the grass. Inside is a exhibition hall for all sorts of art and a cool restaurant, Parkliv, that serves the best rhubarb lemonade and lemon pie!
We are a very active family and every chance we get we are out riding bikes or visit the local public swimming pool. We also recently discovered this gorgeous old gym hall just across from where we live. It’s not open for the public but Martin got contacts from work so sometimes we sneak inside and make ourselves a obstacle course and run around like mad people. The kids love it!

So, you may remember that back in September 2024, I was awarded a full bursary to attend an ECR (early career researcher) networking event in Stirling, Scotland. The event was organised by the British Society of Gerontology’s emerging researchers in ageing group (ERA), in collaboration with SWEAH (the Swedish national graduate school on ageing and health), and hosted at the University of Stirling.
You can read my reflective blog on the ECR networking event here.
So, then in February 2025, the cohort who’d attended this networking event were invited to join another collaborative event between ERA and SAIN (the SWEAH Alumni Interdisciplinary Network) — this time, to join a writing retreat in Stockholm, on the island of Långholmen in the old prison!
The retreat provided the opportunity for: networking, space for co-writing and quiet time, social activities, and also the chance to share our research with the group through short presentations. It was too good an opportunity to miss — especially as attendance at the writing retreat was funded — huge thanks to ERA and SAIN!
Having arrived earlier than most, for my extended research trip, I was one of the first to check in at the former prison — enabling me to settle in over a nice dinner, but fall straight into bed in my ‘cell’! I was tired, as it had already been quite a full-on week!
The organisation, just as it had been in Stirling, was impeccable — we’d been advised of other mates’ arrival and departure times (to co-ordinate travel together), and had received the schedule in advance so we knew what to expect! What we hadn’t bargained on was the incredible hospitality of the Swedish, including my introduction to the concept of ‘fika’ — see blog post three and sharing three meals a day with the group.
Wednesday morning gave me the chance to catch up with a friend from Stirling, before joining the others for our first shared lunch together and then kicking off the retreat with introductions, short research presentations, and an introduction to ELSA (the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing) by Dr Brian Beach (University College London / Karolinksa Institutet).
I was particularly excited about our short presentations, as this was the first time I’d had the opportunity to share our co-created postcard blog series, from my Take a Walk in My Shoes research project. Also, in Stirling I’d use haiku poems for my research presentation, this time I used the postcards…
What’s always fascinating for me at ‘gerontology’ events is the rich diversity of research interests and approaches. We’re all focused on aspects of ageing, but bring an incredible variety of topics, methodologies and personalities — it’s great!
We heard about the Intersectional Stigma of Place-based Ageing (ISPA) project, explored voices of older people from marginalised communities and women living with the impact of intimate partner violence.
We learnt about end of life care through the lenses of understanding health inequalities towards the end of life with dementia and through the architectural design of hospices in England; and considered emotional and physical wellbeing through psychological studies into depression and future-time perspectives, and the impact of the built-environment design of housing and healthcare on the psychology of its users.
Age-friendly design and social relationships in physical spaces and urban neighbourhoods, environmental design for ageing and cognitive health, and the detection and assessment of dementia in the autistic population also featured in the presentations, as well as how stress in earlier life and impact health and functioning in later life.
Further research projects are exploring health inequalities in ageing through the interplay between genes and socioeconomic environment, and focusing on how life-course factors shape health and work prospects in later life; in addition to a focus on extended working lives, risk and protective factors for cognitive ageing and dementia.
Healthy ageing was explored in relation to physical function, high-intensity interval training, cardiovascular and cognitive health, and psychological health during the retirement transition.
The writing retreat provided equal measures of intense research focus and writing, with time to enjoy our local setting and spend time with friends. This balance isn’t easy to get right — but it was done here with thought, care, and lots of time for eating and drinking together!
Since attending this ERA event in April, I’ve been invited to present at the ERA pre-conference, which takes place before the main BSG conference in June 2025, AND have secured a bursary to attend. Thank you!

During my recent trip to Stockholm, I was working remotely on New York hours. I ended up loving this weird working schedule. I would explore the city from 9am-3pm, work 3pm-12:30am, and then sleep 1am-9am. Since I working during dinner hours, I decided to orient my trip around a daytime delicacy — pastries. Each day, I explored a new part of the city in search of the best cardamom bun.
I’ve always been a huge fan of cardamom, so I was excited to learn how ubiquitous cardamom buns (aka kardemummabulle) are in this city. They were all delicious, so it’s really about finding the one that meets your taste — they ranged from bready to buttery and from sugary to spicy. Many bakeries were closed for summer break, but these were the favorites I tried:

Updated September 2019
This guide is meant to help you navigate the Stockholm Tech/Startup Scene.
Stockholm’s tech scene is considered one of the leading in the world, and it’s growing quickly. Investments are at record levels with $1,4Bn invested in 2016, and $1,75Bn exit value in the same year.
In the center of every startup community are the entrepreneurs. Without them there wouldn’t be a startup community to begin with. After the entrepreneurs, there’s a second layer of support from investors, government, universities etc. These form an ecosystem that can be hard to navigate.
To help you navigate I’ve listed the organisations and initiatives that support tech startups in one way or another — and that can be found in Stockholm.

Every school day, I send my kids into a building where other people take on a role in loco parentis, meaning in place of a parent. In many ways, this is a wonderful oppotrunity for them. In others, it’s kind of like sending them to that ex-spouse whose views vary so widely from yours that it’s a wonder your kids haven’t fallen into a chasm of confusion yet.
This particular rant is about the chasm of differences between our heroic attempts at engaging in good nutrition at home v. the notorious, the storied, the hallmarked….SCHOOL LUNCH.
Yes, the ominous school lunch has received its due reputation over the years — often appearing in more than just a cameo in our favorite coming-of-age TV and movies, rued for its terrible taste and dubious ingredients. It even became the star of one of the best comedic outputs from Adam Sandler and Chris Farley (say it with me: sloppy, sloppy Joe).
But it’s not just the taste or the ingredients that I feel urged to rant about today. It is the two-strike punch that is its lack-luster nutritional value plus my utter lack of control over it.
What caused this most recent bout of rage, you might ask? A simple review of our school’s menu of the day, in order to help my kids decide whether to bring home lunch or school lunch. And what did I find upon venturing into that dark abyss?
Our school district feeds our kids “entrees” of — I kid you not — cinnamon rolls. And these are served with a side “vegetable” of — no, really — tater tots.
This is not a joke.
Then they talk to my kids about the dangers of peer pressure on forming unhealthy habits…
The object lesson comes when my kid brings their broccoli and chicken to school and watches all ten of their friends eat cinnamon rolls next to them, so then they have broccoli, chicken, and cinnamon rolls (which, who wouldn’t?).
I have no idea who came up with the meal plan, who put it into writing, who reviewed it, who approved it. I do understand that there are limitations that those persons are working with, including systematic problems and budgetary issues. I also think they were either uninformed or wholly uncreative, un-adaptive, and unresourceful. Or, they also make bad choices for themselves and don’t want to admit it, so they just perpetuate the problems. Now I shall venture into the swamp of that latter estimation:
A few days ago, I came across a social media post (not exactly reality, I know) pleading with folks in a Type One Diabetes group to “agree and acknowledge” that Type Two Diabetes is not caused by diet. Because I am a glutton for punishment, I went to the comments. I expected to see at least some folks kindly or courteously disagreeing, (because this particular group is generally kind and courteous) but…I didn’t. Instead, I saw a whole lot of “yeah, it’s a complex issue,” or “yeah, it’s unclear” nonsense. Why are we telling ourselves this story (at least online)?
Our insulin sensitivity becomes less sensitive due to overuse, and how do we cause overuse? Um, by overusing it…e.g., by feeding it lots of things that require insulin (cue cinnamon rolls and tater tots).
I’m getting pretty sick of people in our culture trying to excuse away suboptimal choices because they feel bad about themselves for making those choices. The truth is this: will power is hard (especially at first) and much harder when it also involves counter-culture, and right now, our culture is a punk kid with a green mohawk and leather coat who is not only dogging us, but whom our parents actually hired to watch us, so we can’t get away from him, and he’s constantly egging us on to do stupid shit in the form of terrible nutrition. We don’t have to lie to ourselves in order to cut ourselves slack about this.
But instead of saying “those donuts sitting feet away from me in the staff room, every single Monday, without fail, with their pink frosting and happy-go-lucky sprinkles, make it much more difficult for me to not eat them,” we tell ourselves this story instead: “those donuts in the staff room aren’t actually bad for me.” Both statements cut us some slack, but the first one is true and the second one is a lie.
And only the first one has the added benefit of reminding us that the culture around us is a problem, and that we could actually address it, at least little by little. The lie, on the other hand, just perpetuates the system that continues to peer pressure us into making choices that deteriorate the mid- and end-years of our lives.
So what to do about it. First, cut yourself slack in the form of actual truth. You are living in Foodcourtia, and that makes it very dificult to make good choices.
Second, don’t be the person who brings donuts, or who puts candy on your desk, or who brings mounds of shareable snacks to events (did you know the word — the very idea — of a “snack” was invented by the food industry in order to sell you more stuff? I shall refer you to Invader Zim for a lighthearted way to laugh about this). It’s unecessary to add to the problem. Do be that person who dares to bring single-ingredient foods, vegetables, protein, etc. to the world’s staff rooms, desks, and events instead.
Because, you, too, can be a punk kid with a mohawk peer pressuring the people around you.

“ Topophilia is the love of place, a deeply felt affective response to the environment. It is more than a preference; it is a visceral attachment to a locale that resonates with memory, identity, and aesthetic or cultural meaning.” – Yi-Fu Tuan, Topophilia: A Study of Environmental Perception, Attitudes, and Values (1974)
The term Topophilia, coined by geographer Yi-Fu Tuan, refers to the emotional bonds between an individual and a certain place. When examined philosophically, Topophilia may be understood as more than emotional attachment; it becomes a lens through which existence is structured and understood. This essay develops a first-person philosophical reflection on my Topophilia, grounded in personal experience of Stockholm as a city whose atmospheric restraint and spatial quietude have reshaped my understanding of happiness, time, and selfhood. In the city where I have encountered what I refer to as Nordic Euphoria, which I define as, a sustained condition of existential balance and interior coherence, and not just a euphoric peak of sensory pleasure. My intention here is to articulate how specific geographies can participate in the formation of lived meanings, and how they function as existential orientation.
The notion of Topophilia is often reduced to sentimental longing or cultural nostalgia. Yet when viewed through the lens of existential philosophy and phenomenology, it appears as a far deeper relation. Hence, a mode of attunement between inner and outer worlds. In other words, the experience of being in a place may signal a deeper ontological fit, where the external rhythms of a landscape mirror or harmonize with one’s inner structure of feeling. In the context of Stockholm, this alignment revealed itself not through dramatic moments, but in a quiet and recurring realization of coherence. The slow unfolding of time, the softness of urban soundscapes, and the restraint in visual stimuli all contributed to a sense of interior deceleration. Time, in this place, did not push forward – to me, it deepened. This temporal stillness allowed for a psychological settling, where being became less fractured and more whole.
The specific characteristics of Stockholm is in its Northern flavour, muted colors, and measured pace that engage the phenomenology of place in unique ways. These elements invite a form of presence that is not about stimulation but about stillness. This is not the absence of movement, but the presence of calm. Besides, the city’s space becomes an aesthetic and affective medium through which one experiences a non-anxious, grounded form of subjectivity. The condition of Nordic Euphoria is not commonly described in either philosophical literature or urban theory. It is neither hedonistic nor ecstatic. Rather, it is my sustained experience of equilibrium. It arises from the city’s spatial ethos; the silence of winter, the rhythmic calm of public spaces, and the sense of contemplative detachment embedded in the architecture itself. This spatial environment subtly constructs a psychological atmosphere in which self-conscious striving diminishes, and being-in-the-world becomes sufficient in itself.
In this context, Topophilia becomes more than a desire for familiarity or beauty. It is a structure of belonging that roots identity not in biography but in spatial resonance. Stockholm, in this reflection, becomes not a setting but a co-constitutive element of identity. The city’s stillness mirrors and shapes a form of joy that is not externalized, but interior. This mode of happiness resists conventional definitions not depending on progress or fulfillment, but on presence. It is the joy of walking without purpose, of looking without need to possess. In Stockholm, the relationship to space becomes one of trust, or a confidence in which no performance is needed to justify one’s being. In this trust, I found a form of happiness that I had never known before, and which I refer to as a form of “existential arrival”.
In essence, place is not a neutral backdrop to human experience, but it is often a silent participant in shaping who we become. When understood deeply, Topophilia is not about place alone but it is about the self-in-place, and about the transformation of subjectivity through spatial experience. The experience of Stockholm as examined here is not anecdotal but archetypal; it shows how space, when aligned with one’s existential rhythms, becomes a silent teacher of stillness, presence, and coherence. The eternal Topophilia to Stockholm is not nostalgia for a fixed past, nor fantasy of escape. Therefore, it is an ongoing, lived alignment between external geography and internal structure. Simply put, my Nordic Euphoria is not a memory but it is a way of being, where my sense of self – no longer fragmented by acceleration or noise, finds rest in the fold of place.

Every researcher has that one piece of lab equipment they’re irrationally attached to, the old centrifuge that rattles like a lawnmower, the cracked beaker they refuse to throw away, or the pipette that’s seen them through every late-night experiment.
For me, it’s a pipette. And if it could talk, it would probably file a complaint.
This is the story of a partnership that started with respect and careful handling… and spiraled into something much more chaotic. A love-hate relationship built on duct tape, bad habits, and stubborn loyalty.
Back when I first got this pipette, it was love at first click. It fit perfectly in my hand — sleek, shiny, ready to help me conquer experiments one microliter at a time.
“Ah, yes, the glory days,” my pipette would say now. “Remember when you used to respect me?” it would sigh. “You used to calibrate me. Now you just pray.”
In those early days, I carried it around like a newborn. I placed it gently on foam pads, wiped it down after every assay, and whispered silent apologies if I accidentally tapped it too hard.
“I did have feelings,” it would say. “Now I just have scratches and abandonment issues.” “Your pipetting technique is why my therapist says I have trust issues.”
But fast forward to year two of grad school. I’m tired. It’s tiring. We’re still pretending we’re fine.
“You’re one coffee spill away from dropping me again. I know it. And I’m not emotionally ready.” “Now you throw me around like I wronged you personally.” “I’m in my third existential crisis this week — and that’s just from your PCR setup.”
These days, I barely think before I grab it. I jam tips on like I’m trying to break a world record. Calibration? A distant memory. I tell myself I’ll “definitely do it tomorrow,” knowing surely that I won’t.
“You used to warm me up,” it grumbles. “Now you treat me like a glue stick with a grudge.” “Precision? Sweetheart, I’m eyeballing volumes at this point.” “I’m not a pipette anymore. I’m an emotional support stick.”
Sometimes, when my experiments fail and the pipette aspirates weirdly, I glare at it like it personally betrayed me.
“YOU forgot to pre-wet the tip,” it would hiss. “Don’t gaslight me.”
Maybe — just maybe — I’m the problem. “Oh, you think?” the pipette snaps.
There are newer pipettes in the drawer. Calibrated. Smooth. Reliable. But I don’t reach for them. It’s always you, old friend.
“Stockholm syndrome. Look it up,” my pipette mutters, rolling its imaginary eyes.
At this point, we’re both hanging on by willpower, static electricity, and two pieces of lab tape.
“You think your data’s unreliable? Buddy, I’m running on trauma and duct tape,” it says, deadpan.
And yet, I can’t throw it away. We’ve been through too much. It’s more than a pipette now, it’s part of my PhD trauma. “One more semester,” it whispers. “Then I ghost you.”
Maybe science is also like life, it is about learning to love the broken things that still show up every day, even when they talk back.

Stockholm’s skyline from Södermalm is something special that ensnares your senses with the same sort of soft-spoken estranged quirkiness you’ve seen in similar European cities or in the smaller surrounding suburbs encircling them. You know the kind of suburbs I mean. The ones where you end up celebrating the New Year because your long-distance girlfriend’s friends live in city-skirting cottages. The ones where you’re quickly forced to accept that the WiFi just isn’t gonna work so you connect to Baileys instead. The ones where people mostly don’t speak English and you finally file that three-day Duolingo streak you achieved in 2013 under ‘non-functional’.
Also filed under ‘non-functional’ is the Katarina Elevator, the second thing to catch your eyes when you’re treading November puddles across the bridge into Södermalm — the first is an impromptu paste-up anti-Trump exhibition tied to the hashtag #PensForFreedom. When you’ve had a sensible chuckle at The Donald redrawn as various memes and fascist figures, you hop on the free roaming data your phone plan has blessed you with, Google ‘bridge elevator soda mall’, and tap ‘did you mean: bridge elevator södermalm’. You read that the local hard hats closed the lift in 2010 because it had rusted into a death trap. Sounds fun, you think.
Though the lift itself is closed, the span of bridge between its peak and the heights of Södermalm is still open and littered with throngs of tourists as awkwardly monolingual as yourself, so you summit the substitute lift-shaft: a string of wooden steps zig-zagging from the lowly lock up to where the lookout kisses the cliff. Walking out into the elements, you instantly start to visualize all the photos you’re gonna take, and the double-tap-baiting hashtags to go with them. There are lengths of metal wiring above the hip-height barriers, so you grip your iPhone extra tight and slip it between the safety cables.
Why is there a large Coca Cola sign fastened to the façade of that building? It doesn’t look like a factory. If it is a factory, well, damn, cute factory. There’s a huge Heineken sign a few buildings over, too. It makes you want to go buy a pint, until you remember Stockholm booze prices. Either way, you’re gonna do some cool shit with the red and green of the signs when you edit these photos in Lightroom and VSCO later. Snap, snap, snap. Oh, and there’s the Stomatol sign you read about on Atlas Obscura. It’s the oldest animated sign in Sweden. It still lights up at night in the same way it has since 1909. It’s a tube of toothpaste.
You’ve never been this excited by an animated illuminated tube of toothpaste.
Yellow and orange have always been your favorite colors. You’ve convinced yourself it’s because they’re attention-grabbing shades which make people stop and look at your photos on Instagram, but deep down inside you know it’s because a few of your crushes have had the slightly manic pixie dream girl tendency to wear bright colors. Now it’s time to crush on some buildings, because the Stockholm city skyline you see from the bridge is a beautiful blend of fall hues. Why the endless layers of yellow and orange architecture? You’d Google it but your phone has died because the battery got too cold.
There’s something bothering you about a few of your cityscape photos, and you realize it’s a construction site in the corner. A jagged hole at the center of a crossroad bordered by a clashing blue tarp. You look out, and notice for the first time that the cityscape is dotted by a whole web of these pockmarks. It’s like taking a selfie and gradually counting all the spots on your face. People regurgitate the cliché that living life through a camera or a screen stops you from seeing the beauty in the world, but if anything, it just helps you see the shitty stuff faster.
The dot-to-dot of building works reminds you of Berlin. That time your other long-distance girlfriend said the German capital’s like one big eternal construction project. That’s a cute and endearing observation, you think. It’s a shame you only saw Berlin from one of those open-top double-decker tour buses. Why did you do that? You’re better than that.
You made up for it, though, by completely eschewing public transport in Sweden. You and your travel companions walked everywhere. Heck, you didn’t even ride the funicular to the top of the open-air museum-zoo hybrid Skansen, and funiculars align perfectly with your love of ageing quirky technologies, Tom Scott videos, and not climbing hills. You even skip the metro when the snow settles and turns the ground into an icy deathtrap on your final day in Stockholm. You throw on your warm clothes, right? Nope. Somehow, you’ve become known as the guy who always wears shorts, and you can’t just break a two-year streak because global warming isn’t doing its job properly.
Your friends fly back to the US. Two days later, Trump gets elected. No amount of warm clothes can help with that coldness.
You’ve still got seven hours in Stockholm by yourself before you board the Arlanda Express and head to the airport, and you’ve made plans to meet up with another friend in Sweden. She’s Latvian, and you’ve only met her once, at a garden party back home in Portsmouth. You’re pretty sure you got really drunk and miscommunicated an opinion about national stereotypes in a way that insulted her, but she still wants to see you, so that’s nice. You flick your access card into the old suitcase the hostel have fashioned into a deposit box and walk out into the snow, and for the first time in two years, you feel like it isn’t working out between you and your shorts.
It quickly becomes apparent that your thinly-soled Dunlop canvases have no grip, and your feet threaten to quit their job and let gravity fill the vacancy. You start walking slowly and carefully, but realize this probably makes you look cold. Cold? You can’t be seen to be some weak human with feelings and senses. You’re a hardened shorts veteran. So you speed up, even though this triples your chances of slipping up and breaking an arm. You’re aware this is stupid, because the European Health Card in your wallet expired in 2014. But the Nando’s loyalty card in front of it is still valid, so there’s a silver lining.
You’ve got your go-to response to “aren’t you cold wearing shorts in this weather?” locked and loaded on your lips: “nah, it’s a warm summer’s day every day in my life.” You’ve been saying it ever since it made a guy smile while you waited for a train in Amsterdam one time. Nobody asks, though. They laugh from afar instead, sometimes at you, sometimes with you. One guy mutters something that sounds like “idiot” under his breath, but he was probably saying something in Swedish, like the Swedish word for “idiot.” Another guy says he’s from Bulgaria and follows you down the street asking for money. He doesn’t even acknowledge your shorts.
Drottninggatan, Riksgatan, and Västerlånggatan slip into one another, and you unsteadily slalom between tourists stopped in their tracks by Gamla Stan’s glowing maze of souvenir shops. “Consumer whores,” you mutter under your breath, making a mental note of a Dala horse you simply must come back and buy later. Soon, you shuffle into Slussen, Södermalm several slippery steps away. Your eyes flicker between the Katarina Elevator and the architectural lasagne behind you in Gamla Stan. There’re still two hours before you’re due to meet your Latvian friend, so you clumsily clamber uphill like a kid going the wrong way up a slide.
The Coca Cola (‘Drink’ is spelled ‘Drick’, you realize), Heineken, and Stomatol signs, the endless layers of orange and yellow, skyrocketing spires of verdigris patinas, the caverns of construction cryogenically comatose, and the railway bridge threading through. It’s all capped in a thin film of frost and snow, and the part of your brain which cries at Love Actually every Christmas sheds a little tear at the sight of the once-fiery fall-colored façades doused to a blend of beiges by the icy whites and chilling blues of this overnight refrigerator of a city.
You’re what people who ask “is your email address all one word?” call a ‘millennial’, so you abide by your natural instinct of instantly Instagramming the view, forcing yourself to tap out a caption despite the fact that your frozen fingers are refusing to move with the same stubbornness as you insisting on avoiding long pants.
After quickly dismissing the idea that the Stomatol sign might make a rad tattoo, you turn to walk off the Katarina Elevator bridge, venture into Södermalm, and hunt down the coffeeshop your friend has picked out. Your final lone thought is that ‘Stomatol’ and ‘Södermalm’ might very well sound similar, but you daren’t tell anyone in case that sneaky umlaut screws everything up.
Over matcha lattes and sweet teas, you and your friend open up new worlds to one another. You drown her in social media advice that’ll help with the launch of a humanitarian podcast she’s working on, and she unlocks an interest in fine dining you didn’t know you had parked in your brain’s overflow garage. Her interest in artistic cuisine is partially sparked by her boyfriend working as a chef at Buckingham Palace. Your interest in social media is partially sparked by that one time a picture of you sitting on the kitchen floor clutching a toaster to your chest went moderately viral.
You fly home, slip on some jeans, nod with satisfaction at the 83 Likes you got on the snow-capped cityscape photo, sit down to watch Chef’s Table, and wonder why you didn’t ask your Latvian friend whether her boyfriend ever petted the Queen’s corgis.

Originally published by The Local Sweden on Jan. 15, 2016
Amayd, a Nigerian mechanic, Thomas, a Swedish former bus driver, and Zina, a Roma magazine vendor, have one thing in common: struggling to find a place to sleep in Stockholm.
“It’s hellfire,” Amayd described life on the streets. A short man with a slow gait, grey-speckled beard, and blood-laced eyes, Amayd is a 42-year-old father from Nigeria. After 13 years as a permanent resident in Spain, he arrived to Stockholm two weeks ago.
Every night, he’s entered the lottery for a bed at a Salvation Army-run centre with success. But on Sunday, his name wasn’t drawn — and Amayd had nowhere to sleep. He stayed in the Central Station until it closed, then spent the night walking through snow-blown streets.
“I only have one coat,” Amayd said. “I was afraid to die of the cold.”
Amayd’s story is extreme. While he’s one of at least 2000 people defined as homeless in Stockholm, the city categorizes homelessness on a spectrum that extends to those living in government-assisted apartments. It also boasts a unique “roof-over-your-head” guarantee ensuring that no resident has to sleep outside.
As a European Union migrant, though, Amayd doesn’t fall under this guarantee. Stockholm’s homeless population is starkly divided between Swedish citizens and permanent residents versus EU migrants. Although the two groups share similar needs, registered citizens and residents receive social services, but unregistered migrants aren’t entitled to government benefits.
“If you’re not registered and you don’t have any money, we’ll give you economic help and shelter,” said Lena Svärd, director of the city’s emergency homeless reception. “You can stay here for three months, but if you don’t find a job or nothing happens after that, we can’t help you and you can’t stay.”
While Stockholm’s social services fund non-profit organisations to help temporary migrants, they focus on tackling Swedish homelessness.
‘Roof Over Your Head’ Just A Start
In 2015, Stockholm’s unit for the homeless helped 1475 clients — 84% of whom were males, most between the ages of 45–65. The city runs six shelters with space for 207 clients, but a bed is just the first step.
“Only around 10% of our clients live in shelters,” explained Jenny Swärd, director of the unit for the homeless. “But it’s not a long-term solution. Shelters can hinder your ability to overcome homelessness. Some people get adjusted to staying there, and when we offer them an apartment with support, they wonder why they have to go and pay rent.”
Social workers like Swärd attribute homelessness among Swedes to three main causes: lack of housing, substance abuse, and mental health. To address the first cause, Swärd and her team try to get clients into a permanent place — a tough job in Stockholm’s competitive housing market.
“It’s difficult to get an apartment, and if you have problems, it’s difficult to stay if you don’t get support,” she said. “If clients get good support, around 90% can stay in their apartments. If they live there for one year and everything works out fine, they get the contract for themselves.”
46% of the clients who left Swärd’s unit last year now live in their own place. But Bodil Nilsson, director of the Salvation Army’s drop-in centre for homeless Swedes, doubted whether this would solve the core issues.
“Our guests are living on the edge of society,” said Nilsson. “Many of them have a place to stay, and some have their own contract, but that doesn’t mean they’re happy. Getting their own apartment is not the solution, and they can lose it because of old habits.”
Core Issues Mental Illness and Addiction
‘Old habits’ are drug and alcohol addictions that estrange clients from their families, cause health problems, and hinder individuals from keeping jobs.
Karin Perak, a social worker with the city’s outreach team that meets the homeless on the streets, claimed substance abuse and mental illness are the main causes of homelessness among a majority of Swedes.
The latter is true for Thomas Ljungberg. A self-depreciating but good-humored 50-year-old with sparse ginger hair, Thomas commandeered a table with two friends at the Salvation Army Monday morning. He’s been unemployed and homeless because of mental illness since 1997.
“I experienced traumatic things in the past that I couldn’t process, and it broke my mental health,” he explained. “I worked as a bus driver for 7 years, it was the best job I ever had, but my brain was overloaded. When I get tired, I can’t control myself, and I didn’t want to have a busload of people behind me, so I chose to stop because I was broken down mentally.”
For 13 years, Thomas slept in temporary shelters until getting his own apartment, supported by the government, five years ago. He now regularly sees a psychiatrist.
“I don’t think of it as helpful, but I guess it is,” he said. “4 years ago, I was like a walking zombie; I could have never sat here and had a conversation.”
Whatever the cause of homelessness, many homeless individuals simply need help navigating their way through the complicated social system.
Nilsson explained: “They come to us because they lack the ability to take responsibility, or they’re away from the system and they don’t have the strength or energy or knowledge to get back. Often they want help, but they’ve been in the situation for so long, they say there’s no point. It takes a lot of courage to turn your life around.”
“But it’s possible,” Swärd said. “The city is expanding every day, but we have fewer homeless people.”
While homelessness among Swedes has steadily decreased in recent years, though, the number of homeless EU migrants skyrocketed.
Migrants Survive on the Fringe
“In the past four to five years, it’s gotten worse,” said Björn Taikon, a community worker with 25 years experience in the municipality. “More people are coming because all of Europe is closed.”
Social services estimate there are now between 600 to 1000 EU-migrants without regular income or proper housing in Stockholm. 40% are Romani people, or gypsies.
“It’s very difficult to work with this population, because the long-term solution is in their home country,” said Åsa Lindhagen, Stockholm’s vice-mayor for social affairs who represents the Green Party in the national parliament. “It’s a shame and tragedy that we haven’t succeeded better in Europe to distribute the wealth to everyone. So we have to do everything we can to make it easier for their stay here, especially during winter.”
“When we found out that people were sleeping on the streets and it was very cold, the city offered shelters,” said Swärd, “so that people won’t die.”
In November 2014, the city began funding non-profit organisations, including the City Mission, Salvation Army, and Philadelphia Church, to provide shelter during winter nights.
Taikon and his colleague Moishe Besokadap, also a Romani who grew up in Stockholm, took up the project. Nearly every day since then, the pair gather at designated times in central locations throughout the city.
Within minutes of the two men entering T-Centralen on Saturday morning, bearded men in parkas and dark-braided women in swishing skirts flocked to them, warmly greeting the two in the Romani language. Besokadap took each person’s ID card and wrote down his or her name and personal number. It’s his job to assign the person to a bed in one of the four night shelters on a first come, first served, basis.
“There are always too many people, but we try and find them other shelters,” Besokadap said. The only exception is if the temperature is below -7, when churches open their doors for people to stay without registering.
On Tuesday night, the temperature hovered around the limit. Thick snowflakes swirled in street lamps as a group of Roma trudged past deserted warehouses to the city’s largest EU migrant shelter.
At 9 pm, the doors opened. A volunteer checked each guest’s number, then took their 10 kroner ($1.75) entrance fee. Once registered, guests can stay five nights — then they must re-register, find a new place, or enter the lottery for one of the free beds.
Upstairs, volunteers dished out mounds of food and served steaming cups of coffee or tea. After eating, the guests settled into their bunk beds, took showers, started a game of chess, or showed off pictures of their children.
One married couple Gratian, 24 and Zina, 26, left their two children in Romania with Gratian’s mother to come to Sweden four months ago.
“It’s much better,” Zina said with a vivacious smile. “We get work here and our family gets food on the table.”
Gratian has found sporadic moving jobs while Zina cleans, sells magazines, or recycles cans. Without language skills and permanent residency, though, they’ve struggled to find permanent work, and they asked Besokadap for help to find better jobs.
“They trust us because we’re family,” he said. “They don’t trust the government, they think they want to do something to them or take something from them, but they trust us because no gypsy would want to hurt another gypsy.”
Downstairs, registration was complete, but two men still waited outside the front door, hoping there were empty beds left. There were not.
A volunteer told them to try another one of the shelters, explaining the location and pointing them in the right direction. The two men turned back into the snowy dark, hoping they’d get lucky that night.

I am not sure if you ever heard the term that I used to name the next chapter of WASTELESS WORLD STORY
If not I do recommend asking WIKIPEDIA
en.wikipedia.org
“Stockholm syndrome is a proposed condition or theory that tries to explain why hostages sometimes develop a psychological bond with their captors!”
To say it simply, or in other words, THE PREY LOVES THE HUNTER
Some confusion may resonate now in your head, looking at the city name in the article name and the city in the header image, which seems to be different and you are right, it is ABU DHABI, the location of COP28 which has been dedicated the extra articles published during the first week of the duration of the global CONFERENCE OF PARTIES that for 28 years already call the UNITED NATIONS
This image, from the same event led under the presidency of the CEO of the largest OIL PRODUCERS in the country and one of the world's leading PETROL COMPANIES, may increase your confusion.
This is good
Because CONFUSION seems to be missing in the heads of 97,000 participants invited to join COP28 with travel, accommodation, food, and drinks covered by the organizer and sponsors
Most of the invited participants (not speaking about politicians, lobbyists, and “world leaders”) come to change the world by contributing with their word to climate change. They know action is needed to realize where they come from.
After coming back the ENEMY is no more the ENEMY but a FRIEND or SOMEONE WHO CARES.
Does it sound familiar to you?
Ask your memory
If it does not help, check the start of this article
THE HUNTERS BECOME THE PREY
falling “in love” with those who let other people money to pay for the tickets, hotel rooms, entertainment, food, and drinks and I am sure everyone will not carry just a COP28 badge home, but great memories of great, nice, rich and influential people that behave like friends, listening for an hour to the claims to say at the end
YOU ARE RIGHT, WE WILL PUT MONEY IN FUND FOR YOU
Above is a screenshot from December 7, 2023, below LIVE COUNTER
It will be hard to return, from the luxury of lean cities, airconditioned rooms, halls filled with entertainment, and tables all the time filled with exotic dishes, from the place where a shower can be taken as long as you wish and you can fill hot water in the bathtub several times day, because this is the life they dreamed about and it exists already.
I would like to propose an extension of the WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE because I do not think the STOCKHOLD SYNDROM applies only to individuals or HUMANS. For a long time companies and organizations ENJOY their own
and no hostages, weapons, or danger need to be applied, MONEY is what makes one addicted
At the moment of integrating the table into my article COP28 and the UN promoted simultaneously on Twitter following poster
with this description
I do understand why the authors did not reply to my cooperation proposal sent when the first information leaked some time ago
Others, who get paid significantly more to come to COP 28 than just a return ticket, accommodation, food, and drink are proud that for them the planet is just a PLAYGROUND on which money can be made with ease
The “new” STOCKHOLM syndrome will act as the next ADHD, it will become the new NORMAL
Have a nice time free of waste and wasting in all its forms, stay safe and free, and BE HUMAN

Travel Diaries
Today I am writing about one of the most awaited experiences of my life — Visit to Avicii Experience museum. Being a huge Tim fan, I was eager to visit this place since it opened in 2021. I love visiting all kinds of museum because we get to know so much by looking at the history, the amazing artifacts and just get an experience of what it was like back then. But now in the developed parts of the world, museum is no longer a seeing experience but it’s more of feel experience. And this one is nothing short of that.
For me, there are two most favourite elements of the world — Music and Technology. The Avicii Museum brings both of them together and I just loved it. The museum is aptly named as it IS an experience. There was no rules for photography and videography and I realised why was that. You can click pictures and take videos as much as you want because when you experience it yourself, it’s absolutely different than seeing pictures or videos. That’s why I feel no regrets to share my memories with you about the most loved EDM artist ever. And I hope that everyone who is reading this blog gets to experience this amazing work at least once in their life.
Let me give you an idea of what the experience is like by sharing some keywords to help you decode.
Music Production — EDM — FL Studio — Ostermalm — Virtual Reality (VR) — Artificial Intelligence (AI) — Travel — Popstar’s Life — Concert Experience — Le7els — Life
Still confused? I can understand that for some of you who haven’t visited Sweden yet, might not know what ‘Ostermalm’ is. That’s okay. Based on my experience, I can try to summarise what the museum holds and may be you can decide then if it’s worth the visit or not.
LIFE OF TIM
@aviciiexperience beautifully showcases the whole life of Tim Bergling, starting with a glimpse of his first apartment at Ostermalm and they placed the objects in the room so meticulously that it looks like a 20 year old Tim is really living there. The whole museum is filled with headsets where you can just listen to different people who he worked with exclusively, about his early days as a music producer to an established global DJ and producer. They also showcased the trips he took in US and you can actually click your own picture int he same setup as her did when he went backpacking through US with his fellow musicians.
HIS ACHIEVEMENTS
If you are a huge fan of Avicii, then you would have already known about his top hits, Swedish Grammy and much more. But it’s a surreal experience to see all those accolades on the wall. This museum is started with the idea that things he achieved shouldn’t be locked in the box and must be shared with everyone. Apart from accolades, his achievements in my opinion are also the songs, synths and riffs he created and gave some legendary hits.
USE OF TECH
This is one of a kind experience due to the use of technology. Most of the tour is experienced through audio clips, interviews and exclusives which can be listened through headphones and that too in English as well as Swedish. Also, there are some VR experiences where you can be inside the studio along with some prominent musicians and sing along with them.
One of the very creative experiences is to go into a mirror cave which represents the downside of success and fame at a very young age. It depicts the reasons for Tim’s struggles through maintaining his mental health due to his schedule. Another one such experience was to go through his meditation journey in eastern Asia and just relax in a soothing environment with chime sounds.
Last but not the least, for those who missed his tribute concert in Stockholm, the museum has a short video from the concert in a large hall which gives you the exact vibe of that specific concert. It shows the most memorable tribute to Tim Bergling along the sounds of his epic EDM anthem Le7els.
Overall, my experience was nothing short of surreal with a mix of emotions — from happy to sad to just accepting. There was a signbook at the end in which we filled a page with our thoughts about the experience and as true fans
For the fans of EDM, I would totally recommend to visit.

I used to think I understood fear. The kind that sends your heart racing before an exam, the kind that creeps in like a shadow while you’re alone with a thriller on a stormy night. But nothing — absolutely nothing — prepared me for the visceral terror that engulfed me when the van door slammed shut behind me in downtown Seattle. In that instant, my world flipped upside down; I realized I had just been kidnapped by the very man I had idolized for years.
My fascination with Diljit began at the tender age of ten, sparked by a grainy YouTube video that crackled with raw energy. A renegade coder, a digital outlaw — he was everything I aspired to be. While other kids plastered their walls with posters of Marvel superheroes, I meticulously printed out screenshots of Diljit’s viral hacktivist interviews, taping them next to my bed like sacred relics. As my friends dreamed of college acceptance letters, I fantasized about finding him, connecting with the genius who danced on the edges of legality and morality.
And I did.
Years of subtle stalking ensued — Reddit threads dissecting his every move, late-night IRC chatrooms filled with whispers of his exploits, and an underground tech talk in Portland where I finally saw him in the flesh. I followed him, obsessed, worshiping at the altar of his brilliance. So when he threw a burlap sack over my head near Pike Place Market and shoved me into a rusted Sprinter van, I wasn’t angry. I felt honored.
His songs, the anthems of rebellion and defiance that once resonated with my youthful ambitions, now echo in my mind as haunting ballads of a fractured soul. Each lyric, once a rallying cry for freedom and individuality, now feels like a cryptic commentary on the very nature of obsession and the thin line between genius and madness. I find myself dissecting the metaphors he wove into his music, the raw emotion that spilled from his heart onto the page, and I can’t help but wonder if they were prophetic tales of his own descent into darkness. His melodies, which once inspired me to dream big and challenge the status quo, now serve as a chilling reminder of how easily the pursuit of passion can spiral into chaos. The notes linger in the air like ghosts, tugging at my consciousness, forcing me to confront the unsettling reality that the man whose voice ignited a fire within me is also the one who plunged me into the depths of fear. In this tortured symphony of admiration and horror, his songs have become both a soundtrack to my liberation and a lament for the hero I thought I knew.
He kept me locked away in a concrete basement that reeked of wet copper and lost dreams. The dim light flickered ominously from a single bulb, illuminating a metal toilet and a floor mattress so thin it felt like sleeping on a bed of nails. My meals were sparse — canned beans, stale granola, and bitter black coffee — but each morsel felt sacred, like communion with the divine.
Through the wall, I heard his voice — muttering code, typing furiously, yelling at himself in fits of rage and genius. I could feel the madness radiating from him, and I loved it. My childhood idol had transformed into a mythic ghost, and I found myself inside his lair, an unwilling accomplice in his chaotic world.
Every evening, he would enter, and our conversations evolved. Initially, they were riddled with insults and paranoia, but soon they blossomed into discussions of philosophy, hacktivism, identity, freedom, and fear. Yes, I was his prisoner, but I was also his audience, hanging on his every word.
One night, driven by an insatiable curiosity, I asked him, ""Why me?""
He didn’t meet my gaze. You were always watching. I figured you’d understand.
Just like that.
No dramatic farewells. No epic showdown. I walked out into the rain-soaked night, drenched and shivering, yet alive. But as I stepped into the world, it felt hollow, void of the vibrancy I once knew. The city around me felt fake — the noise too deafening, the people too… normal.
I wandered for hours, disoriented, until I stumbled upon a payphone. With trembling hands, I dialed the police, omitting any mention of Diljit. I simply said I was lost.
I think about him every day. Not in fear. Not in hatred. But in awe.
My kidnapper wasn’t just a monster lurking in the shadows; he was a dark mirror, reflecting back the fragmented pieces of myself I had long been afraid to confront. Each day, I grapple with the chaotic duality of my feelings — an intoxicating blend of reverence and confusion that twists in my gut like a serpent coiling tighter around its prey. How could someone I had idolized with such fervor, a figure who once embodied my wildest aspirations, morph into my captor, ensnaring me in a nightmare woven from the very fabric of my dreams?
I find myself caught in an emotional tempest, where every recollection is a jagged shard of glass. On one hand, there’s awe — a haunting admiration for the brilliance that fuels his madness, a genius that ignited the flames of my own ambitions. On the other, there’s bewilderment, a spiraling sense of betrayal as I wrestle with the horrifying reality that the man I revered became the architect of my imprisonment.
In the quiet hours of the night, when the world is draped in darkness, I replay our conversations like a broken record, trying to decipher the riddles of his psyche. What did it mean that I was drawn to him, captivated by his chaos? Was I merely a victim or an unwitting accomplice in a twisted tale of obsession and desire?
This internal struggle is suffocating. I’m left questioning everything: my values, my dreams, my very identity. The lines between admiration and horror blur until they become indistinguishable. I feel like I’m standing on the precipice of an abyss, teetering between the longing for understanding and the fear of what that understanding might reveal.
As I navigate this labyrinth of emotions, I realize that the true horror lies not in his actions, but in the reflection he casts upon me — a reminder of the shadows within, the dark corners of my soul I’ve yet to illuminate. In this surreal dance of captor and captive, I am left forever altered, trapped in a paradox of fascination and dread, haunted by the question: how could a hero become a villain, and what does that say about the hero I thought I wanted to be?

I could not remember exactly how I got to know Skogskyrkogården. I guess it was because I wanted to visit Avicii’s grave. And then I got the wrong information on the internet, saying that it was resting in this cemetery. So I googled it and found out that it has been on the list of UNESCO World Heritage since 1994.
Finally, I got the chance to visit it in late September this year. I went there with my Couchsurfing host. He has a great deal of knowledge regarding the history, architecture, art, music, movie, and so on. Besides, he is a huge fan of Greta Garbo, whose grave is also resting in this peaceful land. Thus, he became my private tour guide in Skogskyrkogården. And thanks to him, I had the chance to look at the corner that belongs to the legendary Hollywood star.
According to my host, the spirit of the design was to create harmony between nature and the burial ground. As such, the visitors may enjoy a sense of respect and tranquility. To quote the words of the flyer from the visitor center:
“The design is shaped around the experience of mourners, with a focus on the landscape and the capacity of nature to reconcile mourners with…

I was in Amsterdam, at the end of my journey, feeling very tired. I’d been traveling alone for over two months, carrying my bags. My hands and flat feet were hurting. I was tired of sleeping in strange beds and sharing rooms and bathrooms with strangers.
On that Sunday, my first job was to leave the hostel to buy some snacks and groceries for my long train ride to Stockholm.
After shopping, I went back to my hostel room and started packing my bags again — something I was very good at by then. I could pack my bag in less than 20 minutes without thinking about it. I collected the blankets, left them for cleaning, and left my room with my bags, heading to the reception.
Looking back, I can feel how much I wanted to go home. But I didn’t let myself give up. I was determined to keep traveling, to keep moving, with a clear mind and strong will.
I left the hostel and walked through the streets of Amsterdam, listening to Berlin techno on my earbuds, and never looking back.

I must have done something good in a former life, if you believe in that sort of thing. Because, even though I’m not a healthcare provider or over the age of 65, I was invited to get the COVID-19 vaccine just four weeks after it was released in the U.S.
I made my appointment with mixed emotions. Others need it more than I do. I work as an administrator at a university medical school. I never interact with patients; I’m a desk jockey, 100%. Yet, all healthcare and med school employees have been invited to receive the vaccine — probably because it’s too onerous to sort out which of the 26,000+ employees see patients and which don’t.
My first instinct was to pass — let others get it. I’d rather my mom or significant other or brother get it. Or your grandfather. Anyone. They are all in higher risk groups than I am. But, apparently, people who defer (with good intent) are causing bottlenecks and lags in distribution.
The prevailing opinion is: get it when you’re invited.
I arrived at the famed football stadium at the appointed time. A very orderly process had been set up. People…

Hey you, sitting on your sofa, drinking wine and eating an old Easter egg at 4 pm in the afternoon while tweeting “Hate this lockdown #openbackup” — I’m here to tell you you’re a fraud.
That’s right, you’re a big fat liar. You love lockdown. Go on, admit it.
Right now you’re meant to be working from home but you’re still in pyjamas wiggling your mouse every 5 minutes so it looks like you’re online.
Don’t tell me lockdown is worse than your old daily commute, the traffic jams, crowded trains and getting up 90-minutes earlier than you currently do to shower and pretend you’re a respectable human.
Sure, you might miss the pub and seeing friends, but because deep down in places you don’t talk about at parties (that you’re no longer allowed to go to), you want the lockdown — you need the lockdown.
All that guilt about not seeing friends and family has magically disappeared. No longer does every email and phone conversation have to end with “We must get together soon.” The game is up, no one even pretends anymore, it’s amazing. You’re finally free of social obligation.

I was born and raised in a democratic and capitalistic country but my parents imposed a socialist approach on me because that’s all they’ve known their whole life.
Contradictions and mixed messages left my generation confused and lost. My parents were not able to travel without a permission to leave Czechoslovakia. And usually that permission was not given if asked. And my only goal from early age was to travel and discover different cultures.
I wanted to live somewhere else, but my parents saw this as a danger, something I shouldn’t do and I should be happy where I am. This was purely a socialist approach and I don’t blame them.
Interestingly, my grandparents who shortly experienced their freedom after WWII and then they lost it in the Soviet invasion in 1968, they see communists as evil people and regime that made them fear for their life. And that’s the part my parents haven’t experienced. The main reason was a softer approach to communism which was called socialism.
My dad told me a story about my granddad. He was driving a train to Polish border in 1968 and out of nowhere, there was a Soviet tank on the rails that made him stop. Both my grand dad and the Soviet soldier didn’t know what to do so they just stared at each other for 3 days. My grandma feared the worst when she didn’t…
