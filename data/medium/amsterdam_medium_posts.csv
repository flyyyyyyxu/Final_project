This is a frequently asked question when I first meet people or talk with friends. I usually give a quick answer that comes to mind, but I’ve never really thought it through. Sunday night is the perfect time to do just that!
Among all the big cities I’ve visited, Amsterdam has a unique vibe that you can’t find in others. While places like New York, Taipei, Paris, London, and Munich are filled with tall, modern buildings, Amsterdam stands out with its distinctive charm, where the houses are typically not very tall and are built with red bricks, reflecting the city’s rich culture. Additionally, you can easily reach a canal every few minutes on foot, adding a natural touch to the urban landscape.
Unlike point 1, this isn’t unique to Amsterdam, but it’s still a significant factor in why I enjoy living here. I don’t drive and don’t have a license, which would be a major inconvenience in places like California, where everything is spread out and requires a car. In Amsterdam, however, the excellent public transport system allows me to easily reach shopping centers, my office, and even the suburbs. This is definitely a big plus for me.
I didn’t realize how convenient Amsterdam is until I visited other countries. Since moving here almost a year ago, I haven’t used any cash and I haven’t even withdrawn any cash. I’m personally very against using cash and avoid it as much as possible. In Amsterdam, I don’t even have to try. Even at traditional markets, vendors accept cards, and it’s rare for anyone to ask for cash. This is definitely a great plus!
Amsterdam is crowded compared to other cities in the Netherlands, but it still feels slower and less busy than many other major cities worldwide. People often bike or take public transit, resulting in less polluted air and a fresher atmosphere. This contributes to a cozy, slower-paced feel throughout the city. After 5 PM, stores close, so if you don’t plan to dine out, you can unwind and rest instead of engaging in a busy nightlife that sometimes creates more subtle mental stress.
Similar to other top countries, Amsterdam attracts talent from around the world. However, Amsterdam feels more inclusive, which is reflected in the language people are willing to use. If you enter a shop and give a small hint that you are an English speaker (for example, I usually start with a higher-pitched “Hi” instead of “Hoi” or “Hallo” 😆), they will easily switch to English. It’s also easy to make expat friends, as many people move here for work and are open to meeting new people.
If you’ve ever visited Amsterdam, what do you like about it?

Amsterdam undeniably ranks among the world’s most beloved destinations. Its captivating architecture and enormous intricate canal network weave a spell, effortlessly enchanting visitors. This welcoming city embraces tourists with open arms, boasting a population remarkably fluent in English, making independent exploration as a Non-Dutch speaking foreigner possible. Renowned for its safety and visual splendor, Amsterdam always offers a lot of experiences to pique traveler’s curiosity.
As an Indonesian, my perception of the Netherlands is layered with historical complexity. Our predecessors endured immense suffering in their fight for independence started in the 16th century, a struggle etched in collective memory for three and a half centuries.
Yet, a chance encounter with a veteran of the Dutch Military Aggression (1947) several years ago offered me a profound perspective. His words, “The first to apologize is the bravest. The first to forgive is the strongest. The first to forget is the happiest,” resonated with me deeply, despite language barriers. He recounted facing Dutch forces in Malang, his village’s devastation by explosions and fire, forcing him and his family to seek refuge in Pasuruan, East Java.
It took him almost seventy years to learn to forgive. He told me that he realized that lingering anger only fueled the bitterness, perpetuating a vicious cycle, and as a Christian, he believes God won’t like it. “Transferring this anger to future generations betrays the spirit of a warrior and my Christian faith,” he emphasized.
On an afternoon walk in Amsterdam two years ago, all of a sudden my gaze drifted upwards, landing on the word “Malang” on the front face of an old building on the street of Ververstraat 30, Amsterdam. In that instant, my mind went back to a conversation years ago. In my mind, the veteran’s words echoed: “The first to forgive is the strongest. The first to forget is the happiest.” A long pause punctuated my journey before I resumed walking eventually.
As the cool canal breeze whispered and the afternoon sun cast a peaceful glow, I stood before the former historical VOC (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie / Dutch East India Company) building. Today, facing its weathered facade, I wonder if fear can truly be measured in bricks and mortar. I stood still and in silence, I prayed: “May peace bless all veterans who fought for freedom, and may peace always be with these two countries”.
Forgiveness, I realized, truly fosters peace.
This Amsterdam trip resonated deeply, transcending mere sightseeing. It became a gateway, revealing two divergent paths: the darkness of hatred and the luminous expanse of peace.
The warmth of Amsterdam’s locals during my two-day visit surprised me. Interactions with locals flowed easily, shattering preconceived notions of a “fierce” city. Instead, I discovered a welcoming community steeped in rich history. It was undoubtedly a personal transformation rooted in the unexpected warmth of the city.
Like a painter smoothing past lines, time erases distinctions. Amsterdam and Batavia, the Netherlands and Indonesia, are no longer bound by the rigid constraints of their shared history. Peace has become the guiding hand, paving the way for understanding and connection.
Thank you for reading.

I’m a grandmother (“Oma in Dutch”) and have been living here for a little over the past two years. I’ve had several friends visit me from overseas and from other countries, and taking them to “see the sights” has been an educational experience for me as well. My recommendations below are written from my point of view as a 68-year-old with somewhat limited mobility and also as a grandmother who enjoys doing things with the grandkids. Wherever I’ve included links, they are places I’ve visited and experiences I’ve enjoyed. None of my links are affiliate links.
The City of Amsterdam is full of so many enjoyable things to see and do that it’s a good idea to make a plan for your visit based on several factors, including your budget, the timing and duration of your stay, your physical capabilities, your interests, and most important of all, whether or not you are comfortable riding a bicycle.
The weather needs to be considered. Bring rain gear if you’re coming in the winter or early spring (or any time of the year). If it’s still winter, you will probably be best off with layers, but make sure to bring at least one item that will serve as a windbreaker.

Travel tips from Locals and Tourists
I love Amsterdam. It’s a beautiful city with such a relaxed vibe (and not for the reasons you might think). There’s an understated confidence about it — a city that knows it’s great, but doesn’t have to shout it from the historical rooftops.
It’s one of my favorite cities and hope to go back again (and again). For my first visit, I went for 4 nights. 3 was plenty of time to see everything, but 4 made it more relaxing. Besides buying museum tickets, I didn’t plan too much before and gave myself a lot of time to explore (which basically meant taking pictures of every canal a million times). I would start each day at a museum, then would wander (eat, shop, pictures) for the rest of the day. This worked out perfectly.
Suggested length of visit: 3–5 days
I suggest staying along or near the Canal Ring (Grachtengordel) in the city center or near Museumplein (a large public space surrounded by a lot of museums). Two of my favorite hotels in Amsterdam:
The HoxtonI love this brand of hotels anywhere in the world — they encompass hipster millennial chic at its best. This location was once the Mayor’s home and is a combination of 5 canal houses. They also offer the Hoxton breakfast bags (one of my favorite Hoxton features!). It’s in the middle of the central part of the city right along the Canal Ring. It’s also really close to the Anne Frank House and near a lot of shopping and tourist hotspots.
Hotel JL No76This boutique hotel and quiet neighborhood had a cozy, home away from home vibe. It’s near Museumplein, which made the proximity nice for visiting the museums each day. The location also made it convenient for wandering other parts of the city and it’s not as touristy at night, which made for a nice, local escape.
Stroopwafel. Cheese. Apple Pie. What more could you want? Here’s a list of some of the favorite restaurants and foods from my trip.
Winkel 43I sat outside and watched the world go by while having an awesome slice of Dutch apple pie with a dollop of cream. Basic at its best.
Foodhallen (Resident tip)Large modern food hall with a local, energetic, and youthful vibe. It’s also in a more local neighborhood away from the standard tourist fare.
Stroopwafel Everywhere and addictive. You’ve been warned. I bought a few bags at a local market to bring home.
PoffertjesDutch mini pancakes. So cute and tasty. Found at restaurants and street markets everywhere.
FEBOThis might seem random, but you’ll see these ‘automat’ food shops are all over the city. You drop some money in the machines and out comes the ‘fast food’. An interesting experience to say the least. Croquettes are kind of their thing, but my favorite item is their soft serve ice cream — which you have to purchase from a human behind the counter and then they will bring it to you. Old school.
Dutch Cheese Shops These touristy cheese shops are everywhere. Not sure why I didn’t realize Dutch cheese was a thing until I visited (ummm like Gouda), but with most cheese, it’s worth a sample and a purchase. De Kaaskamer, the Amsterdam Cheese Company, or the Old Amsterdam Cheese Store are some good options to visit.
Belgian Fries / Frites Yes, it’s not Belgium, but the Frites are still delicious. There are a bunch of shops — some touristy, some not. Stop and have some frites in a paper cone with a tasty dipping sauce or toppings — best eaten cleanly with a fork.
Cafe De Klos (Resident tip)This is not Dutch food, but amazing BBQ. Can be a bit of a wait and I suggest paying with cash, but worth a shot if you’re nearby. The food comes with a side of sarcastic staff. If you can’t handle the heat…
Tosti (Resident tip)Essentially a grilled cheese with ham (or not). No specific spot, keep an eye out and try one if you see it.
Door 74Great speakeasy cocktail bar with the standard difficult to find entrance. It’s also listed as one of ‘The World’s 50 Best Bars’ (if you’re into that sort of thing). Look into making a reservation via phone ahead of time.
Albert HeijnLocal grocery chain. Great for basics and snacks during the trip (it’s also where I bought my Stroopwafels).
MuseumpleinA lot of the city’s major museums surround (literally one right next to another) this massive park-like public space in the center of the city. Staying near here makes museum hopping very convenient. This is also where you’ll find the main ‘Iamsterdam’ letters, which makes it a major gathering place for tourists.
RijksmuseumThe ‘main’ museum in Amsterdam and a must see. It’s at the edge of the ‘Museumplein’ and has a few notable works like Rembrandt’s largest and most famous painting The Night Watch and one of Van Gogh’s colorful self portraits.
Van Gogh MuseumI love Van Gogh, so this was a must for me. If you like him too, you should check this out for a deep dive into his life and work.
Stedelijk Museum This is the modern art museum, but I only recommend if you have time and you’re a fan of modern art.
Anne Frank HouseIt goes without saying that this is a must while in Amsterdam. It is a quiet and reflective experience. I had my own unique takeaways, and hopefully you will have yours too. Be sure to purchase your timed-entry ticket ahead of time (they sell out fast, so buy right after you book your flight). I recommend going when it first opens so it’s not as crowded.
Bloemenmarkt — Amsterdam Flower Market I love flowers, so I’m always excited to visit a flower market (I need to go back to the Netherlands during tulip season!). This ‘floating’ market located on the Singel canal features shop after shop with flower bouquets, trinkets and souvenirs. It’s cute, but very touristy. I bought some wooden tulips and took a lot of photos of flowers.
DAM square and Royal PalaceThe is really the heart of central Amsterdam and a very touristy area. Depending on your activities and walking paths, you’ll probably walk by this area often. There is also a lot of shopping in the area — from everyday to fancy.
Canal Boat TourI did the Friendship Amsterdam tour (recommended by a Resident) and loved it. I was afraid this might be too touristy, but taking a canal boat tour was recommended by a lot of locals. The tour departs from the Red Light District and is a fun way to see the city, canals, and bridges. I even made some new friends on the tour, how appropriate.
Red Light DistrictLocated in the De Wallen neighborhood, this was the only part of the city that felt seedy and unsafe, for obvious reasons. As recommended by locals, don’t go here alone at night.
Shopping StreetsThere are adorable shops all over the city. Some of my favorite streets for shopping include Leidsestraat (smaller shops), Nieuwendijk & Kalverstraat (bigger chain stores on either side of DAM square), Damrak (busy touristy street with a lot of shops and food, near the main train station).
In Amsterdam there are 165 canals and 2500 bridges (!), so it’s safe to say you probably won’t see them all. However, there are some cute, key canals and bridges in the city center you should check out.
The CanalsThe Canal Ring was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2010 and has four main canals: Singel, Herengracht, Keizersgracht, and Prinsengracht. These 4 canals essentially make a partial concentric U shape. The outer parts felt more local to me and the further into the center I went, the more touristy it felt. There are also what I like to call ‘mini canals’ like Leliegracht, Oudezijds Voorburgwal, and Reguliersgracht that connect to the larger ones and are just the cutest. The whole area is quintessentially Amsterdam with beautiful and historically significant Dutch houses, boathouses, bikes, and bridges.
The BridgesLekkeresluis Brug bridge is my favorite and makes for a great photo op. The others on my favorite list include Sint Jansbrug (a footbridge crossing the Oudezijdsvoorburgwal canal), Torensluisbrug (Amsterdam’s original Tower Bridge, and the oldest and widest), Magere Brug (a bridge with a lot of lights, saw on the canal tour), Blauwbrug (a fancy, French-like bridge).
LanguageHallo (hah-loh) — HelloAlsjeblieft (ahl-shuh-bleeft) — PleaseBedankt (ba-dankt) — ThanksDank je (dahnk-yuh) — Thank YouDank je wel (dahnk-yuh-vehl) — Thank You Very MuchJa (yah) — YesNee (nay) — NoNee Dank je (nay-dahnk-yuh) — No Thank YouDag (dahk) — Bye (have a nice day)Doei (doo-ee) — Bye (simple bye)Vaarwel (var-vel) — Goodbye
TransportationI took a bus to and from the airport right into the city center. A lot of people also take trains to/from the airport. The city transportation is mostly trains/trams, buses, cabs and of course bikes. Other than taking transportation to/from the airport, I walked the entire time — not even a cab or car service. I didn’t attempt a bike — seemed a bit chaotic. But overall it’s super easy city to navigate no matter your transportation preference.
Money Since The Netherlands is in the EU, their currency is (surprise!) the Euro. I mostly used my credit card (no international fee card) and some euro (probably no more than 10 euro a day). Of course the amount of cash you need depends on your daily budget. I appreciate that the world is using more credit cards, makes traveling to countries with different currencies a lot more seamless.
The X X XYou will see this everywhere. It’s a symbol of Amsterdam, and not for the risque Red Light District. It actually comes from Amsterdam’s coat of arms. So there you have it.

Hello everyone! My name is Davi, and I’m a security engineer at Zivver.
Can you believe it’s been about eight months since I made the leap from the sunny shores of Natal, Brazil, to the charming canals of Amsterdam, Netherlands? Time flies when you’re on an adventure!
I’m here to tell you a little bit about how this move was and give a glance at the past 8 months of my life.
My girlfriend and I always dreamed about living abroad, and Amsterdam was one of our main options. Of course, it was hard to leave a lot behind — all the friends and family and everything that we were used to — but we always like to look at the glass half full. Especially now when it’s so much easier to call family and friends and also travel to visit each other.
We arrived in Amsterdam during the summer, and it was an amazing start! Very sunny, and the weather is not so different from our home city. Of course, adjusting to life in a new country hasn’t been without its challenges. Navigating the Dutch language, adapting to different customs and traditions, and even just figuring out the best way to get around town has had its moments of frustration. But each challenge has been an opportunity for growth, and I’ve learned so much, experienced a lot of great moments, and created amazing memories and friendships.
Amsterdam has welcomed me with open arms, and I’ve fallen head over heels for this beautiful city. From its picturesque streets lined with historic buildings to its diverse and vibrant culture, every day feels like a new adventure waiting to unfold.
Also, we love to travel, and now that we are living in Europe, we can easily travel here and know all the places that we dreamed about.
Moving is challenging, but having a team to support you during this chapter of your life is amazing! From the People team’s help with everything to get settled until the quick tips and offers to help from everyone on the team during lunches and talks were outstanding. All the Zivvies really cared about me since the first day and how my partner and I were doing.
With a team like this, it’s easier to accomplish things, and speaking for the Security Engineering team, we accomplished a lot these last months. Zivver is a security company, so everyone from all the departments is concerned about security, and they offer amazing support for all the initiatives of our team.
In our team, we have some routine tasks like audits, investigating alerts and new vulnerabilities, and assessing security risks in our products and partners as well. But also, we have a lot of time to build things and improve our processes and tooling. Every 4 months, we plan together what we need to improve, and we plan our main initiatives for that term, and then we get it done!
A little bit more about our team, we are 4 in the Security team: Chris Stanley and I as security engineers, Walter Kovacevic as our security and privacy officer, and Nadine Hoogerwerf as our CISO. We work together a lot and also with different teams inside Zivver. We have a Weekly to discuss some topics and ideas and we have a lot of autonomy and freedom to organize our week and our tasks.
Speaking for the engineering side of our team, Chris and I wear many hats and we need to change them sometimes, which for me is very fun! Sometimes we need to respond to incidents and other times we need to do an internal security assessment where we try to exploit our own applications to find security issues and when we find them, we work with the responsible teams to fix them.
We work with a lot of certifications too, because we are a security company we need to prove to our customers that we are following the best practices in the market. So now and then we need to work together with auditors and gather evidence and this is done within the team depending on the certification we also need support from other teams as well like Infrastructure and internal IT.
This term, for example, we were able to improve our detection and response and also our vulnerability management process efficiency. It was very challenging for us; it involved a lot of new concepts and tools, but in the end, it was totally worth it, and we learned a lot. During this improvement, we even saved about 50% with our security cloud costs and tools.
Besides that we also work on the security culture of Zivver, so we try our best to share our knowledge with our colleagues. In fact, this month we are also starting our security champions program and it is very promising! We’ll start with the engineering team, and improve their security technical knowledge which is very valuable not only for us as a company but also for them as professionals.
From our 4 key values, the one that sums up the last 8 months for me is Be all in, not only in Zivver but in my life as a whole.
When we talk about being all in, it’s not about working a lot and being busy all the time; here at Zivver, the work-life balance is a must, and you see this example from everyone, since the onboarding, the message was very clear not only from the People’s team but from everyone: “Go live and travel! Travel here in Europe is cheaper!”. Well, the message was received!
Now let’s talk about what Be All In is. It’s to be engaged and passionate about what you are doing and during your day-to-day. It is about really caring about your teammates and how everyone has cared about me since my first day. It’s to care about our customers and partners during our day-to-day work and keep them in mind when we are doing something. It’s about a can-do attitude embracing challenges and learning from them.
And to be a security engineer in Zivver you definitely need to be all in! As I said before, here we need to wear different hats which sometimes can be hard to switch context. Also, the security field can be overwhelming with new vulnerabilities and attack techniques growing and being discovered every day, but together we are rocking it and evolving one step at a time.
As we all know, technology is always changing and we need to keep our minds sharp and learn new things all the time. Here at Zivver, we have a lot of time to study and improve ourselves technically and personally. This work-life-study balance that I have is very important to me because it keeps me happy and effective and allows me to solve problems a lot more efficiently.
Finally, being all in is also knowing what to focus on and prioritize, this way we can focus on what matters because we can’t do everything, and thinking this way it’s easier to achieve the work-life-study balance. That’s what be all in is and this is a lesson that I’ll bring with me for the rest of my life.
As I continue to settle into life here in Amsterdam, I’m filled with gratitude and happiness for the experiences I’ve had and the people I’ve met along the way. From exploring the city and bustling markets to tasting delicious stroopwafels and bitterballen, every day is a reminder of just how lucky I am to have this experience.
And to anyone out there considering taking a leap of faith and embarking on their journey, my advice is simple: go for it. You never know what incredible experiences await you on the other side.

‘How does Amsterdam compare to London, now that you’ve lived there for two years?’
Wait, my dad is asking me an open ended question? Instead of offering his unsolicited opinion, he’s curious about mine? I close my laptop, welcoming a discussion. ‘It’s very different,’ I start enigmatically.
‘Really? At least the weather is the same, right.’
Here we go again. The true source of my Amsterdam flat deposit: the €1 I got for every time someone found out that I used to live in London, and told me that at least I didn’t have to get used to the weather.
‘No! It’s not! It’s worse. It’s ten times worse. London is just overcast all year round. Amsterdam has this constant wind and rain, and gusts that push you off your bike, and showers that hit you across your face…’ I sigh, but can I blame my dad, though?
He’s got a fair assumption. The one I had made before I moved here, together with a bunch of other assumptions I didn’t question. About all the things I had found in London that I was going to find in Amsterdam, too.
Of course I wanted a difference, I wanted a change. Before I moved, I had thought long and hard about all possible aspects in which these two cities would be different. But, as I described before, you can’t expect that a change will bring all the difference you were hoping for, and none that you’ll be disappointed by. You embrace them both and that’s how you fall in love with a city.
And so, as I boarded a KLM City Hopper for a mere 1 hour flight from one Northern-European capital to another, little did I know about all the things I’d found in London that I was not going to find in Amsterdam at all. The things I was leaving behind.
Let’s get it out of the way since it’s probably the most contentious opinion: Amsterdam is White. Or rather, it’s racially segregated.
Sure, there’s about 180 nationalities living in the Amsterdam area and non-Dutch inhabitants are a majority (source). After the Dutch, the biggest population groups come from Morocco, Suriname, Turkey and Indonesia (source). And sure, if you move to Amsterdam — or the part that is usually referred to as Amsterdam — you will meet people from all over the world. However, this world will include places like Germany, Italy, Spain, South Africa and the USA. To really notice other races other than Caucasian, you’ll need to take a trip to the end of the metro line, like Nieuw West, Bijlmer, or my home, Noord. Although Noord has many faces: my home is actually in the gentrified new built area, the whitest neighbourhood I’ve lived in since leaving Poland.
I still notice the predominant Whiteness, but barely. It struck me in my first month: looking around in public spaces downtown and spotting just a few People of Colour, usually expats from Asia. I remember the first time we went for team drinks and how it didn’t feel right that in a crowded pub in the centre, everyone looked kind of the same. Now it feels normal.
I blend in with the majority, so the population’s homogeneity doesn’t bother me, unless I consciously remind myself about it. And that’s scary.
Only now do I realise the magical freedom of London’s racial and ethnic diversity. Not one set of rules on how to look and behave. Everyone stands out, so everyone blends in.
Nowadays, the closest I can get to that experience is to cycle back to the outskirts of Noord, where I used to live with my flatmate to save money for my own place. In the Middle-Eastern shops in Banne Buiksloot I get herbs, chillies, and a reality check.
Dutch people do use spices, which is commendable in a European country. They benefited from colonial culinary influence, just like the Brits. Their own cuisine is unremarkable, barring cheese and bitterballen, just like the British cuisine, barring shortbread and battered fish. For lunch, they’re satisfied with a broodje kaas, just like the British are fine with a sausage roll. You’d think Amsterdam’s and London’s food scene would be comparable, and yet, London wins big time.
The UK won the culinary game thanks to one contestant: India. India is bigger, older and more diverse than Indonesia and Suriname, and its cuisine is richer. The Brits have proudly adopted Indian curry as one of their national dishes, not different to a Sunday roast and available at every corner. In the Netherlands, on the other hand, people get an Indonesian take-away every now and then, and no tourist comes here to try famous Surinamese restaurants.
India aside, the British colonial past lasted longer and spanned across a larger territory than the Dutch. This means more immigrants, more influence, more variety. More food stores and restaurants, in fact, every imaginable restaurant you may want to try. You don’t get a great selection of non-European restaurants in Amsterdam, and that’s not just because it’s a smaller city than London. It’s because it’s a less diverse one. There are a lot of restaurants, they’re just not that varied: good luck finding something Burmese or Jamaican, for example, but if you’re happy to settle for Italian, you’ve got all the choice in the world. Well, in Italy.
In Amsterdam I cook more. If you want something more exciting than pizza or noodles, you have to pay a lot, which didn’t used to be the case in London. What really rubs me up the wrong way, though, is spending 25 euros on a dish and getting terrible service.
I arrived in Amsterdam just after Covid. I’ve heard that the pandemic caused a shift in the service industry, not that I had a comparison to how it had been before. In my first months, I went out a lot, trying to get to know the city and people. Initially I thought I was just unlucky. Then I realised I’d rather learn cooking than go through the same story yet another time:
Waiting 20 minutes to order, after you’ve waved down the waiter like an aircraft marshal;The waiter, who generally not only doesn’t care, but also doesn’t know much, is unsure if they still have the dish, so they disappear for another 10 minutes;Waiting 45 (I’m not lying) minutes to get your order because all the take-away drivers have priority;Getting a wrong order;Waiting God knows how long to pay, before following the waiter around the restaurant until they Shut Up and Take Your Money.
There are, of course, restaurants with good service, just like in London there are restaurants with bad service. It’s about what your default expectation should be. In Amsterdam, don’t expect much.
That post-Covid shift in the service industry is said to have driven away cheap immigrant labour, leaving the students as the only available workforce. Other population groups can’t support themselves from service jobs in this expensive city. Not that in London you could easily pay rent while working in hospitality. But you could at least legally share a flat.
The relocation package I got from my company included help in finding a flat from a real estate agent. In my orientation call with Piet, I said that I wanted to spend about 1000 euros for a room. Piet said that for this price I should look for a garage.
(This, by the way, is what happens when Dutch service culture and Dutch directness collide).
I tried explaining that I didn’t need a whole flat for myself, that I wanted to share with another “professional”, as they call them. It’s impossible, asserted Piet, after he finally understood what I meant. But now I wasn’t getting it. How was it impossible for employed adults to share a flat? That’s what I did for 8 years in London! Nou, ja, shrugged Piet,
(to clarify, neither was it a video call, nor did I know Dutch body language back then, but now I can totally imagine the typical lack-of-empathy Dutch shrug accompanying Piet’s statement:)
Amsterdam is not London.
Indeed, if a landlord in Amsterdam isn’t prejudiced against renting a flat to sharers (which they mostly are), a bigger barrier is the need for a permit.
The whole topic of the flat sharing ban, preference for couples and ubiquitous fake relationships for the sake of a rental contract is so fascinatingly infuriating that I will spare it a separate article. For now, let’s just say that Amsterdam’s progressiveness ends when unrelated, romantically uninvolved adults want to share a flat.
Progressiveness comes in many shapes and Amsterdam claims to have them all. It’s the capital of the first country to legalise gay marriage. A city where you can use services of self-employed, tax paying, legal sex workers. Where you can enjoy naked saunas, a vibrant queer scene and underground kink raves. But you can’t get tested for an STI.
In Amsterdam, men who have sex with men can get a free test twice a year through an organisation called Man Tot Man. Other than that you have to go through a GP to order a test, and — this is what the Netherlands and the UK have in common — the healthcare system is designed to discourage frivolous requests of people who aren’t visibly dying, and deny silly things like prevention.
One thing that the Netherlands could learn from puritan Britain is commitment to sexual health. The clinics in London, which are free and don’t even ask for your insurance, offer all kinds of contraception, testing and consultations. You can walk in, but you can also order an STI test online, do it at home and send back by free post. If you haven’t tested for more than a few months, the system will send you a text message to encourage a check-in.
The London system sounds impressive, even utopian. It’s easy to forget that it should be a standard in a big city which claims the sex-positive, progressive label.
I might have assumed that Amsterdam was going to be as international, vibrant and progressive as London, and as a result, I might have assumed that cultural activities would be the same, too. They’re not. This is not due to Amsterdam being smaller or more boring. It’s because it has a dominant culture: the Dutch culture. The culture expressed by a language which about a quarter of Amsterdam’s residents prefer not to speak, to no fault but their own. (Something I mentioned in this and this article).
If you don’t need the language for work or social life, you’re not going to learn it to go to the theatre. But what happens in the meantime is that you don’t go to the theatre at all.
There is a good English-speaking cultural program in Amsterdam. I’d assumed there would be and hands down, there is. But it is a minority, and that makes a difference. If you choose not to learn the language, you narrow yourself to the English-speaking material, which is produced with a typical expat in mind. But then again, if you don’t choose to learn the language but have the time and money to go to the theatre, maybe you are a typical expat.
You choose not to learn the language because you don’t need it for your job, and before you know it, it’s harder for you to switch jobs, because you haven’t learned the language. Would Dutch-speaking jobs interest you anyway? If you worked in a metropolis like London, you’re used to a dynamic job market, with top-tier multinationals, hot start-ups and everything in between. Of course, you won’t have that in a smaller city where English isn’t the official language.
It’s not rocket science, yet I didn’t think that through. Like many people who have spent a few tiring years in a huge city, I was fixated on the “quality of life” and didn’t investigate what this move could do to my career in the long run. Now that my company announced possible layoffs, I realise that what suits me in Amsterdam is just a handful of jobs: the expat jobs.
Expat is a word I learned when I came to Amsterdam (and described that process here). Earlier, I was first an immigrant, then a Londoner. Just anyone that lives in London, wherever they’re from, whatever their background. Hardly anyone comes from London, and if they do, all it takes for them to leave their roots behind is to change districts. A friend of mine is from Germany and his wife is from France. They decided to buy a flat and start a family in London, rather than come back to one of their countries of origin, which many couples in their situation would do.
‘London is the only place where I feel like I’m not just visiting’, said my friend before I left. ‘You’ve made London your city. Bear in mind that when you leave, you will be a visitor again, in Amsterdam and in London.’
A lot depends on your choices and values (I used dating to exemplify this in my last 2 articles). You can be a settler: aim to “get naturalised” by learning the language, the culture, the local people. Tie your future to the place. Or, you can be a nomad and “see how it goes”.
It may just be my perception, but in Amsterdam that second group stands out to me more. There is a transient feeling to the international crowd in the Netherlands, which can be tied to a very tangible reason, namely a policy. A lot of people come here with a five year plan. They’ll stay as long as they can benefit from the country’s tax break, the Thirty Percent Ruling.
Of course, I knew about the ruling before moving here, but I didn’t anticipate its significance both to expats’ individual choices, and Dutch people’s popular opinion. Far from being a formality, this policy is a multi-layered subject that I want to cover next time.
These are the categories I run through to answer my dad’s question (barring the sexual health clinics. It didn’t seem relevant).
‘There’s no way of saying which city is better. It depends on the period of life you find yourself in and your priorities,’ I concluded. But I could tell that my dad didn’t want a research paper, he wanted an opinion. A verdict. For that, he resorted back to a “yes or no”:
‘But do you like Amsterdam?’
‘That’s a whole different question! I love it.’
‘You should’ve started off with that.’
Again, he’s got a point. But if I just say that Amsterdam is a great city, I’d miss all the rich details that I fell in love with, including the ones I’m disappointed by.

When my wife and I decided to spend four days in Amsterdam, we had no idea we were signing up for a whirlwind of art, history, culinary delights — and the most hilariously weird truffle-induced adventure of our lives. Buckle up, dear reader. This is a tale of laughter, paranoia, and stencils.
We landed early, bright-eyed and full of ambition. First stop? The Rijksmuseum, where we pretended to be art enthusiasts while secretly just looking for a café to fuel up. After a marathon walk through Dutch masterpieces, we checked into our hotel, Citiez. A quick nap later, we were ready for our nighttime mission: investigating the mystical “magic mushrooms.”
Turns out, there are no mushrooms involved — just truffles packed with psilocybin. The folks at the Magic Mushroom Gallery were incredibly informative, guiding us like sherpas into the psychedelic unknown. We selected our strains like wine connoisseurs: Atlantis for me, Golden Teachers for my wife. The instructions were clear: eat after breakfast, avoid acidic drinks, and prepare for an “enhanced” experience. Challenge accepted.
Our second day was a deep dive into history at the Anne Frank Museum. The atmosphere was poignant, the stories heartbreaking, and the experience humbling. By nightfall, we had a serious discussion: tomorrow was the big day. We laid out our plans like we were preparing for a moon landing.
The day began innocently enough with a hearty breakfast, because apparently truffles and empty stomachs don’t mix. We set off for Zaanse Schans, home to picturesque windmills, endless green fields, and, unbeknownst to us, our impending adventure into trippy absurdity.
The truffles? Surprisingly un-mushroomy. We paired them with chocolate as instructed and waited. And waited. For an hour, nothing happened. Were we scammed? Was this just overpriced trail mix? My wife and I were starting to draft a mental Yelp review when suddenly, she started giggling.
And then it hit us.
We became the embodiment of joy, laughing at everything: the grass, the birds, even the windmills seemed to be winking at us. We found a bench and plopped down, marveling at the universe like two philosophers who’d skipped the study and gone straight to enlightenment.
As we sat there, the rhythmic movement of ducks’ necks caught my attention. They bobbed gracefully, picking food off the ground, and it was, in that moment, the most profound thing I’d ever seen. “Look at them,” I said, barely holding back laughter. “So synchronized. Like nature’s backup dancers.” Surprisingly she was also looking at the same thing. Lol.
Then my wife dropped a spiritual bomb. “You know,” she said, staring into the distance, “human existence is… so small. Look at us — tiny, tiny things compared to everything else.” She waved her hand in a sweeping gesture, possibly at the universe, possibly at the ducks. “It’s like we’re just little dots… floating in a cosmic something.” Also, I remember she mentioned, we are so small that we don’t exist as well. “We are not there!”
I nodded sagely, pretending to understand, though I was mostly thinking about how small we are. People walking by gave us curious looks, probably wondering if we were okay. We weren’t. But we were happy. When my wife followed up her cosmic realization with “Do we look weird?” between uncontrollable giggles, I lied through my teeth: “No, we’re fine.”
Spoiler: we weren’t fine. It was definitely time to relocate.
Inside the Zaans Museum, things got… creative. There was a stencil activity for visitors, which we attacked with the fervor of Picasso on a sugar rush. Never had stenciling felt so profound. We spent ages there, convinced our art could rival the Rijksmuseum collection.
Then came the binoculars. Who knew you could laugh hysterically while looking at a windmill through magnification? My wife declared it a portal to another world. I believed her.
At one point, a receptionist appeared, and paranoia kicked in. She’s watching us, we thought. Why is she here? We imagined her radioing the Truffle Patrol to haul us out. Naturally, we did what any reasonable people would do: fled to next section of museum, the Verkede Experiece: biscuit factory exhibit.
But there she (the receptionist) was again! Or was it? We couldn’t decide. It felt like a Scooby-Doo episode where the villain keeps showing up wherever you run. We bolted for the bus stop, laughing all the way.
Mid-museum session, my wife entered her spiritual guru era. Staring (maybe) deeply at a random art piece (probably a windmill blueprint), she turned to me with the wisdom of a thousand lifetimes and declared, “You know, everyone’s perspective is different. What I see might not be what you see. What I think might not be what you think. But when perspectives align, that’s when true connection happens.”
She said it so profoundly, I half-expected a beam of light to shine down, followed by monks chanting in the background. I nodded sagely, as if her words had unlocked the mysteries of the universe, while secretly wondering if she’d start charging other museum visitors for enlightenment sessions or may be a ted talk.
Back in Amsterdam central, the streets became a kaleidoscope of lights and laughter. We stumbled into an Argentine restaurant and ordered grilled prawns and salmon, which tasted like the food of gods. Fueled by our meal, we wandered into the Moco Museum. Modern art on truffles? Chef’s kiss. Every piece seemed alive, whispering existential secrets and bad jokes.
We capped the night watching locals ice skate, marveling at their skills and wondering if skating while tripping would be genius or disastrous. Spoiler: we didn’t try.
Our last day started strong with a hearty hotel breakfast. We checked out, feeling accomplished, and boarded a canal cruise. Big mistake.
While Amsterdam’s canals are beautiful, sitting on a crowded slow-moving boat was the antithesis of the adventurous spirit we’d cultivated. We spent the entire ride critiquing ourselves for this bad choice, trying to find amusement in the audio guide’s monotone narration and our own sarcastic commentary.
Luckily, the day was redeemed by an amazing Chinese meal and an early arrival at Schiphol Airport, where we reminisced about the past four days of art, history, and hilarity.
Amsterdam gave us more than we could have asked for. From the solemn history of Anne Frank’s house to the surreal hilarity of truffles at Zaanse Schans, it was a trip filled with unforgettable experiences.
Moral of the story? Life is better with laughter, adventure, and maybe just a little bit of psilocybin. Just don’t let the receptionist catch you.
Thanks for reading! Cheers!

Our luggage and other heavy things have all been stashed in an L-size locker at Amsterdam Centraal. Sweet! Aww, my inner child jolted as soon as we exited Amsterdam Centraal. At the same time, my eyes caught a lady skipping happily toward someone who seemed to be waiting for her. A display of simple human happiness. I thought momentarily, ‘Wow, there are so many people here!’ It seems the weekend atmosphere had contributed to the crowd. And that crowd! This sight quickly reminded me how ‘international’ this city — or country — is.
Stepping out of the square, the tram rails are lined right up next to the road. The way they weave together looks a bit messy on the asphalt. I’ve seen similar setups in other places, but I still find it a bit tricky to wrap my head around all these different modes of transportation crammed together. I prefer things to be a little plainer.
To cross the road, I found myself a bit disoriented at first; I wasn’t sure if there was a designated area for crossing. Later that day, Bu Jeannie used the phrase ‘Indonesian way.’ Sekar and I, after observing the traffic situation, also mentioned it and joked about doing it the ‘Indo way.’
We’ve got Google Maps in hand. We try to be wise with our batteries. We want to use Sekar’s phone for navigation and my phone for taking pictures. The direction is facing the city: heading…

Visiting Amsterdam and Riding a Bike When You Haven’t Ridden Since Childhood,https://medium.com/@eatbikeexplore/visiting-amsterdam-and-riding-a-bike-when-you-havent-ridden-since-childhood-26630cc26539,"Sign up

(This story can also be found on my personal blog site www.eatbikeexplore.com)
Amsterdam is often known as the bicycle capital of the world. If you are an advocate of active transportation, there are some YouTubers and bloggers praising Amsterdam for their bike friendliness. BicycleDutch and NotJustBikes come to mind. However, if you are visiting Amsterdam and wanting to ride a bike but haven’t since childhood, I can imagine it can be intimidating. I don’t blame people from North America traveling to Amsterdam and being fearful of riding a bike. If you normally don’t ride, it’s a difficult adjustment. My guess is if you are visiting Amsterdam from North America, you MIGHT hop on a bike for an afternoon as a novelty, but then go back to what you are comfortable with. Most people from North America drive. And most people from other parts of the world probably do not have the bicycling culture like the Dutch or Danish. It’s like if you’re not used to taking public transit in your home country, you might shy away from taking public transit when you travel. You’ll opt for the Hop On Hop Off buses, using ride share or joining a tour group. All are fine, but I would say you are missing out on a uniquely Dutch experience by not taking a bike to get you around town…and riding it as often as possible.
So what is it like riding a bike in Amsterdam? Here are some tips from my experience for visiting Amsterdam and riding a bike if you haven’t ridden since childhood. If you are used to riding consistently as an adult, especially if your bike is your transportation, then you shouldn’t have a problem riding in Amsterdam. The learning curve shouldn’t be too steep.
Otherwise, you will probably be “that” tourist that doesn’t know the rules of riding. There’s plenty of websites that go more into detail on the rules of riding. I’m not going to get that detailed. Instead, I will touch on some basics of what it must feel like riding if you haven’t ridden a bike since forever.
If you are “that” tourist and want to get on a bike, then here are some of my suggestions for “people who normally don’t ride a bike but want to in Amsterdam”.
First, get away from the city center, especially if you are visiting during the summer months where tourism is at its peak. It can get packed with people on bikes, on foot, cars and tour buses. The center of the city also seems to have less separated bike paths, so you’re riding close to other drivers. There’s also vans parked in the bike lanes, so you’ll need to navigate around them by safely moving around other riders and drivers. Plus, you’ll want to be careful crossing the tram tracks as bicycle tires can get caught in it and you will fall.
Find a hotel, hostel, Airbnb, etc outside of the city center that also rents bikes. You don’t have to go too far out but just far enough for you to practice. When I went there, I stayed near Vondel Park. My place rented bikes which was convenient and Vondel Park is a great place to practice riding around.
In the US (and I assume it’s similar in other countries), I notice beginner riders tend to weave around a lot and often ride really slow. There’s nothing wrong with that, but if you want to ride on the bike paths in Amsterdam, you’ll need to practice not weaving around so much and to ride faster. Basically, if you wouldn’t drive your car weaving from lane to lane, then you shouldn’t do that on a bike. Anyways, Vondel Park would be a good place to reintroduce yourself to the bike. Lots of people ride through here to get to their destination so you’ll see lots of riders. But the paths are wide enough for the locals to go around you as you’re starting off.
My biggest advice to those wanting to hop on a bike for the first time is don’t just randomly stop in middle of a bike path because you saw this cool cafe or bar or some interesting mural. Please pull off to the side of the bike path so you don’t block anybody or cause a crash. There is a 100% chance someone is riding right behind you. And just like driving, you don’t just stop in the middle of the road because you saw something cool off to the side. So don’t do that on a bike either.
My next advice is to use hand signals and turn your head to make sure it’s clear before you decide to turn, stop or slow down. Watch how the locals use hand signals. But all you need to do is slightly bend your right arm outwards to show you are turning right and slightly bend your left arm outwards to show you are turning left.
There’s no need to extend your entire arm out when you need to turn. By doing that, you’ll most likely smack someone riding next to you. This of course goes back to turning your head so you know who is around you.
Once you get comfortable riding around in the park, you can move onto neighborhood streets and separated bike paths outside of the city center.
Amsterdam has lots of bicycle signals, so make sure you pay attention to the signals.
Intersections can also be tricky because you’ll need to know when to yield and when not to yield. Pay attention to the “shark teeth” symbols on the ground.
The good thing about being on a bike is even if you are uncertain on what to do, everybody can still move around each other and usually not cause a crash. People can usually read your body language on a bike and you’ll be able to do the same the more your ride.
It’s not like being in a car, where you are unable to see the person driving. In a car, you can’t predict what the people next to you will do. But it’s easier on a bike because you can see the entire person.
One thing I also noticed is that drivers and cyclists will look for any open space to squeeze in (which to me is a bit reminiscent of NYC). There were a couple of drivers that came rather close to me in the city center. I noticed two types of license plates in Amsterdam. The yellow and the blue plates. I had a close pass with a blue license plate driver. I later overheard those are the taxi and delivery drivers? So I guess it makes sense they are more aggressive (even though they shouldn’t be)?
And you know that saying “practice makes perfect”? The more you ride, the more you’ll get the hang of how things are done. And riding a bike in Amsterdam is absolutely amazing! It’s just not something you can experience in the US. Bikes really provide the freedom that cars do not (despite car ads from the last 100 years proclaiming driving is freedom). You don’t need a helmet when riding, so you truly can feel the “wind in your hair”.
And one final tips. Remember where you parked your bike. Take a photo or video of where you parked and the surrounding area. A lot of bikes look similar and they are often jammed together.
And once you get the hang of this, you can ride to grab coffee or a beer. Ride to a park or museum. You’ll soon discover how easy it is to navigate the city by bike. And how many more places you can see without having to pay for the tram, Uber or follow a guided tour. With a bike, you can have the freedom to explore local neighborhoods, cafes and restaurants that might not be in a guide book.
I can’t wait to go back and ride again and I hope if you’re reading this and planning a trip there, you will want to ride as much as possible while you are there.

I idly watched tiny droplets of moisture licking at the plane’s wings as cotton wool clouds and sparkling sunbeams made way for a sea of green and grey, followed by a seemingly-endless taxi along the runway. Almost as soon as I’d left the UK, I was in Amsterdam for a springtime mini break. The grey skies above did nothing to dull my spirit as I muddled through the train system and took a final, deep breath of city air. That’s right. After a pretty hefty hiatus from Medium, I’m back — and accompanied by tales from a small European country known as The Netherlands in April 2025.
As I left the station, I was hit instantly with the lingering aroma of marijuana, coupled with street music and a relentless stream of bicycles. Weaving through tiny streets, the constant bang bang bang of my suitcase wheels on the cobbles grew more comforting than annoying. Finally, after a few wrong turns, I could see the sign for my hostel just up ahead.
I had a little time to kill and so resolved to head out on foot. I ended up down a major shopping street, but resisted the urge to pop into the large Primark. Scattered…

Have you ever imagined immersing yourself in one of the world’s most dynamic and thrilling cities, all while advancing your career? This is the story of my remarkable journey.
As a young software engineer employed at a reputable multinational company in India, the opportunity to embark on a two-month onsite assignment in Amsterdam was nothing short of a dream come true. The mere thought of exploring Europe had always danced at the periphery of my aspirations, yet, as someone from India, such an adventure often felt distant and financially out of reach.
But I persevered, putting in the hard work and dedication necessary to secure this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Finally, the moment had arrived when I could set foot in Amsterdam, and I was filled with boundless gratitude for having reached this significant milestone. Now, let me share with you the captivating journey that unfolded, as I discovered the city’s perfect blend of work and play, and why it has become a place I’ll cherish forever.
One electrifying week before the grand adventure, I embarked on a whirlwind of preparations. With a fresh haircut and meticulous grooming, I was ready to step into the unknown. The day of departure finally dawned, and my parents joined me for a heartwarming farewell at the airport. The excitement in the air was palpable as I embarked on a journey I had been eagerly awaiting.
The flight seemed to stretch on, but the moment we touched down at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, I was immediately captivated by the city’s breathtaking beauty. The sight was a feast for the senses, a stunning welcome to this new chapter in my life. My heart raced with anticipation as I hopped into a sleek Tesla taxi. The streets were teeming with high-end cars, and the buzz around Tesla was infectious. Riding in one was nothing short of a thrilling adventure, marking the exhilarating start of my Amsterdam odyssey.
I arrived at my home around 5 p.m., and it was already dark outside. I had never experienced this in India, where the sun sets much later. My friend and I were so excited to be in Amsterdam that we decided to make dinner and go to bed early so that we could wake up early the next morning and start exploring.
I was nervous on my first day at the office in Amsterdam. I had never been to the city before. But as soon as I walked in, I was greeted by warm smiles from my new colleagues and clients.
My Indian colleagues introduced me to everyone, including my Dutch clients. I was immediately struck by how friendly and welcoming everyone was. My client even asked me about my journey to Amsterdam and how I was settling in.
At lunchtime, I went out with my senior colleagues, we had a delicious meal together. We talked about everything from what we needed to settle in, to the Dutch culture, and some places to travel. I felt so comfortable and at ease.
By the end of the day, I had made a lot of new friends in the office and learned a lot about the company and the city. I was so grateful for the warm welcome I had received.
Through the days, I effortlessly adapted to the Amsterdam culture and people, and I also explored the city’s many attractions. I was captivated by Amsterdam’s distinctive beauty. My personal experience revealed five compelling reasons why Amsterdam stands out as an exceptional destination for both work and leisure:
Canals that Captivate: Amsterdam’s intricate network of canals is a sight to behold, earning it the nickname “Venice of the North.” The reflection of gabled houses in the still waters, along with charming bridges and tree-lined streets, creates a picturesque scene that is reminiscent of a fairytale. For example, the Prinsengracht Canal is home to many beautiful 17th-century houses, while the Keizersgracht Canal is known for its elegant mansions. The canals are also a great place to spot boats and people-watch.
Historical Charm: Amsterdam’s well-preserved architecture stands as a testament to its rich history. As you stroll through the city, you’ll encounter stunning 17th-century buildings, each with its own unique character and story, offering a glimpse into the city’s past. For example, the Anne Frank House is a poignant reminder of the city’s role in World War II, while the Royal Palace is a magnificent example of Dutch Baroque architecture. The city’s canals are also lined with historic buildings, such as the gabled houses of the Jordaan neighborhood.
Cultural Diversity: The city is a melting pot of cultures, and this diversity is reflected in its art, food, and people. From world-class museums like the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum to vibrant neighborhoods like De Pijp, there’s a cultural richness that adds to the city’s allure.
Laid-back atmosphere: Amsterdam has a relaxed and easy-going atmosphere. I appreciated the friendly demeanor of the locals, as it was quite common for strangers to exchange warm greetings with smiles. In all my travels to various countries, I had never witnessed such a welcoming attitude towards strangers.
Diverse workforce: Amsterdam has a diverse workforce, with people from all over the world living and working in the city. This diversity makes for a vibrant and exciting work environment.
Bicycle-Friendly Bliss: Amsterdam’s flat terrain and extensive network of cycling lanes make it a cyclist’s paradise. The sight of countless bicycles whizzing past historic sites, parks, and picturesque canals is not only beautiful, but it is also an embodiment of the city’s eco-friendly ethos. Conveniently, there are bicycle pumps attached to some bicycle areas for filling tires.
Amsterdam is a foodie’s paradise, with a wide variety of restaurants and dishes to choose from, whether you’re looking for a quick bite or a leisurely meal. I sampled some of the city’s most famous dishes, including:
Poffertjes: Small pancakes often served with powdered sugar, fruit, or syrup.Stroopwafels: Thin waffles filled with sweet syrup.Stamppot: Traditional Dutch mashed potatoes with vegetablesErwtensoep: Popular Dutch pea soup, also available in vegetarian versions.
My love for the delicious waffles was only surpassed by my visit to Zaanse Schans, Amsterdam’s old town, where I sampled a variety of delectable cheeseses. I promise you, they were incredibly tasty!
My two months in Amsterdam were an unforgettable experience. I had the opportunity to work on a challenging project, meet new people from all over the world, and explore a beautiful and vibrant city. I also had the chance to travel to other parts of Europe, which was a dream come true.
I’m so grateful for the opportunity I had to live and work in Amsterdam. It was an experience that has changed me for the better. I made lifelong friends, learned new things, and created memories that will last a lifetime.
When it was time to leave, I was sad to say goodbye to my new friends and the city I had come to love. But I know that I will return one day. Amsterdam has a special place in my heart, and I can’t wait to go back and explore more.
Vincent van Gogh once said, ‘Amsterdam is a city of dreams, and I am a dreamer.’
I couldn’t agree more. Amsterdam is a city that inspires creativity and imagination. It’s a city where anything is possible. If you’re looking for a city that will challenge and inspire you, Amsterdam is the place for you.
I hope that this blog post has given you a glimpse into my experience in Amsterdam. If you’re ever thinking about visiting this amazing city, I highly recommend it!

The Dutch have the philosophy, ‘If what you are doing is not harming anyone but you, then what is the problem?’
We got to Amsterdam on Thursday and checked into Clink Hostels, and right away it felt like we were walking onto a college campus. The lobby was live — people from all around the world were playing games, talking, listening to live music, and getting us ready for the weekend. We put down our bags and headed into town. Like other college students, our first stop was the Red Light District. As we walked along the canals, we were amazed at what we witnessed. We were not used to this in the United States. Having taken it all in, we stopped for some fries at a local diner and headed home for the night.
Friday morning, we ferried over the water for breakfast and sampled a stroopwafel — a famous thin waffle with caramel in the middle. They were so good we ended up buying the whole pack to take back home to the US. We strolled the streets a little more and got ready for our next adventure, a canal tour.
Imagine 24 of us crammed on a boat with an open bar — it was fun, to say the least. The vibe was great, we rode down the canal in great company. The music was loud, so we traded the risk of seasickness for dancing. It was worth it. The city itself became a background of ancient buildings and bridges, but the thing that defined the moment was the music. The way I see it is in this culture, you kind of just go with the flow. You never know what to expect, just like the music.
We grabbed dinner after the tour at Ciao Bella, a local pizza place that was ideal for the night ahead of us. We headed to Escape, one of the largest clubs in the city, and abruptly, we were immersed in Amsterdam’s nightlife. We stood up front row to the DJ and took it all in. It was normal music that you would hear at a club, but something was different. The crowd was a lot more into it, and everybody was feeling the music. The DJ stood there leading the crowd, feeding off the crazy energy coming from them. I could finally see why Amsterdam was renowned as such a party city. Somewhere along the early morning, we ended up at a McDonald’s. And I have to say — Amsterdam’s McDonald’s? Better than Barcelona’s. It did the trick before we finally crashed for the night.
Saturday, we woke up and discovered we had the day to ourselves. We walked around and ended up in Amsterdam’s center. We took pictures of the national monument and learned about its history. After a few more hours of touring, we found a bar that caught our eye. The bartenders weren’t regular bartenders — they were entertainers. They were singing along to every song at the top of their lungs. The first song that came on that I will never forget was “Getting Away with It” by James. And for some reason, it felt completely appropriate. Amsterdam is a city of challenging norms, living in the moment, and doing the unexpected. Inside this bar was the perfect atmosphere to witness the city in person.
The day turned into another night, and we were back in the district at the Red Light Bar, a staple hangout where we played pool and watched some Premier League soccer. People continued to pile in until finally, it was too packed. We bar-toured up the strip, each with its own interpretation of Amsterdam’s style. Some blasted classic rock, while others played house music, but each one of them told a story.
By the end of the trip, we were ready to go. We realized that a weekend in Amsterdam was just right — no longer. The city was crazy and awesome at the same time. From the sound of a club to the ring of a bar song, to the energy on the canal, every sound in this city served a purpose. Overall, Amsterdam exceeded our expectations and gave us a weekend to remember.
If you enjoyed this adventure, make sure to follow me for more! I’ll be sharing another exciting destination next week, so stay tuned — you won’t want to miss it. Thanks for reading, and see you in the next blog!

happy, unique, goofy
1 week (or forever if you can)
Wow! I honestly love Amsterdam so much! The people seem so at ease with life and It is a very liberal spiritual place. Everyone is very open minded and accepting of anyone.
Amsterdam is mainly Dutch people so a lot of the people are very tall and blond. Another thing to consider is prostitution, weed, and psychedelics such as truffles are legal despite this everyone seems incredibly responsible and people seem to keep a good balance of life in Amsterdam. It really is the happiest and most open minded place I’ve been to so far and that’s why it is my favorite place so far.
Right from Amsterdam Central you can take a free ferry that will take you to NDSM and it takes about 5–10 mins to get there and the Ferry comes constantly I honestly felt like I never had to wait for one. NDSM is a hip urban area with lots of cool graffiti and hip restaurants to check out. Not to mention the interesting places you can stay at like the Crane hotel oh and you can also bungee jump from it, if you decide to. The area also has lots of special events such a music festivals, flea markets, and movie nights. Its a great place to check out and Its not too crowded so it’s nice getting away from all the people in the main area.
This may be one of my favorite museum trips that I have gone on so far. I really liked that it focused on one artist throughout, and I felt like I really got to see Van Gogh’s life and how it affected his art. I have to say I am a HUGE Van Gogh fan, I really love his brush strokes and his bright use of color. I felt like I got pulled into every single painting diving into each brush stroke and seeing the lines up close then pulling back to see the full picture that he created. I don’t know how he did it but he made each scene look so serene and stylized.
I need to also mention the sensory room where each room you get the senses that Van Gogh was feeling throughout his life. I thought it was so creative because I truly felt like I was living and seeing the things that Van Gogh felt.
I mean you honestly can’t go to Amsterdam without going to the Red Light District at least once. Walking through the red light district you can’t take any photos. You basically see women in windows with red lights above them in their underwear standing or sitting, and they kind of look bored or like their busy looking at their phone. It was an interesting experience but one to definitely check out and experience once.
One of the most unforgettable experiences I have had so far, A’dam lookout is where you go on the top of one of the buildings and there are these 2 electric swings that basically swing you back and fourth for about 2 mins. It was seriously such a magical feeling I honestly felt like I was on top of the world and flying for a second. I will admit it was really scary because you are so high up and you look down and don’t see anything right under you but it is one of the things that you can’t really forget because you just feel so much.
The canal tour is so worth it, you basically just go down the canals throughout the city, it is so fun to see all the little boat houses right on the canals.
I personally really liked the Mocco museum because it had more urban graffiti artists such Banksy, icy & slot, Koons and Warhol. They also had a 3D installation room where you walk into a room in the style of Lichtenstein (which is the bright comic book style with bold colors and lines throughout). The museum is not that big but I kind of like that, your not overwhelmed by all of the art and you can engage in each and every one. Each piece had a strong statement about freedom and freedom of expression.
I checked out multiple psychedelic shops (there were many) and these 2 stood out the most to me.
Kokopelli was very informal and the staff really knew their stuff and loved to talk about it, they sold lots of other interesting things such as Brazilian herbs to help with lucid dreaming. Or seeds that you can grow and eat for different types of needs. They even had an area where you can sit and take your shrooms if you decide to buy it from them.
Alien Visitors s a fun small raver type of shop, with techno music playing and neon fluorescent items throughout the store. I ended up buying a really cute black shirt with some green neon print designs down the middle. It wasn’t too crazy with the designs like how some raver shirts can get a little tacky when its overplayed and I really love the pattern on it.

Today marks five years since I moved from my country to Europe, gradually settling into the vibrant life of Amsterdam. This year is my second year in the Netherlands and five years in Europe overall. This milestone feels like the right moment to reflect on the journey so far. I’m grateful for the personal and professional growth along the way — it’s been quite a journey. I first landed in Berlin, but soon after, COVID hit, and finding a job was a real challenge during that time. After gaining experience living in Berlin, I wanted to see if there was a better place before fully committing to Germany, so I decided to look for opportunities outside of Berlin. Eventually, I found a job in Amsterdam. As things slowly started to recover, the war began, adding another layer to the experience.
My connection with Berlin runs deep. I’ve had a long relationship with the city since my early 20s, when a few of my friends moved there from St. Petersburg and helped me explore Berlin from within. The city quickly became a familiar and vibrant part of my life, with friends and unforgettable experiences. I met my boyfriend just before moving there myself (now my husband) which made the transition even more meaningful. Berlin was more than just a place to live! :) It felt like a second home. Being there was a dream come true in a natural and seamless way.
Our move to Amsterdam was driven by curiosity and a sense of uncertainty about our future in Germany. It takes a lot of effort to fully integrate there and to acknowledge the challenges of living in Germany. Here in the Netherlands, I’ve found a country that values directness, innovation, out-of-the-box thinking, and problem-solving — a motivating environment that has enabled me to grow both professionally and personally.
Sometimes, I feel like a character in Atlas Shrugged, navigating a landscape that mirrors Germany today — a system entangled in endless layers of rules, bureaucracy, reluctance to change, and a fear of moving forward that places increasing demands on companies. Germany feels like a perfect analogy to the world described in the book, where innovation is stifled by rigid structures and a lack of forward thinking. In contrast, the Netherlands represents a refreshing example of how things should operate, with efficiency, innovation, and a practical approach to problem-solving that brings real results.
Having spent years in the digital industry, focusing on process optimization, self-service, and enhancing customer experience, I’ve developed a unique perspective on understanding challenges and identifying opportunities. The Dutch approach to digital transformation, with its emphasis on innovation and efficient governance, aligns closely with my values in creating effective systems and customer-centric solutions. This kind of forward-thinking approach isn’t something I found at a national level in Germany. I know many entrepreneurial people working hard to drive change, but Germany requires significant structural shifts to address the crises ahead. Neglecting change and innovation will make it increasingly difficult to overcome these challenges.
My journey began in Berlin, where I experienced Germany’s intense focus on rules, processes, and seemingly endless layers of bureaucracy. In Amsterdam, I discovered a dynamic, flexible mindset, where people think outside the box — and, most importantly, where people, companies, and even bureaucracies focus on solving problems, not creating more. Both countries have their strengths, yet the Netherlands’ agility and commitment to achieving real outcomes — not just outputs — have made me fall in love with the country and see hope for Europe’s future.
As I look back on these five years, I’m excited about what lies ahead. Amsterdam has become more than just a place to live! It’s a community that drives my curiosity and keeps me moving forward. I look forward to continuing this journey, bringing fresh perspectives to the digital industry, and helping to solve the challenges that await us all in Europe.

I recently traveled to Amsterdam and cannot wait to share my experience with you. It has so much to offer and is one of my favorite cities. Since this is the perfect time to visit Amsterdam, I am sharing with you the must do things in Amsterdam and as well as some interesting facts about the lively city.
Did you know?1) Amsterdam derived its name from the Amstel River.2) There are 165 Amsterdam canals that combine for a length of over 100 kilometers. The Canal Ring became part of the UNESCO World Heritage list in 2010.3) Amsterdam has more bridges than Venice. How difficult is that to believe? But there are only, in fact, 409 bridges connecting Venice’s canals. Amsterdam actually has 1,281 bridges, three times as many as Venice!4) There are approximately 2,500 houseboats in Amsterdam.5) The tilted houses are called dancing houses. The soil was so swampy that they had to build on stilts and that caused them to wobble and sink into the river.6) The number of bicycles in Amsterdam is more than the number of people living in the city.7) Amsterdam has approximately 20 times more tourists throughout the year than the locals.8) Amsterdam is one of the top 25 safest cities in the world and also one of the top 15 cities known for its high standard of living. Who would have thought, with all the marijuana and prostitution?9) A study reveals that Dutch men are the tallest people in the world.10) Amsterdam lies below the sea level and is among the top five coffee consuming cities in the world.11) Amsterdam Stock Exchange is the oldest stock exchange in the world.12) Same-sex marriage is legal in Amsterdam. The Netherlands was the first country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage.
How to travel around Amsterdam
The best way to explore the city is either on a bike or on foot. Even if you only pedal around for a few hours, riding a bike is an essential Amsterdam experience. There are over 800,000 bicycles in Amsterdam. That’s more bikes than people! The city also has a flat landscape, which makes cycling so much more fun and enjoyable, and is also one the world’s most cycle-friendly cities with separate cycling paths throughout the entire city. You can also use public transport such as buses, trams, and metros, which are very well connected in the entire city.
Best time to go to Amsterdam
The city is always buzzing with tourists year round, particularly being busier from April to September because it is warmer in those months. I traveled in April and it was extremely busy, but I had a great time. It would be ideal to book your stay ahead of time if you are going to travel in the peak tourist season as almost everything gets booked.
Here is a list of the must do things in Amsterdam:
2) Canal cruise — Besides providing a stunning backdrop to the city’s historical center, floating down Amsterdam’s canals is one of the most memorable ways to discover the city’s sights and attractions. Whether you’re a first-time or frequent visitor, everything in Amsterdam seems a bit more magical when viewed from a boat.
Most canal cruises take around an hour, which gives you an opportunity to explore Amsterdam’s UNESCO protected Canal Ring and discover plenty of interesting facts about the city along the way. There are various tours operating on the water and you could pick up one quite easily as per your location and requirements.
3) Explore museums — Amsterdam is home to over 50 museums, exploring the diversity of history, art, culture, and educational fun. There are museums to suit everyone’s interest. Some of the most famous museums are Van Gogh Museum, Rijksmuseum, and Anne Frank House.
4) Go beer tasting — Amsterdam is the home of the Heineken headquarters. The Heineken experience is a must see for all visitors. I had a great experience where they showed the brewing process, innovations, ingredients used, etc., and at the end of the tour also gave two free beers. Some other interesting breweries that I would also recommend are Brouwerij de Prael, Brouwerij ‘t IJ, and Butcher’s Tears.
5) Food, bars, and pubs — Amsterdam is well-known around the world as a city of indulgences. Here is a list of famous Dutch food you have to try:Stroopwafel — consists of a syrup filling sandwiched between two thin waffles. (Best when hot). Try the one at Banketbakkerij Lanskroon or Albert Cuyp Market.Dutch Cheese — They are absolutely amazing and cannot be missed. Try them at the Cheese Factory or Henri Willig Cheese shops for a guided experience, or at Reypenaer Proeflokaal or the Cheese Museum.Patat or Frites (Dutch Fries) — These are a must-have with the lip-smacking sauces. One of my absolute favorite places for this food is Vleminckx Sausmeesters.Poffertjes — You can buy these little fluffy pancakes from any street market or vendor.
Some of the other famous eating spots are Winkel 43 for apple pie, Ice Bakery by Nutella, bars in Nieuwmarkt, Pancake Bakery next to the Anne Frank Museum, De Zotte Cafe in Leidseplein, and Van Stapele Koekmakerij for the chocolate cookies.
Noorderlicht Cafe, in the north, is a nice restaurant. You will have to take a ferry across the Ij to NDSM Werf. This ferry is free to use. Also, there are many amazing restaurants and bars in the north that are definitely worth a try and usually unexplored. There are really cute and cozy restaurants in Jordaan, too, which are hidden gems. Some other really good restaurants to try are Frits (burgers), BAK (organic restaurant), Pazzi (best pizza place in town), De Struisvogel (three-course menu), The Lobby Nesplein (Amazing food and wines. Ask for “het vieze boekje” (Dirty Book), which they have in their special wines).
Try a hipster cafe. They believe in ugly is beautiful and cook with all those fruits and vegetables that would have been rejected just because they were not the perfect shape or size. It is a fun experience. You could try Café de Ceuvel, Cafe Brecht, Smokin’ barrels, etc.
The Top deck of the Science Center NEMO is a great place to chill and enjoy magnificent views of the city as well as Floor 17 at the Ramada Apollo Hotel, Sky Lounge at Doubletree by Hilton, Hannekes Boom (an eclectic hangout on the banks of OOsterdok), Edel (a fairy-lit hideaway in De Baarsjes), and other small pubs near the canals. If you’re into hardcore clubbing, then visit Jimmy Woo nightclub, Supperclub, Suzy Wong, Paradiso, Melkweg, AIR Amsterdam, and Sugarfactory.
If you are looking for a Michelin star experience, then try Ciel Bleu. Make reservations in advance at the restaurants in Amsterdam in order to avoid any disappointments, as most of them are pre-booked.
6) Shopping — Amsterdam has amazing places to shop and something for everyone. If you’re looking for high-street brands like H&M and Zara go to the busy Kalverstraat. If local boutiques interest you, then head to The Nine Streets. These nine cobbled streets connect the main canals between Leidsegracht and Raadhuisstraat. For high-end shopping, head to De Bijenkorf or Magna Plaza Shopping Centre (previously a post office) located behind Dam Square.
7) Explore the local neighborhoods — Amsterdam-Centrum: The Red Light District, Jordaan, The Nine streets and the Canal Ring, Leidseplein, or visit the Blijburg Beach.– Dam Square area: It’s the center with Madame Tussauds and other museums.– Take a photo with the IAMSTERDAM letters or hang around the flea market in that area.– Noord: A free ferry from the Central Station will take you to this district which has the city’s coolest architecture, fun hangout spots by the water and exciting festivals.– De Pijp: A great mix of culture, cafes, and cuisine. Do visit the Albert Cuypmarkt here.– Bos en Lommer and De Baarsjes: It’s famous for their multicultural crowd and popular terrace bars.
8) Parks — Parks are at the heart of Amsterdam culture. Every time the sun is out you will see the locals packing up the disposable barbecue and heading down to their nearest garden.If you like visiting parks do not miss to check out Vondelpark, the most famous park in Amsterdam with an open air theater and concerts in the summer. Some other interesting parks are Erasmuspark and Rembrandtpark.
9) Day trips — If you have time then it would be exciting to venture out and take day trips to Volendam, Marken, Zaanse Schans (working windmills), countryside, Delft, The Hague, and Rotterdam. Each of these places is unique and has something to offer you.
10) Visit a market in Amsterdam — Whether you’re looking to buy or try some local delicacies or just soak up the atmosphere, visiting one of the many markets in Amsterdam is a unique and unforgettable experience. Markets selling everything from antiques to books to artisan food to vintage clothes are held all over the city every day. Some of the most popular Amsterdam markets include the Albert Cuypmarkt in De Pijp (Mon.-Sat.) Lindengrachtmarkt in the Jordaan (Saturdays), and the Waterlooplein Market (Mon.-Sat.).
11) Visit coffee shops — A trip to Amsterdam wouldn’t be complete without visiting the coffee shops there. Some of the famous coffee shops are The Bulldog, Mellow Yellow, Original Dampkrings, and Grey Area.

Amsterdam used to mean something to cigar lovers. Or so I’d read¹. The stories painted a picture of cigar lounges that weren’t just places to smoke, but sanctuaries — spaces where a man could light up, lean back, and let the world turn without him for a while. The kind of places that made you feel like a part of something.
But the Amsterdam I found wasn’t that.
I arrived in 2024 chasing those stories. Before my trip, I’d done the usual research, looked up the names that still carried weight in cigar circles. P.G.C. Hajenius — a name spoken with reverence, a temple to tobacco since 1826 , P.G.C. Hajenius, one of the oldest cigar shops in the world — was the first on my list. Its Art Deco interior, legendary humidor, and the ghosts of cigar lovers who’d passed through its doors made it a destination in itself.
But my planning led to discoveries I hadn’t expected. A few phone calls, a dive into the city’s laws, and the truth hit home: Amsterdam’s cigar lounges were no longer what they’d been. The 2008 smoking bans had started the slow dismantling, and the 2020 regulations had finished the job, leaving even the likes of Hajenius a shadow of its former self². By decree of Dutch law, every cigar lounge in Amsterdam was snuffed out as of January 1, 2022 — a quiet funeral for a once-thriving culture³.
I couldn’t bring myself to go. Not because I was afraid of disappointment, but because there’s a point where preserving the memory of something becomes more important than confirming its absence. I didn’t want to see that grandeur stripped down, repurposed into some polite, sterile shell. Maybe one day I’ll go — not to chase what was, but to see what remains. But this trip wasn’t the time for that.
Instead, I focused on the present. I had one day left in Amsterdam, and I wasn’t about to waste it wallowing in nostalgia for a past I’d never lived. That’s how I found myself at Cigaragua.
Cigaragua isn’t a place trying to recreate the golden age of cigar lounges. It doesn’t have the leather armchairs, the paneled wood, or the ghosts of old men swapping war stories⁴. Instead, it’s defiantly modern. Clean. Unapologetically Nicaraguan.
The shopfront is subtle, but its presence is bold, standing as a rare holdout in a city that’s lost its love for cigars. There’s no room to linger — not because they don’t want you to, but because the city doesn’t. Amsterdam has no place anymore for the kind of slow, social rituals that make cigars more than just tobacco. Cigaragua has turned their cigar room into an extra storage space because of this.
What Cigaragua does have is quality. Their selection is a celebration of Nicaragua’s best — a curated homage to a country that’s made itself synonymous with craftsmanship in the cigar world. The staff know their stuff, too. They don’t just sell cigars; they respect them.
I walked out with two: the Sobremesa Brûlée Blue, a cigar that would later redefine my idea of a dessert cigar, and the Perdomo Double Aged 12-Year Vintage Connecticut, with its flawless construction and pedigree of aged tobaccos.
I didn’t smoke them in Amsterdam. This city, for all its indulgences, no longer felt like a place for that kind of moment. But that’s another story: Two Cigars, Two Journeys: a Prelude to Nicaragua
Walking through Amsterdam’s streets, it’s impossible to ignore its contradictions. The air is thick with the scent of cannabis, rolling out of coffee shops without apology. The red-light district glows like a beacon, a carnival of curiosity and hedonism. This is a city that markets its indulgences with pride — except, apparently, for cigars.
The hypocrisy isn’t just glaring — it’s comical. You can sit in a coffee shop and light up a joint without a second thought, but a cigar in a lounge? That’s where the line is drawn. Amsterdam hasn’t turned its back on vice; it’s just decided which kinds of indulgence are acceptable. And cigars, with their air of refinement, their association with slow, thoughtful leisure, have been left out in the cold.
I’m not shocked by Amsterdam’s decadence. I’ve seen enough of the world to know that people will always find ways to indulge. I don’t judge it. But I do call out the hypocrisy — the selective morality that lets one kind of smoke flow freely while stamping out another.
For all the disappointment I felt, Cigaragua gave me hope. It’s not trying to reclaim the past or fight the tide of change. It’s simply standing firm, celebrating the craft and the culture that cigars represent.
Maybe Amsterdam will come around. Maybe, one day, the pendulum will swing back, and the city will remember what it’s lost. And maybe, when that day comes, I’ll walk through the doors of P.G.C. Hajenius — not chasing the past, but ready to face whatever remains. Until then, I’ll carry the memory of what Amsterdam could have been, and the promise of what it still might become.
Because even in a city that’s turned its back on cigars, there’s still room for moments that remind you why they matter. And sometimes, that’s enough.
— — Footnotes — — — — — — — — ¹ I’ve read a number of pieces about Amsterdam’s cigar legacy, such as this one: https://www.cigarinspector.com/cigar-library/amsterdams-cigar-lounges/
² Only after having checked into my hotel in Amsterdam, I started catching up on updates, including this curious insight: https://www.zigarren.zone/en/netherlands-bans-cigar-lounges/But the subject has been covered much earlier, a good example is this 2017 micro-document by David Fuller: Banning Tobacco in Cannabis Cafes?
³ On the subject of cigar lounges being banned: The new law that came into force on January 1, 2022 regarding cigar lounges is not directly aimed at the few cigar lounges, but rather at the large commercial buildings that have smoking areas. Unfortunately, cigar lounges are also affected by this change. They will therefore also had to close.
⁴ Had I traveled to Amsterdam few years earlier, I would have been able to experience Cigaragua when it hosted a cigar lounge. In fact I was looking forward to it, after having seen information such as this piece from 2019: https://www.cigaraficionado.com/article/where-to-smoke-cigaragua-amsterdam

My love for Amsterdam was ignited when I met some friendly Dutch fans at a soccer World Cup match.
This was the year 2010 when South Africa hosted the Soccer World Cup.
The energy and friendliness of the Dutch planted the seed that left me wanting to visit Amsterdam.
Just their warm energy had me drawn to them.
My visit to Amsterdam was everything I expected and much more.
Just like in the soccer match, the people I came into contact with, in Amsterdam were warm and friendly.
Being around people with this energy always leaves me on a natural high. My heart feels at peace.
Waking up each morning and exploring the city was always a fun adventure.
Public transport is extremely reliable and efficient. I did a lot of walking in Amsterdam. I also rented a bicycle.
I love cycling!
Cycling in the streets of Amsterdam was a uniquely different experience.

It is hard to believe that it has already been over a year since I first left the country. I have spent my whole life with a passion for travel but up until last year I was spending all of my time and funds on hopelessly driving or flying from one side of the country to the other.
Don’t get me wrong I love the views in the US but I always wanted to get some stamps in my passport and really experience different cultures and what else the world had to offer!
I spent as much time as I could traveling last year and after experiencing 8 different countries in those 12 months, I have finally come to the conclusion on my answer for the question I get all the time, “Where should I go first?”
With a smirk on my face I enthusiastically reply “Amsterdam!”
Most people are scared or nervous about what to expect when they leave the country for the first time and for good reason. There are so many things to consider like:
what kind of currency do they use?
Is it safe?
How will I get around?
What language do they speak?
These are all valid questions that I ask every time I begin planning my next adventure and something that everyone should look into before…

Here for the travel advice and not to read my life story? Jump to Travel Recommendations for the tl;dr [too long; didn’t read] to plan your trip to Amsterdam now!
I felt giddy as my flight touched down. I was passing through the city somewhat incidentally. My end destination was Portugal but it was cheaper to fly through Amsterdam first. So I stretched my layover into a three-day trip. This gave me one day to recover from jet lag and a solid two days in Amsterdam to explore.
Amsterdam is one of those cities proceeded by its reputation. Personally, it has loomed large in my imagination for decades. A place where prostitution is not only legal but flaunted. Where weed, magic mushrooms, and who knows what else was accessible long before even medical clinics were open back home in California. A place where kids going to what at the time I considered “real” or four-year colleges would go to spend a semester abroad. It seemed like such an exciting and luxurious opportunity. One that I could only dream of as I worked my way through community college as a waitress to supplement my scholarships and financial aid.
I wanted to ride a bike around and meet new people from all over the world. Wear cozy sweaters and do drugs in coffee shops and bars. The fact that this was exactly how I was already spending most if not all of my time right at home in San Francisco and Oakland did not make it seem any less exotic.
By the time I finally had the chance to make that pilgrimage, I was in a very different state of mind. I spent my two days in Amsterdam on history and art tours. Taking in the old buildings and even older paintings. Trying new foods such as stroopwaffle (yay!) and pickled herring (nay).
Amsterdam is expensive! Hotels, hostels, and Airbnbs are all expensive. I ended up staying at CityHub Amsterdam, a capsule hotel. Overall, it was a good experience. I don’t really spend time in the hotel when I am traveling so this was a good option for me. It was clean and quiet. I loved the location. There was even a street market right outside where I stopped every morning for a fresh squeezed juice during my stay.

I don’t have much in the way of tips for this trip. It is easy to move through the city and everyone speaks English. The one thing I want to mention is, watch out for bikes! There is a lot of bicycle traffic and one sure-fire way to get cursed out from an otherwise friendly and easygoing local population is to cross the bike lane without looking.
Back to top
Start your day with a free walking tour! This is a great way to start your trip, especially if you are short on time. I recommend taking one the first day to help you get oriented. Free Walking Tours Amsterdam is the one I went with. I took the classic tour, but they have several other options to chose from depending on your interest. There are also many, many other options to choose from when selecting a free walking tour.
This style of tour is available all over Europe. I have even started seeing them in some places in Latin America as well. They typically last 2–3 hours. Your guide will give you some historical context for the city and show you the main sights within walking distance. The tours are indeed free, but the guides are only paid through tips. Have cash on hand to fork over at least €5-€10 once the tour is over.

Consider grabbing lunch or dinner at this trendy food hall. It is modeled after a concept that has taken the world by storm. Foodhallen is one building with many different stalls inside that offer different types of cuisine. You can order from any one that catches your fancy and grab a spot amidst the communal seating.
Back to top
In the evening, I recommend heading over to NDSM. This cultural hotspot is a collection of contemporary art studios and rotating exhibitions in a giant converted warehouse. You may catch a music show or a performance. There are also a few places to eat while on that side of the river.
The easiest way to arrive is to take the F4 ferry from Amsterdam Central Station. It is free and runs every 15–30 minutes. Be sure to hop back on before the ferry service ends at midnight.
Back to top
There are so many different options to choose from, but Rijksmuseum is the crown jewel of museums in Amsterdam. This one is a must-see for any visitor. You can purchase your timed entry tickets the day of, but I recommend buying them a day or two before if you are on a strict schedule and need to be at the museum at a specific time. I also recommend coming here first and then exploring some of the other must-sees in the city such as the Van Gough Museum or the Anne Frank House Museum.
Back to top
All that wandering around and viewing of those giant Renaissance paintings of food in varying states of decay is bound to make you hungry. After visiting Rijksmuseum it is just a short jaunt to Albert Cupstraat Markt. This market stretches several blocks and includes giftable wares, flowers, and most importantly, traditional Dutch cuisine. Be sure to try the stroopwafels, pickled herring, bitterballen (meatballs), and patat friet (french fries).
The market is open 9:30 am-5:00 pm every day except Sundays.
Back to top
The Central Park of Amsterdam is worth strolling through on foot or by bike and is close to both Rijksmuseum and Albert Cuypstraat market. It’s a beautiful place to stop and take a rest on one of the many benches lining the park paths before continuing on with your busy day.
Back to top
No stay in Amsterdam would be complete without a stop at the famous Red Light District. Locals hate it, tourists love it. If you are visiting, I think you have to go at least to see it. There are even historical tours during the day for the faint of heart. It’s easy to find a burlesque show, sex show, or just head out on your own to experience the scene at night.
If you do go in the evening, be prepared to witness the true spectacle, the endless parade of bachelor or “stag” parties crowding the street. You will mostly see women in windows soliciting their wares as you walk the streets, which is to say, themselves. I enjoyed watching the full spectrum of how these women interacted with the passing crowd. Some were dancing, some were trying to entice potential customers with a flirty, joking manner. The most conventionally attractive were visibly bored, doom scrolling on their phones and awaiting their next client without having to put in much effort.
Back to top
I was traveling alone for this trip, so I didn’t have the wild adventure I might have otherwise. But as I get older and wiser, I can’t help but grow in my appreciate of the quieter side of cities and life itself. The joys of earlier mornings, sans hangover. Trying new foods, even if it is for the first and last time. And most importantly, whether it be through observing classical art or observing my fellow tourist on their worst behavior, always learning something new whenever I have the opportunity.

Clue’s in the name really, it’s an exciting insight into the mysteries of the infamous Red Light District. This museum gives you all the juicy and hush hush secrets of the industry. Here are some reasons why it should feature on your itinerary:
· For one, its location is a former 17th century brothel in the centre of the Red Light District (how much more authentic can you get?!)
· It provides personal stories and accounts of prostitutes who’ve worked in Amsterdam throughout the years; some are extremely emotional and hard hitting.
· You can sit in a Red Light Window (which is a fab photo op!) and visit the room of a girl who worked at the brothel for 7 years.
· It has the last prostitution office in Amsterdam (everything in there is still untouched!).
· It’s on the cheap side! If you go to a tours and tickets shop which are located around Amsterdam or book online in advance its further discounted.
Businesses in the Red Light District do not allow people to take photos. You most likely will have your phone confiscated. You’re putting yourselves at risk if you try! Staring isn’t banned but, understandably, the women don’t like it. Some are very smiley and open, others more reserved. I saw a girl use a curtain to cover her face when a group of tourists wouldn’t stop gawping. Although sometimes it’s difficult not to look, don’t be disrespectful or excessive!
If you’re a history lover, like myself, I imagine this biographical museum would tell the perfect story of arguably the most renowned holocaust victim. I say ‘imagine’… because we didn’t manage to get in! From 9am-3.30pm the museum was reserved for people who had booked online. From 3.30pm a GIGANTIC queue formed which was at least 3 hours long, at which point we abandoned the idea and went to grab a pint.
My advice is DO buy tickets online if you want to visit without the hassle. Plus, I’m aware tickets online sell out quickly so book asap!
Like ‘The Red Lights Secrets museum’, it is anything but boring! From giant penises to an automated farting flasher … it’s great for a giggle and fab if you like art that’s a little out of the box! It’s also cheap as chips (literally…there’s a chip shop across the road which is more expensive) It only costs $5!
It’s a cool photo opportunity and if you’re athletic enough you can climb on the giant letters (note I chose not to!)
This is probably one of my greatest regrets of the trip. EVERYONE and I mean everyone travelled by bike. We decided to walk pretty much everywhere and it resulted in extremely blistered feet. Although walking is beneficial sometimes (at night or if you’re exploring) I’d say biking is the more fun and efficient option. There are places to hire bikes dotted around Amsterdam, they aren’t hard to come by. Although do be careful if you do go on a bike because people cycle like they are competing at a velodrome, which leads perfectly to my next point.
I had a few close shaves whilst obliviously standing in a lane attempting to navigate myself. They can be quite discrete, so just be on the lookout.
Lots of people hire out bikes purely to cycle round this serene environment (and it is quite big so if you want to see all of it, biking is probably the way to go). On a sunny day, it’s full of people listening to music, having picnics and lazing about on the grass. It’s incredibly beautiful and a relaxing pit stop from the business of the city centre.
This 22-floor tower is a bar/restaurant and gives an amazing 360˚ bird’s-eye view of Amsterdam. Drinks are a little on the pricey side but remember, you’re paying for the experience as well- it’s a second to none vantage point and the cocktails are huge! Also, if you are a bit of a daredevil, A’DAM lookout- ‘Over the Edge’ is Europe’s highest swing. You get to swing 100 metres above the ground right at the top of the building (fair to say I was not tempted).
Generally, alcohol is expensive, so pre-drinks are essential and supermarket prices aren’t bad for a bottle of wine or a few cans! This capital is obviously known for its cannabis culture and wide range of coffeeshops (which are just as common as bars). Prices are much cheaper so it’s a sound alternative- when in Rome, do as the Romans do (Or in this case, when in Amsterdam, do as the Dutch do!) …
Like most cities the further into the city centre you go the more expensive things become. This is the case for both food and drink. Some of the best bars and eating places were scattered on the outskirts! Check out the map at the bottom of this post for a few ideas!
The great thing about Amsterdam is the diversity and element of surprise around each corner. Whether it’s exploring the Red Light District, coffeeshops, museums or just strolling by the gorgeous canals, it’s impossible to be bored so allow yourself to wander and take it all in!

Two nights in London was plenty. I wanted to end on a high note, and I’d done just that. I wasn’t going to top the previous night. Plus, it was a waste of money staying there. I needed to get on the Euro. Given the short distance, and my desire to buy weed for the trip, Amsterdam was the obvious choice.
I took the Stena Line Ferry on Joanna’s recommendation. The cost wasn’t included in my Eurorail package, but for $30 it seemed well worth it to travel in comfort. If nothing else, it was a good excuse to drink and chain smoke indoors for 5 hours.
When I boarded, I was struck by how mall-like the interior was. It felt more like a cruise ship than a ferry. There were movie theaters, restaurants, bars, even shopping. There may have been a casino too, but I could just be imagining that because the place felt so much like one. After scoping out the ship, I found myself a comfortable leather chair near the bar and plopped myself down. I ordered a Guinness and swallowed two Adderall. Then, I removed my journal, and made my plans for Amsterdam:
- Coffee shops (buy lots of weed)
- Shrooms
- Find good bar
- Sex w/ prostitute?
For the rest of the ride, I read from the single book I’d brought on the trip, Hunter Thompson’s Fear and Loathing in America, a compilation of letters that Hunter wrote and received between the years of 1968–1976.It’s essentially an account of his life, told through correspondence. The book was 800 pages and weighed a few pounds. I almost didn’t bring it because of the extra heft it added to my backpack, but I knew it would come in handy for long travel days. Plus, I needed to stay sharp. Hunter was my North Star at the time, for good or ill. I admired his brashness and eye for bullshit. He was also a prodigious drug user whilst still being a terrific writer and honorable man. I wanted to be him in every way. I’d never felt that way about any other author or person, and still haven’t.
The ferry dropped us off at the Amsterdam Centraal train station at 2pm, amid the most perfect spring day. The sun was beaming down, and everyone seemed happy. Are people happy because they’re in Amsterdam, or do happy people just gravitate there, making it so? Hard to tell. Sounds like a chicken/egg situation. Speaking of which, I’ve always wondered if people weigh more because of their genes or because their caloric intake is higher, and they work out less. Like, if you took two people who eat and workout the same amount but one’s family has been fat for generations (like mine) and the other skinny, would they end up weighing the same exact amount? That may not be a chicken/egg situation but it’s in the same ballpark. I digress.
Before looking for a hostel, I wanted to get high, so I went in the first “coffee shop” I saw. Now would be a good time to describe the difference between coffee shops in America and coffee shops in Amsterdam. They look the same for the most part, except in Amsterdam, some sell weed. Pretty simple. I think they call them “coffee shops” because it sounds more dignified than “weed stores,” though that’s what they are.
I ordered a pre-roll and a latte. If cocaine and heroin together is a speed ball, weed and coffee together is more like a curveball. Part of me felt demure, sitting there smoking a joint by myself in a café. The other part though, was high as bollocks and VERY paranoid. The American penal system was so ingrained in me that my Pavlovian response to being high was an intense fear of the police. I kept reassuring myself that I wasn’t breaking the law, but I couldn’t shake the fear of being arrested. You don’t realize you’re paranoid amidst the paranoia. If you did, you wouldn’t be paranoid.
On my walk to find a hostel I couldn’t stop laughing at the ridiculousness street names. I wrote some of my favorites down in my journal. I also made up some of my own. See if you can guess which are which (I can’t even remember):
- Brouwersgracht
- Hosenlendinvein
- Princeneiland
- Amsterveenseweg
- Grunarpeilveg
- Einelpenilhar
- Brouwersgracht
The hostel I chose was a far cry from The Flying Pig, the “it” place I’d read about in my research. The Flying Pig was the most popular hostel for people my age (still is) because they had a weed smoking section in the common area where you could rent pipes and bongs. There was a communal element there, one I was not looking for. I don’t like being a part of groups and try to avoid it whenever possible. I want to do what I want to do, not what “us” wants to do. “Us” is always some lame compromise. I, instead, went with an off-brand hostel, one that catered to an older, more laid-back crowd. When I booked it online, the picture made it look like a nondescript Holiday Inn Express. It was a little off the beaten path, but not too far from the action. It looked clean, calm, and quiet, just what I was looking for.
When I got there, it did seem both clean and calm. But, to my surprise, I heard a jackhammer. When I checked in, I inquired, and the manager told me there would be construction every day from 9am-5pm.
Manager: Will that be a problem?
Me: No. I plan to be out during those hours every day. Thanks for letting me know.
That’s how I am, I thank people who inconvenience me. I’ve always been way too accommodating, even to my own detriment. I try to save the world one favor at a time. This wasn’t even a favor though. Who was I helping? The hostel? What’s wrong with me?
When I got up to my room, there was a man jackhammering five feet from my window. I’d never been that close to a jackhammer before. It sounded like a gunfight, like the one from Heat. What a fucking insane shootout. A ten-minute gun battle in the middle of Los Angeles? They must’ve had to shut the entire city down to film it. I wonder how much it cost. — Wait, what am I doing? Sorry. So, I got out of there and vowed to never be back between the hours of 9am-5pm
I still had an hour to kill before I could return. So, the mission again, was weed. This time to buy quantity. After 5 minutes of walking, I found a place called Coffee Shop Bob Marley. The brand is global. From the outside, it looked exactly like you’d think it would, Jamaican flag, pictures of Bob, Wailers albums. The inside had an island vibe, like Sammy Hagar designed it. De whole ting was airy. I promise not to say that again.
When I entered, I was greeted by an old budtender who looked exactly like Willy Nelson, all the way down to the bandana. From his voice I could tell he was an ex-pat. He handed me a Trapper Keeper-style three ring binder. In it were plastic pages with little slots for what traditionally would have been baseball cards. Instead of cards though, each quadrant contained a gram of weed, along with a short description about the type of high you could expect (e.g., purple haze: mellow, euphoric). It was the first time I’d seen such a professional set up and I was blown away. I’d smoked weed daily for 5 years but had never seen anything like that before. Remember in Half Baked, when Thurgood sees the weed room at the laboratory and fucks the air in elation? That was me.
After much consideration, I selected 3 indica strains and paid Willie 60 Euros for the 10.5-gram purchase, a good deal anywhere in the world at that time.
Me: May I light up in here?
Willy: Of course. The smoking room is in back.
The smoking room was just a small, curtained off area with a few high-top tables. A Bob Marley music video played on the television that hung on the wall. I put my bag on the table and removed a grape White Owl cigar that I’d brought with me from America. At the time I was still smoking blunts and I wanted to “represent” my “culture” while in Europe. How stupid. What I didn’t consider, was that I’d barely smoked the previous two weeks while in New York. And, though I smoked a hash spliff the previous night in London, my tolerance was still low. Drug tolerance must ALWAYS be considered. Regardless, I went ahead and rolled a 2.5-gram monster of Afghan Kush.
There were two other people in the room with me, a couple, who both appeared to be in their 30’s. They were smoking out of a pipe and laughing. When I dumped the guts of the blunt into a garbage bin near the wall, they began staring in my direction. They didn’t say anything, but I could tell they were interested in what I was constructing. I was proud of my blunt rolling skills and wanted to put on a show for them, so they could see how we did it in the states. I considered myself an ambassador.
After licking the blunt closed, I sparked my lighter, running the flame along the paper to dry it out. Then, I lit it, taking a deep drag and coughing slightly. The couple, again, glanced my way. I looked in their direction, smiled, and kept smoking like a real cool dude.
About halfway through the blunt, I realized I’d made a huge mistake, and that I was not cool at all. In fact, I was hot, sweating bullets, actually. And I was overcome with dizziness. I could tell the couple wanted to check on me, they just weren’t sure if it was their place to do so. I mean, I must’ve known what I was doing, right? You don’t just roll a blunt like that if it’s your first time smoking weed.
My equilibrium was totally askew. I gripped the small, circular table in front of me like I was Greco Roman wrestling with it. I had to say something before it was too late.
Me: My name is Sam. I’m from America. If I die, my mom’s phone number is in my — -
Then I passed out and fell on the floor.
When I came to, Bob Marley’s I Shot the Sheriff was playing on the tv. The couple was hovering over me, disturbed, their highs obviously ruined. Willy was concerned too, standing over me with a bottle of water. I didn’t even know how long I’d been out.
Willy: We were scared, man. Glad you’re ok. We don’t even allow cigars in here.
Lady: That was so scary.
Other Lady: Here’s your ID. We found it in your bag. We’re from America too.
Me: Well…That’s just perfect.
I grabbed my ID from the lady, along with the remainder of the blunt. Then, I ran out with my tail between my legs, knowing I’d rather be dead than ever show my face in there again. There would be no Redemption Song for me.
On my way back to the hostel, I passed what looked to be the weirdest food establishment I’d ever seen. It reminded me of a Gray’s Papaya, a hot dog chain in New York, in that there was no seating inside. In fact, there was nothing at all inside. It looked to be just an empty room, like an American check cashing place. Yet, it smelled like fast food. It was too weird to not investigate.
When I went in, I thought I was tripping out. I was still very high and woozy from the fall, but I was pretty sure I was standing inside a life-sized vending machine. The walls were lined with rows and rows of slots where hot food was kept. I knew there must have been a kitchen in the back where everything was prepared, but I didn’t see one, nor could I hear one. The only sign of human life was the hand of an employee replenishing the stock after a sale. I didn’t love the impersonality of it all, but I had to admit it was ingenious.
The idea must have seared itself into my brain because I opened a take-and-go food establishment in Chicago only 7 years later. It failed. In fact, I got sued. I don’t want to talk about that, though.
I put my credit card in and pressed the cheeseburger button twice. The slot unlocked and I removed my burgers, which were still delightfully warm. I went over to a bench and enjoyed them while watching a few kids play tag. I realized we were only a block from the Red-Light District. I wondered if they knew about what went on over there. I imagined they did, but were probably cool about it.
…
I awoke from a much-needed night of sleep at 8:00am, which allowed me to get some free breakfast before the jackhammering started. After getting my plate of fruit and toast, I sat down near the television that played the BBC news on a loop. I loathed American news, but the BBC version didn’t bother me all that much. It was almost pleasant to watch. What we have in America can hardly be called news. It’s just commercials for dick pills with raving lunatics spliced in between.
From my seat, I could see that it was drizzling outside. My plans for the day though, were iron clad. No amount of rain was going to keep me from tripping on mushrooms. I was going to trip; it had been written, in my journal.
I’d done mushrooms a handful of times before, with experiences ranging from spiritual bliss to utter madness, but I always learned something about myself in the process, and that was the most important thing to me. Doing them alone wasn’t an issue for me either, I preferred it. I didn’t like getting caught up in other people’s trips, literally and figuratively.
When I entered the Smartshop, I was greeted by the kind of guy you’d think would be running a psychedelic mushroom store, long hair, flannel shirt, monk vibes. They call them “smart shops” the way they call weed stores “coffee shops”. I’ve always found that to be telling. Those are delicate, non-fear inducing terms. Maybe, so when kids walk by, they create positive association instead of negative ones. It’s the Pavlovian response thing again. In America we have “Gun Stores” not “Safety Shops”. Think about it. Rather crude, if you ask me.
Clerk: How may I help you?
Me: Can you please advise me on which mushrooms I should take, and the quantity?
Clerk: Of course. That is exactly what I am here for. Have you done psilocybin before?
Me: Yes, maybe 10 times.
Clerk: Ok, let me walk you through what we have.
He took me over to a glass case with about 10 varieties of mushrooms, some wet, some dry, all of them unique in shape and color. He walked me through their different levels of potency and their array of effects.
Me: How about something in the medium-strength level?
Clerk: Sure. Would you like to see visuals?
Me: Yes, please.
Clerk: I suggest 1 to 2 grams of the High Hawaiian variety, dried.
Me: Will they make me laugh?
Clerk: Ooohhh yeah.
I paid him 10 Euros and exited the Smartshop with my mushrooms. I walked over to the canal and found an unoccupied bench and dried a small spot for myself. It was drizzling the perfect amount, like a mist. I took the mushrooms out of my bag, along with a banana I’d saved from breakfast and a bottle of water. Then I said my usual pre-hallucinogen prayer.
“Lord, please look after me during this trip.”
Once I had the mushrooms down and the nausea passed, I sat back and read my book until the words no longer looked like words, maybe 30 minutes. That’s when the laughing started. EVERYTHING was funny. I spent 10 minutes laughing at my shoes because I thought they looked like chili dogs. Then it was the word “wanker.” I couldn’t stop saying it. “Oy ye wanker”, “Aye wanker, quit ya wanking”, “Bloody, scheming wanker.” That shit was KILLING me. I thought I’d written and entire, perfected comedy bit. As you can see, I did not do that. I was having a ball though.
Then, down the canal a few hundred yards away, I saw a tourist boat slowly approaching. There were 20 or so passengers on the small boat, and all of them were Asian. They looked so happy to me, with their big visors and smiling faces. I was overcome with the urge to connect with them. I stood up and waved my arms, yelling to them as they passed.
“Helllloooooo!!! Welcome to Amsterdam!!!”
They waved back jubilantly, while I cry-laughed like a maniac, waving and yelling in their direction as they passed by my bench.
“Enjoy your staaayyyy!!”
I greeted 8 boats-worth of people over a 2-hour period. For nearly my entire trip, I worked as a volunteer civil servant for a city I’d only been in two days. Amsterdam is special that way. Before leaving my post, I wrote in my journal:
I’D WORK ANY JOB IN THIS CITY
I walked back to the hostel soaked; my feet pruned from the rain. What I needed more than anything was a peaceful place to come down and dry off. When I got to my room, I was delighted to find none of my roommates there, a rare occurrence in a 4-person room. I toweled off and hung my clothes on the edge of the bunk before getting into my bed to reflect and relax. I couldn’t have felt calmer, laying there. My heart was pure, and my thoughts, loving.
Then the jackhammering started. I’d completely forgotten about it. And this time, because of the mushrooms, it sounded even louder and more menacing than before. I still had three hours to kill, but my only jacket was soaked, along with my shoes, so I just laid there with a pillow over my face, laughing at the ridiculousness of the situation.
Mushrooms never fail to humble you.
…
I woke up the next day to more rain. My tentative plan had been to go to Vondelpark, the largest, and most popular park in Amsterdam, but that was now out of the question. I wasn’t willing to get drenched again. So, I went to write in a, you guessed it, coffee shop. I drank café mochas and smoked spliffs with my pinky up like a dignified gentleman. In my journal, I noted my surroundings:
- Everyone is elegant. Nothing dressy, but all timeless looks. Bright, mismatching outfits, silly in the best way.
- Bikes, even in the rain.
- What does everyone do for work? Maybe they’re all architects. That’s why the houses are so unique, everyone builds their own.
- Expensive looking umbrellas in the bin — — In America they’d be stolen.
I left when the rain turned to sun and wondered around for a short time before stumbling on a cute, outdoor market that sold flowers and other local delicacies. I bought an onion and herring sandwich along with a waffle,admittedly an odd combination. It brought back memories of my Bubbie, who’d loved both. Seeing me holding them at the same time would’ve given her a good chuckle. She’d probably ask, “What is it, my birthday?” I missed her dearly, especially in that moment. My father loved waffles too, but I wouldn’t give him the satisfaction of thinking of him. Plus, the image of my dad eating 30 waffles is not a pleasant memory to conjure up.
After finishing my meal, I went in my pocket for dessert, 20mg of Adderall. My mom told me my Bubbie took uppers in the 60’s, when it was prescribed to housewives as a weight loss drug. I bet her grandma was a speed freak too, drinking that Coca Cola with actual cocaine in it. Time is a flat circle, no matter how much we tried to deny it.
I needed to charge up, and without sleep, Adderall was the best way to do that (even with sleep, for that matter). I was on a mission to find a bar that evening. And not just a bar for the night, but one I could call home in future visits. I still had a month left in my trip and knew I’d be back to Amsterdam, so I needed to have a reliable place to hang my hat. Bars are that important to me. I can’t just go any old place to drink willy nilly. I need a home base, somewhere I feel comfortable, where they know my name. Cue the song.
I had no clue where I was going to find it, but I knew I’d know it when I saw it (the same way pornography was defined by the Supreme Court in 1964). It took some walking, but then I stumbled upon what was undoubtablythe place. I was standing at the corner of Nieuwebrugsteeg and Warmoesstraat, right where Warmoesstraat turns into Sint Olofspoort. I’m not joking. I looked up and there it was… The perfect bar. The sign under the awning read: “H. Murray’s Bar”. Next to it was a smaller sign that read “Anno 1619”. It looked to be more of a house than a bar. From the outside it could be mistaken for someone’s living room. Through the window, I could see a long-haired Golden Retriever sitting inside. A bar dog is a surefire sign of a good bar. If it’s good enough for a dog, it’s good enough for me.
I entered like I was returning home.
Me: Hi. I’m Sam.
Neil: Hello, friend. I’m Neil. That’s Lilly (pointing to the dog). And that’s Norman (pointing to the only other man in the bar).
Me: Hello gents. May I…?
Norman: Pull up a seat, Sam.
Me: I’ll have what Norman’s having.
Always drink what the house drinks. It will endear you to the crowd. For me, that only backfires when the house drink is Sambuca. I hate Sambuca. It tastes like a Christmas tree. Or Malort, don’t even get me started on the Chicago bars that push that lighter fluid on their clientele. Monsters.
We got to talking and time got to flying, the way it does when you’re around good people. Norman told me about his time in Berkley, about how he knew Tim Leary, Tom Wolffe and the Merry Pranksters (look them up), people I’d only known from books like The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test. We shared the same sense of humor too. When he told me his favorite comedian was Steven Wright, I knew we were cut from the same cloth, only a generation apart. Steven Wright is one of the more obscure, odd comedians; real dry and wordy. He can make you laugh in less than ten words. I told him to look up Mitch Hedberg. I didn’t bother telling him how Mitch’s death contributed to my quitting stand-up, or that I even did stand-up at all. I just enjoyed listening and being a guest.
I wish I remembered more of that night, but that’s how it goes sometimes. I’ve always found sacrificing memory for fun to be a fair trade. Not everything has to be remembered and documented with a picture. I don’t remember most of the best times of my life and I’m just fine with that. The last memory I have of that night is Norman pulling out an ounce of loose weed from his jacket pocket and slapping it on the bar. We must have smoked a joint that knocked me out completely. I probably threw up before they called me a cab, but that’s just an educated guess (I’ll give you 2/1 odds that I puked though).
…
I awoke to jackhammering the next morning. The sound was so loud I thought it was coming from the inside my head. When I took the pillow off my face, the construction guy was staring at me from outside my window.If there’s a more terrible way to wake up when you’re hungover, or sober for that matter, I’ve never experienced it. I popped up like a jack-in-the-box and ran out like my hair was on fire. I still had my clothes on from the night before, which made my escape easier. Fuck a shower, I needed to get out of there.
While I was scarfing down cold eggs and toast in the lobby, I checked my pockets and counted the money I had. It was the same exact amount as when I’d gone out the night before. John Mulaney had a joke about coming home with MORE money than he went out with, and this wasn’t that, but it was close. Neil didn’t even charge me. I couldn’t recall his kind gesture, but I was sure I hadn’t just left without paying. I mean, I was pretty sure. When wasted, I’m more inclined to try and pay twice than I am to skip out on the bill. One time in New Orleans, I paid my tab, then sat there trying to pay my tab four more times. The bartender threw me out.
I caught some highlights from the NCAA Men’s March Madness tournament on the BBC which made me feel odd. In years past I would have been watching every game, but this time it felt like insignificant news from a distant land.
After finishing my breakfast, I headed out to do some wandering. I hit a few bookstores, but mainly I just walked, soaking in the surroundings and smoking. I had more than enough weed, but I still stopped in coffee shops to see their product line. Each store was unique, and I just couldn’t get enough of being inside places that sold legal weed. I live in California now and the novelty still hasn’t worn off.
As night rolled around, I found myself in a bar, drinking Irish Whiskey, not my usual. I don’t know exactly where I was, but I do know it was right by the Red-Light District. THAT I’M SURE OF.
As I got drunker my loneliness began to transform into horny rage. When my erection grew, I knew the decision was being made for me. It was time.
I walked the entire length of the Red-Light District multiple times, perusing the ladies, to find the perfect date for the next 30 minutes. I’m trying to be tactful here by saying “date”. “Victim” sounds too graphic even though that’s kind of what it felt like.
I have always been a very discerning shopper, that time being no different. The women all had their own room where they sat, positioned toward the outer sidewalk. By just looking in you could see the entire layout. They were all similar; a bed in the corner, a small nightstand, presumably for keys or other knickknacks that may interfere with the coitus, and a few mirrors. Everything was red, the lights, the bed, the carpet, even the exterior. Like white is the safest car color, I think red makes the most fucking. It’s behavioral science.
All the women were objectively gorgeous, much more gorgeous than the sex workers I saw in Tijuana a few months prior. They weren’t beaten down either, figuratively speaking. They looked confident, even proud, like hard working small-business owners. Some of them weren’t even dressed scantily and gave off a “take it or leave it” vibe, which I dug. There were no pimps in sight either. Just the ladies and their red rooms.
With each trip down the corridor, I narrowed my selection. It’s like I was hosting my own NCAA elimination tournament in my brain, only I was pitting lady against lady, with the winner advancing to the next round. Now, I realize what I was doing was waiting for one of them to pick me. If I was going to victimize one of these women, I wanted her to at least feign interest first.
One did. She was white, with long, dark brown hair, and weighed about 150 pounds. She curled her index finger and invited me in, licking it between curls. I was sold.
When I went in, I met the pimp. He may not have been a pimp, but he held the money like a pimp does. And, probably for the best. I gave him 50 Euros and he gave me a single condom. He didn’t say a word. Then, he opened the door to the red room.
Lady: I’m Tonya. What’s your name?
Me: I’m Sam. (I forgot you can lie in those situations.)
Her bubbliness was gone. Now, she was working. She’d already caught her fish; the rest was just fileting.
Lady: Bed or standing?
Me: Uhhh, standing.
She turned around and faced the dresser, gripping the top of it with her hand. She pulled her black panties down and began to prepare herself with one hand, the other braced on the dresser. I took my pants down as well, following her lead. Luckily, I was already prepared. I’d been prepared since I was in the bar an hour ago.
Lady: Ok, ready.
I tore open the condom and put it on. Then, I inserted myself into her.
She moaned. I gained confidence. I started to go faster, and she moaned more, my confidence growing stronger yet.
I took my left hand and slapped her ass cheek. As soon as I did, the pimp came bursting in.
Pimp: NO, NO, NO! NONE OF THAT!
He was pissed.I looked over at him to apologize for my lapse in judgment, and while doing so, ejaculated into the condom I was wearing, while inside of Tonya. I knew I was jizzing. He knew I was jizzing. I knew he knew I was jizzing.
We both jumped back.
Pimp: Ok, that’s it you’re done.
Me: But I didn’t even cum.
He pointed to my shriveling dick.
Pimp: Yes, you did.
I had no recourse. There was jizz in the condom and I couldn’t remove it in his presence, causing a smoking gun, “Gotcha!” type of situation. So, I waited until he left the room. I used my eyes to tell him that I was a coward and would pack up and leave expeditiously. He understood, given his experience.
As I got dressed, Tonya started doing a crossword puzzle. She wasn’t paying any mind to me whatsoever. She was on her own time now, and she planned

The Netherlands has proven to be home to a very diverse group of people in my short time here. While researching I found that the US is technically more diverse but given how much larger of a country it is than the Netherlands, different nationalities, cultures, and races tend to be more spread out and isolated as a result. I have been to many large cities in the US (New York, Washington DC, Miami, Detroit, etc.) and while they are all diverse to an extent, it always seems there is one dominant culture or nationality in each city. This is why to me Amsterdam is a true cultural blend with people having heritages from all over the world and potentially living in the same city block. This made me question why the US is like this and how Amsterdam seems so much more diverse than the US even though it statistically is not.
The simple answer is because of the Dutch themselves and their acceptance of immigrants and refugees. The Dutch have, for centuries, been a safe haven of sorts to people from European, Middle Eastern, or Asian countries and this has led to a high number of immigrants fleeing their home country for Amsterdam. The Dutch advocate heavily for inclusion instead of immigration which has allowed these immigrants to feel safe and comfortable in Amsterdam which in turn leads to them staying and starting families. This is enhanced by the fact that they have a labor migration program that helps skilled workers migrate to the country in order to work. This has the effect of also solving holes in the employment market by filling jobs that are most necessary with immigrants who possess those skills. The most recent “Multi-year Policy Plan for Social Issues” spanned the years 2015–2018 and focused on anti-discrimination, LGBTQ+ rights, and empowering women. These are all issues the US is just now starting to even address let alone solve.
These factors all relate to the 20th and 21st century and the Netherlands has been around for much longer than that, so things have been trending this way for a long time. The Dutch built an empire through trading in the “Golden Era” which was the 16th and 17th centuries, and this was what, unknown to them, got the ball rolling on making Amsterdam so diverse. The addition of colonies started the trend of immigrants leaving for Amsterdam whether it was under their own free will or not did not affect the outcome. The outcome was that many people from South America, The Caribbean, Indonesia, and India ended up residing in Amsterdam throughout the 17th and 18th centuries.
The Netherlands relied heavily on trade which brought foreigners from other countries to the ports of Amsterdam and Rotterdam. These foreigners were trading with the Dutch, not immigrants from one of their many colonies in this time period. Many of these foreigners became immigrants over time whether for profit, the culture, or whatever reason. In turn, this resulted in an even larger influx of immigrants than that of individuals coming from a colony. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, this would continue and be more focused on specialization. The Dutch needed people with different skills, and they didn’t care where they came from, how they talked, or what they looked like. The opportunities of the city of Amsterdam were too enticing to some and this is a major factor in my observation of dense clusters of diversity in the city.
The opportunities didn’t stop at just the jobs though, the Netherlands is home to many prestigious schools and universities which also has a role. People do not just immigrate to Amsterdam for jobs, many do it for education. However, when the job and educational opportunities are combined, along with the respect Dutch citizens have for immigrants, people are more likely to completely emigrate to the Netherlands. A lot of foreigners in the US are not immigrants and live in the US on school or work Visas. The negative view Americans have on immigrants results in many of them going back to their home country after their Visa expires. The Netherlands provides them with a home away from home in a sense and ultimately more immigrants chose to stay. Policy: Diversity — City of Amsterdam

Day 44 — Amsterdam
I am sitting here on my tiny balcony. The air still feels crisp and humid because of last night’s rain. There is no doubt, I am back in Holland.
Back in Holland after 3 years of travelling around as a digital nomad.
But for the very first time, I don’t feel an immediate urge to pack my bags and hop back on another plane. Something needs to change first.
When I started my solo trips around Europe a few years ago, I was terrified that I would constantly feel alone. The mere thought of dining alone in restaurants, going to parties where I knew no one, or feeling lost in an unknown city, freaked me out.
And the alternative—approaching people and socialising—was even scarier.
But life is different now. I doubt if I will ever lose my moments of social awkwardness, but I made a habit of throwing myself into new situations. I learned how to surf, tried to learn how to dance and turned strangers into close friends.
Living a cliche digital nomad lifestyle. Yet, I am somewhat done with it. It feels like I finally graduated.
Don’t get me wrong. I live a privileged life. I love the adventure, the novelty, the thrill and there is nothing quite like connecting with new people. I love new stories, waiting to be unpacked.
However, the biggest downside of a nomadic life is — no surprise— the fact that everyone leaves again. I know now that it is possible to build deep connections within weeks, sometimes even hours. To cry, laugh and share life stories together.
But maintaining them is a different story. It’s almost impossible to stay close while being separated by different time zones. Especially for a terrible Whatsapp’er like myself.
I struggle with the need to always build new deep connections from scratch. I struggle with friends — or myself leaving after a few months. I don’t want that no more. Again, something needs to change.
For years, my biggest desire has been freedom, the freedom to travel and explore the world. But slowly I am witnessing my desires change. Does my longing for freedom still outweigh the struggle of often missing close friends and family?
How do I balance freedom with maintaining deep, long-lasting connections? I can’t simply take my loved ones with me.
Or can I?
Well, I am going to give it a try.
In the upcoming period, I will record conversations with those around me, wherever I am. Much like interviewing famous podcast guests.
Allowing us to dive deeper than casual small talk, and hopefully resulting in an album of conversations — souvenirs for when our paths diverge again.
The goal is not to share them publically and rack up millions of downloads. Quite the opposite. I can be a DJ without a crowd. I am recording these conversations to get to know the people in my life better, explore their stories, and to laugh and create lasting memories.
I don’t know if we will like it. But trying is the only way to find out. Trying to lean into whatever excites me, intrigues me, into what I consider meaningful.
And this idea definitely feels meaningful to me.
I am sitting here on my balcony staring at the sky. The sun slowly breaks through. I am feeling the energy of trying something new.
Let’s go.
— -During the upcoming period, I will record some podcasts and I am looking for cities to settle instead of always travelling around.
“Know when it is time to move on, know when you graduated.”

In a life-first, I went on two holidays this year! I’ve never felt like such a jet-setter, exploring Europe with my friends, staying in the most luxurious hotels that a student budget can buy. My first trip this summer was to Cyprus, and was less adventure and more ‘let’s lie in the sun with a book and a cocktail’. This time, I was ready to throw relaxation out of the window and hit the cobbled streets of the Netherlands’ capital.
Amsterdam has a reputation as the chillest of cities, perhaps in part due to its ‘coffeeshops’, but this reputation is an absolute lie. I have never been so stressed as I was walking out of Amsterdam Centraal Station in rush hour, only to accidentally stumble into the bike swarm. Everyone riding bikes may be great for the environment, but it’s not great for helpless pedestrians who end up jumping into canals to avoid oncoming cyclists. Everyone from 10-year-old boys to little old grandmas is on their bike, and red lights seem to be considered ‘optional’. I found myself muttering “green man means go” every time I crossed a road, just to try and reassure myself that I wasn’t about to end up tangled in someone’s handlebars.
I am of the opinion that Amsterdam should no longer be known as the chillest city, but the fittest one. Firstly, everyone is very physically fit. Cycling everywhere and eating loads of herring seems to have made everyone slim. It probably also helps that they’re all about a foot taller than me, making them look even more beautiful and elven. Beyond physical fitness, everyone is just cute. Me and my highly stylish friend Alethea, featured above, found ourselves doing constant double-takes. The men of Amsterdam put the balding football lads of England to shame. In Amsterdam 45 seems to be the new 20, and they swan around looking tall and handsome on their bikes. I don’t know if it’s the bikes, the pretty scenery, or the weed, but something in Amsterdam clearly keeps you young.
Despite the apparent fountain of youth properties of herring, neither of us indulged. My excuse was being vegetarian, and Alethea’s was that she didn’t want fish breath that repulses everyone within a mile radius. As our canal cruise guide said: “A herring a day keeps the doctor away, two keeps everyone away.”. That isn’t to say we didn’t sample some other typical Amsterdam delights. Our first stop was FEBO, a fast-food place where you can get hot snacks out of vending machines. There were all sorts of croquettes or meaty options, but we went for Kaasoufflé (cheese that’s breaded and fried). After our grease-fest lunch was complete, we also had to grab some Poffertjes, little Dutch pancakes which I love. It seems that the key to authentic poffertjes is to absolutely slather them in icing sugar and butter, which raised no complaints from me.
Although we seemed to spend most of our time wandering aimlessly through the Jordaan, I did also manage to take in Amsterdam’s famous museum quarter. Alethea had already been to the Van Gogh Museum last year, so I went on a little solo adventure to see the work of one of my all-time favourite artists. The paintings were amazing, but I’m a speedy museum viewer so I had the whole place scoped out in an hour or so. Once my whistle-stop tour was finished, I had to take the obligatory photo in front of the digital Van Gogh wall, with an expression of extreme regret as everyone stared at me trying to take my selfie. No museum trip is complete without postcards, so I treated myself to a few of my favourite paintings.
Our final night saw us relaxing in a BBQ grill (yes, an odd choice for a vegetarian, I am aware) after our original restaurant choice was full of intimidatingly beautiful and cool Amsterdam youths. It was a lovely end to the trip, with great cider and slightly weird Asian-style nachos. I’m so glad I finally had the opportunity to tick Amsterdam off my travel bucket list. It doesn’t have the same soft spot in my soul as London does, but it’s very scenic and the perfect place to go if you’re looking to find yourself a gorgeous cycling boyfriend. The 8 hours of trains back to England the next day was rough, especially as I battled a bad case of man flu, but all in all, it was a pretty great adventure.
Next stops on my travel bucket list: Italy, India, and Ireland. I’m on a mission to tick off the 3 Is in 2020, so stay tuned.

When I moved to Amsterdam, 24 years ago, there were innumerable comments along the lines of: “Oh yeah… Amsterdam, eh?! EH?!! Nudge-nudge, wink-wink, EH?!!”.
To the uninformed I was relocating to a cesspit of iniquity, a European Gomorrah of rampant drug taking and prostitutes for sale in the windows of every street. Everything, people supposed, a single man in his early thirties could desire. Except it wasn’t. Because Amsterdam wasn’t — and isn’t — like that at all.
Yes, the notorious red light zone de Wallen (“the walls”) exists, with its women — most probably sex-trafficked — sat in illuminated windows looking bored while awkward men leer at them from the outside. And, as you walk through quaint backstreets, the barely disguised whiff of weed tickles the nostrils as it pours out of semi-legal coffee shops. However, this is just a tiny slice of Amsterdam, one of the jewels of Europe, with its Instagramable canals, medieval architecture, vibrant culture and a history and charm matched only by the likes of Paris, Seville or Prague.
I am naturally biased, having once lived in or near Amsterdam for the better part of a decade, as well as being a frequent visitor for almost 30 years. To some extent, too, the seedier side isn’t as bad as it could be (ditto, Hamburg and its somewhat cartoon-like Reeperbahn), but I get where the city authorities, and indeed the Dutch government, are coming from in wanting to clean it up.
Conscious of this reputation, tourists are even being discouraged from visiting the de facto Dutch capital, though this was initially a measure to cut down on overcrowding. An environmental measure was also introduced to cap flights arriving at Schiphol, Amsterdam’s massive, seven-runway international air hub, which this year alone has reduced the number of flights from the UK by 22% compared with pre-Covid travel. The Netherlands Tourism Board has even been actively promoting places alternatives like Eindhoven — a city I know well from my career at Philips, which was founded there.
But with the exception of football nerds wishing to see the PSV Stadion, or the even more niche interest of the Philips lightbulb museum, Eindhoven is largely a ‘company town’ with little to offer tourists compared to the cultural riches of Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum, the Anne Frank House, the canals or the Negen Straatjes (‘nine streets’), not to mention its wealth of cross-culture cuisines.
Amsterdam has always been one of the most welcoming cities in Europe, in one of the world’s happiest nations, according to research by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. But those same people are understandably tired of the stag-weekenders who spend their time in the city getting drunk, fighting outside bars and urinating in canals (before then falling in), or swaggering about the red light zone leering at its most unfortunate residents.
This has now been reflected by an online campaign specifically targeting 18–35-year-old British men, with one ad showing a young man being arrested and put in a cell with the atypically Dutch-blunt caption: “So coming to Amsterdam for a messy night? Stay away.”
In recent years the city has made efforts to combat the vice industry (believed to be controlled by a combination of rival Turkish and Albanian organised crime), both to cut down on the sex tourism as well as the exploitation of vulnerable women. The drugs trade, run by the same gangs, has long been associated with this, with politicians arguing that the liberal experiment, dating back to the 1970s, which legitimised cannabis use as long as it is sold in limited quantities in coffee shops, has failed. Weed sales have been regarded as a gateway to sales of harder narcotics, all with associated criminality invariably leading to violence.
When I moved to Amsterdam in 1999 moves were already in place to tackle drug tourism, prompting a national ban on the sale of magic mushrooms and an increased regulation of cannabis sales, and aimed at striking a balance between tourism and public safety. Simultaneously, concerns about sex tourism and human trafficking prompted initiatives to regulate prostitution and improve the working conditions of sex workers. There were also measures to reduce the visibility of the red light district, with an effort to redevelop Amsterdam’s central neighbourhoods by encouraging new businesses to move into streets previously dominated by the sex and drug industry.
Sustainable tourism has also been promoted, with a campaign calling for tourists to “Enjoy & Respect” Amsterdam, and embrace its rich cultural artistic heritage rather than its seedier attractions. However, in also addressing both ‘over-tourism’ and sex/drug visitors, businesses relying on tourist euros have expressed their concerns at any effort to drive down undesirabled, especially in the wake of Amsterdam’s post-pandemic recovery.
It is, then, a dilemma. Amsterdam — like everywhere else — suffered greatly from Covid travel bans and lockdowns, as the city’s hotels, bars, restaurants and shops saw business plummet. The campaign against young male Brits is targeted, but it is hard yet to gauge whether it will be either effective in achieving its aims, or detrimental to the local economy.
As a champion of Amsterdam, however, anything which can successfully eradicate city’s “nudge-nudge, wink-wink” association, and works to enhance and embrace its unique identity is a good thing.
The city is more than simply a living museum, but its heritage — dating back to the 13th century when a small fishing village was established along the Amstel River — is more than worthy of protection. This is the city that was at the heart of the Dutch Golden Age in the 18th century, becoming a trading hub, with the construction of its famous ring of canals earning it the “Venice of the North” nickname. Its commercial and artistic foundations are still to be celebrated, either in the traditions established by the Dutch East India Company, one of the world’s earliest multinationals (and the genetic origin of the Netherlands’ global business outlook), the foundation of one of the world’s first stock exchanges — the “Beurs” (although Belgium’s Bruges lays claim to the oldest, its bourse), not to mention the work of Rembrandt and Vermeer during that same era.
There are those who see the see the discouragement of tourists looking to have the wrong kind of good time as being to Amsterdam’s financial detriment, not to mention to the detriment of its charm. But, just as New York — established as New Amsterdam — cleaned itself up in the early 1990s to its immeasurable benefit as a tourist destination, Amsterdam’s crackdown on Brits seeking to exploit its underbelly will go a long way to lessen the profile of that reputation. It will surely only enhance what those like me who know it, know it to be the real Amsterdam.

My vision when I agreed to volunteer with U.Gent was not to spend a ton of time in cities, but I had a weekend to myself and thought that traveling might be a better use of my time than remaining in the home city. So I decided to go to Amsterdam. Its appeal to me was greater than that of Paris, the next-nearest major city. Following my positive experience day-tripping to Bruges, the idea was to have a chilled out weekend in a well-touristed place, where most sights would be accessible and friendly to English-speakers. Legal weed was a cherry on top. The weekend wound up being far from relaxing, but I gained some largely superficial impressions of the city, and learned more lessons on spur-of-the-moment traveling.
The journey began in Antwerp, the city that’s hated by Belgians the same way that Boston is hated by other New Englanders. According to residents it is “THE city”, and the rest of Belgium just serves as parking. I’d made a note to not visit…. but all trains to the Netherlands route you through Antwerp so I had no choice in that matter. The Antwerp train station precipitates the start of what feels like a real European adventure to the Other Low Country. It’s three levels of rails stacked one on top of the next. The surface level is vaulted in an expansive glass arc of windows and decorated with enough marble and carved stone to impress all of the inferior non-residents arriving to its port. The atrium between the two sides of tracks plunges all three stories underground where it’s cold like a cave. This is the level reserved for the long distance trains. I squint up at the glasswork far above. Here it is dark save for pulses of neon blue light on the pillars. I understand that Gentians see this place as stuck up, but the train station makes me believe it actually is modern and cool. I feel like Gretel wandering into the deep woods in this vast place in a little starry summer dress and a bag on my side.
I’m told by a man on the train that Amsterdam “is not the Netherlands”. It’s like Antwerp in the sense that everyone who actually lives in the country hates it. I am not deterred but a little more curious as to what I’ll find there. International travel is uneventful within the Schengen region of the E.U. and there was no indication of when we crossed the border of Belgium into the Netherlands.
The buildings are like a solemn box of chocolates (or tombstones), all blacks and dark browns with white window frames. This contrasts the sandier and whiter Low Citites of Gent and Brugge. It’s like the city is perpetually bracing for a terrible storm, or a long-dark winter. The barges and houseboats are stoically shaped, not flashy or fun. It’s beautiful, but looks at home in cloudy weather and rain. This aesthetic contrasts with the most famous decorative themes of the region: tulips and painted porcelain tiles (interestingly, both imported from Persia in the days of the Ottoman Empire). I like to think the cultural obsessions with these things were precipitated in part by the otherwise complete colorlessness of the city landscape. Certainly both tulips and tiled surfaces are natural fits with the damp, mild temperatures of the region. I like that the city uses the abundant water and flatness for transportation by boat and bicycle. It feels integrated with its surroundings.
I’d like to say that these were my first impressions of the city, but they were not. My first impression was of the second-largest crush of tourists I’ve ever seen after Times Square. The downtown streets are fraught with people wandering aimlessly, stopping dead in their tracks and struggling with ungainly loads of luggage and bags. There’s a huge difference between this behavior in diffuse, manageable situations and at this scale. I find it really stressful, especially as I attempt to find a bike, an affordable place to sleep last-minute, and finally some orientation to the city. There is a telling lack of thru-traffic that suggests the locals aggressively avoid the historic downtown. I turn my first corner in the narrow alleys between the dark brick buildings and come face to face with three head shops, side by side. There are some young-looking burnouts on cushions gazing at the street from an open-air cafe, sitting beneath a canopy of Far-East-looking scarves. Clouds of pot smoke roll onto the street. I question the authenticity of everything I see. There’s no speaking among tourists: a man and woman loudly drawl to one another in North Carolinan accents, then politely nod and bow to me in an attempt to silently indicate they want to get by. I sense that everyone here speaks English but we are unwilling to assume it of each other.
Amsterdam appears to be the European equivalent of Las Vegas as a destination for epic bachelor/ette parties. Small herds of men or women (exclusively single gender groups) trawl by, dressed in matching t-shirts or costumes. Usually one of their numbers is dressed even more ridiculously than their companions: fur coats, fake breasts, and several animal onesies among the sightings. There was a lot of broken glass on the ground, and some of those twelve-person bicycle tour carts that have a keg in the middle.
The boats on the canals appeared to carry a possibly more local crowd. Although there were barges of well-behaved tourists, some aboard for city history and others for wine and cheese, there were other smaller private barges cruising the downtown. These hummed with loud music, full of assorted young men and women looking for all the world like an Abercrombie and Fitch ad. Their leisure time was on display for all as they crawled by just below street-level.
The Red Light district really is everything that its depictions in crappy movies have promised. There were even actual red lights! The first time I saw a prostitute in a window I thought she was a poorly-dressed mannequin until she moved. In Amsterdam there seems to be a culture that is defensive of the sex workers’ rights, privacy and respectful of their profession. I wondered whether I was supposed to give them a nod of solidarity… although none were bothering to make eye contact with female passersby. Turns out white lingerie really pops under UV light. I walked by some fascinating shops — leather and rubber clothing boutiques; lingerie and toys suitable for every kind of body; sex shows; and an overabundance of racy souvenir shops that touted glassware, cannabis ice cream (no psychoactive effects, it just happens to contain cannabis) and some truly alarming postcards. I can only imagine what would happen if you turned a group of 18–19 year-old Americans loose over here. Everything, every vice is available and visible in shop windows. It strikes me that rule-breaking and drug theory by word-of-mouth is a large part of the novelty of American illicit-substance culture. How many wannabe Dharma Bums and Gonzo Journalists would become disillusioned if they could just pop into a shop and purchase mind-altering substances from a professional?
A couple years ago the Netherlands proposed a ban on visitors purchasing recreational drugs. Store owners and residents protested, claiming that the subsequent influx of illegal dealers would cause far worse problems for their urban areas. So now, any person over 18 can purchase whatever they want at dispensaries and koffieshops, the latter’s marijuana distributing license indicated with a subtle green and white sticker in the front window. There were formal and handwritten signs scattered throughout the red light district discouraging the purchase of drugs from street dealers. The signs the same vocabulary you might expect on a sign discouraging people from feeding the squirrels: “They are violent and aggressive”. There were similar signs prohibiting the use of hard drugs.
Drug dispensaries were situated abreast of all other shops in the historic downtown (and, I assume, are scattered throughout the city in lower densities). They seem to keep marijuana separate from places that sell other recreational drugs. I found the reading material on the counters of these dispensaries to be fascinating for its professional and informative tone: each variety of MDMA or psychedellic mushrooms was listed with the exact potency, chemical content and characteristics as well as all potential risks. Some stores had small lounges in the back stocked with incense and picture books.
The koffieshops I investigated ran the gamut from seedy underground dives to quiet and pleasant airy street-level establishments — they all do sell coffee, anyhow — but no alcohol. The strains of weed available were presented like a wine list, with variety names displayed next to a series of smiley faces indicating their characteristics. A joint costs about $3.75 USD.
Late at night I saw a crowd gathering around the front window of a pub: just inside were about seven raucous French or Italian men, all wearing surreal Mr. Bean masks and posing for photos by the streetwalkers below. I walked into a club filled with blacklight and guys and girls with glow-painted faces. Heavy fog was provided by the abundance of assorted smoke. It could have been a music video. At midnight I followed a crowd of “Woo girls” away from the center of town towards where I’d left my bike (it’s impossible to cycle in the tourist district). All wore matching pink tutus and pink and black striped socks. There were several open bottles of wine and liquor between them and they would periodically rally to shriek “WOOOOOO” while doodling over the sidewalks like bees through a field. Street performers, cafe-diners and other pedestrians would WOOOO back, or playfully swerve towards them.
The best part of my just-over-24 hours in Amsterdam was my late night bike ride out to my hostel. The tourist clots disappeared once free from the Red Light district, although chatter from isolated cafes and clubs wafted from the buildings. I rode along the Amstel on a bricked bike path. It was, like every other bicycling experience here, supremely flat and smooth. I cruised along silently, the clamor and stimulation of the perpetual tourist party fuzzing to white noise as I contemplated the stern facades of buildings now bathed in flat orange lamplight. The river was smooth and black and the barges were moored until morning. The night air was cool so long as I maintained some speed, and I saw more pedestrians than cars in the shadowy black and orange side streets. I began to imagine the mode of transportation suitable for this dream-world Amsterdam and found I was at a loss — nothing short of boats piloted through the air, animated serpentine dragons and other space-bending means seemed appropriate. It was a still, and magical time and I felt like any number of impossible things could happen in such an environment.
Morning breaks over Amsterdam and I’m unsure of what I’ll do. The rain is on “soak” setting outside and it strikes me as appropriate weather for this land of heavy black bicycles, heavy black rivers, heavy black boats and heavy, precariously forward-drooping black buildings. The desperation of yesterday’s fight to secure housing and maintain personal space is behind me: after the otherworldly spectacle of Midnight Amsterdam I slept heavily in an unexpectedly dark, quiet and clean location. Unfortunately my quest for good breakfast leads me inevitably to a tourist cafe. The Low Countries do not go out for breakfast. The streets are deserted until about noon, and I use the solitude to poke around residential neighborhoods. Their canals are swollen with fresh rain. Wisteria was made for a black brick facade in such an environment. I drift like a balloon on the breeze into the city’s little Tulip Museum. It feels homemade despite its slick graphics, and is very apparently curated by people who geek out about rare tulips in the same way that others might revere rare birds or cars. The section on wild tulips makes a compelling case for visiting Kazakhstan… a very compelling case. On the street I pass a squinty-eyed guy in a marijuana-leaf print windbreaker and sweatpants, leaning against the rail of a canal bridge and providing apparently unhelpful information to his girlfriend, who is staring blankly at the screen of a phone.
There’s a postcard of some of the city’s graffiti: the iconic portrait of Anne Frank in black and white, bedecked with a colored hipster scarf. My interpretation of the artist’s message is that if she were around today, she’d be invited to be a part of their crew. I wonder when some of the buildings will finally slump over into the street, when the city stopped being a major port, so many questions unanswered as a result of my own lack of research. I head to the city library, a great five or six-storied structure on the waterfront with the best view of the historic city (all skyscrapers are relegated to the outskirts). The library is an awesome building, with creative, modern architecture, fun reading nooks with curtains and space-age chairs, art installations and interpretive material. Some books are in Dutch, others in English. There is an installation about a proposed plan to renovate the downtown historic district. Amsterdam fears “The Venice Syndrome”: having a downtown economy so reliant on tourists that there is no longer means for residents to survive. They reference New York (never forgoing an opportunity to mention that originally it was New Amsterdam) as a city that is modern, vital and still remains a tourist destination. I admire the city’s fight to reclaim its downtown. On my way out I’m interviewed by several schoolgirls who claim to be doing a project for their English class. They tell me some riddles whose punchlines are somewhat lost in translation. I pass a flock of tourists, mesmerized by a tiny 3D printer at work in a shop window. I consider the myriad other technologies and symbols of progress that have been on display in these shops since the construction of the city. Perhaps there is a future for this place not entirely rooted in its past.
Lessons learned:
-You can’t wait til day-of to book a Couchsurfer destination or a hostel on a weekend.
-When things start going wrong in an unfamiliar environment, eat something. Or have a coffee. Or both.
-Don’t second guess expenditures once they’ve been made.
-Research the cost of getting to and from your destination and adjust your expectations of further costs from that number.
-Being alone and female invites lots of attention from strangers. In other places this has been fine, but in Amsterdam I felt like I could get lost down a crack in the crowded tourist party. Related: If you think you might want to do anything edgy, bring someone else.
-Either research the good spots in advance or go on the advice of others… but do one. Especially for areas with cultural significance (as compared to just wilderness significance, which I’d argue is more amenable to uninformed interpretation).
Under what conditions would I return to Amsterdam?
-At night, especially at night in the snow for the aesthetic experience
-If I could avoid the crowded Red Light District unless friends and I had explicit plans to be there
-If I’d read some more history, particularly literature, about the somber maritime town
-If I had a map of the anonymous sculpturework squirreled away around the city, and other hidden treasures.
Honestly, you might be better off with Gent. Older, less somber, same amount of bikes and almost as many canals, but no herds of tourists and instead, a vital city. No pot either, but eyyy. Perhaps I too am learning to appreciate the shadow of the local steeple.

If you are at all familiar with Amsterdam you’ll know that one of the main sources of transportation is the bicycle. Whether you’ve been there yourself, or seen it in movies and TV shows, bicycles are one of the main characters of the city.
If you are a pedestrian, as you wander the streets it’s quite a feat to stay out of the way of those who are on two wheels. It is not always easy.
Thankfully they have bells on their bikes and they are not afraid to use them!
As a photographer, the bikes make it easy to find little scenes within the areas you wander. They make a great subject and help tell the story of Amsterdam in your photos.

From the end of March to the beginning of April, I was on a business trip to the company’s headquarters in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
The first week was primarily to attend the company event, and the second week was to get trainings. Besides the fixed agenda, there was almost always something cool that kept me busy.
In this article, I will share the highlights of the trip.
At the company event, there were multiple sessions where peers from each team went up on the stage to present their team’s updates and insights.
Not only was it a great opportunity for new joiners like myself to get a holistic understanding of the company, but it was also almost shocking how excellent of public speakers they all were.
During my stay, I challenged myself to go out with someone I don’t know every day after work (and completed the challenge).
When the company and industry is growing so fast, I feel inclusivity and knowing who to reach out to for the right information play a crucial role in assisting one’s performance.
Starting my stay as Europe switched to the summer time clocks, I enjoyed watching the sun rise in the morning from my 5th-floor hotel room.
The lines of brick houses and a spider web of waterway that runs in-between the lines gave such exotic vibes.
One Thursday after work, my colleagues and I decided to take a ride into a forest. We rented a bike by the central station and got on the way for about an hour.
I have two things to say about the dutch bikes. One — I was not expecting to back-pedal for brakes so it took me a moment to learn how to stop without causing a scene. Two — they are not Asian-legs friendly. After lowering the seat as far as it allowed, I was still tiptoeing to reach the pedals.
After the hour ride, we arrived at the park with full of cherry blossom.
As I was expecting to miss the cherry blossom season in my hometown Tokyo, it was certainly a pleasant surprise.
The morning after I landed in Amsterdam, I visited a CrossFit box near one of the headquarter offices. As such an exercise is becoming a key in my productive days, it was important that I find a place in Amsterdam as well.
Except, some pieces of the equipment were made so tall for me (like the bars for pull ups) that I could not reach without placing a box to step on. That was embarrassing.
It is an honor to be introduced to such an intelligent and generous group of people. The fact that I am in a place that allows me to learn from them and grow together with them brings nothing but pure excitement and motivation.
It was merely my 6th week in at the company, however, the company has made me feel welcome. I am excited to be part of their journey!

I already wrote a piece about the tourism industry in Amsterdam and how it’s completely out of control. So, my first recommendation is to definitely go to other Dutch cities if you can. However, I’m still torn by the fact that I love my adopted city and hope that others can experience and fall in love with it in much the same way that I did.
Most tourists never go out of the Center (Centraal) area of Amsterdam. While there are certainly cool canals, beautiful architecture, and a ton of historical monuments, the Center is just one small part of the incredibly varied tapestry that is this beautiful city.
So, if you absolutely HAVE to visit Amsterdam, consider easing the tourism crisis by finding a hotel in or exploring one of these areas.
My absolute favorite area of Amsterdam. Green is the operative word here as there are trees and parks EVERYWHERE! Go to Oosterpark, with a huge open green space, some interesting sculptures, and the National Slavery Monument (commemorating the end of slavery in the Netherlands). Oh, it’s also right behind the Tropenmuseum (Tropical Museum), which was originally created to showcase and educate Amsterdammers on The Netherlands’ colonial properties overseas but has been turned into a way for the Dutch to grapple with and better understand this bloody history. It’s definitely not perfect but they’re trying much harder than a number of other museums (*cough* British Museum *cough*).
Also in Amsterdam Oost is the Dappermarkt, one of the several excellent outdoor markets around Amsterdam. It’s open Tuesday — Saturday and has delicious food, clothing, and just about anything you could ever want with some really good prices.
De Plantage is a set of islands perched between Amsterdam Oost and Centraal. It’s notable for the beautiful architecture, trees and parks everywhere, as well as HORTUS and ARTIS. HORTUS is the Royal Botanical Gardens and has a great collection. Honestly, while ARTIS is nice, unless you have kids, there are much better (and cheaper) zoos to go visit in other cities.
This area is definitely one of the most underexplored AND undervalued parts of Amsterdam. Think Brooklyn before it got overly gentrified (but it’s on its way…). Noord used to be considered a working-class area, with shipyards, docks, and factories. In the second half of the 20th Century much of that industry began to move out, especially as Amsterdam moved from being a regional town to a world-class city. Eventually, Amsterdam figured out that there was a huge underdeveloped area just north of Central Station (which makes it a great place to stay when you’re visiting *hint hint*). Today, you can still see remnants of that history, as most of the industrial areas were repurposed to house various enterprises.
While you won’t see any historic canal houses, this side of Amsterdam showcases the ‘alternative, counter-culture’ heritage that the city is known for. Notable things to see are the Boatel, a cruise ship fully repurposed as a hotel, Cafe De Ceuvel, a start-up eco village made of old houseboats, working to clean up a former boatyard and promote environmentalism, and the monthly flea market at NDSM Wharf.
The De Pijp district of Amsterdam was originally known for being like Amsterdam Noord is now, working-class homes and businesses that eventually gentrified. Except, that’s already fully happened now. De Pijp is fully 100% gentrified. Not to say that there aren’t fun things to do, just that you’re going to find about 3 gluten-free, vegan, holistic, non-GMO jackfruit pulled pork/burger places for about every person who lives there. There is so much dining but often at slightly higher prices (and more Americanized) than what you’ll usually pay in other areas of Amsterdam.
The big star attraction of De Pijp is the Albert Cuypmarkt, the largest outdoor market in Amsterdam. This is the big one and it is super-impressive. Weekdays are mostly vendors selling tourist things but Saturday is the best day for a visit, with real Amsterdammers coming to do their shopping.
Other fun things to do include taking a load off in Sarphatipark, one of Amsterdam’s most impressive parks, heading to the Heineken Experience to see the original brewery, or walking over to Museumplein to visit the Van Gogh or Rijksmuseum (book tickets ahead of time). Ok, technically Museumplein isn’t in De Pijp but it’s right next door so I’m counting it.
This area is characterized by big, old 19th century warehouses, lovingly restored to become housing/event space/bars, etc. This entire area used to be for loading and unloading all kinds of cargo ships, especially once Amsterdam Central Station was built, which changed some of the harbor space.
Stop by De Gooyer, one of the few windmills still located within the Amsterdam city limits and have a drink next door at Brouwerij ‘t IJ, the first microbrewery in Amsterdam. Located in a converted bathhouse, its logo is an ostrich with a large egg, which is a Dutch pun. IJ (pronounced like ai) is a well-known river in Amsterdam which also sounds like ei, the Dutch word for egg.
Also while you’re here, take a stroll down Czaar Peterstraat, a beautiful tree-lined boulevard with cute shops and fun places to stop. It’s one of my favorite streets because it’s just so peaceful, you can’t believe you’re still in Amsterdam.
In the summer, walk down to the Marineterrein. Part Dutch naval base, part public access swimming pool, this area is one of the more interesting areas in the city. While part of the Marineterrein is a fully-functioning military base (DO NOT TRESPASS!), a small part has been opened up along the water. Signs are very clear and gates are incredibly obvious. You can enter from the south entrance at Kattenburgerstraat or from the north entrance at the Kommandantsbrug (near Mediamatic). Come for one of the closest areas to Centraal where you can both swim and grab food/drinks at the conveniently-located bar. Definitely a hidden gem.
Anyway, that’s all I have for right now! Stay tuned for more travel tips and please consider helping to ease the Amsterdam tourism crisis by staying or visiting these other areas of town!

Amsterdam is a gorgeous city with beautiful canals and architecture. I was lucky enough to explore it this summer with my mom and my grandparents.
When my mom and I arrived, we took a taxi to the hotel. It was a Tesla. The driver said that soon, most taxis in Amsterdam would be Teslas, to help the environment. We checked in at the Pulitzer hotel, which was made up of 6 canal houses.
The first thing we did was walk around. The Pulitzer was situated on a canal, near the city center, so there was lots to see. First, we visited the Tulip Museum. Tulips used to be a very valuable item in the Netherlands. The best tulips could be sold for almost as much as a house!
Then we stopped for a snack at Pancakes. Amsterdam. Dutch pancakes were kind of like French crepes. They were delicious. After our pancakes, we walked back to the hotel and asked for directions to Momo, a sushi restaurant. It was a 2o minute walk. We had sushi and steamed fish for dinner.
The next day we did the Flowers of Amsterdam Tour with Hanneke. We went to a flower factory and saw flowers being carried away for auctioning and exportation. Next we went to a rose grower. There were rows of roses and each of them smelled fantastic. There were also lots of animals. Fish and turtles in a pond, chickens, and kittens.
After, we went to the town of Haarlem and explored. We had lunch and went to the oldest science museum in the Netherlands. When we got back, we met my grandparents and had delicious Thai food for dinner.
At 10:00am the next day, we had a small group tour about Jewish history. It was pretty long and not very fun, in my opinion. It was a lot of lecturing from our tour guide. We learned a lot, but it was boring. Then late in the afternoon, we went on a boat for a tour of the canals. It was relaxing and enjoyable.
We had another tour with Hanneke at the Rijksmuseum, an art museum. We saw a variety of different painting from different artists, the highlight being the Night Watch, by Rembrandt. We ate lunch at the Rijksmuseum. Then we were supposed to take a painting class but they switched the location on us and we couldn’t make it.
Then we took the tram to the The Royal Concertgebouw and saw the Robeco Jazzclub show. It was my first Jazz show and I thought it was pretty good. We had Chinese food for dinner at Chang-i.
The next day we went relaxed and went shopping at the 9 streets. We didn’t really do much.
In the early morning, we did a photo shoot on the streets of Amsterdam. It was fun and we got great pictures. Next we went to the Anne Frank House. It was amazing how they hid for so long in such a tiny space. Then at night, we went back to the Concertgebouw and saw a string quartet. They did cool things with their instruments and had a dog machine and lights.
The next day was the Amsterdam Pride Parade. It went on for hours. Boats on the canal paraded by filled with crowds of people dressed up and flourishing signs. The horde of people watching screamed and shouted. It was chaotic.
The next day, we went to Schiphol Airport and flew home.

As beautiful as the view of Amsterdam’s canals with the beautiful brick houses around them is, they cause many problems regarding mobility. The narrow alleyways alongside the small canals have only one lane, which leads to traffic jams. A mixture of commuter and delivery traffic, as well as crowds of tourists, quickly congest the picturesque alleyways. The consequences are far-reaching: In a study by the environmental organization Milieudefensie, the European limit for nitrogen oxide was exceeded on no fewer than four roads in Amsterdam in 2016. On the street Stadhouderskade, which runs right through the city, they measured the highest value across the country.
Since then, the city of Amsterdam implemented various projects to tackle the problem including new regulations and the switch to electric mobility.
The title of the initiative “Amsterdam electric” shows as simple as clearly where the city is heading in the coming years. Amsterdam is already recognized as a bicycle city and is now set to become a global figurehead for electric mobility. The purchase of electric cars has been subsidized for years now, along with a steadily growing network of charging points (already the best in the world according to the Urban Mobility Index) and a change in the type of engine in taxi and delivery traffic.
Especially for taxis, Amsterdam wants to become a European role model for electric mobility. Currently, 650 e-taxis are already on the roads, which corresponds to a share of 16 percent — and the trend is rising. Anyone who wants to spontaneously drive electrically through the streets of Amsterdam can use one of the 350 electric cars from car-sharing provider Share Now. By the way, the switch to electric drives applies equally to land and water: by 2025, all gasoline and diesel-powered boats are to be banned in the city center.
Eventually, the plan is not limited to the drive of the cars, but to reduce the private cars on the street in general. Bit by bit they will disappear from the cityscape. Currently, 1,500 parking spaces are being removed annually until 2025 and will be used to widen sidewalks, create more green spaces or make more space for bicycles. Be it for cycle paths or for bicycle parking lots, which the bicycle city always lacks. After all, there are streets in Amsterdam which have ten times more cars than bicycles.
Just under 60 percent of Amsterdam’s residents ride their bicycles every day and take advantage of the excellent infrastructure that already exists. But here too, growth demands new measures. Over the past 20 years, the proportion of cyclists in the city has risen by a proud 40 percent. To ensure that the Dutch capital can continue to live up to its reputation as a cycling city, the network of cycle paths is constantly being expanded and improved. In addition, in the near future, the construction of large-scale cycle paths across the city will make cycling even more attractive as an alternative to the car, even for longer distances.
In comparison to other metropolises, however, you will look in vain for stationless bikes and e-scooters in Amsterdam for spontaneous app rental. They are simply prohibited. On the one hand, the traffic in the narrow alleys along the canals probably does not get along too well with badly parked bikes and scooters. Additionally, the authorities are afraid that those rental bikes and scooters will be found in the water as it happened in Paris.
The most important part of public transport in Amsterdam is the tram, which runs through the city on 14 lines and a total of 200 kilometers of track. The number 2 line, which has been described by National Geographic as one of the most beautiful tram lines in the world, has recently gained particular prominence. For more than 110 years, the tram has been running along the main artery of the city, connecting the top sights of Amsterdam. If at some point you get aching muscles after extensive testing of the cycle paths, you only need a day ticket and you can treat yourself to the full Amsterdam experience.
Markus Herrmann is a blogger, author and member of the successful podcast “Gästeliste Geisterbahn”. For Porsche, he is testing the mobility level of the Back 2 Tape metropolises in Europe.
The project “Back 2 Tape” is a cooperation between the Porsche Newsroom and music journalist Niko Backspin. It follows the tracks of hip hop in Europe. All further information on this project can be found in the Porsche Newsroom.
An important note: Markus’ trip through Europe as well as “Back 2 Tape” were produced before the outbreak of COVID-19. Porsche, Backspin and the involved agencies and artists are aware of their social responsibility and advise against such a trip at this time out of consideration for the health and well-being of all people.

The first time I saw Amsterdam, like most people, I got swept away in a sea of touristic elements. I couldn’t see past them. I didn’t know how.
I’m not alone in that. Many people never get to know the true Amsterdam, the city that build the tourism, and that is now being transformed by its own creation.
The historical city center and the areas in its direct vicinity are being transformed to serve the economic needs of this particular demographic: shops, hotels, airbnb’s and bars. Unfortunately due to the steep rise in prices, local producers are relocating or closing their doors as big name brands are sweeping in depersonalizing the character that started it all.
Some say this is bad, others say this is the natural order of things. The city is evolving based on the present social, cultural and economic developments and we must embrace that. Either way, for the time being, there are still enough elements of the original character to be discovered and experienced.
To make it clear, when I talk about the original character of the city, I am referring to more than just historical elements. There are many newer developments or redevelopments of the past that preserve the creative, bold, artistic, outspoken yet intimate character of the city.
So how did I finally meet Amsterdam? By volunteering for Open Monumentendag Amsterdam, in English: Amsterdam Heritage Days.
European Heritage Days is a cultural event that takes place in 50 countries across Europe. For the two days of the second weekend of September, an impressive number of monuments open their doors to the general public. Some, such as museums or cultural institutions, are indeed accessible also throughout the rest of the year. However a large number of them, such as private homes or offices are open to the public only during this particular event.
In The Netherlands, the event is called Open Monumentendag and it is a really big affair, both for the organisation as well as for the ever growing audience. Each city organizes events, tours and lectures. Massive numbers of volunteers participate every year in order to make sure each location is taken care of and, my favorite thing ever, many children participate as junior guides providing visitors with beautiful explanations. The only downside, for my point of view is that as a volunteer you only get to see that one city. To see another one, I’d have to give up volunteering for that year or choose to help another city.
I have been part of this amazing project for a couple of years now. It is one of my most favorite weekends of the year and it has provided me with a few special moments. The first time I participated I was rather afraid to go out there and deal with the crowds, so I opted for the desk role. Half way through the weekend we ended up one person short, so I had to get out there. The very moment that turned things around and jolted me to see the beauty of the event was when I arrived at one of the big locations in the center of the city. At the entrance of the monument the line was … big. Really big! There wasn’t any way for me to pass through and get to the organizers inside. So I stopped. And as I stood there, unsure of how to proceed further, some of the people noticed my T-shirt (we all get special T-shirts to show we are part of the event). The news spread and in a matter of seconds the entire row moved one step to the right so I could pass. After the initial shock and surprise, I felt rather cocky about it! My very own 15 minutes of fame. Ha! Ha! Ha! But in all seriousness, that showed me how people feel about this event and the level of interaction that is attained despite the fact that most visitors don’t know one another.
As a tourist one often ends up thinking that the center of the city is the most representative image. And while it is full of architectural and historical treasures, Amsterdam is much more complex than that. A city is made by its people. A city expresses itself through its people and their expression and implicitly through its residential and public areas. Touristic locations have a tendency to drown the local spirit. So the way to understand a city is to go further and search for unadulterated local life and surroundings. Now, Amsterdam itself as a major touristic and international hub has by now integrated some of its internationality in its layers. Thus its local flavor is a rather unique one.
My personal experience includes discovering neighborhoods of Amsterdam School architecture of an extraordinary charm, a luxury lounge of royal class at Amsterdam Central, a large variety of Art Deco, treasures hidden in plain sight, a cat cafe (Bonus. Not part of the event.), an amazing array of windows, giving directions to an American tourist who comes to the event on a yearly basis, walking through the narrowest passage in the city and so much more!
The personal experience of discovering a city outside of standard tourism adds to the connections and memories we make. And so, you should have your own story of meeting a city and that should ideally happen in your own time and style. That is why I have no plan for you, no instructions and no list of fancy museums to see. I will leave you however, a few of the places that surprised me and their experience.
The Crane Building
The Crane Building might sound like a modern exuberance, but the crane has been there since 1957. It is the only crane to have survived the Second World War bombings.
It is now famous for the three story apartment that can be rented for quite the price. It has made the news more than once, for more than being an interesting sightseeing point and it has a truly amazing view.
The apartment is an interesting experience. Though I would not recommend it during cold times as some of the circulation between floors is external and the steps are not for the fainted heart. It is also surprisingly spacious particularly when compared to the matchboxes presently advertised due to the high demand during this housing crisis.
The Mercatorbuurt
Probably the most impactful element for me, as an architect, was the unexpected combination of elegance and cosines of the architectural style Amsterdam School. Neighborhoods such as the Mercatorbuurt aren’t your usual touristic attractions. There are no weird or famous museums. There are however incredible details and hidden elements in every facade.
I’ve been rediscovering in many of my recent trips the impressive level of craftsmanship in brick work that older Dutch architecture had reached. The more I look at new and modern facades, the more I wonder how did that get lost. And ironically I already know the answer. Budget wise it is much easier to build a plain facade than to actually create an intricate brick design on its facade. But how much did we lose in terms of character and beauty? Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m not advocating discarding modern architecture. I believe however, that reviving and adapting this traditional element can only be beneficial for present time Dutch architecture.
The Elephant Ally
De Oliphantsgang, in English, The Elephant Ally is a narrow path between two buildings leading to The Golden Tulip. I know, it’s just a small and narrow alley. But I really loved the fancy name, the unassuming door, the texture of the walls as well as the surprise of the interior garden on the other side.
The Golden Tulip is the name of the house found on the location of the oldest brick house in Amsterdam. Due to its bad condition, the house has been disassembled and completely rebuilt in 1993. It presently houses the National Musical Instruments Fund, known for the fact that it gives talented musicians the possibility to loan high quality musical instruments.
Amsterdam Noord
I jumped over the “pond” to meet Amsterdam Nood (Amsterdam North) for the very first time in my third year as a volunteer. Presently, the only way to get there is a ferry, travelling on a strict schedule and at a fast pace. No worry though, they are working on it.
Many cities developed on the line of a river have first made use of one side and only moved across once new buildings would have been located too far from the center. So, I assumed, I’m sorry Amsterdam! that was also the case of Amsterdam and that its northern area was a rather new development with recent architecture. Boy, was I wrong! It is full of old, beautiful, brick, cozy, intimate architecture.
Tuinpark Buitenzorg
The oldest allotment park in the city Tuinpark Buitenzorg forms together with its neighboring forest W.H. Vliegenbos, an important ecological zone rich in biodiversity.
Compared to other allotment parks that I have visited, this one had a completely different character. The explosion of vertical green meant each plot was a little bit of a surprise. Every little house had its own personality and all the plots were carefully maintained.
Unfortunately the waiting list for such a lovely piece of nature is at the moment 15 years.
This article is not sponsored. It is a summary of my experience as a volunteer for several years. If you’d like to know more about the Amsterdam event and and keep current with its details you can do so either on the main website or on their Facebook page. Similarly you can find pages for the event taking place in other cities around The Netherlands as well as in 50 other countries across Europe.

3 different trips of varying lengths, right from 4 hours to 7 days has given me a good insight into this amazingly vibrant city.
For all those thinking this post is gonna be about the coffee shops, red light district and other decadence that this city has come to be known for, I would suggest you head else where. In my eyes, the city is so much more than the chaos of Dam Square, the drunken debauchery at Leidseplein or the feverish squeals of teenage boys at seeing the red light district for the first time. Don’t get me wrong, those areas are not to be missed and do head out into town and hop into the nearest bar to down your glass of the Dutch Genever but then make sure to uncover the actual appeal of the city too.
So here are my top things to do in Amsterdam.
This is the best advice I received a couple of years back from a friend. If you truly want to explore the city and get a feel for it, there’s no better way than to actually experience living in it. I’ve spent time in 2 different hostels, an Airbnb apartment, and a Hotel at Amsterdam in various neighborhoods and if I had one single advice to give to anyone heading to Amsterdam, this would be it. Do not, by any given means, no matter what it takes, stay in the center of town. The center is buzzing with people from all across the world, the vibe is electric, the feel amazing and the experience… well, not exactly Amsterdam. Unless you want to see 10 groups of men celebrating their bros last few days as a bachelor by dressing him up in a frock.
If you get the chance, stay just outside the center. The city is not large and is very well connected by trams and the metro. You can easily find an amazing hotel or apartment in areas like Jordaan, De Pjip or even Amsterdam Noord (a 5 min ferry ride away). Every neighborhood has something different to offer and you can choose your stay based on your interests. The iAmsterdam website gives a quick look at the various neighborhoods here
One of my favorite ways to chill in Amsterdam is to just sit by the canals and watch the city at work. Every canal has something different to offer, few are used extensively for transport, while some others are used by the tourist boats and some others are used just for the houseboats. None the less the canals are extremely calming and you can get to learn a lot of the cities nuances through them.
Some of my favorite places in Amsterdam are also right next to the canals. Check out Waterkant (Outdoor 1 on map) if you are looking for a great place to spend the evening with a couple of beers and some great company.
A visit to Amsterdam is incomplete without a visit to the flower market (Experiences -4 on map). If you have spent any amount of time in the city you would already know of their obsession with plants. Every house has a myriad of blooms popping out from every window and balcony. Even the boats are usually covered with tons of potted plants and it does not stop there. Once you enter the houses, restaurants, hotels or even a pub, you are sure to find a plant on your table or next to your bedside.
I absolutely adore the country for this obsession and make it a point to spend some time at the flower market. Though a little touristy and overpriced compared to some of the other shops I have found in smaller markets and towns, it is a great place for anyone to take in the diversity that the city has to offer in terms of people, plants, culture and even food. From tiny succulents to age old Bonsais, you can find it here.
If you are visiting during the spring, the market will be filled with Tulips of every single color imaginable. Trust me when I say this, it can cause a color overload and you with thank the gods that the sky is dull and dreary.
Not visiting in the spring, you can still pick up Tulip buds to take home with you. Unlike the Tulip mania period when a single bulb could sell for millions, these bulbs are quite reasonable and from what I’ve heard through friends, have a pretty decent success rate. Make sure your country allows you to carry them in though. The shopkeepers usually know the rules for most countries, just ask.
If you have time, visit Keukenhof gardens but only if you can deal with crowds and haven’t blinded yourself with all the color yet.
The garden is open to visitors only during the Tulip festival which lasts a couple of months and the team takes an entire year to landscape and maintain the gardens for this showing. You will be amazed by the variety of Tulips and other flowers showcased here. Be sure to get there early to avoid the crowds and carry some food, the stores there can be a bit pricey.
If you are lucky and visit at the right time, the tulip fields close to Keukenhof are supposed to be breathtaking. We were ready to get away from the crowds and the overdose of beauty and therefore decided to skip out on the fields that were almost bare by the time we got there.
Amsterdam is filled with great choices for food. Being a tourist hotspot you can find every type of food and drink that you would want. Here’s a quick list of Do’s and Don’t that I would suggest.
Check my recommendations for places to eat on the map.
The city is filled with amazing architecture, beautiful bridges, and stunning museums. Keep your eyes open, you will be amazed by what the city has to offer. A stroll through the city will take you past some of the prettiest sights you would have seen in ages.
Amsterdam has quickly become one of my favorite places to visit due to the huge variety of experiences it offers. This post is far from complete and just a quick look at the city. Hopefully to be followed up with more.

Traveling has always been a big part of my life, especially now living in Ireland — All European countries are “literally” a quick flight away!
We went for a quick getaway, arriving on a Thursday evening and leaving on a Sunday morning. Two full days was all it took to fall in love, of course, the amazing sunny weather contributed. However, the diversity of people walking around, mixed with the thriving culture only made exploring the streets that much more exciting.
Skipping all museums on this trip but one (we ain’t got no money…and we’ll be back), day one started with a free walking tour hosted by local Dutch guides. Unaware of just how educational and fun the tour was going to be, time flew by as we learned about the history of Amsterdam. All our trips will now begin with walking tours — they gave us the BEST advice on what to do and what to see. Such as the difference between Coffeeshops and Cafes! (important information as tourists, people!)
For lunch, we attempted following the directions we received from our tour guide and ended up finding the best little place for the famous Dutch cone fries.

There is so much more to Amsterdam than coffee shops and the red light district, yet for some reason people still come to the city and barely scratch the surface! With affordable flights from Europe and soon a three-hour train from London, Amsterdam is more accessible than ever. Even after living in the Netherlands for half a year, I still feel like there is so much more to see, but hopefully this guide will give you a few off-the-beaten-track ideas.
Friday evening: You’ve stepped off the plane from your after-work-flight, and have dropped your bags at your boatstay on the canals of Dam, now you’re hungry and eager to get out and about. Luckily, a unique ramen experience awaits you: Men Impossible. You need to book in advance, because Atsushi, the guy who owns, cooks, hosts, serves and entertains this fine establishment, doesn’t want guests to feel rushed, so limits the amount of covers per evening. This little restaurant is beautifully decorated, with one large, communal table that encourages conversation and connection.
Friday drinks: You’re full of delicious ramen, and feel like a nightcap. This is where you want to avoid the raucous tourists and just chill out with some locals. Cafe Gollem is one such place, offering a selection of 200 different beers with a great, relaxed atmosphere and real, Dutch patrons.
Saturday morning: Wake up, grab a coffee and a bagel, and head into Dam square for the free walking tour! The people who take you really love doing their job, and the tour is fun, informative and touches on a great array of historical moments in Amsterdam’s history.
Saturday lunch: After the tour, you might want to eat something a little more refined than the chips (save those for later), and what better way to warm yourself up than a delightfully spicy Indonesian lunch at Sampurna? Opposite the flower market, the decor is dark and cosy, with statues and shell decorations that tinkle while you eat traditional food that reminds you what a rich and diverse society Amsterdam really is.
Saturday Afternoon: Walking off your meal through the flower market and enjoying the tulips and bulbs, you feel like doing something a bit different. How about visiting a cat sanctuary, on a boat? In the 1960’s, Mrs v. Weelde acquired a barge opposite her apartment, and filled it with the cat’s she’d been rescuing for years. Now you can visit it and stroke the cats, learn about their mission and donate some food or toys for the resident felines!
Saturday Dinner: Get yourself over to Taste Before You Waste, for a donation based, food-waste dinner that will nourish your body and soul. The philosophy is simple: they save food that would otherwise have been dumped, and turn it into a delicious dinner that you pay as much as you are able for. The money raised goes to continuing their efforts and improving food education.
Saturday Evening: Time to go back to the boat stay, have a disco nap and get ready for a big night out. There are some great bars where you can drink and bars where you can dance, but if you’re looking to party, head to de School and literally lose yourself on the dry-ice filled dance floors until the early morning. It has a random door policy so don’t be deterred if you see people in the queue being turned away, just be cool, calm and polite, and you’re sure to make it.
Sunday Brunch: You’re probably feeling pretty tired from last night, so ease yourself into the day with brunch at Pluk: the food is Instagram worthy, not too busy and has a calming, monochrome decor that will keep you grounded until you’ve got some food in you.
Sunday Afternoon: You’ve filled your tummy and you’re ready to explore a bit of culture before you leave. Jump on the train and a bus to Zaanse Schans to see some real life windmills that are still sawing wood, crushing spices and grinding flour. Walk around the reclaimed land and feed the goats and chickens, taste cheese and hot chocolate in the little village and get some great pictures of old Dutch life. Each of the working mills offers a guided tour and little museums which tell you about their history and modern-day purpose.
A whirlwind weekend in Amsterdam that has hopefully shown you a few different sights to the ones you saw when you were inter railing at eighteen. I hope you enjoyed your trip!

We finally made it into Amsterdam on a typically blustery, cold and drizzly Dutch day. We tried to keep our expectations low—not because of the magnificent city, but because we were traveling with a two-year-old and an almost-4-year-old. For those of you who’ve done this, or anything like it, you already know it’s the kind of thing you set low expectations for. For those of you who haven’t done it or don’t have kids, now you know.
And ultimately, it was indeed a modest little visit. Just the sort of thing we were hoping for, really. We got a very reasonably priced room at the Rho Hotel right off Dam Square, which is about as good a location as can be got, unless you count the proximity to the Red Light District, which is itself really only a problem when you’re traveling with the aforementioned young children.
Our room was tiny but full of amazing light (more on that below) and otherwise really cute. If you wind up needing a room in the middle of Amsterdam, try room 216 at the Rho and you won’t be disappointed.
Cat was able to make the visit productive by picking up a terrific new backdrop at a local photography shop. We started the next day (after the Rho’s entirely satisfying free breakfast) with a boat ride around Amsterdam’s infinite network of canals. I was amazed by how fun and interesting this ride was. It made me reflect on (and rethink) how dedicated I am to avoiding “touristy” things on my visits to European cities because…why? because I don’t want to be designated a “tourist?” Because I think it’s in some way beneath me?
I’ve been to Amsterdam many times and had never even considered taking one of these tours before. I want to do it all the time now. It’s pretty, relaxing, and edifying all at once. Especially so in this instance as we basically had the whole boat to ourselves.
That was pretty much our trip’s designated activity—we’re keeping expectations low, remember (and as I write that I realize how absurd it is to characterize a boat trip throughout Amsterdam’s canals as reflecting low expectations). The rest of our time was spent walking around—including a walk to the Rijksmuseum (but not a visit inside), and dinners at the Bier Fabriek, and Cafe van Kerkwijk, both a short walk down Nes Street from our hotel. (Both restaurants are heartily recommended, but especially Cafe van Kerkwijk).
By the next morning, the long advertised foul weather was finally upon us and we headed more or less straight for Amsterdam Centraal and a train back to Leiden (and a bus back to Wassenaar). Verdict: the trip was a success! After we got home, we headed over for a visit to the apartment of Harry Reis and Ellen Nakhnikian for a fun little dinner party. The party confirmed what I have always thought: Cold, shitty weather is a fine prelude to good friends, good food, and good beer.
Have I mentioned that the weather has been cold and shitty? It’s mostly okay with me, actually, because it’s also been beautiful. Seriously, riding home after picking up Veronica yesterday, the sky was Wagnerian.
Tonight, we all watched a short documentary on the common belief of artists all over the world—for centuries—that there is something unique about “Dutch light”—that the Dutch sky is so full of moisture (which causes a lot of refraction), so open by the flat landscape, and so saturated with water all over the place (which reflects a lot of light back up to the sky), that it’s just different than other places.
Without having seen this documentary, and in at least one previous blog post, I have felt certain that something like this was going on. There is a strange beauty here that is hard to compare to other places, and I like it.
Even so, my documentary on the Netherlands wouldn’t be about the Dutch light so much as the Dutch wind, which is fierce, hard to predict, and, when it does strike, unrelenting. For the first time in my life I have had to pull my bike over and rest for a while because of a murderous headwind. Pedaling in a way that can only be described as pathetic, I could barely break walking speed and was growing exhausted besides, so I gave up for a while, watched the world blowing by, walked on a little, sang a song to my girl.
In these moments, I have found an odd little crutch that I use to get myself—and my kids, when they are on the bike with me—through it. None of us likes it when the wind gets that bad, and there is a temptation to really, really hate the experience. All of which can, I’ve found, be kept at bay by singing an old John Denver song called, appropriately enough, Windsong. This song was on an album we had when I was a kid, and good or bad, its lyrics and tune are practically carved onto my brain. The trick, in making the Dutch wind a little more bearable when it is peeling the skin off your face, is to sing this song at the top of your lungs, shoutingly, angrily, like the words are weapons for fighting the elemental forces threatening to sweep you away. Approaching the song the way Denver does would be ridiculous under these circumstances. And of course, we only sing it at all when the wind is really bad.

I’ve visited many cities, but few ignite and fire up the genetic glitch that pushes me to look through the viewfinder more than when in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The city has inspired generations of artists of all kinds. Today is no different.
I’ve literally stood on streets, turned 360 degrees, and seen something I’d like to photograph at every angle. Amsterdam is a photographers Disneyland, Super Model, World Series Champ, and Christmas Morning all rolled into one.. and she likes her photo taken!!!
Some of my favorite days have been those just wondering around the streets of this amazing city with just my camera and time to get lost. When asked about it, I usually say, “It’s like walking around inside a giant museum, but it’s a city! You just have to go, I can’t explain it well enough in words for you to understand.”

I finally landed in Amsterdam after a nightmarish flight from Tallinn. The extremely loud volume of the pilot’s announcement was hurting my ears.
“Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Amsterdam. We have to taxi for ten minutes. Please, remain seated until the seat belt announcement is off. Thank you.”
His voice sounded distorted. I had to cover my ears with both my hands. I had forgotten to bring any earplugs with me. In the past, I used to carry several pairs of earplugs conveniently distributed in all my bags.
“It seems I have forgotten everything about my travel essentials.”
Whilst blaming myself for my oversight I took the obligatory photos of aircrafts. Flashbacks from my last time in Amsterdam began to pop up into my head, uninvited.
My previous time in Amsterdam was nine years ago. Time really flies, doesn’t it? It was May 2015. I was attending a conference for the electronics supply chain industry. I was writing about the conference and the latest news for electronics supply chain professionals for EBN (Electronics Business Network), now EPS News.

Written by Craig BerryCreative Intern at VBAT
Recently I had 2 friends from the UK come to Amsterdam to visit and I wanted to show them the city I have been living in for the last 5 months and all that is great about it. I could easily have taken them to the bigger tourist attractions such as the Heineken Experience, the Anne Frank House, the Rijksmuseum and so on. But I wanted to share my pieces of local knowledge which I have picked up on so far and also find and explore new places in the city for myself.
Firstly we visited the Stedelijk Museum which although yes, it is one of those big tourist attractions, as one of the world’s best museums with a great collection, the 3 of us as intrepid young designers could not escape its allure. I myself went recently to visit the Willem Sandberg exhibition although this had since finished but in its place was a great exhibition celebrating 100 years of ‘De Stijl’. For those who don’t know, De Stijl was a revolutionary art and design movement in the early 20th century (1917–1931) with artists like Mondrian and van Doesburg at the centre of it producing work that they saw as a reduction of form and colour choosing to mostly use vertical and horizontal shapes only using black, white and primary colours.
The exhibition itself covered these characteristics of the movement by showing these well known names tied to De Stijl — there was Piet Mondrian’s ‘Composition’ pieces and Gerrit Rietveld’s ‘Red and Blue Chair, these people built the aesthetic of the movement with the other pieces on show by artists and designers who have/had been inspired by them. There was Ellsworth Kelly with ‘Red Blue Rocker’ in the shape of a folded geometric circle. Roy Lichtenstein’s huge piece ‘As I Opened Fire’ a painting produced using the same reduced colour palette. Also here was a strong piece by the collective — General Idea called ‘Infe©ted Mondrian’ where they parodied the artist, copying the composition but replacing the yellow colour with a more toxic green to address the AIDS crisis which General Idea focused a lot of their work on and a comment on the dominance of De Stijl. The exhibition is part of a longer project marking 100 years of De Stijl and hopefully I can visit more of it as I see it as one of the great commanding art and design movements which is still prevalent today.
The next day we took the boat over the River IJ to NDSM, described as ‘a rugged shipyard to a creative hotspot’. The ‘creative city’ is a historical remainder of the largest shipyard in the city and has become a haven for all people interested in creativity and art with something for everyone to admire. What stood out to us was the main NDSM building/warehouse, now a hub for studios and restaurants; the outer walls still adorned with the original painted sign. The letters on the 2 sides read “Netherlands Shipbuilding Company’ and ‘Nederlandsche Dok en Scheepsbouw Maatschappij’ with each letter painted on heavily in white, with little consistency in letter styles but following some sort of grid. We were motivated to photograph the letters and digitise them to produce a display font with all of its inconsistency and variety as a homage to the building, as designers it was impossible for us to not look at this and be amazed and inspired.
We also found a great bar in the NDSM area — Pllek, built out of old shipping containers a huge glass window looking out onto the IJ and the cold Dutch winter air. We stayed here for a while, chatting and chilling. Drinking a few beers whilst some live music played. A really cool find and as the Dutch might say, it was ‘gezellig’.
I got the following Monday off work to continue our quest around the city and we ended up at the FOAM photography museum (Fotografiemuseum Amsterdam) to check out the Hiroshi Sugimoto exhibition — Black Box. An overview of the Japanese artist’s work which covered his major series. There was a lot of variety in what was on show but the works which really stood out to me were ‘Lightning Fields’ and ‘Theatres’ because of the processes which were used to make them. ‘Lightning Fields’ are images where there is no camera involved, they are made by channelling electricity over photo paper and exposing it. The marks left behind are incredible and the size of the prints makes for a visually strong image. ‘Theatres’ are a series of images where the artist photographed empty theatre halls, the exposure length of each photograph dictated by the length of a feature film, so each image is brighter or darker than the other. They create these ghostly like images of the room with a solid white image on the theatre screen which is almost sinister like to look into as you are surrounded by these images. The rest of the museum is also great as well as the inside of the building, it is one of the canal houses on the Keizersgracht and inside it is a series of winding rooms and dimly lit hallways: easy to get lost — which we did.
Finally throughout the few days we were walking around I had prepared a map that documents some of the great historical and innovative typographic signs that exist through the city. I was inspired by David Quay’s type tour with us back in the warm summer time in September and using these places as well as my own findings we wandered around as I pointed out these great relics, most of them with some story to tell.
My personal favourite was this piece by Dutch artist Piet Parra on the Tuinstraat. A huge wall mural near a school and kids park which reads: “Ik speel in de stad met alles wat er bestaat” — I play in the city with all that exists. I just love how the letters flow from one to the next and also Parra has a unique style which fits the city perfectly.

Entertaining conspiracy in the land of the one-eyed King.
Three cinema trips ago, and in the second week of October of a year that is ending just hours away from when I pen these brief words of appreciation, I was leaving my local cinema in the company of my beautiful son when I happened upon the above poster for Amsterdam and immediately remarked to all within earshot: this will be a stunner of a film. As is so often proved correct within my own particular one-eyed kingdom, I was indeed right, and director David O Russell’s tenth big screen cinematic affair was a conspiratorial treat. Not as accomplished perhaps as his 1999 epic Three Kings or Silver Linings Playbook over a decade later or my particular favourite in his cinematic cannon, 2013’s American Hustle, but I loved Amsterdam for a multitude of reasons and hopefully for differing and surprising reasons than your own.
Returning for just a moment to that film poster and my proclamation of its coming greatness as a film as my son and I ambled away from Halloween Ends in early October, whilst he was nonplussed by my soothsaying future review the cinema’s “Greeter” wasn’t as she confessed (a) she’d seen and loved an advance copy of the film and (b) she’d already bagged the poster I was referring to as she too liked it and as a perk of the job, she can buy any unreserved film posters for a knockdown price. I was of course envious as I’m a childish film fan at heart and am so often taken in by a good poster and so it was, finally, on 29th December in a year finishing in a mere few hours from now, that I watched Amsterdam expectantly awaiting a gem of a film that didn’t arrive but which was replaced by something wholly surprisingly and unexpectedly different.
Since seeing the film poster in early October I’d seen not a trailer nor a sneak peak or any written reviews whatsoever. I still haven’t. I watched this film without even the most basic of a premise or blurb which, according to The Matrix Movie Bible at www.imdb.com proclaims Amsterdam to be:
“In the 1930s, three friends witness a murder, are framed for it, and uncover one of the most outrageous plots in American history”.
Had I known this before time I would of course have been expecting the obvious real-life conspiracy being laid out before us and with the introduction of Robert De Niro in his notable cameo role, however it was even more pleasing for your humble narrator to call out this conspiracy ahead of cinematic time, way before the introduction of De Niro and way before those closing credits that rather soured the ending to an otherwise brilliantly engaging film.
Go see the credits for yourself. It’s all there for a one eye wishing to see.
But rather remarkably, arguably the greatest untold and unsaid conspiracy of all time is laid out within this gem of a film and should you be unaware of General Smedley Butler, his book “War is a Racket”, the request placed upon him to lead a Fascist revolution in the United States of America exactly a century ago or his multitude of revealing quotes attributed to him later in life, treat yourself to a real conspiracy in a world absent of them according to our Overlords in charge of the all seeing eye.
Five paragraphs in and not one word about the film? Par for my cinematic course. There are never any major spoilers here. Just a human reaction to an artform I revere like no other. But returning to the film poster once again and it’s a veritable who’s who and ensemble collection of character actors and actresses of our generation, all of whom produce intriguing, spirited and fiercely individual performances. In poster order we have Margot Robbie playing arguably a dual character if not definitely a dual personality as she flits from secretive war nurse to artist and much more in league with the love of her life, World War I veteran and now New York lawyer in the guise of John David Washington. Chris Rock is an awkwardly outspoken World War I veteran too and best friends with Washington whilst back in a New York of 1933 and fifteen years since the end of the Great War, we find Anya Taylor-Joy as a rather prissy and controlling wife of Rami Malek whilst Zoe Saldana excels as a medical examiner.
Pleasingly as well as perhaps unfairly, I saw the Mike Myers character of a British spy stepping right out of the Quentin Tarantino character created for him in 2009’s Inglourious Basterds and the screen time he shares with Michael Shannon’s American spy is a bizarre joy. Timothy Olyphant is a hitman. Andrea Riseborough a socially climbing and grasping estranged wife. Taylor Swift hangs up the singing microphone for a small cameo role and Matthias Schoenaerts and Alessandro Nivola complete the poster roll of acting talent as two ridiculously cartoonish bungling New York detectives.
Which just leaves your star of a conspiratorial show:
“Bert Berendsen” (Christian Bale) World War I veteran and now ostensibly a fringe outsider doctor and medical practitioner, Berendsen has seen the devastation of war and the human casualties he now tries in vain to treat. The carnage of human war is writ large on the returning veterans unable to stop shaking from what was termed then as “Shell Shock” but is now flowered and mired in the newspeak language of “Post Traumatic Stress Disorder”, but Berendsen is also somewhat of an expert in the art of facial and body disfigurement having lost and left an eye in France at the very end of the war. Forming a “pact” with the nurse who saved him and nursed him back to health (Margot Robbie as “Valerie Voze”) and his best friend and also recovering veteran (John David Washington as “Harold Woodman”), Berendsen breaks the pact to return to his medical calling in New York and the estranged wife from an estranged family who distrust him enormously.
As ever, Christian Bale is wonderful in a central role arguably only he or Sam Rockwell could truly play and pull off with such aplomb. Often framed with a querying and quizzical head tilt to the side and always with long, lingering shots on a character trying desperately to piece together the puzzle before him, David O Russell deserves enormous credit for writing such a character as well as guiding and directing him into life in league with Bale.
“A lot of this really happened”, so proclaims the very first frame of the film before we journey backward and forward, from 1930’s New York to France in 1918 and back again, as a tapestry is slowly woven around a huge cast of characters embroiled or otherwise in the greatest untold (and dare not spoken about) conspiracy of all time. There’s an arguable hero’s tale component to the story alongside the conspiracy but with heavy emphasis on the returning veterans I’m hoping the deliberately shocking human aftermath of war resonates deeply with everyone.
There’s a “Committee of 5” and “The Great Nation Society” and with a bending of the truth and some plot contrivances combining with a stellar cast, I rather enjoyed Amsterdam and recommend it to you.
Postscript
I first read about this Fascist coup to topple a sitting USA President to install a military dictatorship in the late 1990’s so it’s only taken a quarter of a century since then to arrive on the big cinema screen. I still haven’t seen or read any reviews of the film but I’d wager it gets panned. Big time!
I’d also wager than no-one of any mainstream substance brings up the conspiracy despite it’s centennial anniversary and the implications this may have had for the world at large.
But then again, conspiracies don’t exist, do they?
Silly me.
Thanks for reading. Just for larks as always, and always a human reaction rather than spoilers galore. My three most recently published film articles are linked below or there’s well over 100 blog articles (with 300+ individual film reviews) within my archives from which to choose:

Hoy! The capital of the Netherlands holds a special place in my heart. Never have I liked a big city as much as Amsterdam. It booms with people from all over the world, the standard of living is exquisite, and there are so many bike lanes! Find yourself wandering around Amsterdam, taking in the canals, the houses among them, the marvelous new architecture, and experiencing this small but beautiful country.
Get yourself the real deal: A fresh Stroopwafel on a market. This is so good; I cannot even describe it. Stroopwafels are a traditional dutch pastry; a doughball with spices and cinnamon gets baked into the Wafel. The thought of the smell when it comes out waters my mouth! It then gets cut open, and a thick sirup, the Stroop, is put onto it, and tadaa, you have yourself a heavenly tasting dessert. Or…

I have never seriously considered the expat life: I’m too fond of deep-fried foods and the convenience of driving to supermarkets that sell everything I need. But after spending four days in Amsterdam, I may have to reconsider my attachment to American soil. Amsterdam is without a doubt the most beautiful city I’ve ever seen — I think it’s even more picturesque than Paris. Almost every street is divided by a canal dotted with houseboats, and the brightly colored buildings with tall windows lean gracefully over the streets and canals. Bridges are sprinkled with flower boxes, and the scent of flowers, food, and other herbs wafts into the streets.
I stayed about 30 minutes outside of the city at Lucky Lake Hostel on Lake Vinkeveen. Lucky Lake is more than just a hostel: it is a community, where travelers from all over the world eat breakfast together in a converted bus, kayak the lake together, or unwind at night together in the lounge. Painted camper trailers, small cabins, tents, and hammocks form a ring around the property, with a block of gender-neutral showers and toilets (those absurdly progressive Dutch!) in the center, campground-style. Staff members or guests cook big dinners every night in the outdoor kitchen, and anyone can chip in for a share of the food. Guests and staff actually hang out in the lounge at night to play cards or the guitar, creating a sense of community that many hostels advertise but very few actually deliver. It was truly the experience of a lifetime.
The lake was a three-minute walk from my camper door. On my first day, I joined a couple of friends I made on the shuttle and rented kayaks for €3/hour to explore the waters. We paddled our way through a maze of canals and tiny houses with tinier boats until we reached the lake. The water was so clear you could almost see the bottom, and we saw more sailboats and kayaks than motorboats.
Later that day, I decided to take the hostel shuttle into the city to walk around and see what I could discover. I found that the Dutch way of life is perhaps the most relaxed in the world: they grow tulips and marijuana, ride bicycles, and eat fresh cheese and chocolate-covered waffles. All the people I met were very laid-back and pleasant, even more so than the Belgians. So that’s why the Dutch are consistently recognized as the happiest people in the world!
Amsterdam is truly a city of bicycles. It has more bicycles than people and more bike lanes than streets. It’s very pleasant to hear the tinkle of thousands of bells and to see so many people cycling their way through the city (it must be the Dutch secret to staying fit despite eating lots of waffles). Pro tip: don’t walk in the bike lanes! I was crossing a bike lane when I saw this really cool Dutch bookstore out of the corner of my eye. I decided midway across the street to check it out and changed direction, only to collide into a passing bicycle. My phone flew out of my hands across the street, and my body scraped its way along the cobblestones until I ended up on my side. The cyclist, who was only a few years older than I am, had fallen off his bike, and he rushed over to help me up. He very kindly checked me for any injuries and even recommended the bookstore when he heard what had distracted me. I guess Dutch amicability knows no bounds.
My friends know that I am somewhat of a crazy cat lady, and Amsterdam definitely provided the feline interaction I’ve missed on my travels. I visited De Poezenboot (“The Catboat”), a floating cat sanctuary on one of Amsterdam’s canals. The lovely houseboat is home to dozens of stray cats who have learned to love living on the water. For someone like me who misses her own cats dearly, it’s positively sublime to visit a place where I can play with friendly cats for as long as I like. Later, I toured KattenKabinet, a museum specializing in artwork featuring cats. They have paintings by artists such as Rembrandt and Manet, as well as sculptures and posters by less famous artists. They even have a couple of real cats hanging around the museum for artistic inspiration!
Normally I would save my culinary experiences for a food post, but I have to rave about the food in Amsterdam. My diet consisted mostly of cheese and waffles: needless to say, I was well-satisfied. There is a cheese shop selling fresh local cheese on almost every corner in Amsterdam, and the best part is that they all offer free samples! I wandered from shop to shop, trying slices of every cheese and every fig spread offered. I literally made a meal out of free cheese samples.
The Dutch are famed for their stroopwafels, which are thin waffles cemented together by caramel syrup. They sound delicious, and I’m a little ashamed to say that I never tried one. My sweet-tooth hopelessly indulged in the perhaps less-authentic but more delectable chocolate-covered waffles.
Oh. My. God. I may never be able to eat at Waffle House again after feasting on these things. I ate one every day: chocolate-covered waffles, white chocolate-covered waffles, caramel-covered waffles. So many waffles, and so much tastebud explosion. They were usually topped with yummy things like marshmallows, butterscotch chips, or Oreos, too.
Whether you like amazing food, beautiful rural countryside, or a charming and vibrant city with flowers everywhere, Amsterdam will take your breath away. It is easily my favorite city so far. We’ll see if it can be surpassed by my next stop — Berlin!

Today is the beginning of my month-long, Amazing Amsterdam Adventure.
I will be on my own this month, and I have decided to pretend I am a tourist who managed to find a beautiful apartment in Amsterdam for a month.
The first day of my fakecation began appropriately with transportation challenges. I helped my daughter and family get to the train station, and it was a bit more challenging than anticipated to get all those bikes and the dog across town to Central station, never mind onto a train.
I left them outside and then got very lost on my way home — at one point, my GPS tried to send me into the canal. Fortunately, I made it to the apartment. Now, after a hard day of traveling, I am beginning this adventure.
I hope you join me.

I decided I’ll write a bit about the two cities I just visited during my French school break, partially because my British friend Matt (shoutout number three if he’s counting!) encouraged me to keep writing about urban planning. So here I am.
Amsterdam is very interesting with its urban planning — some might call it “the Mecca” of urban planning because of how idealized it is by many urbanists. The most popular urbanism YouTube channel is Not Just Bikes, who moved to Amsterdam because of its reputation. But what is it really like?
I would imagine the tourist experience is much different from the habitant experience, even more than other cities. This is because while the prioritization of biking is helpful for locals, it can be difficult for a newbie to get a handle on. As you walk around the city, there can be so much to look out for as a pedestrian. Watch out for the bikes! Watch out for the tram! Watch out for the cars! It’s a complex ecosystem, and if you aren’t paying attention, it can be easily overwhelming.
I did love the trams in Amsterdam’s city center. Metros can go faster underground, but the experience of a tram above ground, where you can simply hop on and look out the window at the city, is delightful. However, I noticed that the trams and metro have a tap-in and tap-out system, which I’m not a fan of. In New York, you use your ticket to get on the subway, but you can get off wherever you want and you do not have to rescan the ticket. This is much easier for riders. My friends and I were sometimes scrambling to take out our ticket again and rescan to exit the train.
I get the sense that in Venice people actually use their canals for transportation, but in Amsterdam this does not seem to be the case. There are tours on the canal, but not a lot of regular folks using the canal to navigate the city. The bikes are everywhere. I don’t know how I underestimated the number of bikes when I knew how bike-crazy Amsterdam is, but I underestimated them.
There are a few things I prefer about Paris, a place I’ve been to many times and am more familiar with. The sidewalks are wider in Paris than in Amsterdam. There are also a lot more terraces/outdoor seating in Paris, which is always welcoming and enjoyable for tourists and locals. Amsterdam’s meager outdoor seating was always just a few tables outside, whereas in Paris there can be huge terraces with many tables for people to simply plop down and order a coffee. Relaxed café culture in France is simply unbeatable. In comparison, with its smaller streets and a lack of outside seating, Amsterdam is always keeping things moving. It’s a faster pace but it’s also exciting and keeps you turning down the next corner.
There are a few key neighborhoods in Amsterdam. The 9 Streets neighborhood is very beautiful with varying architecture and canal views, but much of the ground floor establishments were expensive shops. Again, I would’ve liked an outdoor café to sit and take things in rather than feeling like I couldn’t linger. I found the Jordaan neighborhood to be more residential (I could literally look into rich people’s houses because of their big, open windows) but just as architecturally interesting. The Red Light District felt the most touristy. It’s really just one street, a couple blocks long, with sex workers in the windows and “cinemas.” We walked up and down it once, but there wasn’t much for our group to do there.
Athens has a few popular neighborhoods as well — Plaka and Psyri. I found Plaka to be touristy in some parts and desolate in others. Maybe this is just my experience. I really liked Psyri — I had multiple meals in that area and found something going on down every street. Cars in Athens are interesting — they attempt to go down any street they can fit in. I was sitting outside at a café and a car squeezed through the small street less than two feet away from me. There is a lack of signaled crosswalks in Athens. Most of the time people just cross the street whenever possible through traffic. That is less than ideal.
But I would not say Athens isn’t walkable. I walked all over the city center while I was there and only took the metro a few times to get to faraway locations. When I did take the metro, it was fairly reliable but not the cleanest. One thing I did like about the Athens metro was that they had signs showing which direction the escalators were going so that you could easily navigate where you needed to go to get out. I haven’t seen that in a metro before, but it was helpful.
Athens is the furthest south I’ve been in Europe and the sunshine was welcome after months of rainy winter in France. One thing I noticed is all of the solar panels! Many apartment buildings had multiple solar panels at the top, maybe 6 feet long by 4 feet wide. In contrast, when I took the Eurostar train to Amsterdam, I noticed that Belgium and the Netherlands had a lot of wind turbines. Northern part of Europe, more wind, it makes sense.
This was a great trip with two cities I really wanted to see this year, so I’m proud of myself and feeling very fulfilled.

Amsterdam is one of the most famous places in The Netherlands, but city officials are putting measures in place to reduce tourism.
A few years ago, the city of Amsterdam started fighting back against mass tourism (also called overtourism). You might wonder why, since tourists can be great for the local economy. Let me explain a few reasons:

A City of Surprises and Endless Possibilities.
No city compares to Amsterdam’s diversity. Every time I visit, I discover something new that I never knew existed. It’s like joining an adventure each time, with surprises waiting around every corner.
And I love it.
This year, I’ve had the opportunity to visit Amsterdam two times, and each experience has been unique each time.
The first visit was with my family. We were a large group, which made it challenging to please everyone. So, my daughter and I quickly decided to return on our own. (So we did, a couple of weeks later).
During our first visit to Amsterdam, we decided to play tourists. And what better place is there than to visit The Royal Palace?
This palace is best known for being where the King and Queen of the Netherlands stand and wave to the people on various occasions.

I spent 3 days and 2 nights in Amsterdam.
I really do think anyone can enjoy travelling on a budget without it being extremely restrictive as long as you have a plan in place. In my opinion, Amsterdam is an extremely beautiful city, definitely much more expensive than some other cities in Europe eg Berlin, Prague, and Dublin but it is nonetheless worth a visit.
The iconic buildings, riverbanks and bridges make it truly picturesque. The buildings in some streets remain a protected UNESCO world heritage.
Here is basically what I did and how much I spent:
Flight: Ryan air — €38 (Dublin to Amsterdam). Quite a steal if you ask me.
Breakfast: Breakfast at the airport — €19.25
Train to the city: €5.7 (Amsterdam Schiphol Airport to Amsterdam City Centre which is around a 30 minutes journey)

I have lived in the Netherlands for nearly four years now, the past two in Amsterdam. Because I moved here during the pandemic and then was sick quite a bit for the last year, I haven’t done as many of the touristy things as I might have liked.
Starting August 1st, things are about to change.
My family lives on the same block as I do, but they are going away this year for August. That means I will be on my own in my beautiful apartment.
I have decided to pretend that I am in a beautiful vacation apartment in a city I don’t know well and act like a tourist. I will visit museums and gardens, take a canal tour, and do anything that seems fun. I will probably even take some of my own advice:
medium.com
And, of course, I will regularly write about it, so stay tuned!

Beautiful Amsterdam / Built on Poles/ Who would pay if it all fell down?
–Old Dutch nursery rhyme translated
Since early times, the houses in Amsterdam have been built on wooden foundation piles[i] that are driven deep into the clay, peat, and water until they reach the first layer of solid sand. Even some of the trees in Vondelpark are supported on wooden piles to keep them from sinking into the marshy ground.
How long can a wooden pile remain in the ground before it has to be replaced?
300 years? 80 years? Until next week? The answer depends on many variables:
Quality of the sand layer
In Amsterdam, the first layer of sand lies approximately 12 meters below the surface. However, the quality of the sand layer is not consistent throughout the city. In some areas, the first sand layer is thinner than normal or missing entirely. As a result, the houses in these areas sink at an abnormal rate, and the foundations have to be replaced faster.
The top of the wooden foundation pile should be below the lowest expected water level. If part of the pile reaches above the water, it will be subject to insect attacks and decay. A problem is that the water level under Amsterdam isn’t always stable. For instance, it can drop during long periods of drought. Or a sewer pipe can develop cracks, allowing the ground water to flow into the pipe and be carried away. As a result, the water level drops.
On the other hand, if the water level rises too high, as sometimes occurs after a heavy rain, the Amsterdam cellars and crawl spaces fill up like bathtubs.
Construction projects can also interfere with the water level. An example is the incident on the Vijzelgracht in 2008 during work on the new metro station. A leak in the dam wall at a depth of 60 meters caused water and sand to stream into the pit. Part of the sand layer that was supporting the wooden foundation piles of the nearby houses washed away, causing extensive damage to the structure of the houses.
Spruce is less vulnerable to damage from bacteria than pine. Since around 1970, piles made from pine are prohibited from use. Concrete and steel piles are often used in present day construction.
The visible signs are slanted floors, cracks in the walls, doors and windows that stick, and broken front steps. The charming crooked roofline of Amsterdam is actually a symptom of unstable foundations.
If a foundation that is in poor condition is not repaired in time, the wooden piles will need to be replaced. No homeowner wants to get this news. A new foundation can easily cost 100,000 euro. Furthermore, the floor may need to be opened up, thereby making the house unlivable for some time.
In recent years, the housing corporations have been replacing the wooden piles under their properties with concrete piles.[ii] For example, Ymere is replacing the decayed pine piles in the Van der Pek neighborhood — a costly investment. However many houses that are at risk are privately owned.
The condition of the old wooden piles will only worsen in the coming years, so the question is: who will pay?
[i] Referred to as poles in the nursery rhyme.

Sangam and I visited a place called A’dam Lookout in Amsterdam. It’s a high platform where you can see an amazing view of the city. You’ll see the old part of the city, the busy port, and the special Dutch landscape with its canals, which are recognized as important by UNESCO. They also have a cool exhibition and a free audio tour that tells you about Amsterdam’s past and culture. A’dam Lookout is on the top of the A’dam Tower in Amsterdam North.
We got tickets for A’dam Lookout and hopped on the elevator. We were really excited to see the city view from the tower. As the elevator went up, the colors changed constantly, and it looked absolutely amazing.
When we reached the top of the tower, the city view was incredible. Even though it was windy and a bit chilly, we still had a great time enjoying the view.

Hi there!
Welcome to a cityscape with unique merchant houses, intersected by numerous canals. Amsterdam is a lively city with a rich cultural scene and 800 years of history.
Forget about the typical tourist traps.
I will tell you the best things you can do for the first time there to feel fabulous.
Stay with me so you don’t miss anything.
Here we go with the Top 10 Must-Do Activities In Amsterdam:
Cycling isn’t just a mode of transportation in Amsterdam.
It’s a way of life!
With over 800,000 bicycles in the city — more than its human population — Amsterdam is often called ‘The Cycling Capital of the World’.This is owed to the city’s flat terrain and extensive network of bike routes.
Experience the city alongside locals on two wheels.
I am sure that you will love Amsterdam’s cycling culture:
www.dutchamsterdam.nl
Grab your saddle and pedal through Amsterdam’s bike-friendly streets.
You will enjoy passing by historic landmarks and picturesque canals.
Try to choose a sunny day or be prepared to cycle in the rain, as is often the case there!
The city of Amsterdam has a unique network of canals stretching to the west and south of the historic old town. The project was initiated during the late 16th and early 17th centuries.
It consists of the reclamation of swampland and the construction of concentric arcs of canals.
The canals, along with radial waterways and streets, showcase the city’s rich history. Now you have a chance to enjoy its beauty and heritage!
Find more information here:
whc.unesco.org
I had the opportunity to step into the evolution of Jordaan.
Once a humble working-class enclave, it has now transformed into Amsterdam’s hippest neighborhood!
Here, you can stroll along streets lined with art galleries, vintage boutiques, and bars.
Amsterdam’s Nine Streets, nestled behind the Royal Palace on Dam Square, attract both locals and tourists alike:
www.iamsterdam.com
Lose yourself along the cobblestone streets and peaceful canals of Amsterdam’s historic district!
Now, get ready for a journey through time. In just 40 minutes, you’ll zip through 400 years of history, starting from a swampy area.
The best part? This museum tells how Amsterdam, a city built on water, came to be:
grachten.museum
The museum itself is housed in a jaw-dropping building on the Herengracht.
Once you’re inside, grab an audio guide and settle in.
Before you know it, the lights dim, and bam! You’re whisked back to 1600, smack dab in the middle of Amsterdam’s golden age.
But wait, there’s more! This museum isn’t just about history.
It’s also about the city’s vibrant life.
The doll’s houses are straight out of the past and snippets from cult classic movies.
Yeah, it’s that cool.
Ever wondered what it’s like to live on a houseboat? Well, now’s your chance to find out!
Step aboard the Woonboot Museum, a cozy floating museum housed in a converted cargo ship from 1914:
houseboatmuseum.nl
You can sip tea and enjoy cake while lounging in retro armchairs.
But that’s not all — Amsterdam’s houseboat scene is a unique way of life. Dive deeper into its story at the Boat Museum of the Canals.
Located on the famous Prinsengracht, this museum offers a glimpse into Amsterdam’s aquatic past and present.
Learn about the evolution of houseboats, canal history, and more.
After all, where else can you get a firsthand look at life on the waterways?
Explore one of Amsterdam’s most powerful historical sites, the Anne Frank House.
Enter the hidden annex where Anne Frank and her family sought refuge during World War II.
Here, you’ll uncover the truths of the Holocaust:
www.annefrank.org
In this museum, you will see Anne’s actual diary and other relics.
I was inspired by the lasting message of courage and hope.
Experience the world of art at the famous Van Gogh Museum.
You will see the largest collection of Vincent van Gogh’s masterpieces!
This museum provides a close look into the life and art of the iconic Dutch painter:
www.vangoghmuseum.nl
Admire his lively paintings, sketches, and personal letters, witnessing the journey of his artistic brilliance.
Dive into centuries of Dutch art and history at the legendary Rijksmuseum:
www.rijksmuseum.nl
Discover masterpieces by Rembrandt, Vermeer, and other masters, highlighting the richness of Dutch culture.
From stunning paintings to decorative arts and more, the Rijksmuseum invites you now.
As soon as I walked into the Heineken Brewery, the delightful aroma of hops surrounded me.
Exploring the brewery’s vats and vintage equipment, I discovered the story of Heineken’s beginnings and their dedication to brewing excellence:
www.heinekenexperience.com
No wonder it’s my favorite beer!
The tasting room was a highlight for me.
With every sip, I savored the essence of Heineken’s craftsmanship. Heineken truly deserves its high regard in the brewing world.
Do you enjoy this beer as much as I do?
As the sun dips below the horizon, Amsterdam ignites with exciting nightlife.
The Red Light District, famous for its legalized prostitution, is a must-see spot and that caught my eye too:
amsterdamtickets.tours
I wandered through lively streets with friends, enjoying its unique vibe.
But there’s more to see in the district than just its reputation. Amongst the buzzing nightlife, you’ll discover a fascinating mix of history, culture, and cutting-edge experiences.
Explore cozy cafes, trendy bars, nightclubs, and live music spots.
Amsterdam offers endless possibilities for nighttime adventures.
Whether you’re into groovy beats or prefer a chill night with locals, the city promises unforgettable experiences until the early hours.
Ready to dive in?

Today is the 7th day of my August Amsterdam Adventure, and I went to the Rijksmuseum, the National Museum of the Netherlands. I had the opportunity to see the famous painting “The Night Watch,” which is undergoing restoration, a process being documented every step of the way. The Museum has published extensive information about it online.
I spent two hours looking at only a fraction of the work on exhibit and am looking forward to doing more of a deep dive this month into the art available to residents and tourists in the Netherlands. Today’s visit included works by Rembrandt, Vermeer, and Van Gogh, among many others.
I will be visiting the Van Gogh Museum later this month, as well as the Fabrique des Lumières exhibit of the Dutch Masters, and I will write a lot more about them. I will be keeping a travel log about my adventures here:

Amsterdam by Ian McEwan certainly isn’t the first novel in the history of literature that deals with moral hypocrisy in a corrupted society, nor is it the last. But the way McEwan deals with it, the approach, the focus — it is all so fresh (even now, in 2015) and remarkable. The narrative instance doesn’t criticize and doesn’t even laugh at those characters. Instead, we, the readers, are encouraged to take the protagonists seriously. There is no bare sarcasm, only the finest irony, essential to characterization and plot. McEwan is a master of the free indirect style. We are in the characters’ heads, thinking their thoughts, afraid of their fears. We are worried that Clive will end up just like Molly. And there is Vernon with his feeling of non-existence, which is a postmodernist moment, for he certainly does not exist until someone reads the novel.
The introductory setting is hilarious. Two middle-aged guys are attending an ex-lover’s funeral. The ex-lower was a kind of femme fatale cliché of the XX century. The sound of the name, Molly Lane, somehow recalls Molly Bloom. There is, also, at least, one more ex-lover of hers, and her husband. They are all connected in various ways, but the existence of Molly deepens those connections. The first two guys are friends and, which is more important, they give us the first two points of view. They are the good guys. According to them, the husband is stupid and possessive. The third lover, a politician, is an enemy of the previous three.
The language of the novel is extraordinary. Characterization is delicate and minutious.
So, we have two bad, and two good guys. And then Vernon appears to be quite immoral and without human principles. Nevermind. There is Clive, with his moral superiority. He is the one who really loved Molly, who deeply misses her, and who doesn’t even want Vernon to publicly humiliate the arch-enemy, by publishing his photos in women's clothes, taken by Molly, and provided by her husband. We also read a long and rather pathetic passage about how Clive had always been a so much better friend to Vernon than he was to Clive.
Just a few pages later, this morally superior guy goes hiking, in search of inspiration, and then witnesses an act of violence, perhaps a murder, and just walks away, because, for god’s sake, he has the symphony to write!
After less than half of the novel, there is no good protagonist left for us to feel empathy for. But, instead of becoming boring, the novel’s plot starts to accelerate, preventing you from letting it from your hands before you’ve read the very last page of it.
The main plot triggers are behind us by now. Clive and Vernon have made a pact: if one of them gets ill the way Molly did, the other will arrange euthanasia abroad. After that, they’ve had the first, but crucial, argument in the history of their friendship. It is about embarrassing photographs of Foreign Minister, Julian Garmony, which were about to be published in the magazine that Vernon runs.
Now comes a deus ex machina — and the first spoiler to Vernon’s plan. A new character, the Minister’s wife, gives a press conference, which turns things upside down. On the sudden, it is not the politician’s head urgently needed on a plate, but Vernon’s.
Vernon and Clive are mad at each other, as they both feel betrayed. They start to hate each other and, in the end, mutually arrange a murder in Amsterdam, where the grand premiere of Clive’s symphony is about to be performed.
It is Molly’s husband who, followed by now ex-Foreign Minister, buries them all. The most of his wife’s former lovers are dead, and now he recalls memories of Vernon’s wife, who used to be wild. He is about to call her for a dinner. So, who is laughing now?
We are. At this moment, I can’t recall any other piece of prose in which the death of the main characters produces such a comical effect. It is even not morbid humor; it is just humor, and it is great.
Ian McEwan won the Man Booker Prize for Amsterdam in 1998.

It’s my third year in the Netherlands. Or, as we Highly Skilled Migrants like to say, year 3 out of 5.
When I arrived in 2022, as full of enthusiasm about the future as the whole newly reopened post-Covid world, the border officer asked me how long I was planning on staying. ‘Maybe forever!’ I replied with a broad smile. (Coming from the UK, I was still used to the image of public officials as banterous teddy bears). Then, I marched straight into the Dutch winter.
I was proud to have intentionally chosen a new country to live in and determined to be happy. As it happens, reality proved to be more complex and less controllable, and not just because of the weather. The job was actually worse than my previous job in London. The housing market was broken beyond understanding. The friendships were effortful and shallow. The relationship I started turned long distance.
And that’s okay. That’s how you fall in love with a city, through a journey of joys and disappointments. You will survive, grow and thrive, as long as you have a guiding principle. Mine, as many other expats in Amsterdam, has always been:
At least stay until the end of the ruling. Then you can always leave.
The Dutch government calls it a “facility” or “reimbursement” as if trying to hide its own intentions. But when you fill any legal forms here, the literally translated question they ask you is “Are you enjoying the 30% ruling?”. I surely am, thank you very much. That’s the purpose of it — it’s an incentive. A tax scheme from 1964, according to which Highly Skilled Migrants don’t pay taxes on 30% of their salary, as well as wealth tax for shares, savings and properties they have abroad. The aim is to compensate them for the cost of moving countries.
Much has changed to this program since its introduction 60 years ago. Firstly, the definition of Highly Skilled Migrant has blurred, from someone with a specific expertise needed in the Netherlands, to someone that earns more than roughly €70k per year. Secondly, the duration of the tax advantage shortened from 10 to 8 to 5 years. And finally, just a year ago, the percentage of tax-exempt salary has decreased. Just like Milka has been gradually replacing cocoa with palm oil and Uniqlo has added polyester to their T-shirts, the Dutch government, too, has diluted its concentration of a promised land.
Between 2010 and 2022, the number of expats in the Netherlands nearly tripled, reaching about 70 thousand. The incentive to attract skilled labour has clearly worked. But instead of celebrating this with a champagne and liquorice candy, officials in the Hague have started to scale back the program. So… attracting expats is now a bad thing?
I think the Dutch government finally realised that it’s neither good nor bad, but it’s complicated.
Learning the local opinions from personal anecdotes and discussions, as well as Dutch media and online forums, I can confirm that the policy has more resonance than a simple reimbursement that it claims to be.
One thing I love about the Dutch is how hard it is to annoy them. It takes a group of stoned British lads disregarding the cyclist's path to cross that barrier. Even then, the worst that happens is a Dutchie elbowing the tourist so that they trip, while they could’ve run them over and still win in any Dutch court (since cyclist paths are sacred and bikes always have priority).
Bottom line is, the Dutch are easy-going people, not precious about things. That’s why very often their opinion about the 30% ruling goes along the lines of: “it doesn’t affect me, so why would I care”, “the policy is there to use it, so let expats use it”, or even: “it’s not right to envy someone when I already have a good life”. Besides, apparently expats are polite and their culture doesn’t bother others.
The neutral attitude can trend towards solidarity and even enthusiasm. Some Dutch people say that their country is too small to keep its economic importance without highly skilled migrants. Expats bring knowledge, innovation and jobs: they are the reason that multinational companies are not afraid to have an office in the Netherlands, which in turn creates jobs for the locals. Everybody benefits.
The “everybody benefits” argument is important for Dutch people, who value equality and are proud of it. That’s why to some, it seems unfair that they may earn the same as their expat colleagues, but take less pay home, based just on their origin.
Still, this group is not hostile to the expats. They’re disappointed that the government facilitates unfair pay by effectively subsidising companies. If companies want to attract talent, they should just offer higher pay to everyone, to make up for the high cost of living in Holland. Some people even argue that the ruling allows companies to suppress salaries.
Then there’s the smallest and most extreme camp. Expats overcrowd big cities, don’t learn the language, don’t contribute to the community, and don’t intend to stay. Make them pay back the cash if they leave within 5 years after their ruling ends.
Which leaves some expats confused, because… wasn’t that the plan all along?
Here I can speak in the first person: we know that we are seen as a contingent workforce. A touch of variety to the local fauna & flora, fertilising the economy as we hop from country to country in search of nectar. As long as most of us don’t stay, we’re not an invasive species.
The point of a fixed-term incentive is to get as much out of the workforce as possible in their productive years, without having to provide for them in old age.
Shortening and diluting of the ruling in the last years proves this point. Highly Skilled Migrants are still incentivised to come, they are still needed. But they are also welcome to leave.
Similarly, an argument can be made that it’s fair not to pay full taxes if you haven’t relied on the country before reaching a productive age.
A Highly Skilled Migrant contributes to the economy from day one. No public money has been invested in their healthcare and education.
Contrary to the locals, though, they need to take the cost and risk of relocating, and so it would seem fair that they are compensated for it. They don’t have a home in the new location and their pension takes a hit. This means that applying wealth tax to their foreign properties or savings wouldn’t be fair either.
Among the expats there is also a radical camp. High cost of living, high taxes, expensive health care, crap weather — you shouldn’t even be questioning why I need an incentive to be here, they say.
Like with the hostile locals, this is a small camp. The majority of Highly Skilled Migrants are just happy to receive the ruling and not make a song and dance about it. Just like the Dutch see them: expats are polite and their culture doesn’t bother others.
Some of the Highly Skilled Migrants will grow roots, if they happen to keep a good job, find a flat, meet friends and partners. Others will see how it goes, and if it doesn’t go great, after five years they will have one less reason to stay.
But during those first five years, nobody knows which is which, including the expats themselves. And so, the best plan is to stay put. Invest, but not so much to tie yourself down. Find friends, but maybe just other expats who are easy to connect with. Learn a bit of language. Keep checking out LinkedIn for jobs in other cities.
Do a little taster of how it’s like to live here, so that in five years, when you suddenly earn 1k less per month, you can make an informed decision if it’s worth staying.
In those five years, expats can be accused of making a poor effort at integrating, but the setup doesn’t encourage it, either.
Don’t get me started on the language, since I’ve mentioned it so many times. It’s not pretty or easy to pick up, has little value outside of this small country, and has to be learned in one’s spare time and out of own pocket. Sure, that’s what the tax break is for, but if it’s up to an individual to decide, realistically they will have other priorities in their budget.
The institutions who need and can afford Highly Skilled Migrants are multinational companies. Their employees will work in a group of other expats and their skill will be niche enough to only be relevant to another multinational company. As a result, it’s unrealistic for such a person to think about switching to a Dutch business.
I’ve described at length what it’s like to make friends and date as an expat. The social circle is not just your friends and partners, it’s also the community around you and even wider, the strangers you meet every day. And this wider Dutch community, just like I’ve described, is characterised by the prevalent sentiment of: “I’m not affected, so I don’t mind”. The easy-going character of the locals allows them to ignore the expats, for good and bad. Even if internally they are annoyed by the cash that expats get, they won’t make a big deal out of it, and just get on with their life.
On the plus side, this unbothered attitude promotes a peaceful coexistence. On the downside, it kills any curiosity in the Dutch about the expats and any motivation in the expats to fit with the Dutch.
I hear it in the uninterested, short smalltalk in polite English from any Dutch person I meet. It can be translated to: I get it, you’re one of the passing expats, coming here to have a good life for a few years and contribute to the economy. I’ll leave you be.
I sometimes wish they shouted back at me in their native language, as it would happen in Paris, Barcelona or even Berlin. It would mean: I want you to integrate! If you choose to live here, I need you to be a part of this community!
But no, they don’t need us to integrate, they understand we probably won’t. They assume we probably won’t. They just don’t care if we do or not.
That attitude of indifference in the Dutch, a very indirect and unplanned consequence of the 30% ruling, is the real reason for the transient character of Amsterdam.
It’s a city where everyone assumes that you may just be on a grown-up exchange program, so by absorbing the local atmosphere, you start to believe that yourself.
Eventually, when your ruling runs out, if you decide that it’s worth it to graduate from a nomad to a settler, you will likely settle outside of Amsterdam anyway. Maybe you’ll look for more space, more greenery, maybe you’ll want to hear Dutch on the streets and contribute to the community. Most likely, you’ll just be fed up with Amsterdam property prices, which have gone up a lot in the last few years, similarly to the number of Highly Skilled Migrants.
The Dutch attitude of “the 30% ruling doesn’t affect me, so I don’t have an opinion about it” ends when their house search starts. Without a doubt, they will find it very hard to buy a property, and at the same time, they will meet many foreigners who are to do it. And now they wonder: does the tax break for expats really not affect me? Or if an expat with spare cash didn’t overbid on the house I wanted, maybe it would’ve been mine?
And that’s how the expats, who are apparently polite and whose culture doesn’t bother others, have apparently caused the housing crisis in Amsterdam. But that’s a topic for next time.

Welcome! Happy to see you in the seventh part of my Vuejs Amsterdam Conference 2022 summary series, in which I share a summary of all the talks with you.
You can read my JSWorld Conference 2022 Summary series (in four parts) here, where I summarized all the first day’s talks. You can also find the previous Talks of the Vue Amsterdam conference 2022 in my blog.
After two and a half years, JSWorld and Vue Amsterdam Conference were back in Theater Amsterdam between 1 and 3 June, and I had the chance to attend this conference for the first time. I learned many things, met many wonderful people, spoke with great developers, and had a great time. On the first day the JSWorld Conference was held, and on the second and third days, the Vue Amsterdam.
The conference was full of information with great speakers, each of whom taught me something valuable. They all wanted to share their knowledge and information with other developers. So I thought it would be great if I could continue to share it and help others use it.
At first, I tried to share a few notes or slides, but I felt it was not good enough, at least not as good as what the speaker shared with me. So I decided to re-watch each speech, dive deeper into them, search, take notes and combine them with their slides and even their exact words in their speech and then share it with you so that what I share with you is at least at the same level as what I learned from them.
Everything you read during these few articles is the result of the effort and time of the speaker itself, and I have only tried to learn them so that I can turn them into these articles. Even many of the sentences written in these articles are exactly what they said or what they wrote in Slides. This means if you learn something new, it is because of their efforts.
Last but not least, I may not dig into every technical detail or live codings in some of the speeches. But if you are interested and need more information, let me know and I’ll try to write a more detailed article separately. Also, don’t forget to check out their Twitter/Linkedin.
Here you can find the program of the conference:

Sebastien Chopin — Co-Founder of Nuxt
Our mission at @nuxtlabs is to provide the best Developer Experience to deliver the best User Experience for your end users. We are doing this with Nuxt for six Years now.
Nuxt is a web framework for creating any kind of Vue app. That means you can do:
Since the beginning of Nuxt in October 2016 it has been downloaded about 46M times on npm, has 300k live websites, and 18k GitHub contributors.
This is a hello world bundle size comparison between Nuxt 2 and Nuxt 3:
One of the reasons Nuxt 3 is so much smaller is that it’s tree shakable, like Vue 3. So if you don’t use a feature, it will not be included in the bundle.
The Next equivalent bundle size is around 80kB.
In that Nuxt 3 JS bundle, 25.3kB are from Vue, and the 8.7kB left includes:
Edge Side Rendering — also named JavaScript containers by Ryan Dahl — is the capability of running JavaScript at the CDN nodes somewhere around the world close to the end user.
The advantages:
Some of the Edge computing providers right now:
Nuxt Content is a Nuxt module that reads Markdown, YAML, CSV, and JSON files in the content/ directory to create a powerful data layer for your application and Content V2 is out now with more features.
What’s coming for Nuxt 2.X:
What’s coming for Nuxt 3.0:
I hope you enjoyed this part and it can be as valuable to you as it was to me.
Over the next few days, I’ll share the rest of the talks with you. Stay tuned…

This month I am engaged in an experiment. Normally I spend a lot of time with my family, who live only a few doors away from my apartment in Amsterdam. However, they are on a month-long adventure to Great Britain, leaving me on my own. Rather than feeling sorry for myself, I am creating a month’s worth of exciting touristy plans where I am going to pretend to be a tourist in my own city.
I haven’t developed a full itinerary yet. Today, August 1st, I helped my family get to the train station, then came home and relaxed after several days of helping them pack for their own adventure, which consists of biking all over Great Britain and camping for a good portion of that time.
I am also getting started on creating a calendar. I am going to publish the first draft of it, which will consist of a few plans I’ve made in advance by necessity, such as making reservations for the Van Gogh Museum and my oncologist appointment, which was scheduled six months ago. I will add activities as they arise—some of which will be pre-planned, and some will be scheduled the way I most enjoy things: on the fly, depending upon my mood and the weather.
There are a number of things I don’t want to miss, such as going on a canal cruise or visiting some of the less…

Amsterdam is one of the most mysterious cities I have ever visited. Each time you believe you’ve witnessed everything, a mere stroll around the corner reveals that you’ve scarcely glimpsed its true essence.
Its history is marked by episodes of violence, stardom, and war. That can be seen in the buildings in the city. The old buildings bring stories from the past, while the new buildings show the path to the future.
I’ve frequented Amsterdam on several occasions, mainly for shopping. The shops in my hometown pale in diversity compared to the offerings in Amsterdam.
In 2022, I journeyed to Amsterdam with dual objectives: to experience my first boat ride and explore (as I’d heard) the largest Rituals store in Europe.
Navigating the canals was a first for me. Would it mirror the majesty portrayed in films? When the opportunity arose, I eagerly seized it!
Spoiler Alert: The experience fell short of the cinematic majesty.
Nonetheless, it proved to be a beautiful and enjoyable tour. Our guide shared historical insights, and I captured a series of photographs:

Cities and their spaces are designed experiences — we’re just not always aware we’re users. Within these spaces, we encounter countless touchpoints — physical, emotional, and social — all shaping the way we experience them.
With a background in product design and professional experience in UX, I’ve always understood user experience as something holistic, more than digital interactions. But during a recent trip to Amsterdam and Dubai, I noticed something deeper: cities themselves are designed experiences.
Walking through these two very different cities made me reflect on how much urban design and service design overlap. From the ease of getting around to the emotional tone a space creates, I started seeing each city as a living system — one with its own user flows, pain points, and design choices.
In this article, I share some of those observations from my personal experience and the UX lessons I took from them.
My trip began in Amsterdam —a city where user experience extends beyond screens, shaping how people move through their environment every day. One of the first things I noticed was how bikes aren’t treated as a leisure activity or exercise, but as the primary means of getting around. People bike everywhere, even to nightclubs.
Back home in Portugal, cycling is more of a weekend activity — something for fitness or family outings. In Amsterdam, it’s everyday life. That difference struck me, not just because it was unfamiliar, but because it revealed something deeper: how infrastructure shapes behavior, and how behavior, over time, becomes culture. The flat terrain, narrow streets, and widespread bike infrastructure all work together to make biking the most natural choice.
Design made it easy. Culture made it normal.
As I walked alongside the canals, passing locals on their bikes or stepping out of houseboats, I began to understand something about pace and emotional design. The layout of the city encourages slowness. Not in the sense of inefficiency, but in presence. The kind of design that makes you look around more, breathe slower, take things in. Amsterdam moves differently — both physically and emotionally. The environment isn’t just designed for mobility; it’s designed for human connection.
One small detail that caught my eye — and kept coming back to me — was something I might have overlooked if I hadn’t asked about it. I noticed strange hooks jutting out from the top floor facades of the narrow houses. Curious, I brought it up to the friend travelling with me, who had already been to Amsterdam and explained that these are centuries-old fixtures for moving furniture and goods through windows. The buildings are too narrow, the staircases too tight, and so people developed an outside-in system. A centuries-old solution to a simple but real problem:
“How do you get your couch into a house with stairs too small and steep to carry it up?”
It’s a quiet example of design under constraint. Faced with tight architecture (partly shaped by historic tax laws), people innovated through a humble, mechanical workaround. What struck me most is that it’s still used today. It reminded me of a moment in Urbanized, the documentary by Gary Hustwit, where it’s mentioned how the most meaningful urban innovations often come from the bottom up — citizens adapting space to fit real needs.
The second and final part of the trip was spent in Dubai. If Amsterdam felt spontaneous and human-scale, Dubai felt curated — like someone was handling it for me.
Getting around wasn’t just about driving — it was about being moved. From valet parking to full-service fuel stations where we never had to leave the car, every step of the journey felt taken care of.
Across both service and transport, I noticed a pattern: the city was designed to require less from me. Less friction. Less effort. Fewer choices to make. I could compare it to a seamless user journey where each step is thoughtfully designed, with no critical pain points.
In UX, we talk about reducing cognitive load and anticipating needs. In Dubai, it felt like that idea was everywhere. From how you moved to how you were received, the environment kept stepping in for you before you even realised what you needed.
As I settled into Dubai, it became immediately clear that the city was designed with an extraordinary level of attention to detail. In fact, it was so present that I almost didn’t realise it at first.
It wasn’t just that Dubai was clean — it was that someone was always cleaning it. From mall bathrooms to rooftop clubs, I saw staff quietly maintaining the space, constantly resetting it. And that’s when it hit me: it wasn’t just about upkeep; it was an integral part of the user experience.
Most people only notice cleanliness when it’s absent. In Dubai, it was so proactive and seamless that it became a continuous, visible signal of care. There was a sense that the space was always ready for you, that someone had already anticipated your needs. This wasn’t just about hygiene; it was about creating a sense of psychological safety, comfort, even luxury. Cleanliness here didn’t just make the space more pleasant; it made you feel valued. It told you: your experience matters. Everything was designed to make you feel supported, reducing mental load so you could simply exist in the moment without worry.
It reminded me of how digital services work in the background — updating, syncing, backing up — without you having to lift a finger. You don’t see it, but it builds a foundation of trust by keeping everything running smoothly. In Dubai, this same principle applied to the physical environment, where every detail felt carefully planned to keep things effortless.
Behind this seamless experience, of course, is a larger system of labor and structure. Dubai’s focus on high service standards relies on a workforce of trained individuals, which are migrant workers. Their work enables this constant care, and it’s important to acknowledge that the experience of ease and luxury is held up by a whole infrastructure designed to support it.
As a tourist, everything felt designed to be easy, polished, and thoughtful. Not just functionally, but emotionally. It was the kind of design that made you feel cared for, without even realising it.
On a final note, the most striking aspect of my travel experience was how I was addressed. I was consistently greeted with “madam”. It wasn’t just politeness. It was a signal — a small, repeated gesture that carried emotional weight.
You’re seen. You’re respected. You’re valued here.
And what struck me was how consistent it was. Whether I was at a humble restaurant or shopping, the tone didn’t change. The same level of care and attention showed up everywhere. That consistency created something rare: a shared emotional tone across different service levels.
In a way, this mirrored what I’d already been feeling in Dubai: that the city was designed not just to function well, but to make you feel looked after. The details weren’t loud — but they added up. And sometimes, all it takes is a single word to shape the emotional tone of an entire place.
Luxury in Dubai is easily accessible. The views are framed just right, designed to impress and soothe. You got the sense that someone had considered how you might feel at every turn.
Of course, none of this is accidental. Dubai’s focus on aesthetics and hospitality is a cornerstone of its identity. The city markets itself on these experiences. It is curated — carefully and deliberately — to feel seamless. But even knowing that, it still worked. What stayed with me wasn’t the imposing skyline or luxury touches, but the quiet signals of care: a clean space, fuel stops anticipating needs, and a respectful “madam” at every place. It reminded me that thoughtful environments — digital or physical — aren’t just designed for function. They’re designed to shape how we feel.
In Dubai, that feeling was clear: you’re being looked after. It was frictionless, anticipatory, and emotionally consistent. A good experience designed end to end.
Looking back, it’s clear how deeply our environment shapes our experience — often in ways we don’t even realise. Whether through frictionless mobility systems, services that anticipate needs, or subtle cues that build trust and emotional safety, thoughtful design operates on many levels at once.
What surprised me most was that, in a place known for innovation and cutting-edge tech, it wasn’t the digital interfaces that left the strongest impression. It was the experience of navigating the city itself — the people, the spaces, and the seamless care in every interaction.
Great user experience — whether in a product or physical space — isn’t just about usability. It’s about how we feel while interacting with it: confident, cared for, at ease.
This trip reminded me that UX and service design extend far beyond screens. Every touchpoint — human, digital, or physical — shapes the journey. And in the best cases, that journey feels seamless — not because it’s invisible, but because every detail works in harmony to support the user.
A note on context
The perspective in this article comes from my experience visiting Amsterdam and Dubai as a tourist. While my time in Amsterdam was shaped by exploring the city on my own, in Dubai I stayed with people who live there. That experience gave me a different kind of access — more immersive and seamless — which naturally shaped how I experienced and noticed the city.

When I woke up the next day I knew I was cooked. I’d wanted to go to Italy, but that wasn’t realistic anymore. My engine was puttering. Plus, I was almost out of Adderall. I only had 4 pills left, enough for one more day and a plane flight. So, by that math, I had one more night left.
Using the hostel computer, I booked a one-way ticket from Amsterdam to O’hare for the following day at 5pm (17:00). I also booked new lodging for my final night. It was an outdoor campy-type place about 20-minutes away from the city center. On their website, it looked more like a trailer park than a hostel. There were no amenities other than the communal grills, firepits, and bathrooms. It was definitely weird, but I didn’t mind weird, so I rolled the dice, hoping for a day of peace and quiet. I had a lot of notes to go through and memories to piece together, and that seemed like the perfect place to do it, away from the world, on mushrooms, in a trailer. That’s what Hunter Thompson would have done to make sense of a romp of that magnitude, and Hunter was my North Star.
After checking out of the hostel and saying goodbye to Karim, I went to take care of one last errand. What do you do when you’re completely exhausted and need a little extra pep that speed can’t give you? You buy shoes, of course. The right pair of shoes can give you super powers. Throw in a haircut, and you can defeat an army.
Before passing out at the concert, I remembered noting that Raekwon had on a snazzy pair of blue and red Nike Dunks. That’s probably what planted the seed. Plus, my brown low-top Converse were mangled and nearly unwearable. So, I set out on a mission to find the perfect pair of life-saving shoes to propel me through the rest of the trip.
After an hour of searching, I was just about to give up, when I saw them in the window of a skate shop. I immediately knew they were the ones. I stood staring at them like Wayne from Wayne’s World did with his dream guitar. They looked like beautiful chocolate covered bananas, immaculate, and completely in line with my style, other than the 130 Euro price tag. They were emergency medical shoes though, so cost be damned. (Insurance should really cover fly shoes).
I paid the guy right after lacing them up and gave him my old Converse to toss. I felt like a new man. I was ready for whatever the next 24 hours had to throw at me.
After buying some mushrooms (I still had a ton of weed left), I checked out of my hostel, called a taxi, and headed to the trailer park. Saying goodbye to Amsterdam wasn’t easy, which made the ride a little emotional for me. Throughout my hectic 6-week trip, Amsterdam had been my home base, a place where I always felt comfortable. For some reason I just fit in there. The city opened their arms for me — Willy Nelson, Karim, the bouncer at the Melkveg, Neil, even the pseudo-pimp who chose to spare my life— they all looked out for me at a time when I needed it most. I felt so grateful to all of them.
I saw hippies before I even got out of the taxi, which made me uneasy. (For someone who doesn’t like jamband music, I find myself around people who do quite often.)
“Don’t worry about the hippies,” I told myself, “ you’re motherfucking John McEnroe.”
I wanted to get into the mushrooms before the sun went down, so as soon as I familiarized myself with the trailer and the surrounding area, I got right to it. I’d purchased the same style of mushrooms I had before. I’m that way with everything. If I like something, I will continue with it until it burns me, be it restaurants, people, or socks. I always get out when the gettin ceases to be good.
I took them around 5pm and wandered around in my flip flops, waiting for them to kick in. When they did, they kicked in hard, like a mule or the DEA. I took the same amount as the last time, but for some reason I was 10 times as high. When I went back into my trailer to gather myself, the exact opposite happened. I completely freaked out. My vision wasn’t right. I had no clue what was going on. I grabbed a pen and wrote, “EVERYTHING IS RED”. There was a mirror in the trailer, and I made the mistake of staring into it. DO NOT make that mistake during a bad trip. During a good trip, maybe, but never during a bad one.
The mirror was firey red and my face was peeling off. Blood was dripping from my chin, it was a horrifying scene. There was also this awful sound, like the kind you hear when someone presses the red emergency button at a nuclear power plant. My brain was in crisis.
I splashed water on my face in an attempt to tamp down the flames, but it didn’t work, so I started removing my clothes. They had bad juju all over them, and they needed to go.
As I was taking my pants off I looked down. That’s when it hit me.
“I’m not wearing my shoes! What the fuck was I thinking!?”
As soon as I put them on, my vision went back to normal, and the blaring alarm in my head stopped. To make sure I wasn’t losing my mind (I was absolutely losing my mind), I took them off again. Everything turned red. I put them on once more. No red.
Then, I heard a knock at the door.
“OH SHIT,” I whispered, tossing on a new shirt.
If you’ve ever taken hallucinogens, you know a knock at the door is the last thing you want to hear. The sound itself is paralyzing. Anything can be behind that door, and I mean ANYTHING. There are no limitations to what the brain can conjure.
Then, there was a second knock.
They weren’t going to give up, I could feel it in my bones. I had to open the door and face my fears. Most trips, in some way or another, are about facing your fears.
I walked over to the door and placed my hand on it to see if I could feel any weird vibrations. Nothing.
Then I grabbed the knob and turned it slowly, hoping the person had already left. When I opened the door I was greeted by a smiling, shirtless hippie with dreadlocks.
“Hey, sorry if I scared you, man. I’m Liam. I wanted to invite you to join the group. We’ve got a fire going and we’re just jamming out. It’s pretty chill.”
While I tried to comprehend the words he was saying, he began staring down at my feet intently.
“Those shoes. They’re amazing,” He said, slowly.
“Trust me, I know. I’m really high on mushrooms and they just saved my life,” I told him, just as slowly.
“Ha, sounds intense. I’m on mushrooms too. We all are.”
Before I could tell him I didn’t do well in groups, Liam walked me over and started introducing me.
“This is Sam. He’s really high. Be nice to him.”
“Sweet shoes,” one of them said. “They look like chocolate covered bananas.”
“They do, don’t they?” I said, enjoying my inside joke.
We hung out for a few hours. They played their guitars while I just stared into the fire. We didn’t talk much, but it was nice. No one felt the need to fill the air with bullshit. We just utilized the good vibrations to enjoy our own thoughts. The red was a long lost memory, and the fire didn’t scare me one bit.
When the drugs started wearing off I thanked the guys for their company and made the walk back to my trailer to call it a night. To be safe, I kept my shoes on inside. I wasn’t going to make the same mistake twice. Lying in bed, I grabbed my notebook and a pen.
A+ in group setting
Was Johnny Mac a hippie?
AM I A HIPPIE?!
I stayed in bed until noon the next day, relaxing in silence and smoking joint after joint. I felt terrible about wasting weed and I still had a quarter ounce left that I didn’t want to just leave in my trailer. If I’d seen anyone on the property other than the manager I would have given it to them, but I didn’t. When the cab driver picked me up, I could tell he wasn’t an option either, so I just stuffed the remainder into my pants pocket, assuming I’d be able to give it away at the airport.
After the cab dropped me off, I stood right in front of the exit, next to the “No Weed Past This Line” sign, and held the baggie in my open hands. “Free weed, get your free weed. Take as much as you want. Free weed here,” I yelled like a peanut vendor. People just walked right past me though, one after the other. I was in disbelief. No one wanted free weed. Every 20-something that I stopped declined. Some said they had their own, while others declined based on strain preference.
“These snobby bastards,” I thought.
I stayed as long as I could, smoking cigs, and advertising my goods. After an hour of embarrassment I gave up and threw it in the garbage (just like the stand-up comedy fliers I used to pass out in exchange for stage time). I was pissed off for the first time since I’d been in Amsterdam. It wasn’t the weed thing, I was just irritable. I didn’t want to go home. Home was where the problems were, where that awful basement was and all those terrible memories. I had no place else to go though. It was my mom’s or nothing, at least for a little while.
And just like that, my trip was over. I felt trapped again.
The flight home was anxiety filled. Instead of reading or writing I just sat there and stewed. I’d quit comedy, graduated college, left to find myself, and returned to the same exact spot, completely clueless about what to do next. The only thing I knew was that stopping to mourn and take care of myself was not an option. I had to keep running, no matter the cost.

So, you are visiting The Netherlands? Don’t get stuck in Amsterdam- visit Texel! You will love it, and here is why.
Texel Island can be found in the North Eastern part of The Netherlands and is one of the five Wadden Islands, also known as the West Frisian Islands, where many city dwellers have chosen to escape the busy lifestyle and settle on this thriving yet peaceful island. The word “wadden” refers to the mudflats that appear with the ebb and flow of the tide. You are just there in under two hours from Amsterdam Schiphol airport by car — including the ferry.
Some even call it the “Ibiza of The Netherlands” which underlines the relaxed attitude by the locals and the existence of many beach clubs.
Here it is: my 5 favourite spots!
This area is part of National Park the Dunes of Texel and has an open connection with the North Sea. Wander around and discover the many creeks The Slufter has. Great for hikes, bird watching — over 80 species breed here every year.
The most northern part of the island had a giant stretchy beach with a pretty lighthouse built in 1863. This makes up for long evening sunset strolls. If you are in a sporty mood you can climb the inside of the historic lighthouse by day.
My favorite place for breakfast in the lovely unofficial capital of Texel — Den Burg. They offer free coffee or tea with a paid breakfast if you order before 10.53am — random, ha! Around the open kitchen you will find all types of sourdough bread, wonderful sweet pastries and lightly roasted coffee. Must visit. Location link (Google Maps) | Website
Visiting with kids? They will love Ecomare which educates and shows how they care for seals of all kinds. Don’t miss out on the daily seal feed every morning.
Location link (Google Maps) | Website
When I visit Texel I often go to this place. Get the best strawberries locally grown and picked here! If you are into it, you can wander around in the food gardens and pick your own vegetables and fruits for a small fee. You can also get buy local products here and take it with you before you depart to the ferry.

Hi, I’m Serhat from OpsGenie. I recently had the chance to go to Atlassian’s Connect Week event. I will try to share my experience at this amazing event.
I arrived in Amsterdam on Saturday afternoon and had the chance to visit lots of great places like the Van Gogh museum, the Rijksmuseum, the Heineken Experience…
On Monday morning, I went to Atlassian’s Amsterdam office at around 9:00 AM. There were many friendly people at the door who greeted me. I introduced myself and got my Atlassian Connect Week event t-shirt; then I went to the meeting area, where we had standup meetings throughout the week.
Luke Kilpatrick from Atlassian welcomed us, and everyone started introducing himself/herself. After the introductions, there were presentations about JIRA, Confluence, JIRA Service Desk, and others. I learned a lot about Atlassian products on Monday. At the end of the day, there was a happy hour event where I met great guys from all over the world. We talked about lots of things, including what our companies do and what our plans were for the week…
I will not go into the implementation details, but during the Connect week, I mainly worked on our HipChat Add-On updates together with Nick Turskyi from HipChat. On Tuesday, I completed one of our prime goals of providing an option to simplify HipChat messages that go into the room. Now, our messages are collapsible and don’t take so much space in the chat room, but they still show all the details when you extend the message or click the message to see all the details in the sidebar. It’s been implemented in a backward compatible way so that current customers who love the way it was can still use it the same way.
Wednesday started with a standup meeting where everyone said what they were working on and shared any problems they encountered. During the day, I scheduled meetings with JIRA, JIRA Service Desk and Confluence teams. There were lots of useful ideas on how to improve our current applications and add new ones to provide a complete workflow using Atlassian tools.
I added an unacknowledge action option to the HipChat sidebar. Now, users can unacknowledge their alerts — in addition to acknowledging and closing them — without leaving the HipChat room.
At the end of the day, Atlassian organized a trip to the Amsterdam Museum. It was a great trip, and we learned a lot about Amsterdam. After the trip, there was another happy hour next to the museum. After all that, we felt a bit hungry and decided to explore Indonesian food at Kantjil.
On Thursday, I had a meeting with a UI/UX team and got feedback on our HipChat Add-On. I implemented action buttons for the alert list view in the chat sidebar that makes executing actions faster. I also worked on implementing an add note action option, using HipChat dialogs. It was nearly done, but it could not be released (because of a bug). Thursday was intensive, because the next day would be our demo day!
Friday was our demo day, and I had the chance to present information about our product and about what I accomplished during the week. Many great companies shared their products and proved the strength of the Atlassian platform.
It was truly a great week in Amsterdam!
I met with developers from all over the world, learned a lot about their products, exchanged ideas, explored Amsterdam, and developed great Atlassian add-ons.
Take a look, below, at some of my other pictures from this wonderful week.
Oh: special thanks to Michael Lauricella from Atlassian, Nick Turskyi from HipChat, Hector Urtubia and Matt Pizzimenti from Olark, Nic from Fugue, and Brandon from PingPilot. This week would not have been as great without you guys!

Two weeks ago I decided Amsterdam would be my place to settle, hoping finally this would be the place for me and even though I had been warned by my peers and colleagues, I did all my homework, studied the market and told myself that it couldn’t be as hard as finding an apartment in China, where everybody just spoke Mandarin to do so.
I was extremely wrong, the market here is insane, maybe because we are in a post-covid season and the city is blooming with tourism, perhaps is the interest younger people have towards trying the so-called “legal drugs”, it might be due to the high season rental as schools and Universities are starting again or simply just a slip from the Dutch government when considering housing options for everybody.
The reality is that thousands of people are competing on a daily basis to find an apartment, a room or at least a long-term stay without paying a kidney and a half for it.
I got an Airbnb type of apartment via Expedia, it was a great deal for one week, only paying 917€ after my Genius 30%…

I’ve been more time as an adult in Amsterdam, than in my home country. In Amsterdam, there are many options for everything. But be careful. It’s so very easy to get lost in Amsterdam. For me Amsterdam is stressful.
Study
In Amsterdam, you will find all sorts of studying careers, and people are very free on choosing. Many Dutch people drop out in the first or second program because “they don’t like it”. And is very normal to try different things. Education is many times in English. However I would say that education can be very stressful because it’s a bit chaotic and challenging at the same time. You have to do everything by yourself, and teachers are more mentors than teachers. It’s like you never can really relax, and you have to think a LOT in every subject, because education here priorities thinking by yourself, they absolutely infinitely 100% hate things “by the book” (typical Dutch). Of course, you meet people from everywhere. Your colleagues are from everywhere. It can be stressful, especially if you come from cultures where “everything is organized”, where you know what you really gonna learn, where grades matter a lot, where everything has a specific linear way of being. In Amsterdam simply things are free.
Informality
Here no one likes any form of formality. Everything must be informal by default. No one absolutely no one cares about formal clothing, and genuinely everyone will hate that. It’s not…

Amsterdam moves. People walk briskly, bikes fly past, trams glide along their rails. Everyone seems to have a place to be, a purpose to fulfill. And yet, despite the chaos — bikes weaving through pedestrians, cars stopping and starting, boats slipping quietly through the canals — there’s a strange kind of order. No honking, no shouting, no visible frustration. Just movement. It feels like watching a symphony with no conductor, a city that somehow just knows how to keep itself in rhythm.
I sit by a restaurant window and watch it all unfold. The rain-speckled glass blurs the edges of passing figures, turning them into something out of a painting. I catch glimpses of them — sharp jawlines, loose scarves, hands tucked into the pockets of long coats. I find myself romanticizing over every woman that walks by, assigning them stories they’ll never know they’ve been given. She’s on her way to meet a friend. She’s heading home after a long day at work. She’s just as lost in thought as I am.
And then there are the couples. The ones who share a cigarette outside a café, the ones who lean into each other on their bikes, the ones who don’t need words to fill the space between them. I am content here, alone, but I can’t help but envy them. Amsterdam is beautiful on its own, but I imagine it would be even better when shared.
The Dutch language wasn’t a necessity — I could’ve gotten by just fine without it — but I’m glad I learned it anyway. Even simple exchanges feel like small victories, a way of stepping further into this place instead of just passing through it. And the food? The beer? It all just sits better. There’s a freshness to it, a simplicity. I don’t leave meals feeling sluggish, just satisfied.
Maybe that’s the feeling I’ll take home with me — not just the admiration, not just the longing, but the quiet contentment of being here. The realization that I don’t have to understand how everything works to appreciate that it does.

By Johannes Novy
When COVID hit the Netherlands in 2020, Amsterdam emptied of visitors overnight. Long-term residents, inured to the permanent noise and litter and tourists peeing in the streets, welcomed the newfound tranquillity. The pandemic, they told the Washington Post, was “a blessing in disguise”.
COVID has offered a rare, if not unique chance to address tourism’s enduring problems. From how people reach destinations to how tourism is managed within the cities it floods, not to mention the way its benefits and costs are distributed to local communities, the burden of overtourism has long been a concern.
Amsterdammers aren’t the only city dwellers to perceive the current pause as a much needed relief. From Kyoto to Venice, residents see a return to pre-pandemic tourist numbers as a threat, not a promise.
For years, we’ve been told that tourism needs to be sustainable, without much consensus on what sustainable tourism looks like. COVID, meanwhile, has seen the term “resilience” become a go-to for industry insiders and policymakers. But what exactly is resilient tourism? And can it make our cities any more socially and environmentally responsible? Can it make them any better to live in?
Broadly conceived as the ability to manage adversity, resilience is touted as an essential quality for coping with uncertainty and change, stress and shock. As trends go, resilience isn’t new. It was Time Magazine’s environmental buzzword of the year in 2013. It has since become one of the dominant tropes in contemporary debate on everything from island studies and child psychology to urban disaster risk reduction.
The pandemic has of course brought global tourism to a virtual standstill. In 2020, 1 billion fewer international trips were made to tourist destinations than in 2019. Up to 120 million jobs were threatened. So thinking about how this industry, which previously supported one in ten jobs worldwide, might cope with the stress and shock of COVID is no bad thing.
However, critical geographers and political sociologists alike have warned that the concept of resilience is in danger of becoming as empty a notion as sustainability. It has its roots in ecological and engineering thinking, wherein it refers to the ability to return to normal － to a state of equilibrium — after a period of adversity. Critics argue though that, in the social world, we deal not with equilibrium structures, but constant flux.
In a city, there is no normal state to return to. And those affected by natural hazards — a coastal mega-city prone to flooding, say — were vulnerable to begin with. Returning to an original state is therefore as undesirable as it is impossible. Instead, cities adapt.
More broadly, resilience thinking is deemed inherently conservative. With the emphasis it places on bouncing back, it is underscores reactive and short-term solutions. These distract from the need to address the root causes of major challenges such as climate change.
It is also not as harmless a theory as it may seem. When politicians insist that investing in a more resilient city is plain common sense, they often downplay issues of power and inequality. New Orleans is a case in point. Rebuilding after hurricane Katrina in 2005 came at enormous social cost, when the city privileged economic gain over the needs of marginalised communities.
Resilience is nonetheless an elastic concept, and it is increasingly associated not only with the ability to bounce back after a setback, but also to bounce forward — to a new and better state. The UK government’s slogan “ Build Back Better”, has become the mantra for a myriad post-COVID ambitions, particularly with regard to tourism.
That said, as travel restrictions are lifted and the cruise ships return to Venice’s St Mark’s Square, mere weeks after the Italian government promised they wouldn’t, it looks like this golden opportunity to rethink tourism has been lost.
Governments generally seem more interested in a return to business as usual than in thinking about how much tourism we can actually afford. Calls to come up with a fairer, less exploitative model have, at best, been met with a muted political response. Governments appear loath to discourage business trips, despite climate scientists advocating for less air travel, because they bring in money.
Any attempt to make tourism truly resilient, however, has to go further than short-term economic recovery. It has to address the tourism sector’s carbon footprint and its injustices and ethical quandaries.
In this respect, Amsterdam presents an interesting model. COVID has accelerated the implementation of several measures under consideration well before the pandemic took hold. The city has adopted ordinances that variously prevent souvenir shops from displacing local businesses, developers from turning residential spaces into holiday lets, and new hotels from being built.
Elsewhere, it has hiked up the tax tourists pay for overnight stays and introduced measures to reduce the so-called incivilities (littering, public urination) they unthinkingly leave behind.
More broadly, it has become the first city ever to embrace British economist Kate Raworth’s doughnut economics model for sustainable development. This theory centres on the environment and the basic needs of its citizens as opposed to economic growth. The council has pledged to use it as a guideline for all future policies that govern urban life — from emissions regulations to fixing the city’s housing crisis.
It is still too early to say whether these efforts will pay off. Without a similarly bold rethink, though, more residents will likely rebel against the touristification of their communities. If, on the other hand, more cities follow the Dutch capital’s example (as Copenhagen, Brussels, Dunedin in New Zealand and Nanaimo in Canada are reportedly doing), the idea of a real bounce forward might indeed apply.

Our luggage and other heavy things have all been stashed in an L-size locker at Amsterdam Centraal. Sweet! Aww, my inner child jolted as soon as we exited Amsterdam Centraal. At the same time, my eyes caught a lady skipping happily toward someone who seemed to be waiting for her. A display of simple human happiness. I thought momentarily, ‘Wow, there are so many people here!’ It seems the weekend atmosphere had contributed to the crowd. And that crowd! This sight quickly reminded me how ‘international’ this city — or country — is.
Stepping out of the square, the tram rails are lined right up next to the road. The way they weave together looks a bit messy on the asphalt. I’ve seen similar setups in other places, but I still find it a bit tricky to wrap my head around all these different modes of transportation crammed together. I prefer things to be a little plainer.
To cross the road, I found myself a bit disoriented at first; I wasn’t sure if there was a designated area for crossing. Later that day, Bu Jeannie used the phrase ‘Indonesian way.’ Sekar and I, after observing the traffic situation, also mentioned it and joked about doing it the ‘Indo way.’
We’ve got Google Maps in hand. We try to be wise with our batteries. We want to use Sekar’s phone for navigation and my phone for taking pictures. The direction is facing the city: heading…

I idly watched tiny droplets of moisture licking at the plane’s wings as cotton wool clouds and sparkling sunbeams made way for a sea of green and grey, followed by a seemingly-endless taxi along the runway. Almost as soon as I’d left the UK, I was in Amsterdam for a springtime mini break. The grey skies above did nothing to dull my spirit as I muddled through the train system and took a final, deep breath of city air. That’s right. After a pretty hefty hiatus from Medium, I’m back — and accompanied by tales from a small European country known as The Netherlands in April 2025.
As I left the station, I was hit instantly with the lingering aroma of marijuana, coupled with street music and a relentless stream of bicycles. Weaving through tiny streets, the constant bang bang bang of my suitcase wheels on the cobbles grew more comforting than annoying. Finally, after a few wrong turns, I could see the sign for my hostel just up ahead.
I had a little time to kill and so resolved to head out on foot. I ended up down a major shopping street, but resisted the urge to pop into the large Primark. Scattered…

I first visited Amsterdam in March for less than a week and absolutely loved it! I connected with new family members, made friends, and saw all of the incredible attractions of the city. The city is gorgeous, with endless canals and narrow streets. Everyone bikes, and people put a lot of effort into keeping the city beautiful and full of flowers. It’s also a diverse, young city, which creates a great community for newcomers. Plus, the everyday fashion in Amsterdam is incredible. Everyone always looks put together, especially in the city center. Unsurprisingly, the clothing stores are beautiful and curated to classic European style. If you’re visiting Amsterdam, dress to impress!
There is so much to love about Amsterdam, which is why I decided to rent a house for about five weeks in Linjden, Amsterdam. Linjden is southwest from the city center, suburban, quiet, and I always felt safe! Just two minutes away from my house was a cute goat farm, and two minutes away from that one was another (smaller) goat farm. The more I explored the area, the more goats I found! My house was on Hoofdweg, which was the perfect neighborhood to go for long walks in. The only downside is that it typically takes an hour to get into the city (30 minute tram ride), and it is a 30 minute walk to the nearest grocery store. Of course, you can always rent a bike.
I spent most of my time enjoying the suburbs of Amsterdam, but I was able to explore a significant part of the city as well. In March, I already visited most of the tourist attractions, so I was able to relax and revisit my favorites. Below, I have listed some of my top places and recommendations that can help you when visiting Amsterdam!
Sightseeing & Experiences:
Food:
Desserts:
Museums:
Queer bars:
Thrift/Vintage Stores:
I hope that this list of recommendations is helpful if you visit Amsterdam!
During my five weeks here, several friends from home visited me. My three friends from the US visited during my first week, which was mostly a disaster. Traveling with groups can be difficult, but I’m still glad that they visited me! I would happily travel with any of them again. Then later in my trip, my friend from college, Danicia, and her girlfriend stayed with me for a few nights. I have not seen Danicia since my freshman year of college at UConn and now she is living in Germany!
A couple of months ago in Dublin, I met Ariane and she was planning on coming to Amsterdam with a friend. When that plan didn’t work out, I offered her a place to stay at my house in Linjden. We went to MOCO, ate sushi, took a canal tour, and had a drink at Black & Blue on Reguliersdwarsstraat. The next day, we visited the Anne Frank House, ate pancakes, and walked to the Royal Palace. We also went to Cafe Saarein for some beers and a couple games of pool, and then had a stroopwafel at Van Wonderen. Later in the evening in the Red Light District, we had dinner at an Argentinean restaurant and drinks at Cafe’t Mandje. It was a busy, amazing couple of days!
Throughout my trip, I was able to visit some family members that I first met in March. I grabbed lunch with my cousin, Gosia, and my younger cousin, Indra, visited for a day. From TripBff (a travel app), I also met Diena and her friends, who were all solo travelers. During the second half of my time in Amsterdam, I hung out with a new friend, Isa, a few times and we explored some great restaurants together. I am so glad that I was able to meet some new and old friends here!
Amsterdam is a great city that I highly recommend visiting. As always, please reach out if you want solo travel tips or other recommendations!

Have you ever imagined immersing yourself in one of the world’s most dynamic and thrilling cities, all while advancing your career? This is the story of my remarkable journey.
As a young software engineer employed at a reputable multinational company in India, the opportunity to embark on a two-month onsite assignment in Amsterdam was nothing short of a dream come true. The mere thought of exploring Europe had always danced at the periphery of my aspirations, yet, as someone from India, such an adventure often felt distant and financially out of reach.
But I persevered, putting in the hard work and dedication necessary to secure this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Finally, the moment had arrived when I could set foot in Amsterdam, and I was filled with boundless gratitude for having reached this significant milestone. Now, let me share with you the captivating journey that unfolded, as I discovered the city’s perfect blend of work and play, and why it has become a place I’ll cherish forever.
One electrifying week before the grand adventure, I embarked on a whirlwind of preparations. With a fresh haircut and meticulous grooming, I was ready to step into the unknown. The day of departure finally dawned, and my parents joined me for a heartwarming farewell at the airport. The excitement in the air was palpable as I embarked on a journey I had been eagerly awaiting.
The flight seemed to stretch on, but the moment we touched down at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, I was immediately captivated by the city’s breathtaking beauty. The sight was a feast for the senses, a stunning welcome to this new chapter in my life. My heart raced with anticipation as I hopped into a sleek Tesla taxi. The streets were teeming with high-end cars, and the buzz around Tesla was infectious. Riding in one was nothing short of a thrilling adventure, marking the exhilarating start of my Amsterdam odyssey.
I arrived at my home around 5 p.m., and it was already dark outside. I had never experienced this in India, where the sun sets much later. My friend and I were so excited to be in Amsterdam that we decided to make dinner and go to bed early so that we could wake up early the next morning and start exploring.
I was nervous on my first day at the office in Amsterdam. I had never been to the city before. But as soon as I walked in, I was greeted by warm smiles from my new colleagues and clients.
My Indian colleagues introduced me to everyone, including my Dutch clients. I was immediately struck by how friendly and welcoming everyone was. My client even asked me about my journey to Amsterdam and how I was settling in.
At lunchtime, I went out with my senior colleagues, we had a delicious meal together. We talked about everything from what we needed to settle in, to the Dutch culture, and some places to travel. I felt so comfortable and at ease.
By the end of the day, I had made a lot of new friends in the office and learned a lot about the company and the city. I was so grateful for the warm welcome I had received.
Through the days, I effortlessly adapted to the Amsterdam culture and people, and I also explored the city’s many attractions. I was captivated by Amsterdam’s distinctive beauty. My personal experience revealed five compelling reasons why Amsterdam stands out as an exceptional destination for both work and leisure:
Canals that Captivate: Amsterdam’s intricate network of canals is a sight to behold, earning it the nickname “Venice of the North.” The reflection of gabled houses in the still waters, along with charming bridges and tree-lined streets, creates a picturesque scene that is reminiscent of a fairytale. For example, the Prinsengracht Canal is home to many beautiful 17th-century houses, while the Keizersgracht Canal is known for its elegant mansions. The canals are also a great place to spot boats and people-watch.
Historical Charm: Amsterdam’s well-preserved architecture stands as a testament to its rich history. As you stroll through the city, you’ll encounter stunning 17th-century buildings, each with its own unique character and story, offering a glimpse into the city’s past. For example, the Anne Frank House is a poignant reminder of the city’s role in World War II, while the Royal Palace is a magnificent example of Dutch Baroque architecture. The city’s canals are also lined with historic buildings, such as the gabled houses of the Jordaan neighborhood.
Cultural Diversity: The city is a melting pot of cultures, and this diversity is reflected in its art, food, and people. From world-class museums like the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum to vibrant neighborhoods like De Pijp, there’s a cultural richness that adds to the city’s allure.
Laid-back atmosphere: Amsterdam has a relaxed and easy-going atmosphere. I appreciated the friendly demeanor of the locals, as it was quite common for strangers to exchange warm greetings with smiles. In all my travels to various countries, I had never witnessed such a welcoming attitude towards strangers.
Diverse workforce: Amsterdam has a diverse workforce, with people from all over the world living and working in the city. This diversity makes for a vibrant and exciting work environment.
Bicycle-Friendly Bliss: Amsterdam’s flat terrain and extensive network of cycling lanes make it a cyclist’s paradise. The sight of countless bicycles whizzing past historic sites, parks, and picturesque canals is not only beautiful, but it is also an embodiment of the city’s eco-friendly ethos. Conveniently, there are bicycle pumps attached to some bicycle areas for filling tires.
Amsterdam is a foodie’s paradise, with a wide variety of restaurants and dishes to choose from, whether you’re looking for a quick bite or a leisurely meal. I sampled some of the city’s most famous dishes, including:
Poffertjes: Small pancakes often served with powdered sugar, fruit, or syrup.Stroopwafels: Thin waffles filled with sweet syrup.Stamppot: Traditional Dutch mashed potatoes with vegetablesErwtensoep: Popular Dutch pea soup, also available in vegetarian versions.
My love for the delicious waffles was only surpassed by my visit to Zaanse Schans, Amsterdam’s old town, where I sampled a variety of delectable cheeseses. I promise you, they were incredibly tasty!
My two months in Amsterdam were an unforgettable experience. I had the opportunity to work on a challenging project, meet new people from all over the world, and explore a beautiful and vibrant city. I also had the chance to travel to other parts of Europe, which was a dream come true.
I’m so grateful for the opportunity I had to live and work in Amsterdam. It was an experience that has changed me for the better. I made lifelong friends, learned new things, and created memories that will last a lifetime.
When it was time to leave, I was sad to say goodbye to my new friends and the city I had come to love. But I know that I will return one day. Amsterdam has a special place in my heart, and I can’t wait to go back and explore more.
Vincent van Gogh once said, ‘Amsterdam is a city of dreams, and I am a dreamer.’
I couldn’t agree more. Amsterdam is a city that inspires creativity and imagination. It’s a city where anything is possible. If you’re looking for a city that will challenge and inspire you, Amsterdam is the place for you.
I hope that this blog post has given you a glimpse into my experience in Amsterdam. If you’re ever thinking about visiting this amazing city, I highly recommend it!

1 week (or forever if you can)
Wow! I honestly love Amsterdam so much! The people seem so at ease with life and It is a very liberal spiritual place. Everyone is very open minded and accepting of anyone.
Amsterdam is mainly Dutch people so a lot of the people are very tall and blond. Another thing to consider is prostitution, weed, and psychedelics such as truffles are legal despite this everyone seems incredibly responsible and people seem to keep a good balance of life in Amsterdam. It really is the happiest and most open minded place I’ve been to so far and that’s why it is my favorite place so far.
Right from Amsterdam Central you can take a free ferry that will take you to NDSM and it takes about 5–10 mins to get there and the Ferry comes constantly I honestly felt like I never had to wait for one. NDSM is a hip urban area with lots of cool graffiti and hip restaurants to check out. Not to mention the interesting places you can stay at like the Crane hotel oh and you can also bungee jump from it, if you decide to. The area also has lots of special events such a music festivals, flea markets, and movie nights. Its a great place to check out and Its not too crowded so it’s nice getting away from all the people in the main area.
This may be one of my favorite museum trips that I have gone on so far. I really liked that it focused on one artist throughout, and I felt like I really got to see Van Gogh’s life and how it affected his art. I have to say I am a HUGE Van Gogh fan, I really love his brush strokes and his bright use of color. I felt like I got pulled into every single painting diving into each brush stroke and seeing the lines up close then pulling back to see the full picture that he created. I don’t know how he did it but he made each scene look so serene and stylized.
I need to also mention the sensory room where each room you get the senses that Van Gogh was feeling throughout his life. I thought it was so creative because I truly felt like I was living and seeing the things that Van Gogh felt.
I mean you honestly can’t go to Amsterdam without going to the Red Light District at least once. Walking through the red light district you can’t take any photos. You basically see women in windows with red lights above them in their underwear standing or sitting, and they kind of look bored or like their busy looking at their phone. It was an interesting experience but one to definitely check out and experience once.
One of the most unforgettable experiences I have had so far, A’dam lookout is where you go on the top of one of the buildings and there are these 2 electric swings that basically swing you back and fourth for about 2 mins. It was seriously such a magical feeling I honestly felt like I was on top of the world and flying for a second. I will admit it was really scary because you are so high up and you look down and don’t see anything right under you but it is one of the things that you can’t really forget because you just feel so much.
The canal tour is so worth it, you basically just go down the canals throughout the city, it is so fun to see all the little boat houses right on the canals.
I personally really liked the Mocco museum because it had more urban graffiti artists such Banksy, icy & slot, Koons and Warhol. They also had a 3D installation room where you walk into a room in the style of Lichtenstein (which is the bright comic book style with bold colors and lines throughout). The museum is not that big but I kind of like that, your not overwhelmed by all of the art and you can engage in each and every one. Each piece had a strong statement about freedom and freedom of expression.
I checked out multiple psychedelic shops (there were many) and these 2 stood out the most to me.
Kokopelli was very informal and the staff really knew their stuff and loved to talk about it, they sold lots of other interesting things such as Brazilian herbs to help with lucid dreaming. Or seeds that you can grow and eat for different types of needs. They even had an area where you can sit and take your shrooms if you decide to buy it from them.
Alien Visitors s a fun small raver type of shop, with techno music playing and neon fluorescent items throughout the store. I ended up buying a really cute black shirt with some green neon print designs down the middle. It wasn’t too crazy with the designs like how some raver shirts can get a little tacky when its overplayed and I really love the pattern on it.

Today marks five years since I moved from my country to Europe, gradually settling into the vibrant life of Amsterdam. This year is my second year in the Netherlands and five years in Europe overall. This milestone feels like the right moment to reflect on the journey so far. I’m grateful for the personal and professional growth along the way — it’s been quite a journey. I first landed in Berlin, but soon after, COVID hit, and finding a job was a real challenge during that time. After gaining experience living in Berlin, I wanted to see if there was a better place before fully committing to Germany, so I decided to look for opportunities outside of Berlin. Eventually, I found a job in Amsterdam. As things slowly started to recover, the war began, adding another layer to the experience.
My connection with Berlin runs deep. I’ve had a long relationship with the city since my early 20s, when a few of my friends moved there from St. Petersburg and helped me explore Berlin from within. The city quickly became a familiar and vibrant part of my life, with friends and unforgettable experiences. I met my boyfriend just before moving there myself (now my husband) which made the transition even more meaningful. Berlin was more than just a place to live! :) It felt like a second home. Being there was a dream come true in a natural and seamless way.
Our move to Amsterdam was driven by curiosity and a sense of uncertainty about our future in Germany. It takes a lot of effort to fully integrate there and to acknowledge the challenges of living in Germany. Here in the Netherlands, I’ve found a country that values directness, innovation, out-of-the-box thinking, and problem-solving — a motivating environment that has enabled me to grow both professionally and personally.
Sometimes, I feel like a character in Atlas Shrugged, navigating a landscape that mirrors Germany today — a system entangled in endless layers of rules, bureaucracy, reluctance to change, and a fear of moving forward that places increasing demands on companies. Germany feels like a perfect analogy to the world described in the book, where innovation is stifled by rigid structures and a lack of forward thinking. In contrast, the Netherlands represents a refreshing example of how things should operate, with efficiency, innovation, and a practical approach to problem-solving that brings real results.
Having spent years in the digital industry, focusing on process optimization, self-service, and enhancing customer experience, I’ve developed a unique perspective on understanding challenges and identifying opportunities. The Dutch approach to digital transformation, with its emphasis on innovation and efficient governance, aligns closely with my values in creating effective systems and customer-centric solutions. This kind of forward-thinking approach isn’t something I found at a national level in Germany. I know many entrepreneurial people working hard to drive change, but Germany requires significant structural shifts to address the crises ahead. Neglecting change and innovation will make it increasingly difficult to overcome these challenges.
My journey began in Berlin, where I experienced Germany’s intense focus on rules, processes, and seemingly endless layers of bureaucracy. In Amsterdam, I discovered a dynamic, flexible mindset, where people think outside the box — and, most importantly, where people, companies, and even bureaucracies focus on solving problems, not creating more. Both countries have their strengths, yet the Netherlands’ agility and commitment to achieving real outcomes — not just outputs — have made me fall in love with the country and see hope for Europe’s future.
As I look back on these five years, I’m excited about what lies ahead. Amsterdam has become more than just a place to live! It’s a community that drives my curiosity and keeps me moving forward. I look forward to continuing this journey, bringing fresh perspectives to the digital industry, and helping to solve the challenges that await us all in Europe.

1980 ~ Amsterdam, the Netherlands
Our expectations were not high when we finally entered the Eighties. The economic recession was underway; nine percent of the Dutch workforce was unemployed — including most of my friends. The Cold War raged over our heads, principally between the United States and the Soviet Union, and we assumed our territory would end up being the eventual nuclear battlefield. It looked like the somber adage of the Punk movement- No Future — would become a reality.
In the lesbian anarchist artsy milieu of hippies, squatters, punkers, musicians, and thieves, which was my habitat, our feeling was: ‘Let’s make it to 1984 first.’
Our life as lesbians is interwoven with a hippie background, anarchist Emma Goldman’s adage ‘If I can’t dance to it, it’s not my revolution’, and the motto of another radical, Jill Johnston, ‘All women are lesbians except those who don’t know it yet’. The energy of the punk movement is in our hairstyles, the fashion of New Wave in our jackets and shoes, and the political consciousness of the women’s movement in the spaces we claim give those threatening times a dynamic twist.
Right after our old Queen Juliana announced her abdication, the slogan: Geen woning geen kroning, No Housing No Crowning — is scrawled all over the city’s walls. This ominous message comes from the squatting movement. The die has been cast. We don’t love her daughter Beatrice yet, who will be crowned Queen on April 30 at a party for nobility, royalty, and other rich folks. Amsterdam has changed from a free port to an impenetrable fortress where you need a pass to walk through the streets, and the noise of helicopters hovering over the city for days drives us crazy. I don’t live in a squat; I’m not precisely adventurous that way. I pay proper rent and work as a cook in the Melkweg. But I do support the causes of the squatters: It seems criminal to leave buildings vacant. Speculation with scarce space means that buildings are left empty for years. Amsterdam looks like a rotting set of teeth because of the holes.
On Leap Day of the year 1980, I am sitting in the women’s cafe Saarein with a lezzy from Bologna, Italy, whom I met (through the informal International Lesbian Network. We toast our friendship and the International Lesbian Solidarity with espresso and Genever when the door is pushed open. A group of ruggedly dressed when women enter the café. Their eyes are shining with excitement. ‘We won’, they sing. A woman with a red-yellow Mohawk holds a transistor radio at her ear, tuned to Radio Stad, a local radio station. A large group of squatters chased off three platoons of Riot Police; in the Vondelstraat, ‘The hillbillies couldn’t handle it anymore,’ a triumphant voice shouts, Police officers are summoned from all over the country, to stop the squatters. Within ten minutes, they‘re chased out. The gals order beer and keep repeating the story of the inglorious retreat of the policemen under a shower of rocks.
A line has begun to form for the bathroom. Women enter in groups and come out with a wild look in their eyes, snorting. On the flush tank lies a cleanly wiped pocket mirror. The downstairs group has gathered to go and support the squatters. They want the café to close and all of us to join them. After fierce deliberation, the café stays open and promises to refer new women to the place of action. We decline the invitation. We have something else to do. We are going to an opening.We are going to an opening. Our friend Karen Kverneness from Seattle sells confection art in her shop, Art Something, on Herengracht. The art is stacked on shelves and a few large display tables like in a regular store.
Tonight, a new series from New York has arrived. Karen sells leather files with a safety pin stuck through them for twelve guilders and thirty cents apiece.’Betty goes punk,’ it says, cut-out newspaper letters. A straight-looking girl has photographed herself with punk bands from New York City.
The cream of the lesbian crop and other art freaks are feasting on American onion soup yogurt dip, flown-in bagels with cream cheese, root beer, and Four Roses bourbon. A blond, short-shaved nightingale in a men’s suit stands behind a black box with a keyboard. Touching only one key, she plays a rhythmic chord. It sounds cheerful and fresh. Her voice is like a gift from heaven, and we listen breathlessly.
At KK’s party, people sympathize with the squatters, but no one else wants to go and look, so the Bolognesi and I walk together through a bleak and empty Vondelpark to the Vondelstraat.
The atmosphere on Constantijn Huygensstraat is surreal. The bridge is full of loose paving stones, and barricades are on the corner of Roemer Visscherstraat. There is no triumphant frenzy here — more like a terse tension. From the front of the squatted house hangs a police cap as a trophy.
A group of boys talk persistently to a drunken friend who hangs back, babbling. But most of the dialog is inaudible to us. A group of intertwined figures sits beside an oil lamp, listening to a small transistor radio. A boy who wears heavy winter clothes and a black helmet stops us. ‘What are you here for?’ ‘To look, I answer. “We have no place for busybodies.’ He turns around to indicate that he is done talking. From the group of people, one figure detaches. I recognize Tilt, a woman I know from the women café. She climbs over the barricade and walks with us for a while.” They’re excited, the men. The testosterone is racing through their veins. They expect the riot police, and they want to fight. Boys will be boys.”She jabs me in the side.” I understand them. My testosterone is licking me, too,’ she continues, “and tickling me as well. I want to have sex. We only let people in we’re sure of. If you want to fight with us, you are welcome, but you — you, old hippie you — violence is not your thing.”She is right. My heart is hippy. We shake hands, Tilt slaps us on our shoulders, and we hear her crooked laugh as she walks away.

I recently traveled to Amsterdam and cannot wait to share my experience with you. It has so much to offer and is one of my favorite cities. Since this is the perfect time to visit Amsterdam, I am sharing with you the must do things in Amsterdam and as well as some interesting facts about the lively city.
Did you know?1) Amsterdam derived its name from the Amstel River.2) There are 165 Amsterdam canals that combine for a length of over 100 kilometers. The Canal Ring became part of the UNESCO World Heritage list in 2010.3) Amsterdam has more bridges than Venice. How difficult is that to believe? But there are only, in fact, 409 bridges connecting Venice’s canals. Amsterdam actually has 1,281 bridges, three times as many as Venice!4) There are approximately 2,500 houseboats in Amsterdam.5) The tilted houses are called dancing houses. The soil was so swampy that they had to build on stilts and that caused them to wobble and sink into the river.6) The number of bicycles in Amsterdam is more than the number of people living in the city.7) Amsterdam has approximately 20 times more tourists throughout the year than the locals.8) Amsterdam is one of the top 25 safest cities in the world and also one of the top 15 cities known for its high standard of living. Who would have thought, with all the marijuana and prostitution?9) A study reveals that Dutch men are the tallest people in the world.10) Amsterdam lies below the sea level and is among the top five coffee consuming cities in the world.11) Amsterdam Stock Exchange is the oldest stock exchange in the world.12) Same-sex marriage is legal in Amsterdam. The Netherlands was the first country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage.
How to travel around Amsterdam
The best way to explore the city is either on a bike or on foot. Even if you only pedal around for a few hours, riding a bike is an essential Amsterdam experience. There are over 800,000 bicycles in Amsterdam. That’s more bikes than people! The city also has a flat landscape, which makes cycling so much more fun and enjoyable, and is also one the world’s most cycle-friendly cities with separate cycling paths throughout the entire city. You can also use public transport such as buses, trams, and metros, which are very well connected in the entire city.
Best time to go to Amsterdam
The city is always buzzing with tourists year round, particularly being busier from April to September because it is warmer in those months. I traveled in April and it was extremely busy, but I had a great time. It would be ideal to book your stay ahead of time if you are going to travel in the peak tourist season as almost everything gets booked.
Here is a list of the must do things in Amsterdam:
2) Canal cruise — Besides providing a stunning backdrop to the city’s historical center, floating down Amsterdam’s canals is one of the most memorable ways to discover the city’s sights and attractions. Whether you’re a first-time or frequent visitor, everything in Amsterdam seems a bit more magical when viewed from a boat.
Most canal cruises take around an hour, which gives you an opportunity to explore Amsterdam’s UNESCO protected Canal Ring and discover plenty of interesting facts about the city along the way. There are various tours operating on the water and you could pick up one quite easily as per your location and requirements.
3) Explore museums — Amsterdam is home to over 50 museums, exploring the diversity of history, art, culture, and educational fun. There are museums to suit everyone’s interest. Some of the most famous museums are Van Gogh Museum, Rijksmuseum, and Anne Frank House.
4) Go beer tasting — Amsterdam is the home of the Heineken headquarters. The Heineken experience is a must see for all visitors. I had a great experience where they showed the brewing process, innovations, ingredients used, etc., and at the end of the tour also gave two free beers. Some other interesting breweries that I would also recommend are Brouwerij de Prael, Brouwerij ‘t IJ, and Butcher’s Tears.
5) Food, bars, and pubs — Amsterdam is well-known around the world as a city of indulgences. Here is a list of famous Dutch food you have to try:Stroopwafel — consists of a syrup filling sandwiched between two thin waffles. (Best when hot). Try the one at Banketbakkerij Lanskroon or Albert Cuyp Market.Dutch Cheese — They are absolutely amazing and cannot be missed. Try them at the Cheese Factory or Henri Willig Cheese shops for a guided experience, or at Reypenaer Proeflokaal or the Cheese Museum.Patat or Frites (Dutch Fries) — These are a must-have with the lip-smacking sauces. One of my absolute favorite places for this food is Vleminckx Sausmeesters.Poffertjes — You can buy these little fluffy pancakes from any street market or vendor.
Some of the other famous eating spots are Winkel 43 for apple pie, Ice Bakery by Nutella, bars in Nieuwmarkt, Pancake Bakery next to the Anne Frank Museum, De Zotte Cafe in Leidseplein, and Van Stapele Koekmakerij for the chocolate cookies.
Noorderlicht Cafe, in the north, is a nice restaurant. You will have to take a ferry across the Ij to NDSM Werf. This ferry is free to use. Also, there are many amazing restaurants and bars in the north that are definitely worth a try and usually unexplored. There are really cute and cozy restaurants in Jordaan, too, which are hidden gems. Some other really good restaurants to try are Frits (burgers), BAK (organic restaurant), Pazzi (best pizza place in town), De Struisvogel (three-course menu), The Lobby Nesplein (Amazing food and wines. Ask for “het vieze boekje” (Dirty Book), which they have in their special wines).
Try a hipster cafe. They believe in ugly is beautiful and cook with all those fruits and vegetables that would have been rejected just because they were not the perfect shape or size. It is a fun experience. You could try Café de Ceuvel, Cafe Brecht, Smokin’ barrels, etc.
The Top deck of the Science Center NEMO is a great place to chill and enjoy magnificent views of the city as well as Floor 17 at the Ramada Apollo Hotel, Sky Lounge at Doubletree by Hilton, Hannekes Boom (an eclectic hangout on the banks of OOsterdok), Edel (a fairy-lit hideaway in De Baarsjes), and other small pubs near the canals. If you’re into hardcore clubbing, then visit Jimmy Woo nightclub, Supperclub, Suzy Wong, Paradiso, Melkweg, AIR Amsterdam, and Sugarfactory.
If you are looking for a Michelin star experience, then try Ciel Bleu. Make reservations in advance at the restaurants in Amsterdam in order to avoid any disappointments, as most of them are pre-booked.
6) Shopping — Amsterdam has amazing places to shop and something for everyone. If you’re looking for high-street brands like H&M and Zara go to the busy Kalverstraat. If local boutiques interest you, then head to The Nine Streets. These nine cobbled streets connect the main canals between Leidsegracht and Raadhuisstraat. For high-end shopping, head to De Bijenkorf or Magna Plaza Shopping Centre (previously a post office) located behind Dam Square.
7) Explore the local neighborhoods — Amsterdam-Centrum: The Red Light District, Jordaan, The Nine streets and the Canal Ring, Leidseplein, or visit the Blijburg Beach.– Dam Square area: It’s the center with Madame Tussauds and other museums.– Take a photo with the IAMSTERDAM letters or hang around the flea market in that area.– Noord: A free ferry from the Central Station will take you to this district which has the city’s coolest architecture, fun hangout spots by the water and exciting festivals.– De Pijp: A great mix of culture, cafes, and cuisine. Do visit the Albert Cuypmarkt here.– Bos en Lommer and De Baarsjes: It’s famous for their multicultural crowd and popular terrace bars.
8) Parks — Parks are at the heart of Amsterdam culture. Every time the sun is out you will see the locals packing up the disposable barbecue and heading down to their nearest garden.If you like visiting parks do not miss to check out Vondelpark, the most famous park in Amsterdam with an open air theater and concerts in the summer. Some other interesting parks are Erasmuspark and Rembrandtpark.
9) Day trips — If you have time then it would be exciting to venture out and take day trips to Volendam, Marken, Zaanse Schans (working windmills), countryside, Delft, The Hague, and Rotterdam. Each of these places is unique and has something to offer you.
10) Visit a market in Amsterdam — Whether you’re looking to buy or try some local delicacies or just soak up the atmosphere, visiting one of the many markets in Amsterdam is a unique and unforgettable experience. Markets selling everything from antiques to books to artisan food to vintage clothes are held all over the city every day. Some of the most popular Amsterdam markets include the Albert Cuypmarkt in De Pijp (Mon.-Sat.) Lindengrachtmarkt in the Jordaan (Saturdays), and the Waterlooplein Market (Mon.-Sat.).
11) Visit coffee shops — A trip to Amsterdam wouldn’t be complete without visiting the coffee shops there. Some of the famous coffee shops are The Bulldog, Mellow Yellow, Original Dampkrings, and Grey Area.

My love for Amsterdam was ignited when I met some friendly Dutch fans at a soccer World Cup match.
This was the year 2010 when South Africa hosted the Soccer World Cup.
The energy and friendliness of the Dutch planted the seed that left me wanting to visit Amsterdam.
Just their warm energy had me drawn to them.
My visit to Amsterdam was everything I expected and much more.
Just like in the soccer match, the people I came into contact with, in Amsterdam were warm and friendly.
Being around people with this energy always leaves me on a natural high. My heart feels at peace.
Waking up each morning and exploring the city was always a fun adventure.
Public transport is extremely reliable and efficient. I did a lot of walking in Amsterdam. I also rented a bicycle.
I love cycling!
Cycling in the streets of Amsterdam was a uniquely different experience.

5 Reasons Amsterdam is The Best Choice For New Travelers,https://medium.com/@jeffreyg/https-medium-com-jeffreypgonzal-5-reasons-you-should-make-amsterdam-your-first-out-of-country-experience-1ad48313c55e,"Sign up

It is hard to believe that it has already been over a year since I first left the country. I have spent my whole life with a passion for travel but up until last year I was spending all of my time and funds on hopelessly driving or flying from one side of the country to the other.
Don’t get me wrong I love the views in the US but I always wanted to get some stamps in my passport and really experience different cultures and what else the world had to offer!
I spent as much time as I could traveling last year and after experiencing 8 different countries in those 12 months, I have finally come to the conclusion on my answer for the question I get all the time, “Where should I go first?”
With a smirk on my face I enthusiastically reply “Amsterdam!”
Most people are scared or nervous about what to expect when they leave the country for the first time and for good reason. There are so many things to consider like:
what kind of currency do they use?
Is it safe?
How will I get around?
What language do they speak?
These are all valid questions that I ask every time I begin planning my next adventure and something that everyone should look into before…

I was sitting in Naples airport waiting for my flight back to Amsterdam after my New Year’s holiday. People were coming and going with their usual murmur, and the loudspeakers were announcing things in Italian that my mind, despite understanding, ignored. I looked at all the faces, searching for a familiar one that made me feel at home. I must admit that at that point, I had already spent quite some months wondering about the meaning of “home”. What was home? Where is your house if you’ve left your country, and your family did as well?The people around me were dragging their suitcases, their inflatable pillows, their children. Suddenly, a voice crept into my thoughts; it was the loudspeaker saying in Dutch that the flight 4091 with destination Amsterdam was going to leave on time. Strange, I thought, that Dutch has my attention and Italian doesn’t.
Five years and nine months ago, I started writing a piece called “Three Months in Amsterdam.” It took me so long to finish it (like all ideas that spring up from the back of my mind and I marinate without cooking) that spring passed, and the piece had to be retitled “Six Months in Amsterdam.” Knowing myself, not so bad. It’s not six months anymore; it’s six years, plus a few more winters and springs.
In practical and numerical terms, my life in the Netherlands can be summed up as 1 pandemic, 4 houses, 11 roommates, 3 jobs, 7 months of unemployment, a few gyms, 5 stolen bicycles, a few hundred acquaintances, a handful of friends, 22 or 23 romantic platonic crushes, 3 bike crushes, 1 Dutch boyfriend (ex-boyfriend), and a ton of questions.
Living in the Netherlands is something I choose every day, especially on winter days, pedaling through the rain and against the wind is where love is tested. It’s easy to choose Amsterdam in spring, when the streets are filled with flowers planted by the city (oh my taxes look so pretty!) and the cherry trees are blooming in the forest. When the streets are filled with happy people, sipping white wine while sitting on the sidewalk, young people (!) playing jeu de boule at the park, and the barbecue my neighbor and I make on the sidewalk with meat he brought on one of his flights to Argentina and passed through customs with dubious techniques.It’s easy to choose Amsterdam in summer, with the sidewalks already decorated with the chalk drawings of the neighborhood children, when the heat is 25 degrees, and you get ice cream at work. When the team returns to play volleyball at the park, and I can pedal around the city with my floral dress blowing in the wind, on my way to jump into a canal or to put my bike on my sister's and brother-in-law’s boat for a ride after work. Amsterdam in summer is a playground among gardens of happiness.
When winter comes, the story is different; the city becomes quiet, calm. It’s a bit of a relief not to have to leave the house every day, to make a winter plan, to learn something new, to buy candles because they make the night more cozy, or like Dutch people say gezellig. No one writes to go to the park anymore, unless it’s those two autumn days when all the trees in Vondelpark are a different color. No, when winter comes and the sky is gray, it’s not so easy to choose the Netherlands; even my freckles disappear. When winter comes and no one sees the sun for 20 days, doubts also arise: Why do I choose to live in this place? Am I always going to live in the shade under an overcast gray sky?
The key to escaping the existential emptiness that the lack of sun brings is nothing more and nothing less than to leave. Yes, leave. If privilege allows, all migrants try to escape. I go to see my parents and my brother in Spain, to the mountains in France, to some island where “clouds” is not a topic of conversation. I escape on Wednesdays to my comedy club to make strangers laugh, or to be entertained by my comedian friends, I escape between the keys of a piano I can’t play or take refuge at the gym.
Perhaps the strangest thing about having migrated six years ago is that my family also left Argentina, and we live spread across three countries in Europe. Sometimes I like to say we’re reverse colonizing, a TEG in real time. I also like when people ask me about my parents, to say: “They’re in a better place” and then clarify that they live in Spain as well as one of my brothers. That they adapted to other latitudes and now say words like “majo” and “guapa”, that they occasionally have a whole leg of ham at home, that they like to have bread with tomato for breakfast, that they eat eggs with chips and meat at 10 am and they go out for tapas and to see their friends at the bar.
That they also maybe sometimes wonder where home is.
A few years ago, I had two Argentinian brothers, but now I have a half-Spanish brother and a half-French brother, who has blended into the culture spectacularly. This includes having a French accent when he speaks English, which confuses my friends in Amsterdam, a lot lot. On the other hand, my brother-in-law, who used to be Argentinian, is now Argentinian-Dutch, and beyond what the papers say, he loves to eat bitterballen with beer and if you ask me, that should be worthy of a Dutch nationality. Sometimes I ask my sister if she suspected that her life would be like having dinner at 6 p.m. and that every plan would include a bicycle, if she ever suspected how difficult it would be for her to make new friends in this place.
I wonder if I, too, should be given a Dutch passport after having carried things in my bike like a desk and chair on a single trip, a case of beer, a Dutchman, a small tree, a computer screen, and a coat rack. Perhaps it would be worth it of a Dutch passport my new ability to set boundaries, to be incredibly direct, to ask everyone to pay their share after inviting people for dinner at my house, to have events planned six months in advance and to own that raincoat that opens like a tent so your legs don’t get wet when you pedal.Would my love for Dutch urbanism and design, and my fondness for those classic Dutch songs by Andre Hazes that sound like a grandmother’s ballad, deserve a Dutch passport?
Sometimes loving a country that isn’t your own feels a lot like cheating on a loved one. Forgive me, Argentina, I didn’t know I was going to fall in love. I still think of you on rainy afternoons, on barbacueless Sundays, and when I notice my friends growing old so far away.
But don’t wait up for me.
If it’s any consolation, the truth is that I miss things: the culture, the sun, the alfajores, the Paraná River, my friends, some parts of my extended family. Then I open Twitter and see what the drama of the day in the country is. I go to eat empanadas at a little argentinian paradise called La Reinita, I listen to “Adios Nonino”, which is the song my friend Fede always listens to, and the tango makes me melancholic, which is the only emotion that goes well with it. I think about Messi more than I’d like to admit, and I carry a little Argentinian flag on the back of my phone so I don’t forget that other place I love and has given me so much.
But despite the wonders I can say about my life in Amsterdam after so many years the fantastic becomes familiar, and what keeps me here, I have to admit, are my friends. What I would do without the love of these people, I don’t know. They’re living their own migration experience, and from different places, we share something that is common to all.
I landed at Amsterdam Airport after a few hours of travel. Stepping off the plane, I felt an immediate and unexpected relief at the familiarity of the airport: how tall the people were, hearing people speaking Dutch, the friendly voice on the loudspeakers announcing the trains. Then I knew it: my house is here and my home as well.

Here for the travel advice and not to read my life story? Jump to Travel Recommendations for the tl;dr [too long; didn’t read] to plan your trip to Amsterdam now!
I felt giddy as my flight touched down. I was passing through the city somewhat incidentally. My end destination was Portugal but it was cheaper to fly through Amsterdam first. So I stretched my layover into a three-day trip. This gave me one day to recover from jet lag and a solid two days in Amsterdam to explore.
Amsterdam is one of those cities proceeded by its reputation. Personally, it has loomed large in my imagination for decades. A place where prostitution is not only legal but flaunted. Where weed, magic mushrooms, and who knows what else was accessible long before even medical clinics were open back home in California. A place where kids going to what at the time I considered “real” or four-year colleges would go to spend a semester abroad. It seemed like such an exciting and luxurious opportunity. One that I could only dream of as I worked my way through community college as a waitress to supplement my scholarships and financial aid.
I wanted to ride a bike around and meet new people from all over the world. Wear cozy sweaters and do drugs in coffee shops and bars. The fact that this was exactly how I was already spending most if not all of my time right at home in San Francisco and Oakland did not make it seem any less exotic.
By the time I finally had the chance to make that pilgrimage, I was in a very different state of mind. I spent my two days in Amsterdam on history and art tours. Taking in the old buildings and even older paintings. Trying new foods such as stroopwaffle (yay!) and pickled herring (nay).
Amsterdam is expensive! Hotels, hostels, and Airbnbs are all expensive. I ended up staying at CityHub Amsterdam, a capsule hotel. Overall, it was a good experience. I don’t really spend time in the hotel when I am traveling so this was a good option for me. It was clean and quiet. I loved the location. There was even a street market right outside where I stopped every morning for a fresh squeezed juice during my stay.

I don’t have much in the way of tips for this trip. It is easy to move through the city and everyone speaks English. The one thing I want to mention is, watch out for bikes! There is a lot of bicycle traffic and one sure-fire way to get cursed out from an otherwise friendly and easygoing local population is to cross the bike lane without looking.
Back to top
Start your day with a free walking tour! This is a great way to start your trip, especially if you are short on time. I recommend taking one the first day to help you get oriented. Free Walking Tours Amsterdam is the one I went with. I took the classic tour, but they have several other options to chose from depending on your interest. There are also many, many other options to choose from when selecting a free walking tour.
This style of tour is available all over Europe. I have even started seeing them in some places in Latin America as well. They typically last 2–3 hours. Your guide will give you some historical context for the city and show you the main sights within walking distance. The tours are indeed free, but the guides are only paid through tips. Have cash on hand to fork over at least €5-€10 once the tour is over.

Consider grabbing lunch or dinner at this trendy food hall. It is modeled after a concept that has taken the world by storm. Foodhallen is one building with many different stalls inside that offer different types of cuisine. You can order from any one that catches your fancy and grab a spot amidst the communal seating.
Back to top
In the evening, I recommend heading over to NDSM. This cultural hotspot is a collection of contemporary art studios and rotating exhibitions in a giant converted warehouse. You may catch a music show or a performance. There are also a few places to eat while on that side of the river.
The easiest way to arrive is to take the F4 ferry from Amsterdam Central Station. It is free and runs every 15–30 minutes. Be sure to hop back on before the ferry service ends at midnight.
Back to top
There are so many different options to choose from, but Rijksmuseum is the crown jewel of museums in Amsterdam. This one is a must-see for any visitor. You can purchase your timed entry tickets the day of, but I recommend buying them a day or two before if you are on a strict schedule and need to be at the museum at a specific time. I also recommend coming here first and then exploring some of the other must-sees in the city such as the Van Gough Museum or the Anne Frank House Museum.
Back to top
All that wandering around and viewing of those giant Renaissance paintings of food in varying states of decay is bound to make you hungry. After visiting Rijksmuseum it is just a short jaunt to Albert Cupstraat Markt. This market stretches several blocks and includes giftable wares, flowers, and most importantly, traditional Dutch cuisine. Be sure to try the stroopwafels, pickled herring, bitterballen (meatballs), and patat friet (french fries).
The market is open 9:30 am-5:00 pm every day except Sundays.
Back to top
The Central Park of Amsterdam is worth strolling through on foot or by bike and is close to both Rijksmuseum and Albert Cuypstraat market. It’s a beautiful place to stop and take a rest on one of the many benches lining the park paths before continuing on with your busy day.
Back to top
No stay in Amsterdam would be complete without a stop at the famous Red Light District. Locals hate it, tourists love it. If you are visiting, I think you have to go at least to see it. There are even historical tours during the day for the faint of heart. It’s easy to find a burlesque show, sex show, or just head out on your own to experience the scene at night.
If you do go in the evening, be prepared to witness the true spectacle, the endless parade of bachelor or “stag” parties crowding the street. You will mostly see women in windows soliciting their wares as you walk the streets, which is to say, themselves. I enjoyed watching the full spectrum of how these women interacted with the passing crowd. Some were dancing, some were trying to entice potential customers with a flirty, joking manner. The most conventionally attractive were visibly bored, doom scrolling on their phones and awaiting their next client without having to put in much effort.
Back to top
I was traveling alone for this trip, so I didn’t have the wild adventure I might have otherwise. But as I get older and wiser, I can’t help but grow in my appreciate of the quieter side of cities and life itself. The joys of earlier mornings, sans hangover. Trying new foods, even if it is for the first and last time. And most importantly, whether it be through observing classical art or observing my fellow tourist on their worst behavior, always learning something new whenever I have the opportunity.

Time flies — it’s been almost a year since I moved from Prague, Czechia, to Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
I loved Prague, but Amsterdam quickly captured a special place in my heart. It feels like home here. And thanks to the rare combination of calmness and just enough excitement, I’ve decided to stay here a little longer and build a stable base.
This is my analysis of how it is to live in Amsterdam. Based on ten criteria, I evaluated the quality of life in Amsterdam. Please note that this article is based on a combination of facts and statistics, but mainly on personal experiences.
Since the introduction of the Safe Cities Index, a report from The Economist Intelligence Unit, Amsterdam was always in the top 10 safest cities globally. In the 2021 report, Amsterdam was in second place on personal security, just behind Copenhagen.
I can see why Amsterdam consistently ranks that high. It feels incredibly safe here. A walk in the middle of the night? No problem. A late-night bicycle ride through the park? Don’t worry. I go running daily (often late at night) and…

Two nights in London was plenty. I wanted to end on a high note, and I’d done just that. I wasn’t going to top the previous night. Plus, it was a waste of money staying there. I needed to get on the Euro. Given the short distance, and my desire to buy weed for the trip, Amsterdam was the obvious choice.
I took the Stena Line Ferry on Joanna’s recommendation. The cost wasn’t included in my Eurorail package, but for $30 it seemed well worth it to travel in comfort. If nothing else, it was a good excuse to drink and chain smoke indoors for 5 hours.
When I boarded, I was struck by how mall-like the interior was. It felt more like a cruise ship than a ferry. There were movie theaters, restaurants, bars, even shopping. There may have been a casino too, but I could just be imagining that because the place felt so much like one. After scoping out the ship, I found myself a comfortable leather chair near the bar and plopped myself down. I ordered a Guinness and swallowed two Adderall. Then, I removed my journal, and made my plans for Amsterdam:
- Coffee shops (buy lots of weed)
- Shrooms
- Find good bar
- Sex w/ prostitute?
For the rest of the ride, I read from the single book I’d brought on the trip, Hunter Thompson’s Fear and Loathing in America, a compilation of letters that Hunter wrote and received between the years of 1968–1976.It’s essentially an account of his life, told through correspondence. The book was 800 pages and weighed a few pounds. I almost didn’t bring it because of the extra heft it added to my backpack, but I knew it would come in handy for long travel days. Plus, I needed to stay sharp. Hunter was my North Star at the time, for good or ill. I admired his brashness and eye for bullshit. He was also a prodigious drug user whilst still being a terrific writer and honorable man. I wanted to be him in every way. I’d never felt that way about any other author or person, and still haven’t.
The ferry dropped us off at the Amsterdam Centraal train station at 2pm, amid the most perfect spring day. The sun was beaming down, and everyone seemed happy. Are people happy because they’re in Amsterdam, or do happy people just gravitate there, making it so? Hard to tell. Sounds like a chicken/egg situation. Speaking of which, I’ve always wondered if people weigh more because of their genes or because their caloric intake is higher, and they work out less. Like, if you took two people who eat and workout the same amount but one’s family has been fat for generations (like mine) and the other skinny, would they end up weighing the same exact amount? That may not be a chicken/egg situation but it’s in the same ballpark. I digress.
Before looking for a hostel, I wanted to get high, so I went in the first “coffee shop” I saw. Now would be a good time to describe the difference between coffee shops in America and coffee shops in Amsterdam. They look the same for the most part, except in Amsterdam, some sell weed. Pretty simple. I think they call them “coffee shops” because it sounds more dignified than “weed stores,” though that’s what they are.
I ordered a pre-roll and a latte. If cocaine and heroin together is a speed ball, weed and coffee together is more like a curveball. Part of me felt demure, sitting there smoking a joint by myself in a café. The other part though, was high as bollocks and VERY paranoid. The American penal system was so ingrained in me that my Pavlovian response to being high was an intense fear of the police. I kept reassuring myself that I wasn’t breaking the law, but I couldn’t shake the fear of being arrested. You don’t realize you’re paranoid amidst the paranoia. If you did, you wouldn’t be paranoid.
On my walk to find a hostel I couldn’t stop laughing at the ridiculousness street names. I wrote some of my favorites down in my journal. I also made up some of my own. See if you can guess which are which (I can’t even remember):
- Brouwersgracht
- Hosenlendinvein
- Princeneiland
- Amsterveenseweg
- Grunarpeilveg
- Einelpenilhar
- Brouwersgracht
The hostel I chose was a far cry from The Flying Pig, the “it” place I’d read about in my research. The Flying Pig was the most popular hostel for people my age (still is) because they had a weed smoking section in the common area where you could rent pipes and bongs. There was a communal element there, one I was not looking for. I don’t like being a part of groups and try to avoid it whenever possible. I want to do what I want to do, not what “us” wants to do. “Us” is always some lame compromise. I, instead, went with an off-brand hostel, one that catered to an older, more laid-back crowd. When I booked it online, the picture made it look like a nondescript Holiday Inn Express. It was a little off the beaten path, but not too far from the action. It looked clean, calm, and quiet, just what I was looking for.
When I got there, it did seem both clean and calm. But, to my surprise, I heard a jackhammer. When I checked in, I inquired, and the manager told me there would be construction every day from 9am-5pm.
Manager: Will that be a problem?
Me: No. I plan to be out during those hours every day. Thanks for letting me know.
That’s how I am, I thank people who inconvenience me. I’ve always been way too accommodating, even to my own detriment. I try to save the world one favor at a time. This wasn’t even a favor though. Who was I helping? The hostel? What’s wrong with me?
When I got up to my room, there was a man jackhammering five feet from my window. I’d never been that close to a jackhammer before. It sounded like a gunfight, like the one from Heat. What a fucking insane shootout. A ten-minute gun battle in the middle of Los Angeles? They must’ve had to shut the entire city down to film it. I wonder how much it cost. — Wait, what am I doing? Sorry. So, I got out of there and vowed to never be back between the hours of 9am-5pm
I still had an hour to kill before I could return. So, the mission again, was weed. This time to buy quantity. After 5 minutes of walking, I found a place called Coffee Shop Bob Marley. The brand is global. From the outside, it looked exactly like you’d think it would, Jamaican flag, pictures of Bob, Wailers albums. The inside had an island vibe, like Sammy Hagar designed it. De whole ting was airy. I promise not to say that again.
When I entered, I was greeted by an old budtender who looked exactly like Willy Nelson, all the way down to the bandana. From his voice I could tell he was an ex-pat. He handed me a Trapper Keeper-style three ring binder. In it were plastic pages with little slots for what traditionally would have been baseball cards. Instead of cards though, each quadrant contained a gram of weed, along with a short description about the type of high you could expect (e.g., purple haze: mellow, euphoric). It was the first time I’d seen such a professional set up and I was blown away. I’d smoked weed daily for 5 years but had never seen anything like that before. Remember in Half Baked, when Thurgood sees the weed room at the laboratory and fucks the air in elation? That was me.
After much consideration, I selected 3 indica strains and paid Willie 60 Euros for the 10.5-gram purchase, a good deal anywhere in the world at that time.
Me: May I light up in here?
Willy: Of course. The smoking room is in back.
The smoking room was just a small, curtained off area with a few high-top tables. A Bob Marley music video played on the television that hung on the wall. I put my bag on the table and removed a grape White Owl cigar that I’d brought with me from America. At the time I was still smoking blunts and I wanted to “represent” my “culture” while in Europe. How stupid. What I didn’t consider, was that I’d barely smoked the previous two weeks while in New York. And, though I smoked a hash spliff the previous night in London, my tolerance was still low. Drug tolerance must ALWAYS be considered. Regardless, I went ahead and rolled a 2.5-gram monster of Afghan Kush.
There were two other people in the room with me, a couple, who both appeared to be in their 30’s. They were smoking out of a pipe and laughing. When I dumped the guts of the blunt into a garbage bin near the wall, they began staring in my direction. They didn’t say anything, but I could tell they were interested in what I was constructing. I was proud of my blunt rolling skills and wanted to put on a show for them, so they could see how we did it in the states. I considered myself an ambassador.
After licking the blunt closed, I sparked my lighter, running the flame along the paper to dry it out. Then, I lit it, taking a deep drag and coughing slightly. The couple, again, glanced my way. I looked in their direction, smiled, and kept smoking like a real cool dude.
About halfway through the blunt, I realized I’d made a huge mistake, and that I was not cool at all. In fact, I was hot, sweating bullets, actually. And I was overcome with dizziness. I could tell the couple wanted to check on me, they just weren’t sure if it was their place to do so. I mean, I must’ve known what I was doing, right? You don’t just roll a blunt like that if it’s your first time smoking weed.
My equilibrium was totally askew. I gripped the small, circular table in front of me like I was Greco Roman wrestling with it. I had to say something before it was too late.
Me: My name is Sam. I’m from America. If I die, my mom’s phone number is in my — -
Then I passed out and fell on the floor.
When I came to, Bob Marley’s I Shot the Sheriff was playing on the tv. The couple was hovering over me, disturbed, their highs obviously ruined. Willy was concerned too, standing over me with a bottle of water. I didn’t even know how long I’d been out.
Willy: We were scared, man. Glad you’re ok. We don’t even allow cigars in here.
Lady: That was so scary.
Other Lady: Here’s your ID. We found it in your bag. We’re from America too.
Me: Well…That’s just perfect.
I grabbed my ID from the lady, along with the remainder of the blunt. Then, I ran out with my tail between my legs, knowing I’d rather be dead than ever show my face in there again. There would be no Redemption Song for me.
On my way back to the hostel, I passed what looked to be the weirdest food establishment I’d ever seen. It reminded me of a Gray’s Papaya, a hot dog chain in New York, in that there was no seating inside. In fact, there was nothing at all inside. It looked to be just an empty room, like an American check cashing place. Yet, it smelled like fast food. It was too weird to not investigate.
When I went in, I thought I was tripping out. I was still very high and woozy from the fall, but I was pretty sure I was standing inside a life-sized vending machine. The walls were lined with rows and rows of slots where hot food was kept. I knew there must have been a kitchen in the back where everything was prepared, but I didn’t see one, nor could I hear one. The only sign of human life was the hand of an employee replenishing the stock after a sale. I didn’t love the impersonality of it all, but I had to admit it was ingenious.
The idea must have seared itself into my brain because I opened a take-and-go food establishment in Chicago only 7 years later. It failed. In fact, I got sued. I don’t want to talk about that, though.
I put my credit card in and pressed the cheeseburger button twice. The slot unlocked and I removed my burgers, which were still delightfully warm. I went over to a bench and enjoyed them while watching a few kids play tag. I realized we were only a block from the Red-Light District. I wondered if they knew about what went on over there. I imagined they did, but were probably cool about it.
…
I awoke from a much-needed night of sleep at 8:00am, which allowed me to get some free breakfast before the jackhammering started. After getting my plate of fruit and toast, I sat down near the television that played the BBC news on a loop. I loathed American news, but the BBC version didn’t bother me all that much. It was almost pleasant to watch. What we have in America can hardly be called news. It’s just commercials for dick pills with raving lunatics spliced in between.
From my seat, I could see that it was drizzling outside. My plans for the day though, were iron clad. No amount of rain was going to keep me from tripping on mushrooms. I was going to trip; it had been written, in my journal.
I’d done mushrooms a handful of times before, with experiences ranging from spiritual bliss to utter madness, but I always learned something about myself in the process, and that was the most important thing to me. Doing them alone wasn’t an issue for me either, I preferred it. I didn’t like getting caught up in other people’s trips, literally and figuratively.
When I entered the Smartshop, I was greeted by the kind of guy you’d think would be running a psychedelic mushroom store, long hair, flannel shirt, monk vibes. They call them “smart shops” the way they call weed stores “coffee shops”. I’ve always found that to be telling. Those are delicate, non-fear inducing terms. Maybe, so when kids walk by, they create positive association instead of negative ones. It’s the Pavlovian response thing again. In America we have “Gun Stores” not “Safety Shops”. Think about it. Rather crude, if you ask me.
Clerk: How may I help you?
Me: Can you please advise me on which mushrooms I should take, and the quantity?
Clerk: Of course. That is exactly what I am here for. Have you done psilocybin before?
Me: Yes, maybe 10 times.
Clerk: Ok, let me walk you through what we have.
He took me over to a glass case with about 10 varieties of mushrooms, some wet, some dry, all of them unique in shape and color. He walked me through their different levels of potency and their array of effects.
Me: How about something in the medium-strength level?
Clerk: Sure. Would you like to see visuals?
Me: Yes, please.
Clerk: I suggest 1 to 2 grams of the High Hawaiian variety, dried.
Me: Will they make me laugh?
Clerk: Ooohhh yeah.
I paid him 10 Euros and exited the Smartshop with my mushrooms. I walked over to the canal and found an unoccupied bench and dried a small spot for myself. It was drizzling the perfect amount, like a mist. I took the mushrooms out of my bag, along with a banana I’d saved from breakfast and a bottle of water. Then I said my usual pre-hallucinogen prayer.
“Lord, please look after me during this trip.”
Once I had the mushrooms down and the nausea passed, I sat back and read my book until the words no longer looked like words, maybe 30 minutes. That’s when the laughing started. EVERYTHING was funny. I spent 10 minutes laughing at my shoes because I thought they looked like chili dogs. Then it was the word “wanker.” I couldn’t stop saying it. “Oy ye wanker”, “Aye wanker, quit ya wanking”, “Bloody, scheming wanker.” That shit was KILLING me. I thought I’d written and entire, perfected comedy bit. As you can see, I did not do that. I was having a ball though.
Then, down the canal a few hundred yards away, I saw a tourist boat slowly approaching. There were 20 or so passengers on the small boat, and all of them were Asian. They looked so happy to me, with their big visors and smiling faces. I was overcome with the urge to connect with them. I stood up and waved my arms, yelling to them as they passed.
“Helllloooooo!!! Welcome to Amsterdam!!!”
They waved back jubilantly, while I cry-laughed like a maniac, waving and yelling in their direction as they passed by my bench.
“Enjoy your staaayyyy!!”
I greeted 8 boats-worth of people over a 2-hour period. For nearly my entire trip, I worked as a volunteer civil servant for a city I’d only been in two days. Amsterdam is special that way. Before leaving my post, I wrote in my journal:
I’D WORK ANY JOB IN THIS CITY
I walked back to the hostel soaked; my feet pruned from the rain. What I needed more than anything was a peaceful place to come down and dry off. When I got to my room, I was delighted to find none of my roommates there, a rare occurrence in a 4-person room. I toweled off and hung my clothes on the edge of the bunk before getting into my bed to reflect and relax. I couldn’t have felt calmer, laying there. My heart was pure, and my thoughts, loving.
Then the jackhammering started. I’d completely forgotten about it. And this time, because of the mushrooms, it sounded even louder and more menacing than before. I still had three hours to kill, but my only jacket was soaked, along with my shoes, so I just laid there with a pillow over my face, laughing at the ridiculousness of the situation.
Mushrooms never fail to humble you.
…
I woke up the next day to more rain. My tentative plan had been to go to Vondelpark, the largest, and most popular park in Amsterdam, but that was now out of the question. I wasn’t willing to get drenched again. So, I went to write in a, you guessed it, coffee shop. I drank café mochas and smoked spliffs with my pinky up like a dignified gentleman. In my journal, I noted my surroundings:
- Everyone is elegant. Nothing dressy, but all timeless looks. Bright, mismatching outfits, silly in the best way.
- Bikes, even in the rain.
- What does everyone do for work? Maybe they’re all architects. That’s why the houses are so unique, everyone builds their own.
- Expensive looking umbrellas in the bin — — In America they’d be stolen.
I left when the rain turned to sun and wondered around for a short time before stumbling on a cute, outdoor market that sold flowers and other local delicacies. I bought an onion and herring sandwich along with a waffle,admittedly an odd combination. It brought back memories of my Bubbie, who’d loved both. Seeing me holding them at the same time would’ve given her a good chuckle. She’d probably ask, “What is it, my birthday?” I missed her dearly, especially in that moment. My father loved waffles too, but I wouldn’t give him the satisfaction of thinking of him. Plus, the image of my dad eating 30 waffles is not a pleasant memory to conjure up.
After finishing my meal, I went in my pocket for dessert, 20mg of Adderall. My mom told me my Bubbie took uppers in the 60’s, when it was prescribed to housewives as a weight loss drug. I bet her grandma was a speed freak too, drinking that Coca Cola with actual cocaine in it. Time is a flat circle, no matter how much we tried to deny it.
I needed to charge up, and without sleep, Adderall was the best way to do that (even with sleep, for that matter). I was on a mission to find a bar that evening. And not just a bar for the night, but one I could call home in future visits. I still had a month left in my trip and knew I’d be back to Amsterdam, so I needed to have a reliable place to hang my hat. Bars are that important to me. I can’t just go any old place to drink willy nilly. I need a home base, somewhere I feel comfortable, where they know my name. Cue the song.
I had no clue where I was going to find it, but I knew I’d know it when I saw it (the same way pornography was defined by the Supreme Court in 1964). It took some walking, but then I stumbled upon what was undoubtablythe place. I was standing at the corner of Nieuwebrugsteeg and Warmoesstraat, right where Warmoesstraat turns into Sint Olofspoort. I’m not joking. I looked up and there it was… The perfect bar. The sign under the awning read: “H. Murray’s Bar”. Next to it was a smaller sign that read “Anno 1619”. It looked to be more of a house than a bar. From the outside it could be mistaken for someone’s living room. Through the window, I could see a long-haired Golden Retriever sitting inside. A bar dog is a surefire sign of a good bar. If it’s good enough for a dog, it’s good enough for me.
I entered like I was returning home.
Me: Hi. I’m Sam.
Neil: Hello, friend. I’m Neil. That’s Lilly (pointing to the dog). And that’s Norman (pointing to the only other man in the bar).
Me: Hello gents. May I…?
Norman: Pull up a seat, Sam.
Me: I’ll have what Norman’s having.
Always drink what the house drinks. It will endear you to the crowd. For me, that only backfires when the house drink is Sambuca. I hate Sambuca. It tastes like a Christmas tree. Or Malort, don’t even get me started on the Chicago bars that push that lighter fluid on their clientele. Monsters.
We got to talking and time got to flying, the way it does when you’re around good people. Norman told me about his time in Berkley, about how he knew Tim Leary, Tom Wolffe and the Merry Pranksters (look them up), people I’d only known from books like The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test. We shared the same sense of humor too. When he told me his favorite comedian was Steven Wright, I knew we were cut from the same cloth, only a generation apart. Steven Wright is one of the more obscure, odd comedians; real dry and wordy. He can make you laugh in less than ten words. I told him to look up Mitch Hedberg. I didn’t bother telling him how Mitch’s death contributed to my quitting stand-up, or that I even did stand-up at all. I just enjoyed listening and being a guest.
I wish I remembered more of that night, but that’s how it goes sometimes. I’ve always found sacrificing memory for fun to be a fair trade. Not everything has to be remembered and documented with a picture. I don’t remember most of the best times of my life and I’m just fine with that. The last memory I have of that night is Norman pulling out an ounce of loose weed from his jacket pocket and slapping it on the bar. We must have smoked a joint that knocked me out completely. I probably threw up before they called me a cab, but that’s just an educated guess (I’ll give you 2/1 odds that I puked though).
…
I awoke to jackhammering the next morning. The sound was so loud I thought it was coming from the inside my head. When I took the pillow off my face, the construction guy was staring at me from outside my window.If there’s a more terrible way to wake up when you’re hungover, or sober for that matter, I’ve never experienced it. I popped up like a jack-in-the-box and ran out like my hair was on fire. I still had my clothes on from the night before, which made my escape easier. Fuck a shower, I needed to get out of there.
While I was scarfing down cold eggs and toast in the lobby, I checked my pockets and counted the money I had. It was the same exact amount as when I’d gone out the night before. John Mulaney had a joke about coming home with MORE money than he went out with, and this wasn’t that, but it was close. Neil didn’t even charge me. I couldn’t recall his kind gesture, but I was sure I hadn’t just left without paying. I mean, I was pretty sure. When wasted, I’m more inclined to try and pay twice than I am to skip out on the bill. One time in New Orleans, I paid my tab, then sat there trying to pay my tab four more times. The bartender threw me out.
I caught some highlights from the NCAA Men’s March Madness tournament on the BBC which made me feel odd. In years past I would have been watching every game, but this time it felt like insignificant news from a distant land.
After finishing my breakfast, I headed out to do some wandering. I hit a few bookstores, but mainly I just walked, soaking in the surroundings and smoking. I had more than enough weed, but I still stopped in coffee shops to see their product line. Each store was unique, and I just couldn’t get enough of being inside places that sold legal weed. I live in California now and the novelty still hasn’t worn off.
As night rolled around, I found myself in a bar, drinking Irish Whiskey, not my usual. I don’t know exactly where I was, but I do know it was right by the Red-Light District. THAT I’M SURE OF.
As I got drunker my loneliness began to transform into horny rage. When my erection grew, I knew the decision was being made for me. It was time.
I walked the entire length of the Red-Light District multiple times, perusing the ladies, to find the perfect date for the next 30 minutes. I’m trying to be tactful here by saying “date”. “Victim” sounds too graphic even though that’s kind of what it felt like.
I have always been a very discerning shopper, that time being no different. The women all had their own room where they sat, positioned toward the outer sidewalk. By just looking in you could see the entire layout. They were all similar; a bed in the corner, a small nightstand, presumably for keys or other knickknacks that may interfere with the coitus, and a few mirrors. Everything was red, the lights, the bed, the carpet, even the exterior. Like white is the safest car color, I think red makes the most fucking. It’s behavioral science.
All the women were objectively gorgeous, much more gorgeous than the sex workers I saw in Tijuana a few months prior. They weren’t beaten down either, figuratively speaking. They looked confident, even proud, like hard working small-business owners. Some of them weren’t even dressed scantily and gave off a “take it or leave it” vibe, which I dug. There were no pimps in sight either. Just the ladies and their red rooms.
With each trip down the corridor, I narrowed my selection. It’s like I was hosting my own NCAA elimination tournament in my brain, only I was pitting lady against lady, with the winner advancing to the next round. Now, I realize what I was doing was waiting for one of them to pick me. If I was going to victimize one of these women, I wanted her to at least feign interest first.
One did. She was white, with long, dark brown hair, and weighed about 150 pounds. She curled her index finger and invited me in, licking it between curls. I was sold.
When I went in, I met the pimp. He may not have been a pimp, but he held the money like a pimp does. And, probably for the best. I gave him 50 Euros and he gave me a single condom. He didn’t say a word. Then, he opened the door to the red room.
Lady: I’m Tonya. What’s your name?
Me: I’m Sam. (I forgot you can lie in those situations.)
Her bubbliness was gone. Now, she was working. She’d already caught her fish; the rest was just fileting.
Lady: Bed or standing?
Me: Uhhh, standing.
She turned around and faced the dresser, gripping the top of it with her hand. She pulled her black panties down and began to prepare herself with one hand, the other braced on the dresser. I took my pants down as well, following her lead. Luckily, I was already prepared. I’d been prepared since I was in the bar an hour ago.
Lady: Ok, ready.
I tore open the condom and put it on. Then, I inserted myself into her.
She moaned. I gained confidence. I started to go faster, and she moaned more, my confidence growing stronger yet.
I took my left hand and slapped her ass cheek. As soon as I did, the pimp came bursting in.
Pimp: NO, NO, NO! NONE OF THAT!
He was pissed.I looked over at him to apologize for my lapse in judgment, and while doing so, ejaculated into the condom I was wearing, while inside of Tonya. I knew I was jizzing. He knew I was jizzing. I knew he knew I was jizzing.
We both jumped back.
Pimp: Ok, that’s it you’re done.
Me: But I didn’t even cum.
He pointed to my shriveling dick.
Pimp: Yes, you did.
I had no recourse. There was jizz in the condom and I couldn’t remove it in his presence, causing a smoking gun, “Gotcha!” type of situation. So, I waited until he left the room. I used my eyes to tell him that I was a coward and would pack up and leave expeditiously. He understood, given his experience.
As I got dressed, Tonya started doing a crossword puzzle. She wasn’t paying any mind to me whatsoever. She was on her own time now, and she planned

The Netherlands has proven to be home to a very diverse group of people in my short time here. While researching I found that the US is technically more diverse but given how much larger of a country it is than the Netherlands, different nationalities, cultures, and races tend to be more spread out and isolated as a result. I have been to many large cities in the US (New York, Washington DC, Miami, Detroit, etc.) and while they are all diverse to an extent, it always seems there is one dominant culture or nationality in each city. This is why to me Amsterdam is a true cultural blend with people having heritages from all over the world and potentially living in the same city block. This made me question why the US is like this and how Amsterdam seems so much more diverse than the US even though it statistically is not.
The simple answer is because of the Dutch themselves and their acceptance of immigrants and refugees. The Dutch have, for centuries, been a safe haven of sorts to people from European, Middle Eastern, or Asian countries and this has led to a high number of immigrants fleeing their home country for Amsterdam. The Dutch advocate heavily for inclusion instead of immigration which has allowed these immigrants to feel safe and comfortable in Amsterdam which in turn leads to them staying and starting families. This is enhanced by the fact that they have a labor migration program that helps skilled workers migrate to the country in order to work. This has the effect of also solving holes in the employment market by filling jobs that are most necessary with immigrants who possess those skills. The most recent “Multi-year Policy Plan for Social Issues” spanned the years 2015–2018 and focused on anti-discrimination, LGBTQ+ rights, and empowering women. These are all issues the US is just now starting to even address let alone solve.
These factors all relate to the 20th and 21st century and the Netherlands has been around for much longer than that, so things have been trending this way for a long time. The Dutch built an empire through trading in the “Golden Era” which was the 16th and 17th centuries, and this was what, unknown to them, got the ball rolling on making Amsterdam so diverse. The addition of colonies started the trend of immigrants leaving for Amsterdam whether it was under their own free will or not did not affect the outcome. The outcome was that many people from South America, The Caribbean, Indonesia, and India ended up residing in Amsterdam throughout the 17th and 18th centuries.
The Netherlands relied heavily on trade which brought foreigners from other countries to the ports of Amsterdam and Rotterdam. These foreigners were trading with the Dutch, not immigrants from one of their many colonies in this time period. Many of these foreigners became immigrants over time whether for profit, the culture, or whatever reason. In turn, this resulted in an even larger influx of immigrants than that of individuals coming from a colony. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, this would continue and be more focused on specialization. The Dutch needed people with different skills, and they didn’t care where they came from, how they talked, or what they looked like. The opportunities of the city of Amsterdam were too enticing to some and this is a major factor in my observation of dense clusters of diversity in the city.
The opportunities didn’t stop at just the jobs though, the Netherlands is home to many prestigious schools and universities which also has a role. People do not just immigrate to Amsterdam for jobs, many do it for education. However, when the job and educational opportunities are combined, along with the respect Dutch citizens have for immigrants, people are more likely to completely emigrate to the Netherlands. A lot of foreigners in the US are not immigrants and live in the US on school or work Visas. The negative view Americans have on immigrants results in many of them going back to their home country after their Visa expires. The Netherlands provides them with a home away from home in a sense and ultimately more immigrants chose to stay. Policy: Diversity — City of Amsterdam

How a visit to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam made me see art — and life — a little differently.
“There are so many people … who imagine that words are nothing. On the contrary, don’t you think, it’s as interesting and as difficult to say a thing well as to paint a thing. There’s the art of lines and colours, but there’s the art of words that will last just the same.” — Vincent van Gogh
The Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam wasn’t just another stop on my trip — it was an experience that has sat with me long after I left. Walking through the galleries felt like stepping into someone’s mind — chaotic, confusing, beautiful and deeply human. A stark contrast to the sensory overload of the Red Light District. It was a reminder that cities hold entire worlds within them, and this was one I wanted to stay in for a while.
I took my time. My friends, not exactly museum people, humored me the best they could. But I was walking through on my own timeline, looking at every painting, reading every plaque, walking through the life of a man who saw art and color in ways other’s couldn’t. I’ve always been drawn to words, to how they hold meaning beyond what we can easily explain. And Van Gogh, for all his beautiful paintings, was also a writer. His letters to his brother Theo were displayed throughout the museum and were filled with thoughts on life, art, struggle that somehow still resonate over a century later.
I think a lot about whether I’m on the right path, if the choices I’m making now will lead somewhere meaningful. Van Gogh didn’t have certainty either, but he worked anyway. That’s the thing: we don’t get guarantees. We just have to keep moving, creating, learning and hoping that the fire we listen to inside us means something.
There’s something about being in a new place, a new country, that sharpens my senses. Colors seem brighter, sounds louder, details more prominent. Travel makes you look closer at the world, but I don’t want to need a plane ticket to notice things. I want to carry that kind of attention with me every day, the way Van Gogh found beauty in the most ordinary things — a field, a flower, a patch of sky.
Travel forces you to be okay with not knowing what you’re doing. I’ve seriously messed up languages, taken the wrong trains and gotten lost in cities with a dead phone where I don’t even know the alphabet. But I figured it out. That’s how we learn — by doing, failing and trying again. Van Gogh painted relentlessly, even when he doubted himself. I think that’s how I want to live: always trying, always pushing toward something better.
My friends waited for me while I lingered in the museum, laughing at my obsession but letting me have my moment. Travel is filled with these fleeting experiences, but the people you share them with are what make them real. I’m slowly learning that home isn’t a town or even a continent — it’s the people who let you be exactly who you are, whether that’s standing in front of a painting for way too long or getting lost in a city together.
I often find myself feeling unsettled, like I’m searching for something I don’t quite know yet. But then I remind myself that not everything makes sense right away. Van Gogh knew what it felt like to struggle, to wonder if things would ever get better. But he kept going. And I think that’s all any of us can do: keep going, keep searching, keep trying to make sense of it all.
I left the museum with postcards, a book of his quotes (which inspired this blog) and a feeling I couldn’t quite name. Maybe it was a quiet understanding. Maybe it was comfort. Maybe it was just the realization that, across centuries, across continents, some people just get it.
As I stepped back into the streets of Amsterdam, the world seemed slightly different — like I was seeing it through his eyes, noticing the colors a little more, the details I might have otherwise missed. Maybe that’s the real gift of art, not just what it shows us, but how it changes the way we see everything else.
“For my part I know nothing with any certainty, but the sight of the stars makes me dream.” — Van Gogh
And maybe, for now, that’s enough.

Day 44 — Amsterdam
I am sitting here on my tiny balcony. The air still feels crisp and humid because of last night’s rain. There is no doubt, I am back in Holland.
Back in Holland after 3 years of travelling around as a digital nomad.
But for the very first time, I don’t feel an immediate urge to pack my bags and hop back on another plane. Something needs to change first.
When I started my solo trips around Europe a few years ago, I was terrified that I would constantly feel alone. The mere thought of dining alone in restaurants, going to parties where I knew no one, or feeling lost in an unknown city, freaked me out.
And the alternative—approaching people and socialising—was even scarier.
But life is different now. I doubt if I will ever lose my moments of social awkwardness, but I made a habit of throwing myself into new situations. I learned how to surf, tried to learn how to dance and turned strangers into close friends.
Living a cliche digital nomad lifestyle. Yet, I am somewhat done with it. It feels like I finally graduated.
Don’t get me wrong. I live a privileged life. I love the adventure, the novelty, the thrill and there is nothing quite like connecting with new people. I love new stories, waiting to be unpacked.
However, the biggest downside of a nomadic life is — no surprise— the fact that everyone leaves again. I know now that it is possible to build deep connections within weeks, sometimes even hours. To cry, laugh and share life stories together.
But maintaining them is a different story. It’s almost impossible to stay close while being separated by different time zones. Especially for a terrible Whatsapp’er like myself.
I struggle with the need to always build new deep connections from scratch. I struggle with friends — or myself leaving after a few months. I don’t want that no more. Again, something needs to change.
For years, my biggest desire has been freedom, the freedom to travel and explore the world. But slowly I am witnessing my desires change. Does my longing for freedom still outweigh the struggle of often missing close friends and family?
How do I balance freedom with maintaining deep, long-lasting connections? I can’t simply take my loved ones with me.
Or can I?
Well, I am going to give it a try.
In the upcoming period, I will record conversations with those around me, wherever I am. Much like interviewing famous podcast guests.
Allowing us to dive deeper than casual small talk, and hopefully resulting in an album of conversations — souvenirs for when our paths diverge again.
The goal is not to share them publically and rack up millions of downloads. Quite the opposite. I can be a DJ without a crowd. I am recording these conversations to get to know the people in my life better, explore their stories, and to laugh and create lasting memories.
I don’t know if we will like it. But trying is the only way to find out. Trying to lean into whatever excites me, intrigues me, into what I consider meaningful.
And this idea definitely feels meaningful to me.
I am sitting here on my balcony staring at the sky. The sun slowly breaks through. I am feeling the energy of trying something new.
Let’s go.
— -During the upcoming period, I will record some podcasts and I am looking for cities to settle instead of always travelling around.
“Know when it is time to move on, know when you graduated.”

In a life-first, I went on two holidays this year! I’ve never felt like such a jet-setter, exploring Europe with my friends, staying in the most luxurious hotels that a student budget can buy. My first trip this summer was to Cyprus, and was less adventure and more ‘let’s lie in the sun with a book and a cocktail’. This time, I was ready to throw relaxation out of the window and hit the cobbled streets of the Netherlands’ capital.
Amsterdam has a reputation as the chillest of cities, perhaps in part due to its ‘coffeeshops’, but this reputation is an absolute lie. I have never been so stressed as I was walking out of Amsterdam Centraal Station in rush hour, only to accidentally stumble into the bike swarm. Everyone riding bikes may be great for the environment, but it’s not great for helpless pedestrians who end up jumping into canals to avoid oncoming cyclists. Everyone from 10-year-old boys to little old grandmas is on their bike, and red lights seem to be considered ‘optional’. I found myself muttering “green man means go” every time I crossed a road, just to try and reassure myself that I wasn’t about to end up tangled in someone’s handlebars.
I am of the opinion that Amsterdam should no longer be known as the chillest city, but the fittest one. Firstly, everyone is very physically fit. Cycling everywhere and eating loads of herring seems to have made everyone slim. It probably also helps that they’re all about a foot taller than me, making them look even more beautiful and elven. Beyond physical fitness, everyone is just cute. Me and my highly stylish friend Alethea, featured above, found ourselves doing constant double-takes. The men of Amsterdam put the balding football lads of England to shame. In Amsterdam 45 seems to be the new 20, and they swan around looking tall and handsome on their bikes. I don’t know if it’s the bikes, the pretty scenery, or the weed, but something in Amsterdam clearly keeps you young.
Despite the apparent fountain of youth properties of herring, neither of us indulged. My excuse was being vegetarian, and Alethea’s was that she didn’t want fish breath that repulses everyone within a mile radius. As our canal cruise guide said: “A herring a day keeps the doctor away, two keeps everyone away.”. That isn’t to say we didn’t sample some other typical Amsterdam delights. Our first stop was FEBO, a fast-food place where you can get hot snacks out of vending machines. There were all sorts of croquettes or meaty options, but we went for Kaasoufflé (cheese that’s breaded and fried). After our grease-fest lunch was complete, we also had to grab some Poffertjes, little Dutch pancakes which I love. It seems that the key to authentic poffertjes is to absolutely slather them in icing sugar and butter, which raised no complaints from me.
Although we seemed to spend most of our time wandering aimlessly through the Jordaan, I did also manage to take in Amsterdam’s famous museum quarter. Alethea had already been to the Van Gogh Museum last year, so I went on a little solo adventure to see the work of one of my all-time favourite artists. The paintings were amazing, but I’m a speedy museum viewer so I had the whole place scoped out in an hour or so. Once my whistle-stop tour was finished, I had to take the obligatory photo in front of the digital Van Gogh wall, with an expression of extreme regret as everyone stared at me trying to take my selfie. No museum trip is complete without postcards, so I treated myself to a few of my favourite paintings.
Our final night saw us relaxing in a BBQ grill (yes, an odd choice for a vegetarian, I am aware) after our original restaurant choice was full of intimidatingly beautiful and cool Amsterdam youths. It was a lovely end to the trip, with great cider and slightly weird Asian-style nachos. I’m so glad I finally had the opportunity to tick Amsterdam off my travel bucket list. It doesn’t have the same soft spot in my soul as London does, but it’s very scenic and the perfect place to go if you’re looking to find yourself a gorgeous cycling boyfriend. The 8 hours of trains back to England the next day was rough, especially as I battled a bad case of man flu, but all in all, it was a pretty great adventure.
Next stops on my travel bucket list: Italy, India, and Ireland. I’m on a mission to tick off the 3 Is in 2020, so stay tuned.

When I moved to Amsterdam, 24 years ago, there were innumerable comments along the lines of: “Oh yeah… Amsterdam, eh?! EH?!! Nudge-nudge, wink-wink, EH?!!”.
To the uninformed I was relocating to a cesspit of iniquity, a European Gomorrah of rampant drug taking and prostitutes for sale in the windows of every street. Everything, people supposed, a single man in his early thirties could desire. Except it wasn’t. Because Amsterdam wasn’t — and isn’t — like that at all.
Yes, the notorious red light zone de Wallen (“the walls”) exists, with its women — most probably sex-trafficked — sat in illuminated windows looking bored while awkward men leer at them from the outside. And, as you walk through quaint backstreets, the barely disguised whiff of weed tickles the nostrils as it pours out of semi-legal coffee shops. However, this is just a tiny slice of Amsterdam, one of the jewels of Europe, with its Instagramable canals, medieval architecture, vibrant culture and a history and charm matched only by the likes of Paris, Seville or Prague.
I am naturally biased, having once lived in or near Amsterdam for the better part of a decade, as well as being a frequent visitor for almost 30 years. To some extent, too, the seedier side isn’t as bad as it could be (ditto, Hamburg and its somewhat cartoon-like Reeperbahn), but I get where the city authorities, and indeed the Dutch government, are coming from in wanting to clean it up.
Conscious of this reputation, tourists are even being discouraged from visiting the de facto Dutch capital, though this was initially a measure to cut down on overcrowding. An environmental measure was also introduced to cap flights arriving at Schiphol, Amsterdam’s massive, seven-runway international air hub, which this year alone has reduced the number of flights from the UK by 22% compared with pre-Covid travel. The Netherlands Tourism Board has even been actively promoting places alternatives like Eindhoven — a city I know well from my career at Philips, which was founded there.
But with the exception of football nerds wishing to see the PSV Stadion, or the even more niche interest of the Philips lightbulb museum, Eindhoven is largely a ‘company town’ with little to offer tourists compared to the cultural riches of Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum, the Anne Frank House, the canals or the Negen Straatjes (‘nine streets’), not to mention its wealth of cross-culture cuisines.
Amsterdam has always been one of the most welcoming cities in Europe, in one of the world’s happiest nations, according to research by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. But those same people are understandably tired of the stag-weekenders who spend their time in the city getting drunk, fighting outside bars and urinating in canals (before then falling in), or swaggering about the red light zone leering at its most unfortunate residents.
This has now been reflected by an online campaign specifically targeting 18–35-year-old British men, with one ad showing a young man being arrested and put in a cell with the atypically Dutch-blunt caption: “So coming to Amsterdam for a messy night? Stay away.”
In recent years the city has made efforts to combat the vice industry (believed to be controlled by a combination of rival Turkish and Albanian organised crime), both to cut down on the sex tourism as well as the exploitation of vulnerable women. The drugs trade, run by the same gangs, has long been associated with this, with politicians arguing that the liberal experiment, dating back to the 1970s, which legitimised cannabis use as long as it is sold in limited quantities in coffee shops, has failed. Weed sales have been regarded as a gateway to sales of harder narcotics, all with associated criminality invariably leading to violence.
When I moved to Amsterdam in 1999 moves were already in place to tackle drug tourism, prompting a national ban on the sale of magic mushrooms and an increased regulation of cannabis sales, and aimed at striking a balance between tourism and public safety. Simultaneously, concerns about sex tourism and human trafficking prompted initiatives to regulate prostitution and improve the working conditions of sex workers. There were also measures to reduce the visibility of the red light district, with an effort to redevelop Amsterdam’s central neighbourhoods by encouraging new businesses to move into streets previously dominated by the sex and drug industry.
Sustainable tourism has also been promoted, with a campaign calling for tourists to “Enjoy & Respect” Amsterdam, and embrace its rich cultural artistic heritage rather than its seedier attractions. However, in also addressing both ‘over-tourism’ and sex/drug visitors, businesses relying on tourist euros have expressed their concerns at any effort to drive down undesirabled, especially in the wake of Amsterdam’s post-pandemic recovery.
It is, then, a dilemma. Amsterdam — like everywhere else — suffered greatly from Covid travel bans and lockdowns, as the city’s hotels, bars, restaurants and shops saw business plummet. The campaign against young male Brits is targeted, but it is hard yet to gauge whether it will be either effective in achieving its aims, or detrimental to the local economy.
As a champion of Amsterdam, however, anything which can successfully eradicate city’s “nudge-nudge, wink-wink” association, and works to enhance and embrace its unique identity is a good thing.
The city is more than simply a living museum, but its heritage — dating back to the 13th century when a small fishing village was established along the Amstel River — is more than worthy of protection. This is the city that was at the heart of the Dutch Golden Age in the 18th century, becoming a trading hub, with the construction of its famous ring of canals earning it the “Venice of the North” nickname. Its commercial and artistic foundations are still to be celebrated, either in the traditions established by the Dutch East India Company, one of the world’s earliest multinationals (and the genetic origin of the Netherlands’ global business outlook), the foundation of one of the world’s first stock exchanges — the “Beurs” (although Belgium’s Bruges lays claim to the oldest, its bourse), not to mention the work of Rembrandt and Vermeer during that same era.
There are those who see the see the discouragement of tourists looking to have the wrong kind of good time as being to Amsterdam’s financial detriment, not to mention to the detriment of its charm. But, just as New York — established as New Amsterdam — cleaned itself up in the early 1990s to its immeasurable benefit as a tourist destination, Amsterdam’s crackdown on Brits seeking to exploit its underbelly will go a long way to lessen the profile of that reputation. It will surely only enhance what those like me who know it, know it to be the real Amsterdam.

Written by Marcos CruzCreative at VBAT
Imagine, walking on a cold rainy day, lost, dragging a broken suitcase through slippery and bumpy old streets whilst trying not to get killed by cyclists coming from all directions.
This is me arriving in Amsterdam 5 years ago. Definitely not the best welcome-card from the old charming Dutch capital.
At the beginning everything was new and although I arrived with some previous international experiences, all of it felt like a big swirl of excitement, freedom and insecurity.
The job was actually the main reason that brought me here. Joining VBAT, a branding and packaging design company which I admired since the beginning of my career and becoming more specialised in packaging design seemed like the perfect step in my career.
I was ready to start my new adventure, but I needed one last thing, a Dutch bike.
Having a bike means the freedom to go everywhere in this town and country and like a very old Johnny Cash song says, “I’ve been everywhere man”.
And that’s what I did:
I’ve been…
…in East, West, North, South, De Jordaan, De Pijp, De Baarsjes, De 9 Straatjes. Westerpark, Vondelpark, Rembrantpark, Sarphatipark, Street-markets, Neighbourmarkets, Sunday market, flea market. Museumplein , Dam square, Red light, Green Light. On the boat, on the train, on the tram, on the bike.
Being on a bike in Amsterdam gives a totally different living experience. Here I just need to cycle around and absorb everything that this city has to offer from street-art to architecture, graphic design to music and nature.
However, (to enjoy it fully,) I really needed to step-up in my bike skills. My biggest achievement so far was to carry somebody on the back, together with a crate of beer. Nothing to be proud of compared to what Dutch people can do on a bike though.
I’ve tasted…
…Bitterballen, Haring, Stroopwafels, Frikandel, Oliebollen, Kibbeling, Poffertjes, Stamppot, Pannenkoeken, Kroketten. Edam kaas , Boeren kaas, Gouda kaas, Maasdamer kaas. Heineken, Amstel, Grolsch, Hertog Jan, Brand Bier, Jopen Bier, Dudels Bier, Oedipus Bier.
There is loads of beer brands in this country from big brands to craft brands.
I’m not a real beer connoisseur and I still love the good old Portuguese Sagres, but I did became quite addicted to looking at beer labels and bottles. A strange behaviour for most people, but for me as a designer at VBAT an easy and fun way to do research and get inspired.
I’ve seen…
…Sun, hale, fog , snow, ice, drizzling rain, heavy rain, freezing rain, lots of rain.
Talking about the weather sounds pretty much like a cliché anywhere else. Here it is not only a fundamental topic of local conversation, but there is actually a lot to talk about. The weather is much more unstable compared to sunny Portugal. This brings more contrast between the days and seasons, transforming these supposed to be boring flat lands into a magical place of contrast and colours.
I’ve met…
…Italians, French, English, Russians, Brazilians, Spanish, Polish and of course Dutchies.
There is a lot to say about Dutch people but one thing I still find quite remarkable after these 5 years: opportunity.
Since the beginning I felt that The Netherlands and especially Amsterdam is a place full of opportunities, attracting people form all parts of the world. I especially enjoy the fact that living in such a diverse community enables you to meet all sorts of people and creative minds.
I’ve made…
…Sketches, drawings, songs, coffee, designs and redesigns.
At VBAT, the redesign of Canei Frizzante Originale is one of the projects that I feel most proud of. Not only because of it’s design, but also because I received the 2018 Best Packaging Design award in beverages in The Netherlands for this project!
I also had the opportunity to design and develop a very special project, the Strum Coffee Brewery. A small brewery built to produce cold brew coffee, one of my favourite Summer coffee refreshments.
Looking back it has been a great roller-coaster of experiences. A journey with curves that make you sick, bumps that make you fly and loops that give you the most unexpected sensations.
Not so long ago it was just another cold rainy day. I was in an Old Amsterdam Cafe together with my Dutch girlfriend. We were having a beer and sharing a small portion of bitterballen when I say out loud “gezellig”. This doesn’t necessarily mean I’m doing great in my Dutch lessons, however I suddenly understood the full meaning of this word in harmony with what was around me.
I understood that I became part of this world. I became part of Amsterdam.
I realised that perhaps I haven’t been everywhere, but for now I also don’t need to go anywhere.

If you are at all familiar with Amsterdam you’ll know that one of the main sources of transportation is the bicycle. Whether you’ve been there yourself, or seen it in movies and TV shows, bicycles are one of the main characters of the city.
If you are a pedestrian, as you wander the streets it’s quite a feat to stay out of the way of those who are on two wheels. It is not always easy.
Thankfully they have bells on their bikes and they are not afraid to use them!
As a photographer, the bikes make it easy to find little scenes within the areas you wander. They make a great subject and help tell the story of Amsterdam in your photos.

From the end of March to the beginning of April, I was on a business trip to the company’s headquarters in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
The first week was primarily to attend the company event, and the second week was to get trainings. Besides the fixed agenda, there was almost always something cool that kept me busy.
In this article, I will share the highlights of the trip.
At the company event, there were multiple sessions where peers from each team went up on the stage to present their team’s updates and insights.
Not only was it a great opportunity for new joiners like myself to get a holistic understanding of the company, but it was also almost shocking how excellent of public speakers they all were.
During my stay, I challenged myself to go out with someone I don’t know every day after work (and completed the challenge).
When the company and industry is growing so fast, I feel inclusivity and knowing who to reach out to for the right information play a crucial role in assisting one’s performance.
Starting my stay as Europe switched to the summer time clocks, I enjoyed watching the sun rise in the morning from my 5th-floor hotel room.
The lines of brick houses and a spider web of waterway that runs in-between the lines gave such exotic vibes.
One Thursday after work, my colleagues and I decided to take a ride into a forest. We rented a bike by the central station and got on the way for about an hour.
I have two things to say about the dutch bikes. One — I was not expecting to back-pedal for brakes so it took me a moment to learn how to stop without causing a scene. Two — they are not Asian-legs friendly. After lowering the seat as far as it allowed, I was still tiptoeing to reach the pedals.
After the hour ride, we arrived at the park with full of cherry blossom.
As I was expecting to miss the cherry blossom season in my hometown Tokyo, it was certainly a pleasant surprise.
The morning after I landed in Amsterdam, I visited a CrossFit box near one of the headquarter offices. As such an exercise is becoming a key in my productive days, it was important that I find a place in Amsterdam as well.
Except, some pieces of the equipment were made so tall for me (like the bars for pull ups) that I could not reach without placing a box to step on. That was embarrassing.
It is an honor to be introduced to such an intelligent and generous group of people. The fact that I am in a place that allows me to learn from them and grow together with them brings nothing but pure excitement and motivation.
It was merely my 6th week in at the company, however, the company has made me feel welcome. I am excited to be part of their journey!

I already wrote a piece about the tourism industry in Amsterdam and how it’s completely out of control. So, my first recommendation is to definitely go to other Dutch cities if you can. However, I’m still torn by the fact that I love my adopted city and hope that others can experience and fall in love with it in much the same way that I did.
Most tourists never go out of the Center (Centraal) area of Amsterdam. While there are certainly cool canals, beautiful architecture, and a ton of historical monuments, the Center is just one small part of the incredibly varied tapestry that is this beautiful city.
So, if you absolutely HAVE to visit Amsterdam, consider easing the tourism crisis by finding a hotel in or exploring one of these areas.
My absolute favorite area of Amsterdam. Green is the operative word here as there are trees and parks EVERYWHERE! Go to Oosterpark, with a huge open green space, some interesting sculptures, and the National Slavery Monument (commemorating the end of slavery in the Netherlands). Oh, it’s also right behind the Tropenmuseum (Tropical Museum), which was originally created to showcase and educate Amsterdammers on The Netherlands’ colonial properties overseas but has been turned into a way for the Dutch to grapple with and better understand this bloody history. It’s definitely not perfect but they’re trying much harder than a number of other museums (*cough* British Museum *cough*).
Also in Amsterdam Oost is the Dappermarkt, one of the several excellent outdoor markets around Amsterdam. It’s open Tuesday — Saturday and has delicious food, clothing, and just about anything you could ever want with some really good prices.
De Plantage is a set of islands perched between Amsterdam Oost and Centraal. It’s notable for the beautiful architecture, trees and parks everywhere, as well as HORTUS and ARTIS. HORTUS is the Royal Botanical Gardens and has a great collection. Honestly, while ARTIS is nice, unless you have kids, there are much better (and cheaper) zoos to go visit in other cities.
This area is definitely one of the most underexplored AND undervalued parts of Amsterdam. Think Brooklyn before it got overly gentrified (but it’s on its way…). Noord used to be considered a working-class area, with shipyards, docks, and factories. In the second half of the 20th Century much of that industry began to move out, especially as Amsterdam moved from being a regional town to a world-class city. Eventually, Amsterdam figured out that there was a huge underdeveloped area just north of Central Station (which makes it a great place to stay when you’re visiting *hint hint*). Today, you can still see remnants of that history, as most of the industrial areas were repurposed to house various enterprises.
While you won’t see any historic canal houses, this side of Amsterdam showcases the ‘alternative, counter-culture’ heritage that the city is known for. Notable things to see are the Boatel, a cruise ship fully repurposed as a hotel, Cafe De Ceuvel, a start-up eco village made of old houseboats, working to clean up a former boatyard and promote environmentalism, and the monthly flea market at NDSM Wharf.
The De Pijp district of Amsterdam was originally known for being like Amsterdam Noord is now, working-class homes and businesses that eventually gentrified. Except, that’s already fully happened now. De Pijp is fully 100% gentrified. Not to say that there aren’t fun things to do, just that you’re going to find about 3 gluten-free, vegan, holistic, non-GMO jackfruit pulled pork/burger places for about every person who lives there. There is so much dining but often at slightly higher prices (and more Americanized) than what you’ll usually pay in other areas of Amsterdam.
The big star attraction of De Pijp is the Albert Cuypmarkt, the largest outdoor market in Amsterdam. This is the big one and it is super-impressive. Weekdays are mostly vendors selling tourist things but Saturday is the best day for a visit, with real Amsterdammers coming to do their shopping.
Other fun things to do include taking a load off in Sarphatipark, one of Amsterdam’s most impressive parks, heading to the Heineken Experience to see the original brewery, or walking over to Museumplein to visit the Van Gogh or Rijksmuseum (book tickets ahead of time). Ok, technically Museumplein isn’t in De Pijp but it’s right next door so I’m counting it.
This area is characterized by big, old 19th century warehouses, lovingly restored to become housing/event space/bars, etc. This entire area used to be for loading and unloading all kinds of cargo ships, especially once Amsterdam Central Station was built, which changed some of the harbor space.
Stop by De Gooyer, one of the few windmills still located within the Amsterdam city limits and have a drink next door at Brouwerij ‘t IJ, the first microbrewery in Amsterdam. Located in a converted bathhouse, its logo is an ostrich with a large egg, which is a Dutch pun. IJ (pronounced like ai) is a well-known river in Amsterdam which also sounds like ei, the Dutch word for egg.
Also while you’re here, take a stroll down Czaar Peterstraat, a beautiful tree-lined boulevard with cute shops and fun places to stop. It’s one of my favorite streets because it’s just so peaceful, you can’t believe you’re still in Amsterdam.
In the summer, walk down to the Marineterrein. Part Dutch naval base, part public access swimming pool, this area is one of the more interesting areas in the city. While part of the Marineterrein is a fully-functioning military base (DO NOT TRESPASS!), a small part has been opened up along the water. Signs are very clear and gates are incredibly obvious. You can enter from the south entrance at Kattenburgerstraat or from the north entrance at the Kommandantsbrug (near Mediamatic). Come for one of the closest areas to Centraal where you can both swim and grab food/drinks at the conveniently-located bar. Definitely a hidden gem.
Anyway, that’s all I have for right now! Stay tuned for more travel tips and please consider helping to ease the Amsterdam tourism crisis by staying or visiting these other areas of town!

Amsterdam is a gorgeous city with beautiful canals and architecture. I was lucky enough to explore it this summer with my mom and my grandparents.
When my mom and I arrived, we took a taxi to the hotel. It was a Tesla. The driver said that soon, most taxis in Amsterdam would be Teslas, to help the environment. We checked in at the Pulitzer hotel, which was made up of 6 canal houses.
The first thing we did was walk around. The Pulitzer was situated on a canal, near the city center, so there was lots to see. First, we visited the Tulip Museum. Tulips used to be a very valuable item in the Netherlands. The best tulips could be sold for almost as much as a house!
Then we stopped for a snack at Pancakes. Amsterdam. Dutch pancakes were kind of like French crepes. They were delicious. After our pancakes, we walked back to the hotel and asked for directions to Momo, a sushi restaurant. It was a 2o minute walk. We had sushi and steamed fish for dinner.
The next day we did the Flowers of Amsterdam Tour with Hanneke. We went to a flower factory and saw flowers being carried away for auctioning and exportation. Next we went to a rose grower. There were rows of roses and each of them smelled fantastic. There were also lots of animals. Fish and turtles in a pond, chickens, and kittens.
After, we went to the town of Haarlem and explored. We had lunch and went to the oldest science museum in the Netherlands. When we got back, we met my grandparents and had delicious Thai food for dinner.
At 10:00am the next day, we had a small group tour about Jewish history. It was pretty long and not very fun, in my opinion. It was a lot of lecturing from our tour guide. We learned a lot, but it was boring. Then late in the afternoon, we went on a boat for a tour of the canals. It was relaxing and enjoyable.
We had another tour with Hanneke at the Rijksmuseum, an art museum. We saw a variety of different painting from different artists, the highlight being the Night Watch, by Rembrandt. We ate lunch at the Rijksmuseum. Then we were supposed to take a painting class but they switched the location on us and we couldn’t make it.
Then we took the tram to the The Royal Concertgebouw and saw the Robeco Jazzclub show. It was my first Jazz show and I thought it was pretty good. We had Chinese food for dinner at Chang-i.
The next day we went relaxed and went shopping at the 9 streets. We didn’t really do much.
In the early morning, we did a photo shoot on the streets of Amsterdam. It was fun and we got great pictures. Next we went to the Anne Frank House. It was amazing how they hid for so long in such a tiny space. Then at night, we went back to the Concertgebouw and saw a string quartet. They did cool things with their instruments and had a dog machine and lights.
The next day was the Amsterdam Pride Parade. It went on for hours. Boats on the canal paraded by filled with crowds of people dressed up and flourishing signs. The horde of people watching screamed and shouted. It was chaotic.
The next day, we went to Schiphol Airport and flew home.

As beautiful as the view of Amsterdam’s canals with the beautiful brick houses around them is, they cause many problems regarding mobility. The narrow alleyways alongside the small canals have only one lane, which leads to traffic jams. A mixture of commuter and delivery traffic, as well as crowds of tourists, quickly congest the picturesque alleyways. The consequences are far-reaching: In a study by the environmental organization Milieudefensie, the European limit for nitrogen oxide was exceeded on no fewer than four roads in Amsterdam in 2016. On the street Stadhouderskade, which runs right through the city, they measured the highest value across the country.
Since then, the city of Amsterdam implemented various projects to tackle the problem including new regulations and the switch to electric mobility.
The title of the initiative “Amsterdam electric” shows as simple as clearly where the city is heading in the coming years. Amsterdam is already recognized as a bicycle city and is now set to become a global figurehead for electric mobility. The purchase of electric cars has been subsidized for years now, along with a steadily growing network of charging points (already the best in the world according to the Urban Mobility Index) and a change in the type of engine in taxi and delivery traffic.
Especially for taxis, Amsterdam wants to become a European role model for electric mobility. Currently, 650 e-taxis are already on the roads, which corresponds to a share of 16 percent — and the trend is rising. Anyone who wants to spontaneously drive electrically through the streets of Amsterdam can use one of the 350 electric cars from car-sharing provider Share Now. By the way, the switch to electric drives applies equally to land and water: by 2025, all gasoline and diesel-powered boats are to be banned in the city center.
Eventually, the plan is not limited to the drive of the cars, but to reduce the private cars on the street in general. Bit by bit they will disappear from the cityscape. Currently, 1,500 parking spaces are being removed annually until 2025 and will be used to widen sidewalks, create more green spaces or make more space for bicycles. Be it for cycle paths or for bicycle parking lots, which the bicycle city always lacks. After all, there are streets in Amsterdam which have ten times more cars than bicycles.
Just under 60 percent of Amsterdam’s residents ride their bicycles every day and take advantage of the excellent infrastructure that already exists. But here too, growth demands new measures. Over the past 20 years, the proportion of cyclists in the city has risen by a proud 40 percent. To ensure that the Dutch capital can continue to live up to its reputation as a cycling city, the network of cycle paths is constantly being expanded and improved. In addition, in the near future, the construction of large-scale cycle paths across the city will make cycling even more attractive as an alternative to the car, even for longer distances.
In comparison to other metropolises, however, you will look in vain for stationless bikes and e-scooters in Amsterdam for spontaneous app rental. They are simply prohibited. On the one hand, the traffic in the narrow alleys along the canals probably does not get along too well with badly parked bikes and scooters. Additionally, the authorities are afraid that those rental bikes and scooters will be found in the water as it happened in Paris.
The most important part of public transport in Amsterdam is the tram, which runs through the city on 14 lines and a total of 200 kilometers of track. The number 2 line, which has been described by National Geographic as one of the most beautiful tram lines in the world, has recently gained particular prominence. For more than 110 years, the tram has been running along the main artery of the city, connecting the top sights of Amsterdam. If at some point you get aching muscles after extensive testing of the cycle paths, you only need a day ticket and you can treat yourself to the full Amsterdam experience.
Markus Herrmann is a blogger, author and member of the successful podcast “Gästeliste Geisterbahn”. For Porsche, he is testing the mobility level of the Back 2 Tape metropolises in Europe.
The project “Back 2 Tape” is a cooperation between the Porsche Newsroom and music journalist Niko Backspin. It follows the tracks of hip hop in Europe. All further information on this project can be found in the Porsche Newsroom.
An important note: Markus’ trip through Europe as well as “Back 2 Tape” were produced before the outbreak of COVID-19. Porsche, Backspin and the involved agencies and artists are aware of their social responsibility and advise against such a trip at this time out of consideration for the health and well-being of all people.

The first time I saw Amsterdam, like most people, I got swept away in a sea of touristic elements. I couldn’t see past them. I didn’t know how.
I’m not alone in that. Many people never get to know the true Amsterdam, the city that build the tourism, and that is now being transformed by its own creation.
The historical city center and the areas in its direct vicinity are being transformed to serve the economic needs of this particular demographic: shops, hotels, airbnb’s and bars. Unfortunately due to the steep rise in prices, local producers are relocating or closing their doors as big name brands are sweeping in depersonalizing the character that started it all.
Some say this is bad, others say this is the natural order of things. The city is evolving based on the present social, cultural and economic developments and we must embrace that. Either way, for the time being, there are still enough elements of the original character to be discovered and experienced.
To make it clear, when I talk about the original character of the city, I am referring to more than just historical elements. There are many newer developments or redevelopments of the past that preserve the creative, bold, artistic, outspoken yet intimate character of the city.
So how did I finally meet Amsterdam? By volunteering for Open Monumentendag Amsterdam, in English: Amsterdam Heritage Days.
European Heritage Days is a cultural event that takes place in 50 countries across Europe. For the two days of the second weekend of September, an impressive number of monuments open their doors to the general public. Some, such as museums or cultural institutions, are indeed accessible also throughout the rest of the year. However a large number of them, such as private homes or offices are open to the public only during this particular event.
In The Netherlands, the event is called Open Monumentendag and it is a really big affair, both for the organisation as well as for the ever growing audience. Each city organizes events, tours and lectures. Massive numbers of volunteers participate every year in order to make sure each location is taken care of and, my favorite thing ever, many children participate as junior guides providing visitors with beautiful explanations. The only downside, for my point of view is that as a volunteer you only get to see that one city. To see another one, I’d have to give up volunteering for that year or choose to help another city.
I have been part of this amazing project for a couple of years now. It is one of my most favorite weekends of the year and it has provided me with a few special moments. The first time I participated I was rather afraid to go out there and deal with the crowds, so I opted for the desk role. Half way through the weekend we ended up one person short, so I had to get out there. The very moment that turned things around and jolted me to see the beauty of the event was when I arrived at one of the big locations in the center of the city. At the entrance of the monument the line was … big. Really big! There wasn’t any way for me to pass through and get to the organizers inside. So I stopped. And as I stood there, unsure of how to proceed further, some of the people noticed my T-shirt (we all get special T-shirts to show we are part of the event). The news spread and in a matter of seconds the entire row moved one step to the right so I could pass. After the initial shock and surprise, I felt rather cocky about it! My very own 15 minutes of fame. Ha! Ha! Ha! But in all seriousness, that showed me how people feel about this event and the level of interaction that is attained despite the fact that most visitors don’t know one another.
As a tourist one often ends up thinking that the center of the city is the most representative image. And while it is full of architectural and historical treasures, Amsterdam is much more complex than that. A city is made by its people. A city expresses itself through its people and their expression and implicitly through its residential and public areas. Touristic locations have a tendency to drown the local spirit. So the way to understand a city is to go further and search for unadulterated local life and surroundings. Now, Amsterdam itself as a major touristic and international hub has by now integrated some of its internationality in its layers. Thus its local flavor is a rather unique one.
My personal experience includes discovering neighborhoods of Amsterdam School architecture of an extraordinary charm, a luxury lounge of royal class at Amsterdam Central, a large variety of Art Deco, treasures hidden in plain sight, a cat cafe (Bonus. Not part of the event.), an amazing array of windows, giving directions to an American tourist who comes to the event on a yearly basis, walking through the narrowest passage in the city and so much more!
The personal experience of discovering a city outside of standard tourism adds to the connections and memories we make. And so, you should have your own story of meeting a city and that should ideally happen in your own time and style. That is why I have no plan for you, no instructions and no list of fancy museums to see. I will leave you however, a few of the places that surprised me and their experience.
The Crane Building
The Crane Building might sound like a modern exuberance, but the crane has been there since 1957. It is the only crane to have survived the Second World War bombings.
It is now famous for the three story apartment that can be rented for quite the price. It has made the news more than once, for more than being an interesting sightseeing point and it has a truly amazing view.
The apartment is an interesting experience. Though I would not recommend it during cold times as some of the circulation between floors is external and the steps are not for the fainted heart. It is also surprisingly spacious particularly when compared to the matchboxes presently advertised due to the high demand during this housing crisis.
The Mercatorbuurt
Probably the most impactful element for me, as an architect, was the unexpected combination of elegance and cosines of the architectural style Amsterdam School. Neighborhoods such as the Mercatorbuurt aren’t your usual touristic attractions. There are no weird or famous museums. There are however incredible details and hidden elements in every facade.
I’ve been rediscovering in many of my recent trips the impressive level of craftsmanship in brick work that older Dutch architecture had reached. The more I look at new and modern facades, the more I wonder how did that get lost. And ironically I already know the answer. Budget wise it is much easier to build a plain facade than to actually create an intricate brick design on its facade. But how much did we lose in terms of character and beauty? Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m not advocating discarding modern architecture. I believe however, that reviving and adapting this traditional element can only be beneficial for present time Dutch architecture.
The Elephant Ally
De Oliphantsgang, in English, The Elephant Ally is a narrow path between two buildings leading to The Golden Tulip. I know, it’s just a small and narrow alley. But I really loved the fancy name, the unassuming door, the texture of the walls as well as the surprise of the interior garden on the other side.
The Golden Tulip is the name of the house found on the location of the oldest brick house in Amsterdam. Due to its bad condition, the house has been disassembled and completely rebuilt in 1993. It presently houses the National Musical Instruments Fund, known for the fact that it gives talented musicians the possibility to loan high quality musical instruments.
Amsterdam Noord
I jumped over the “pond” to meet Amsterdam Nood (Amsterdam North) for the very first time in my third year as a volunteer. Presently, the only way to get there is a ferry, travelling on a strict schedule and at a fast pace. No worry though, they are working on it.
Many cities developed on the line of a river have first made use of one side and only moved across once new buildings would have been located too far from the center. So, I assumed, I’m sorry Amsterdam! that was also the case of Amsterdam and that its northern area was a rather new development with recent architecture. Boy, was I wrong! It is full of old, beautiful, brick, cozy, intimate architecture.
Tuinpark Buitenzorg
The oldest allotment park in the city Tuinpark Buitenzorg forms together with its neighboring forest W.H. Vliegenbos, an important ecological zone rich in biodiversity.
Compared to other allotment parks that I have visited, this one had a completely different character. The explosion of vertical green meant each plot was a little bit of a surprise. Every little house had its own personality and all the plots were carefully maintained.
Unfortunately the waiting list for such a lovely piece of nature is at the moment 15 years.
This article is not sponsored. It is a summary of my experience as a volunteer for several years. If you’d like to know more about the Amsterdam event and and keep current with its details you can do so either on the main website or on their Facebook page. Similarly you can find pages for the event taking place in other cities around The Netherlands as well as in 50 other countries across Europe.

3 different trips of varying lengths, right from 4 hours to 7 days has given me a good insight into this amazingly vibrant city.
For all those thinking this post is gonna be about the coffee shops, red light district and other decadence that this city has come to be known for, I would suggest you head else where. In my eyes, the city is so much more than the chaos of Dam Square, the drunken debauchery at Leidseplein or the feverish squeals of teenage boys at seeing the red light district for the first time. Don’t get me wrong, those areas are not to be missed and do head out into town and hop into the nearest bar to down your glass of the Dutch Genever but then make sure to uncover the actual appeal of the city too.
So here are my top things to do in Amsterdam.
This is the best advice I received a couple of years back from a friend. If you truly want to explore the city and get a feel for it, there’s no better way than to actually experience living in it. I’ve spent time in 2 different hostels, an Airbnb apartment, and a Hotel at Amsterdam in various neighborhoods and if I had one single advice to give to anyone heading to Amsterdam, this would be it. Do not, by any given means, no matter what it takes, stay in the center of town. The center is buzzing with people from all across the world, the vibe is electric, the feel amazing and the experience… well, not exactly Amsterdam. Unless you want to see 10 groups of men celebrating their bros last few days as a bachelor by dressing him up in a frock.
If you get the chance, stay just outside the center. The city is not large and is very well connected by trams and the metro. You can easily find an amazing hotel or apartment in areas like Jordaan, De Pjip or even Amsterdam Noord (a 5 min ferry ride away). Every neighborhood has something different to offer and you can choose your stay based on your interests. The iAmsterdam website gives a quick look at the various neighborhoods here
One of my favorite ways to chill in Amsterdam is to just sit by the canals and watch the city at work. Every canal has something different to offer, few are used extensively for transport, while some others are used by the tourist boats and some others are used just for the houseboats. None the less the canals are extremely calming and you can get to learn a lot of the cities nuances through them.
Some of my favorite places in Amsterdam are also right next to the canals. Check out Waterkant (Outdoor 1 on map) if you are looking for a great place to spend the evening with a couple of beers and some great company.
A visit to Amsterdam is incomplete without a visit to the flower market (Experiences -4 on map). If you have spent any amount of time in the city you would already know of their obsession with plants. Every house has a myriad of blooms popping out from every window and balcony. Even the boats are usually covered with tons of potted plants and it does not stop there. Once you enter the houses, restaurants, hotels or even a pub, you are sure to find a plant on your table or next to your bedside.
I absolutely adore the country for this obsession and make it a point to spend some time at the flower market. Though a little touristy and overpriced compared to some of the other shops I have found in smaller markets and towns, it is a great place for anyone to take in the diversity that the city has to offer in terms of people, plants, culture and even food. From tiny succulents to age old Bonsais, you can find it here.
If you are visiting during the spring, the market will be filled with Tulips of every single color imaginable. Trust me when I say this, it can cause a color overload and you with thank the gods that the sky is dull and dreary.
Not visiting in the spring, you can still pick up Tulip buds to take home with you. Unlike the Tulip mania period when a single bulb could sell for millions, these bulbs are quite reasonable and from what I’ve heard through friends, have a pretty decent success rate. Make sure your country allows you to carry them in though. The shopkeepers usually know the rules for most countries, just ask.
If you have time, visit Keukenhof gardens but only if you can deal with crowds and haven’t blinded yourself with all the color yet.
The garden is open to visitors only during the Tulip festival which lasts a couple of months and the team takes an entire year to landscape and maintain the gardens for this showing. You will be amazed by the variety of Tulips and other flowers showcased here. Be sure to get there early to avoid the crowds and carry some food, the stores there can be a bit pricey.
If you are lucky and visit at the right time, the tulip fields close to Keukenhof are supposed to be breathtaking. We were ready to get away from the crowds and the overdose of beauty and therefore decided to skip out on the fields that were almost bare by the time we got there.
Amsterdam is filled with great choices for food. Being a tourist hotspot you can find every type of food and drink that you would want. Here’s a quick list of Do’s and Don’t that I would suggest.
Check my recommendations for places to eat on the map.
The city is filled with amazing architecture, beautiful bridges, and stunning museums. Keep your eyes open, you will be amazed by what the city has to offer. A stroll through the city will take you past some of the prettiest sights you would have seen in ages.
Amsterdam has quickly become one of my favorite places to visit due to the huge variety of experiences it offers. This post is far from complete and just a quick look at the city. Hopefully to be followed up with more.

Empty, really. For the first time in three months trains were going regularly again, and although it is advised to still stay home and only use public transport for critical trips, I took the opportunity to go see my mother. Is it the smartest thing to do? Not sure. And despite it being a terrible situation in which we now find ourselves, it is bringing out the true beauty and reality of places, like Amsterdam.
A city that has grown to become a touristic hub is finally showing its real side in times of this pandemic. Where masses of British and American tourists usually flood the trains from the airport to the city centre , I could now count the number of people on the train platform on my two hands. It’s strange to imagine what one of the busiest airports in the world is like during times like these. News reports headlined incredible reductions in tourism’s and flights, both internationally and intercontinentally, but it’s only when you’re in the train from the airport and at the airport yourself that you realize how much of an impact this virus has. It also made me realize how many tourists Amsterdam counts all year round, and perhaps also how dependent the city is on what we often call “cultural terrorists”.
Only later on in the evening, when mum and I cycled towards the city Centre, did I realize how dependent we ‘Amsterdammers’ are on tourism. To see an empty train station and airport is one. But to see any empty Dam square, well damn, that was just fascinating. The occasional saxophone street artist tends to get swallowed up in the groups of tourists. But last night, it was surrounded by nothing but a few locals and pure emptiness. Almost lonely. For the first time, the saxophonist was heard on a square that is extremely symbolic to the city and the country in every day life. No more police sirens, trams, and old diesel driven garbage trucks. This is not how I know Amsterdam, but it definitely felt like this is how it should be. For the very first time I was not ashamed of ‘my’ city.
A city in which trams are usually stuffed with people, now only accepts a maximum of 40 passengers per ride. A city where cafes and bars will always serve people, even if there is no space, are now left dead empty or still remain closed. A city where canal and river cruises destroy the waters of the centre, is now so empty that citizens are taking a swim. And a city where one usually has to slalom through tourists, is now so empty and clean that it just simply unbelievable and unimaginable. It almost feels wrong. But definitely a city that now feels like home, more than ever before.

Traveling has always been a big part of my life, especially now living in Ireland — All European countries are “literally” a quick flight away!
We went for a quick getaway, arriving on a Thursday evening and leaving on a Sunday morning. Two full days was all it took to fall in love, of course, the amazing sunny weather contributed. However, the diversity of people walking around, mixed with the thriving culture only made exploring the streets that much more exciting.
Skipping all museums on this trip but one (we ain’t got no money…and we’ll be back), day one started with a free walking tour hosted by local Dutch guides. Unaware of just how educational and fun the tour was going to be, time flew by as we learned about the history of Amsterdam. All our trips will now begin with walking tours — they gave us the BEST advice on what to do and what to see. Such as the difference between Coffeeshops and Cafes! (important information as tourists, people!)
For lunch, we attempted following the directions we received from our tour guide and ended up finding the best little place for the famous Dutch cone fries.

There is so much more to Amsterdam than coffee shops and the red light district, yet for some reason people still come to the city and barely scratch the surface! With affordable flights from Europe and soon a three-hour train from London, Amsterdam is more accessible than ever. Even after living in the Netherlands for half a year, I still feel like there is so much more to see, but hopefully this guide will give you a few off-the-beaten-track ideas.
Friday evening: You’ve stepped off the plane from your after-work-flight, and have dropped your bags at your boatstay on the canals of Dam, now you’re hungry and eager to get out and about. Luckily, a unique ramen experience awaits you: Men Impossible. You need to book in advance, because Atsushi, the guy who owns, cooks, hosts, serves and entertains this fine establishment, doesn’t want guests to feel rushed, so limits the amount of covers per evening. This little restaurant is beautifully decorated, with one large, communal table that encourages conversation and connection.
Friday drinks: You’re full of delicious ramen, and feel like a nightcap. This is where you want to avoid the raucous tourists and just chill out with some locals. Cafe Gollem is one such place, offering a selection of 200 different beers with a great, relaxed atmosphere and real, Dutch patrons.
Saturday morning: Wake up, grab a coffee and a bagel, and head into Dam square for the free walking tour! The people who take you really love doing their job, and the tour is fun, informative and touches on a great array of historical moments in Amsterdam’s history.
Saturday lunch: After the tour, you might want to eat something a little more refined than the chips (save those for later), and what better way to warm yourself up than a delightfully spicy Indonesian lunch at Sampurna? Opposite the flower market, the decor is dark and cosy, with statues and shell decorations that tinkle while you eat traditional food that reminds you what a rich and diverse society Amsterdam really is.
Saturday Afternoon: Walking off your meal through the flower market and enjoying the tulips and bulbs, you feel like doing something a bit different. How about visiting a cat sanctuary, on a boat? In the 1960’s, Mrs v. Weelde acquired a barge opposite her apartment, and filled it with the cat’s she’d been rescuing for years. Now you can visit it and stroke the cats, learn about their mission and donate some food or toys for the resident felines!
Saturday Dinner: Get yourself over to Taste Before You Waste, for a donation based, food-waste dinner that will nourish your body and soul. The philosophy is simple: they save food that would otherwise have been dumped, and turn it into a delicious dinner that you pay as much as you are able for. The money raised goes to continuing their efforts and improving food education.
Saturday Evening: Time to go back to the boat stay, have a disco nap and get ready for a big night out. There are some great bars where you can drink and bars where you can dance, but if you’re looking to party, head to de School and literally lose yourself on the dry-ice filled dance floors until the early morning. It has a random door policy so don’t be deterred if you see people in the queue being turned away, just be cool, calm and polite, and you’re sure to make it.
Sunday Brunch: You’re probably feeling pretty tired from last night, so ease yourself into the day with brunch at Pluk: the food is Instagram worthy, not too busy and has a calming, monochrome decor that will keep you grounded until you’ve got some food in you.
Sunday Afternoon: You’ve filled your tummy and you’re ready to explore a bit of culture before you leave. Jump on the train and a bus to Zaanse Schans to see some real life windmills that are still sawing wood, crushing spices and grinding flour. Walk around the reclaimed land and feed the goats and chickens, taste cheese and hot chocolate in the little village and get some great pictures of old Dutch life. Each of the working mills offers a guided tour and little museums which tell you about their history and modern-day purpose.
A whirlwind weekend in Amsterdam that has hopefully shown you a few different sights to the ones you saw when you were inter railing at eighteen. I hope you enjoyed your trip!

I’ve visited many cities, but few ignite and fire up the genetic glitch that pushes me to look through the viewfinder more than when in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The city has inspired generations of artists of all kinds. Today is no different.
I’ve literally stood on streets, turned 360 degrees, and seen something I’d like to photograph at every angle. Amsterdam is a photographers Disneyland, Super Model, World Series Champ, and Christmas Morning all rolled into one.. and she likes her photo taken!!!
Some of my favorite days have been those just wondering around the streets of this amazing city with just my camera and time to get lost. When asked about it, I usually say, “It’s like walking around inside a giant museum, but it’s a city! You just have to go, I can’t explain it well enough in words for you to understand.”

Before leaving my safe D.C. haven and flying thousands of miles across the Atlantic, my friends who had gone abroad the semester before told me that it changed their lives, how they would go back in a second, and how lucky I was that I had the experience ahead of me. Few people mentioned challenges, or if they did, it was because they had to eat too much rice or had too many crazy nights out. For most people it seemed like their experience in Europe was spent drunk 90% of the time, something I wasn’t particularly searching for in an abroad experience. So I was wholly unprepared when I came to Amsterdam and struggled in many unexpected ways. I hate saying I struggled because I feel so privileged that I could even study abroad and spend four months in Amsterdam. Who complains about getting to live in Europe??? I found myself looking at my Instagram and Facebook photos wondering if my pictures really represented my experience at all. But in the interest of being honest and transparent, I figured it was best not to sugarcoat my experience. Whenever people ask me how my time in Amsterdam is going, my automatic and natural response is to say, “Amazing, I love it!” when in fact it has not been without obstacles that often left me questioning why I left D.C. at all. Why is our natural response to say what we think people want to hear even if it is far from the truth? It’s hard to say that you don’t love something, and even harder to admit that you are probably partially, if not fully, responsible for that. Convinced my generation has a fear of mediocrity, I found myself trying to portray my experience in a positive light just to make people think I was having the stereotypical abroad experience. It was definitely difficult writing this because I feel guilty and ungrateful for not loving my time in Europe, for not cherishing every moment. It almost feels socially unacceptable to question anything that should be wonderful. But going abroad was tough, and I wanted to explain the good, bad, and ugly and go beyond my usual rosy response.
I think of myself as a pretty adventurous person, relatively adaptable, and definitely good at taking on new situations, but Amsterdam tested that. I sat in my room after the first week of classes and cried for hours. I felt so alone and isolated. Maybe that was due to the fact that I lived 25 minutes outside the center of the city, or maybe because I had never before lived in a room by myself. Regardless, it was tough. It made me truly appreciate having someone at home to ask you how your day was, or always having someone available to vent to. I pride myself on being strong and independent, but being alone truly tests your sense of self. It wasn’t as much that I was physically alone — I had classes every day where I saw plenty of people — but I felt emotionally lonely. My mom wasn’t available to talk as much because of the time difference, I didn’t make a lot of friends where I lived, and the friends I made mostly lived in the city, which was a long commute, especially late at night when they all met up. Usually high-spirited and positive, I didn’t feel like myself. The first few weeks were a lot: figuring out the transportation system (aka I hate being late, so getting to class hours early), navigating a dutch grocery store, deciding how comfortable I was biking without a helmet. I struggled with money, weight, exercise, unhealthy food, technology. Every day was a new challenge and new growth.
For me, transitioning to new things has always been pretty easy. My freshmen year at GW I made friends instantly and never felt homesick or alone. Even during my first summer working at camp, I felt like I fit in and made friends effortlessly. But abroad was different. Obviously, I was in an entirely new culture that speaks a language I literally know not a word of, but it was more than that. Living far away without people to help me feel comfortable is definitely difficult in a way I wasn’t expecting. It is easy to say you love alone time until that’s all you have. I quickly realized that maybe I wasn’t well equipped to go abroad. I don’t really drink or stay out late or enjoy deviating from my routine, so where did that leave me? When I asked some of my friends here why they went abroad, common answers were to get away from their university or a bad relationship or to travel around Europe. Hearing them talk about why they went abroad made me realize that I may have gone for the wrong reasons or because I thought it was something I had to do. I wasn’t trying to get away from anything (other than maybe Trump’s presidency), I love my friends at GW, and I’ve already traveled around Europe before, so this wasn’t a first-time experience. I guess the only answer that popped into my mind was that I wanted to see a culture different from my own and to increase my knowledge of the world.
For those of you that don’t know me super well, I love schedules and to-do lists and being busy. As I was talking to my mom on the phone last night, I realized that one of the things I disliked most about being abroad was the free time. I know that’s crazy, and that I should love having free time, so let me explain. Did you ever read that book about the little girl who has one wish, and her wish is to have Christmas every day? After Christmas happens a few days in a row, she starts to dislike it and not appreciate it as much. She gets a stomach ache from all the candy and doesn’t know what to do with all the presents. Well, that is kind of how I feel about free time. It is great the first few days, but then I just start resenting it. It’s hard to appreciate something when that’s all you know. Much of abroad was free time. I have NEVER had this much time to do whatever I want, and it was overwhelming. Learning how to relax was hard, and also really good for me. Most of my friends here thought it was ridiculous that I didn’t enjoy free time, so that made me feel even more guilty about being miserable. As the semester has gone on, I’ve learned how to make free time busy, which I realize sounds insane. My google schedule now says “ 6:15am: Workout; 8:00am: Bike to class; 11:00am: make lunch; 1:00pm: walk around the block; 3:00pm: Read; 6:00pm: Eat dinner; 10:00pm: Bed.” As you can see, my life is full of exciting turns.
Whenever people ask me what my favorite part about abroad is, I say the classes. The reaction I get is usually a mix between confusion and maybe a little disgust. The University of Amsterdam has given me three of the best classes of my entire life, with three of the best teachers. I look forward to class every day and can’t wait to do the readings. I asked my Language and Politics teacher if she would go teach at GW because I loved her class so much. I felt intellectually stimulated by my classes and learned so much about the EU and the populist movement from a European perspective. If I didn’t know who Geert Wilders was before Amsterdam, I sure know now. I love that the Netherlands is so progressive and generally prioritizes everyone’s needs. Their health care system is truly comprehensive and they definitely understand the importance of compromise in governing. There are many things about the Netherlands that I didn’t love, but their political system and progressive policies impressed me. I now understand that prostitution is a profession and that lax drug laws are actually effective when it comes to safety.
I realize most of this essay has been about my struggles with being abroad, but I definitely need to mention all the highlights. Through my introspection on my time in the Netherlands, I have come to the conclusion that my struggles had little to do with Amsterdam or the Netherlands itself. I think I would have struggled in the same way wherever I would have gone (except maybe I would have lived closer to the city somewhere else). First and foremost, I love the city of Amsterdam. I’m so thankful for the beautiful canals, delicious food (shoutout to dutch pancakes & apple pie), and the biking culture. Biking 30 minutes to school every day was honestly one of my favorite parts. It was so rewarding learning the local biking rules and feeling like a Dutch citizen while navigating trams, tourists, and bikers with headphones. Plus, I have thighs of steel now. I made a list of things I love about the Netherlands as the semester went on, so here is a quick summary:
I’m not going to lie and say it will be extremely hard to leave. I will definitely be sad to leave this beautiful place and say goodbye to some truly great friends I’ve made. Being out of Trump’s America has been an incredible and therapeutic break from reality, but I am ready to come back and resist (well, after my three months in rural Michigan teaching fitness, of course). I sometimes mull over what I am going to say when people ask me how my time abroad was. The classic answer that it was the best four months would be inaccurate. But I feel like telling people how hard it was would be uncomfortable because we are so used to talking about abroad as if it is always incredible and without flaws. Maybe it did change my life in some ways. I think I am much better at being alone, better at relaxing, better at processing my emotions and prioritizing my health and happiness. I think learning how to live in a new culture is an important skill, and I certainly learned a lot more about Europe. Being outside of America for awhile is a good reality check. And I can’t forget to mention the friendships I made. I’m thankful for Maggie biking to school with me every day, participating in almost every one of my workout sessions, and letting me vent about people stealing my Clif bars. Thankful for Steph for being my travel buddy and pushing me to really evaluate and process my feelings on relationships and family. Thankful for Kerri for being the only person I’ve ever met who feels the same way I do about alcohol and going out. And thankful for everyone else who has impacted my time abroad and made it infinitely better.
It’s okay that my time abroad wasn’t perfect or as life-shattering as I was told it would be. And maybe that’s my own fault. Maybe I should have gone out more or stayed up later. Maybe in 20 years I’ll regret not forcing myself to go to dark clubs with American music with mostly American students. I very well could regret not being drunk or high for 90% of this experience. It is hard to look back on my four months and ask if there was anything I could have done to make it a better or more positive experience. But I think the most important thing I’ve learned is how to deal with situations that aren’t ideal. I’m not always going to have an incredibly supportive and loving roommate (hi Sammi) to ask me how my day was. I’m not always going to have healthy food options or an accessible gym. I’m not always going to be in a city that feels natural (aka DC) or that keeps me constantly busy. Life is about dealing with new things that aren’t always what you expect. My mom and dad were the MVP’s of abroad. The time difference (9 hours!!!) was rough, especially because my mom gets off work at 2:30 pm, which is 11:30 pm my time (I’m definitely asleep by then), but they spent hours telling me that what I was feeling was natural. It’s okay not to love an experience but make the most of it and learn from it. When I get on the plane tomorrow, I know I’ll be sad to leave such a beautiful city, and I will certainly cherish the memories. So peace out Sloterpark and the old lady that always flies by me on my long runs around the lake. Peace out Dirk, my grocery store, that has everything but brussels sprouts (my one true love). Peace out to Bike 359, aka the most ratchet and broken bike of all time. Peace out to the Student Hotel, where customer service is definitely not a priority. Peace out to my shared kitchen and the mornings when I come in and the floor is covered in beer and half of my food is gone. Peace out to UvA and the amazing staff and students that made my time in Amsterdam academically amazing. Peace out to Ivy & Bros, aka the cafe that became my home. Peace out Schiphol Airport, where I have spent 90% of my time in the last two months due to traveling 8 (!!!) weekends in a row. Peace out Dam Square, the home of pigeons and high tourists. And finally, peace out Amsterdam, I’ll miss you.

Written by Craig BerryCreative Intern at VBAT
Recently I had 2 friends from the UK come to Amsterdam to visit and I wanted to show them the city I have been living in for the last 5 months and all that is great about it. I could easily have taken them to the bigger tourist attractions such as the Heineken Experience, the Anne Frank House, the Rijksmuseum and so on. But I wanted to share my pieces of local knowledge which I have picked up on so far and also find and explore new places in the city for myself.
Firstly we visited the Stedelijk Museum which although yes, it is one of those big tourist attractions, as one of the world’s best museums with a great collection, the 3 of us as intrepid young designers could not escape its allure. I myself went recently to visit the Willem Sandberg exhibition although this had since finished but in its place was a great exhibition celebrating 100 years of ‘De Stijl’. For those who don’t know, De Stijl was a revolutionary art and design movement in the early 20th century (1917–1931) with artists like Mondrian and van Doesburg at the centre of it producing work that they saw as a reduction of form and colour choosing to mostly use vertical and horizontal shapes only using black, white and primary colours.
The exhibition itself covered these characteristics of the movement by showing these well known names tied to De Stijl — there was Piet Mondrian’s ‘Composition’ pieces and Gerrit Rietveld’s ‘Red and Blue Chair, these people built the aesthetic of the movement with the other pieces on show by artists and designers who have/had been inspired by them. There was Ellsworth Kelly with ‘Red Blue Rocker’ in the shape of a folded geometric circle. Roy Lichtenstein’s huge piece ‘As I Opened Fire’ a painting produced using the same reduced colour palette. Also here was a strong piece by the collective — General Idea called ‘Infe©ted Mondrian’ where they parodied the artist, copying the composition but replacing the yellow colour with a more toxic green to address the AIDS crisis which General Idea focused a lot of their work on and a comment on the dominance of De Stijl. The exhibition is part of a longer project marking 100 years of De Stijl and hopefully I can visit more of it as I see it as one of the great commanding art and design movements which is still prevalent today.
The next day we took the boat over the River IJ to NDSM, described as ‘a rugged shipyard to a creative hotspot’. The ‘creative city’ is a historical remainder of the largest shipyard in the city and has become a haven for all people interested in creativity and art with something for everyone to admire. What stood out to us was the main NDSM building/warehouse, now a hub for studios and restaurants; the outer walls still adorned with the original painted sign. The letters on the 2 sides read “Netherlands Shipbuilding Company’ and ‘Nederlandsche Dok en Scheepsbouw Maatschappij’ with each letter painted on heavily in white, with little consistency in letter styles but following some sort of grid. We were motivated to photograph the letters and digitise them to produce a display font with all of its inconsistency and variety as a homage to the building, as designers it was impossible for us to not look at this and be amazed and inspired.
We also found a great bar in the NDSM area — Pllek, built out of old shipping containers a huge glass window looking out onto the IJ and the cold Dutch winter air. We stayed here for a while, chatting and chilling. Drinking a few beers whilst some live music played. A really cool find and as the Dutch might say, it was ‘gezellig’.
I got the following Monday off work to continue our quest around the city and we ended up at the FOAM photography museum (Fotografiemuseum Amsterdam) to check out the Hiroshi Sugimoto exhibition — Black Box. An overview of the Japanese artist’s work which covered his major series. There was a lot of variety in what was on show but the works which really stood out to me were ‘Lightning Fields’ and ‘Theatres’ because of the processes which were used to make them. ‘Lightning Fields’ are images where there is no camera involved, they are made by channelling electricity over photo paper and exposing it. The marks left behind are incredible and the size of the prints makes for a visually strong image. ‘Theatres’ are a series of images where the artist photographed empty theatre halls, the exposure length of each photograph dictated by the length of a feature film, so each image is brighter or darker than the other. They create these ghostly like images of the room with a solid white image on the theatre screen which is almost sinister like to look into as you are surrounded by these images. The rest of the museum is also great as well as the inside of the building, it is one of the canal houses on the Keizersgracht and inside it is a series of winding rooms and dimly lit hallways: easy to get lost — which we did.
Finally throughout the few days we were walking around I had prepared a map that documents some of the great historical and innovative typographic signs that exist through the city. I was inspired by David Quay’s type tour with us back in the warm summer time in September and using these places as well as my own findings we wandered around as I pointed out these great relics, most of them with some story to tell.
My personal favourite was this piece by Dutch artist Piet Parra on the Tuinstraat. A huge wall mural near a school and kids park which reads: “Ik speel in de stad met alles wat er bestaat” — I play in the city with all that exists. I just love how the letters flow from one to the next and also Parra has a unique style which fits the city perfectly.

*** Since the time of this writing, the laws around the Working Holiday Visa have changed. On October 1, 2018 the Dutch government decided to start cracking down on the types of work you can do with this visa, limiting it to incidental work (nothing full-time). This means that in order to move here and start working, you will unfortunately have to find a job that will sponsor a highly-skilled migrant visa. ***
A little bit of background
To give this post some context, I want to start with sharing some background on me and my story of moving to the Netherlands on the working holiday visa. My name is Dave, and I’m a 24 year old Canadian (or Canadese, according to my Dutch residency card) who moved from Toronto to Amsterdam in September, 2017 with my girlfriend Madi (also Canadese). Prior to moving, we were both living in Toronto and working in our first post-grad jobs. I was in sales at a software startup, and Madi was working in retail buying at the Hudson’s Bay Company.
Although we were really enjoying our lives in Toronto, we always shared the dream of living and working abroad ‘at some point’. What I started to realise as our time in Toronto progressed was that finding this ‘point’ was inevitably going to become more challenging. When would we both be at the same point in our careers where we would be comfortable with dropping everything and just leaving? Next thing you know, it’s 2, 3, 5 years later and all of your friends are getting married, buying houses etc. and the idea of moving just becomes too daunting. Life happens.
Luckily, the ‘point’ presented itself to Madi and I in spring of 2017. My company had just been acquired by a large tech company based in San Francisco, and many key members of the team were moving down to the US in the process (myself not included…damn Trump). Madi was already in between jobs at the time, so we decided that this was our chance. We decided we were moving. We didn’t know where at that point, but we’re not the type to overthink decisions when they feel right. So despite having little semblance of a plan and strategy, I gave my notice at work the next day.
Why I wanted to write this
During the months leading up to our move we spoke with a handful of fellow Canadians who had moved to Amsterdam in the past, but the conversations were always more focused on living in Amsterdam rather than practical tips for moving. This was because most of the people we spoke with had moved for jobs (aka they were sponsored on a highly skilled visa), so a lot of the immigration admin was taken care of by their respective companies and they were landing in a fairly comfortable position.
We are on the more adventurous/reckless side so we decided to quit our respective jobs in Toronto and take a leap of faith. Maybe we’re just lazy and didn’t do enough digging (actually, highly likely), but we found it disappointing that there was no ‘one stop shop’ post where we could find all of the common pitfalls to avoid. We vowed that once we had made our move and semi-settled we would document all of our mistakes on the world wide web in the hopes of saving someone else a bit of stress or a few bucks.
So, to be clear, this post is intended as a mini survival guide to help folks who are moving to the Netherlands without a job and taking advantage of the working holiday visa (although certain advice will be universal). We are also Canadian, so some of the immigration content is specific to that context.
These are the main mistakes that we made in the process. If you are in a similar situation to us and are planning on moving to Amsterdam, my hope is that you can avoid making the same ones.
TL;DR
Make them well in advance of your move!!! Ideally, do this before you book your flight to come here so that you can hit the ground running. You need two appointments:
Visa — this appointment is with the IND. It can be at any IND office in the Netherlands, so if you are on the phone with someone and they are saying there’s nothing in Amsterdam, ask them to check other cities. We ended up going out to Den Hague for ours (after a week of calling every day to check for cancellations) because we could get in about a month ahead of our scheduled appointment in Amsterdam.
Registration — the Dutch government likes to keep tabs on you, so before you can get a job and earn any money you need to register and get your BSN (of course it stands for Burger Service Number, welcome to Holland). You must schedule your registration appointment with the city that you plan on living in, so for this one you’re limited to a certain number of offices. If you’re moving with a job sponsorship, there’s a special office for you that I’m sure is efficient and lovely. If you’re a pleb like us, you will need to book your appointment at one of the Amsterdam city offices (see the list, here).
What we did….
Rather than dedicating some time and effort to visa research like any rational person would, Madi and I lollygagged around for the summer after quitting our jobs. We knew there were appointments, but we very naively assumed we could book them within two weeks of our flight. Our flight was September 6 and when I called for a registration appointment the earliest they had was October 18…
Get immigration documents organised ASAP
Start the process of legalising your birth certificate right now. For your registration appointment, you need a legalised birth certificate. This means that you have to physically send it to your federal government, they give it a thumbs up and a stamp, then you physically send it to the Dutch Embassy, and they also give it a thumbs up and a stamp. Fun process, right? You might even have to get a new birth certificate before starting the stamping process, but double check that for your case. More about this here.
What I did….
When I finally got around to serious research regarding Dutch immigration (two weeks before our flight), I figured out that we needed to do this. It was one of many, ‘Oh fuck’ moments in my research phase. We ended up having to get special birth certificates issued for this purpose, and express ship them to a service in Ottawa (capital of Canada) that specialised in this kind of thing. They physically took them to these offices in Ottawa for us and got the stamps and express shipped them back. This is who we used. Of course because you are in a tight spot and they know it they absolutely hose you on price, I think with shipping and everything we spent $500+ getting two pieces of paper stamped.
Have a place to stay
When you land in Amsterdam, you’re going to want to have a place to stay set up. The last thing you’re going to want to do after a long-haul flight is carry your bags around from door-to-door. Ideally, you can find a relatively cheap Airbnb or hostel room. Then once you’re here you can explore the city a little bit and hit the Facebook groups hard looking for a longer term room or apartment rental in a good neighborhood.
What I did…..
In this case, we totally lucked out, and it probably saved out entire move from turning into a complete flop. About a month before we moved Madi and I were introduced to a couple at a summer BBQ who had lived in Amsterdam for 25+ years and knew a ton of people here. They then connected us with a couple who happened to have an empty garden house that they offered for us to stay in when we arrived. Looking back, I wonder what we would have done if this intro didn’t surface. It was another one of those really important things that we were taking the ‘ignorance is bliss’ approach to. Oh well, sometimes things just work out!
Start looking for jobs
The Dutch hire slow because it’s way harder to fire people here than in North America. It’s not uncommon to go through 3–5 interviews before receiving an offer, which takes a long time if you’re doing 1 interview per week. So it’s important to start conversations early and set yourself up for success when you move.
Set up a few Amsterdam job alerts for the type of role you will be looking for when you land. If you have a good idea of what you will be looking for, I would try to sort that out and get a focus before moving.
I think the best place to start is LinkedIn, and you could add in Angelist if you’re looking for a role at a startup. Make sure your resume is up to date* and start proactively applying or direct messaging people at companies you find interesting and get a conversation started. You will probably have a hard time getting to a job offer from abroad, but at least you can get some coffee chats lined up for when you arrive.
* Make sure your location is Amsterdam, otherwise people might be confused as to why you’re applying. The Dutch also include their DOB/age in the info section.
Shamelessly ask for connections
Leverage your network to source some connections. We found that when people found out we were making such a radical move they really went the extra mile to introduce us to anyone they knew in Amsterdam. Some of them were super random, but you never know who’s going to know someone who knows someone that has an awesome place they’re renting out for super cheap…
TL;DR
Get a bike
Do this your first or second day in Amsterdam. As you will see, it’s the way people get everywhere here. Once you have a bike, the city totally opens up and no place is more than 15–20 minutes away. Bikes also get stolen like crazy here, so I would advise getting a fairly cheap second hand one to start. You will see a TON of options if you put ‘bike shops’ into Google Maps, or you can try the Waterlooplein flea market (more here). I got mine there and paid 90 euro with two locks included. Swapfiets is another great bike membership service that is totally hassle-free, which Madi joined after her first bike got stolen.
Get a prepaid SIM
Another day one task. Connectivity is super key; you’re going to need plenty of Google Maps to navigate this semi-circle city. Pop into any Vodafone or Tele2 store and grab a prepaid sim card. You can get them pretty cheap, I think we had 3 GB of data and 30 minutes of calling for 20 euro per month.
You’ll need to keep renewing your prepaid for at least 3 months because of a funny rule. To prevent fraud, phone companies here don’t let you set up an auto-renew phone plan until you have had a Dutch bank account for at least 3 months. So that means you need to a) get your BSN, b) open a bank account, and c) wait 3 months from that day to get a real phone plan. Oh, the Dutch and their systems…
Make Chrome your default browser
While we are on the note of phones, I would highly recommend setting Chrome as your default web browser on your computer and mobile. Chrome will auto-translate Dutch sites for you, which is really helpful when you’re exploring and trying to find business hours etc. If it’s not auto-translating, you should be able to toggle that feature on in settings.
Hustle for a job
Once you are boots on the ground it’s time to start networking pretty aggressively. I would recommend dedicating a few hours a day to putting in job applications and continuing to message people and set up conversations.
In addition, you can now start hitting up networking events and making in-person intros. There are quite a few on the Meetup app, which is pretty popular here. You can also check the websites for the coworking spaces* in town to see what they have going on.
*TQ, Impact Hub and WeWork are great places to start looking.
I personally went the more traditional route as I find networking events pretty painful. I focused on applying/messaging on LinkedIn and the intros I had received from friends, former colleagues etc. I ended up getting my current job from a cold email I had sent before moving. It took a while to materialize (about 3 months), but 5 interviews later I got an offer!
Get a bank account (I recommend ING)
A lot of grocery stores and certain checkout lines don’t take cash, so it’s important to set up a bank account quickly for convenience. NOTE: You must have already done your immigration appointments and have your BSN to open up an account.
Dutch service is terrible in general, but I was pretty shocked when we went to set up bank accounts here. We went into three ABN AMRO branches and they all told us we needed to book an appointment for one or two weeks later. They were literally pushing our business away.
The first ING we walked into (located here), we went right up to the counter and opened up two accounts within 15 minutes. Now, that was probably partly because they were experiencing a lull in the day, but I find everything about ING more pleasant. Their website is in Dutch, but they have a great app in English. We haven’t had any trouble with them so far.
We’re creeping up on the 5 month mark in Amsterdam now. Overall, we’re loving the city. There are still moments where I’m biking around and I have to remind myself that we actually live here now. The architecture and people are so unique and quintessentially European that it can feel quite surreal.
We scored an awesome 3-month rental that we found on this Facebook group. January 2018 marks our final month in this current rental, and we are moving into another 3-month rental (a houseboat!!!) that we found on the Facebook marketplace. Facebook is a great place to look for rentals to avoid paying fees, but you really have to be on it and persistent to beat out the competition. After this next rental, we are hoping to settle into a longer-term place in the Oud-West area.
I am 2 months in to my job here at a local startup and really enjoying it, and Madi is in some really promising conversations with a few creative agencies here. She was offered a job around the same time that I got mine, but decided to hold out for something that felt like a better fit.
Now we’ve transitioned into the phase where we’re settling into a routine, trying to make new friends, and planning our next weekend trip around Europe ;)
We’ve just crossed the year mark in the Netherlands, and this post is now the first thing on Google when you search ‘Canadian moving to Amsterdam’. The internet’s pretty cool.
We’re settling in for our second winter here, currently in a long term apartment in the Westerpark area. We’re both working full time in central Amsterdam, and have agreed that we probably have one of the most picturesque commutes in the world. Luckily, my work has sponsored me on the highly skilled visa (and Madi as a registered partner) so we’re in the clear deportation-wise. One thing that has come up a few times from people reaching out about this article is the ability to work for the same company beyond 12 weeks on the working holiday program. In my case, I had no issue with this, but I have heard of a few people running into some trouble. My advice would be to make sure that the companies you’re talking to are cool with bringing you on with that visa and there won’t be any surprises down the line. You should also make sure to discuss the eventual move to the highly skilled visa.
If you have any further questions about moving to the Netherlands (from Canada), or you just want someone to grab a beer with once you’re here, please respond to this article in the comments!

We were talking the other day about how untypical it has been to revisit a country you’ve had the chance to travel before. I mean, there are a few exceptions (for work Maeghan would travel to certain cities each year for conferences) but to visit a city you went to when you were in your 20s and then revisit 7 years later is a pretty cool experience.
Maeghan came to the Netherlands during college and has family scattered across the small country. She remembers having little money and being nervous to travel on her own without some sort of direction. But this time around, we’ve been lucky to make friends while traveling, had the time to mature as travellers and that makes visiting the same places in a totally different mindset is pretty awesome.
After some time in Amersfoort, we visited Utrecht and Amsterdam and got to indulge in some super fun stuff.
Oh, we also learned a lot about the Netherlands. 1) Maeghan was brought up calling it Holland. Turns out, there is an interesting reason why (Watch the CPG grey video to explain) 2) This country is tiny and so easy to get around in comparison to most of the other places we’ve visited 3) Everything and everyone is awesome here. So you should visit ❤
See more on our website www.alittledetour.ca🌏✈️👫
We celebrated Maeghan’s birthday in Amersfoort and she was totally spoiled. After the early gift of Balloon rides in Cappadocia, we got to tour around where her grandparents lived and grew up and had a awesome dinner at a jazz pub near by with family.
So these are house boats. People buy the spot on the water and build a house that is anchored there. We were kind of mind blown, some of these house boats are super modern!
We had a jam-pack planned Saturday in Amsterdam. It started with Maeghan trying to be cool like all the young kids and get her ear pierced (she felt very hardcore), then strolling through some markets and craft beer stores as it was Zwanze Day (A special beer event from one of Oli’s favorite breweries) until we reached our final destination at a concert, The Pineapple Thief, that Oli had been looking forward to for weeks!
We made some Canadian friends from Newfoundland dat the bar and talked all about living and traveling abroad, and how crazy of a place Amsterdam can be!
The demographic of attendees was older, so there was no pushing, no garbage on the floor, lots of space and really nice people all around! What a way to enjoy a concert! :P
The next day, Banksy had one of his famous pieces auctioned off and to everyone’s surprise, he had it self- shred upon purchase. So Oli felt very relevant after learning all about Banksy.

Hoy! The capital of the Netherlands holds a special place in my heart. Never have I liked a big city as much as Amsterdam. It booms with people from all over the world, the standard of living is exquisite, and there are so many bike lanes! Find yourself wandering around Amsterdam, taking in the canals, the houses among them, the marvelous new architecture, and experiencing this small but beautiful country.
Get yourself the real deal: A fresh Stroopwafel on a market. This is so good; I cannot even describe it. Stroopwafels are a traditional dutch pastry; a doughball with spices and cinnamon gets baked into the Wafel. The thought of the smell when it comes out waters my mouth! It then gets cut open, and a thick sirup, the Stroop, is put onto it, and tadaa, you have yourself a heavenly tasting dessert. Or…

Today is the beginning of my month-long, Amazing Amsterdam Adventure.
I will be on my own this month, and I have decided to pretend I am a tourist who managed to find a beautiful apartment in Amsterdam for a month.
The first day of my fakecation began appropriately with transportation challenges. I helped my daughter and family get to the train station, and it was a bit more challenging than anticipated to get all those bikes and the dog across town to Central station, never mind onto a train.
I left them outside and then got very lost on my way home — at one point, my GPS tried to send me into the canal. Fortunately, I made it to the apartment. Now, after a hard day of traveling, I am beginning this adventure.
I hope you join me.
You can read more about my plans in the piece below.

Amsterdam had been in my dreams for a long, long time. The trip was something I started planning and preparing for months before it actually happened. Last week, I finally visited the city, and it took my breath away.
Getting to Amsterdam from the Schiphol airport (AMS) is fast and effortless: you can ride a bus (€6 and 15 minutes to the Amstelveen bus station) or a train (€4.30 and 20 mins to Amsterdam Centraal), or take an Uber (€20–25 and roughly 15 minutes).
The place I lived at is located not in Amsterdam itself, but in the suburban town of Amstelveen. The moment I got off the bus, I was astonished by the quiet and peaceful neighborhoods of Amstelveen. As I was going to find out later, the whole town is just like that: filled with two- to three-story houses, divided by narrow streets, and with bike lanes on every single street.
I arrived on October 31st, which gave me a chance to see how Amstelveeners celebrate Halloween (if they even do). What I saw gave me a sense of community in Amstelveen: people dress up their houses with fake spider webs, carve pumpkins, and place baskets with candies outside so that anyone (primarily kids) can have them whenever they want.
If goes without saying that local grocery stores had bunch of Halloween food, like these “pumpkin” profiteroles.
Another thing that indicated strong community in Amstelveen was the leisure center (called Randwijck Markt) which doubles as a coworking area in the daytime and a club in the evening, where residents gather to share stories, sing, and discuss town matters. A nice lady who works there invited me to see what’s inside and have a cup of coffee, but I had things to do, so I politely declined the invitation.
Moving on to Amsterdam itself, the first time I saw the city was through the subway train’s window. Train 51 can take you from the suburban town of Amstelveen to Amsterdam Centraal (Central Station) in about 20 minutes. You see, Amsterdam is not a big city, compared to Rome or Paris.
As you approach the downtown, you first travel through business districts with a lot of office buildings that have names of well-known companies sparkling on their roofs. I haven’t been to those districts, so it’s hard to tell what it feels like to work in Amsterdam.
The city core looks and feels just like in the photos I’d seen on the web before the trip.
Amsterdam Centraal is the starting point for many Amsterdam visitors.
Like Venice, Amsterdam is divided by countless canals. Unlike Venice, those canals don’t show up in random places-there’s certain logic: just compare the map of Amsterdam with the one of Venice.
Dull and rainy days are a usual thing for the city.
Amsterdam’s architectural style appeals to me.
The city is absolutely full of bike riders. They’re everywhere, and sometimes it gets pretty dangerous, especially if you’re not used to them sneaking all around.
If I were asked to name a city that offers the best selection of food, I’d undoubtedly name Amsterdam. Compared to all the places I’ve visited over the past couple of years, Amsterdam gives you the biggest choice of different styles and cuisines. From traditional burgers-and-fries fast food to pizza to Turkish doner to spiciest Asian dishes-Amsterdam’s got you covered.
Amsterdam houses many museums and other points of interest: from the Rijksmuseum to the Anne Frank Huis to the Torture Museum to the Museum of Prostitution.
Museumplein (Museum square) is located between three museums: the Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum, and Stedelijk Museum.
Nightlife in Amsterdam is as various as the city’s food. The infamous Red-light district (De Wallen) houses countless bars, clubs, and brothels (although the latter looked like a joke).
Amsterdam’s Vondelpark is one of the largest and best-known parks in the city. It’s a classic public park, as seen in most other cities I’ve been to. And yes, it has bike riders everywhere.
Street art is not rare to see, even in remote neighborhoods.
And in the evening, the city appears in a whole new light (literally).
Amsterdam showed itself to be a comfortable city for living, with plenty of opportunities for leisure and entertainment, and various work options (at least if you work in IT). If I had to choose between living in the city of Amsterdam and the suburbs, I’d probably opt for the latter for its quiet streets (once again, I’m not a fan of big cities).

I decided I’ll write a bit about the two cities I just visited during my French school break, partially because my British friend Matt (shoutout number three if he’s counting!) encouraged me to keep writing about urban planning. So here I am.
Amsterdam is very interesting with its urban planning — some might call it “the Mecca” of urban planning because of how idealized it is by many urbanists. The most popular urbanism YouTube channel is Not Just Bikes, who moved to Amsterdam because of its reputation. But what is it really like?
I would imagine the tourist experience is much different from the habitant experience, even more than other cities. This is because while the prioritization of biking is helpful for locals, it can be difficult for a newbie to get a handle on. As you walk around the city, there can be so much to look out for as a pedestrian. Watch out for the bikes! Watch out for the tram! Watch out for the cars! It’s a complex ecosystem, and if you aren’t paying attention, it can be easily overwhelming.
I did love the trams in Amsterdam’s city center. Metros can go faster underground, but the experience of a tram above ground, where you can simply hop on and look out the window at the city, is delightful. However, I noticed that the trams and metro have a tap-in and tap-out system, which I’m not a fan of. In New York, you use your ticket to get on the subway, but you can get off wherever you want and you do not have to rescan the ticket. This is much easier for riders. My friends and I were sometimes scrambling to take out our ticket again and rescan to exit the train.
I get the sense that in Venice people actually use their canals for transportation, but in Amsterdam this does not seem to be the case. There are tours on the canal, but not a lot of regular folks using the canal to navigate the city. The bikes are everywhere. I don’t know how I underestimated the number of bikes when I knew how bike-crazy Amsterdam is, but I underestimated them.
There are a few things I prefer about Paris, a place I’ve been to many times and am more familiar with. The sidewalks are wider in Paris than in Amsterdam. There are also a lot more terraces/outdoor seating in Paris, which is always welcoming and enjoyable for tourists and locals. Amsterdam’s meager outdoor seating was always just a few tables outside, whereas in Paris there can be huge terraces with many tables for people to simply plop down and order a coffee. Relaxed café culture in France is simply unbeatable. In comparison, with its smaller streets and a lack of outside seating, Amsterdam is always keeping things moving. It’s a faster pace but it’s also exciting and keeps you turning down the next corner.
There are a few key neighborhoods in Amsterdam. The 9 Streets neighborhood is very beautiful with varying architecture and canal views, but much of the ground floor establishments were expensive shops. Again, I would’ve liked an outdoor café to sit and take things in rather than feeling like I couldn’t linger. I found the Jordaan neighborhood to be more residential (I could literally look into rich people’s houses because of their big, open windows) but just as architecturally interesting. The Red Light District felt the most touristy. It’s really just one street, a couple blocks long, with sex workers in the windows and “cinemas.” We walked up and down it once, but there wasn’t much for our group to do there.
Athens has a few popular neighborhoods as well — Plaka and Psyri. I found Plaka to be touristy in some parts and desolate in others. Maybe this is just my experience. I really liked Psyri — I had multiple meals in that area and found something going on down every street. Cars in Athens are interesting — they attempt to go down any street they can fit in. I was sitting outside at a café and a car squeezed through the small street less than two feet away from me. There is a lack of signaled crosswalks in Athens. Most of the time people just cross the street whenever possible through traffic. That is less than ideal.
But I would not say Athens isn’t walkable. I walked all over the city center while I was there and only took the metro a few times to get to faraway locations. When I did take the metro, it was fairly reliable but not the cleanest. One thing I did like about the Athens metro was that they had signs showing which direction the escalators were going so that you could easily navigate where you needed to go to get out. I haven’t seen that in a metro before, but it was helpful.
Athens is the furthest south I’ve been in Europe and the sunshine was welcome after months of rainy winter in France. One thing I noticed is all of the solar panels! Many apartment buildings had multiple solar panels at the top, maybe 6 feet long by 4 feet wide. In contrast, when I took the Eurostar train to Amsterdam, I noticed that Belgium and the Netherlands had a lot of wind turbines. Northern part of Europe, more wind, it makes sense.
This was a great trip with two cities I really wanted to see this year, so I’m proud of myself and feeling very fulfilled.

Amsterdam is one of the most famous places in The Netherlands, but city officials are putting measures in place to reduce tourism.
A few years ago, the city of Amsterdam started fighting back against mass tourism (also called overtourism). You might wonder why, since tourists can be great for the local economy. Let me explain a few reasons:

A City of Surprises and Endless Possibilities.
No city compares to Amsterdam’s diversity. Every time I visit, I discover something new that I never knew existed. It’s like joining an adventure each time, with surprises waiting around every corner.
And I love it.
This year, I’ve had the opportunity to visit Amsterdam two times, and each experience has been unique each time.
The first visit was with my family. We were a large group, which made it challenging to please everyone. So, my daughter and I quickly decided to return on our own. (So we did, a couple of weeks later).
During our first visit to Amsterdam, we decided to play tourists. And what better place is there than to visit The Royal Palace?
This palace is best known for being where the King and Queen of the Netherlands stand and wave to the people on various occasions.

Earlier this week Bloomberg published an article about a meeting of multiple cities in Amsterdam last month “to forge an alliance in response to Airbnb and Uber.” This headline misses the mark; it is both misleading and glosses over what actually happened. I should know: I was at the meeting.
The Global Sharing Cities Roundtable was conceived by the City of Amsterdam several months ago, as an opportunity for cities who are leading efforts to understand and promote the sharing economy worldwide. Participant cities ranged from Seoul, whose Sharing City initiative dates back to 2012 and includes everything from a city-owned space sharing platform to investment of public funds in more than 50 sharing economy initiatives, to Copenhagen, whose sharing economy strategy is linked to its goals for sustainability and the circular economy. Of course, Amsterdam played a leading role — as Europe’s first self-declared sharing city, home to numerous sharing economy enterprises and a fresh approach to policy reform.
Airbnb and Uber were discussed at the roundtable. But to be clear: the roundtable was not “about” them. The purpose of the roundtable was for cities to meet each other — the overwhelming majority of them had never been in contact before — and to engage in blue-sky thinking about the sharing economy’s potential.
True, Amsterdam’s innovative approach to policy reform for homesharing and short-term rentals was one topic discussed, due to popular demand by other cities. But it was only one topic. Dozens of other topics were also part of the agenda. Ridesharing and ridehailing were another popular topic, though ironically Uber itself barely came up. Rather, more time was spent on brainstorming how the sharing economy can link with waste reduction initiatives, serve to rethink delivery of public services, engage youth and elderly, and potentially help tackle a wide range of other social problems for cities worldwide. The Bloomberg article misses the mark in failing to detail — or even acknowledge — this much broader agenda.
I was honored to be invited as the only non-city employee. (For full disclosure, I have advised several of the cities in attendance.) Bloomberg reached out to interview me but did not follow through in doing so. Meanwhile, none of the people quoted in the interview were at the meeting. With all due respect, this falls short of what I would expect from one of the world’s most esteemed publications.
The sharing economy is about much, much more than Airbnb or Uber. We should know that. It is extremely frustrating to see the media focus disproportionately on what is but one piece of a much larger pie. It is increasingly easy to single out one or two companies, but by doing so, we are missing the forest for the trees — and missing a much bigger opportunity.

I have lived in the Netherlands for nearly four years now, the past two in Amsterdam. Because I moved here during the pandemic and then was sick quite a bit for the last year, I haven’t done as many of the touristy things as I might have liked.
Starting August 1st, things are about to change.
My family lives on the same block as I do, but they are going away this year for August. That means I will be on my own in my beautiful apartment.
I have decided to pretend that I am in a beautiful vacation apartment in a city I don’t know well and act like a tourist. I will visit museums and gardens, take a canal tour, and do anything that seems fun. I will probably even take some of my own advice:
medium.com
And, of course, I will regularly write about it, so stay tuned!

From Bicycles to AI Agents: How Amsterdam Changed the Way I Think About AI,https://nwijesekare.medium.com/from-bicycles-to-ai-agents-how-amsterdam-changed-the-way-i-think-about-ai-111f5a910569,"Sign up

Not long ago, I found myself in Amsterdam — one of those “I need a break, but let’s call it inspiration” kind of trips. I was wandering along a canal with a ridiculously good coffee from a tiny cafe that looked like it had been decorated by someone who really loved vintage postcards and didn’t believe in chairs that match. I wasn’t thinking about work. Or at least I told myself I wasn’t.
At some point, I was standing at a crosswalk near Jordaan, watching bicycles zip past — one woman riding no-handed, coffee in one hand, phone in the other, somehow gliding through this chaotic mess of tourists and trams like it was nothing. And I just stood there, kind of stunned by how everything was working. No signs, no instructions, no one directing the flow. Just people navigating it together independently, but weirdly in sync. I don’t know why, but it made me think of AI agents and the way they should work — fluid, reactive, quietly doing their thing without being micromanaged.
If you’ve ever watched Amsterdam cyclists at rush hour, it’s like a ballet — chaotic but balanced. Dozens of people moving independently, but somehow in harmony. There are no detailed instructions, no central planner shouting orders, and yet everyone knows where they’re going and how to get there.
That’s exactly how we should think about AI agents — not as rule-bound bots waiting for step-by-step commands, but as autonomous systems capable of interpreting vague goals and getting things done. Rather than telling them exactly what to do, you provide a clear objective, like “Draft a user-friendly changelog from these commits”, “Find three good flights next Friday that don’t land before 10am” or “Clean up this spreadsheet and flag anything that looks off.” And the agent figures it out. It plans, makes trade-offs, calls tools, revises, and checks back when needed — all without being micromanaged. Just like a cyclist adjusting their route on the fly to avoid a crowd or take a shortcut.
Amsterdam cyclists don’t know every street by heart. But they don’t stop pedalling every time they hit a new neighborhood. They ask. They glance at signs. They check their phones mid-ride. They adjust without missing a beat.
That’s exactly what Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables in AI. Traditional models rely on what they learned during training but that knowledge gets stale. RAG allows agents to “ask” for updates from real-time sources: internal wikis, live documents, recent chats, or APIs. The model doesn’t have to memorize everything; it just needs to know when and how to retrieve what matters.
Imagine asking an assistant, “Can you send the updated vacation policy to the team?” Without RAG, it might make something up or pull in outdated info. But with RAG, it actually retrieves the real policy from your Google Drive and shares the correct details. It’s like giving your AI access to your company’s memory, so it doesn’t just sound confident, it is accurate.
It’s the difference between blindly guessing your route and checking the map mid-ride. Cyclists don’t freeze up when they’re unsure — they adjust. That’s the spirit behind RAG: staying curious, staying responsive, and rolling with the unknown instead of rigidly sticking to a script.
If you have ever ridden a creaky old bicycle through cobblestone streets, you know: even a good system needs upkeep. In Amsterdam, riders are always tweaking something: fixing a squeaky brake, tightening a loose seat. You’ll see tools everywhere like air pumps on the sidewalk, little repair stations on corners. It’s just part of keeping things rolling.
This is the dance of AI-for-code and code-for-AI.
On one side, tools like Copilot, ChatGPT, and Cody are transforming how we write software. They help generate boilerplate, catch bugs, write tests, and even explain complex code. They’re like having a bicycle mechanic riding shotgun, tightening bolts as you move.
But on the flip side, code-for-AI is where the real infrastructure gets built. It’s where you define your agent’s behaviors, their constraints, their tools, their norms. It’s how you make sure your AI doesn’t veer into the wrong lane. You give it a frame, a drivetrain, a set of rules.
What’s exciting is how the two are starting to build on each other: as AI gets better at coding, it becomes easier to create smarter, more dependable agents and those agents, in turn, help us write even better code. But it’s not just about moving fast. It’s about holding up over time. You don’t just want an AI that can sprint — you want one that can go the distance, and patch things up when they break along the way.
The magic of Amsterdam isn’t just the bicycles — it’s the unspoken rhythm everyone seems to follow. People just know when to slow down, where to ride, how to signal. It’s not about strict rules or endless signage. It’s something built into the culture. That shared understanding is what keeps everything flowing, even when the streets get packed.
That’s what Model Context Protocol (MCP) does for AI. MCP defines how agents interact with tools, with other systems, and with users. It gives them structured context about what’s available, what’s off-limits, and how to behave in a given environment. It’s like a silent rulebook that all agents agree to follow. Without MCP, each agent is a rogue cyclist dropped into traffic with no map and no idea what a red light means. With MCP, every agent enters the environment already knowing the rules — not just for itself, but for the broader system it’s riding within.
The future of AI isn’t just about making individual models smarter. It’s about building shared standards and frameworks that let these agents work together smoothly and safely in real-world situations. Think of it this way: training the model is like teaching someone how to ride a bicycle, while MCP is like giving them a map and the rules of the road.
Watching a group of cyclists ride in sync, adjusting speed, spacing, and direction as one is kind of hypnotic. No shouting, no instructions, just quiet coordination. One slows down a bit, another speeds up, and they glide through a tight turn together.
That’s what agent-to-agent collaboration can unlock. You don’t need one giant all-in-one “super-agent” doing everything. Instead, you want a bunch of smaller specialists who each focus on what they do best, communicate clearly, and work together smoothly. One handles the schedule, another puts together a proposal, and someone else makes sure everything’s following the rules. It’s like a group of riders on bicycles — each with their own job, but all moving in sync because they’re paying attention to each other When agents talk to each other i.e. when they can share state, delegate tasks, escalate decisions, and adapt dynamically they stop being tools and start becoming teammates.
Standing at that crosswalk, I wasn’t thinking about AI. But somehow, AI found me anyway.
What really stuck with me about Amsterdam’s bicycle culture wasn’t just how charming or efficient it was — it was the independence. No one was waiting around for instructions. No hesitation. Just people who understood their surroundings, trusted their instincts, and moved with just enough awareness of others to keep things flowing.
That’s the kind of AI worth building — not rigid scripts, not those bloated, do-everything systems that crumble when things get messy. Instead, it’s about small, capable agents designed to think, fetch what they need, follow protocols, and work together. Tools built to handle the unexpected without constant oversight — to move, adjust, and ride.
Because the future of AI isn’t some bullet train locked to a single track moving fast but missing the turns. It’s more like a fleet of bicycles — light, responsive, and always adapting. And if they can keep your coffee from spilling in the middle of the chaos? That’s a win :)

Beautiful Amsterdam / Built on Poles/ Who would pay if it all fell down?
–Old Dutch nursery rhyme translated
Since early times, the houses in Amsterdam have been built on wooden foundation piles[i] that are driven deep into the clay, peat, and water until they reach the first layer of solid sand. Even some of the trees in Vondelpark are supported on wooden piles to keep them from sinking into the marshy ground.
How long can a wooden pile remain in the ground before it has to be replaced?
300 years? 80 years? Until next week? The answer depends on many variables:
Quality of the sand layer
In Amsterdam, the first layer of sand lies approximately 12 meters below the surface. However, the quality of the sand layer is not consistent throughout the city. In some areas, the first sand layer is thinner than normal or missing entirely. As a result, the houses in these areas sink at an abnormal rate, and the foundations have to be replaced faster.
The top of the wooden foundation pile should be below the lowest expected water level. If part of the pile reaches above the water, it will be subject to insect attacks and decay. A problem is that the water level under Amsterdam isn’t always stable. For instance, it can drop during long periods of drought. Or a sewer pipe can develop cracks, allowing the ground water to flow into the pipe and be carried away. As a result, the water level drops.
On the other hand, if the water level rises too high, as sometimes occurs after a heavy rain, the Amsterdam cellars and crawl spaces fill up like bathtubs.
Construction projects can also interfere with the water level. An example is the incident on the Vijzelgracht in 2008 during work on the new metro station. A leak in the dam wall at a depth of 60 meters caused water and sand to stream into the pit. Part of the sand layer that was supporting the wooden foundation piles of the nearby houses washed away, causing extensive damage to the structure of the houses.
Spruce is less vulnerable to damage from bacteria than pine. Since around 1970, piles made from pine are prohibited from use. Concrete and steel piles are often used in present day construction.
The visible signs are slanted floors, cracks in the walls, doors and windows that stick, and broken front steps. The charming crooked roofline of Amsterdam is actually a symptom of unstable foundations.
If a foundation that is in poor condition is not repaired in time, the wooden piles will need to be replaced. No homeowner wants to get this news. A new foundation can easily cost 100,000 euro. Furthermore, the floor may need to be opened up, thereby making the house unlivable for some time.
In recent years, the housing corporations have been replacing the wooden piles under their properties with concrete piles.[ii] For example, Ymere is replacing the decayed pine piles in the Van der Pek neighborhood — a costly investment. However many houses that are at risk are privately owned.
The condition of the old wooden piles will only worsen in the coming years, so the question is: who will pay?
[i] Referred to as poles in the nursery rhyme.

Hi there!
Welcome to a cityscape with unique merchant houses, intersected by numerous canals. Amsterdam is a lively city with a rich cultural scene and 800 years of history.
Forget about the typical tourist traps.
I will tell you the best things you can do for the first time there to feel fabulous.
Stay with me so you don’t miss anything.
Here we go with the Top 10 Must-Do Activities In Amsterdam:
Cycling isn’t just a mode of transportation in Amsterdam.
It’s a way of life!
With over 800,000 bicycles in the city — more than its human population — Amsterdam is often called ‘The Cycling Capital of the World’.This is owed to the city’s flat terrain and extensive network of bike routes.
Experience the city alongside locals on two wheels.
I am sure that you will love Amsterdam’s cycling culture:
www.dutchamsterdam.nl
Grab your saddle and pedal through Amsterdam’s bike-friendly streets.
You will enjoy passing by historic landmarks and picturesque canals.
Try to choose a sunny day or be prepared to cycle in the rain, as is often the case there!
The city of Amsterdam has a unique network of canals stretching to the west and south of the historic old town. The project was initiated during the late 16th and early 17th centuries.
It consists of the reclamation of swampland and the construction of concentric arcs of canals.
The canals, along with radial waterways and streets, showcase the city’s rich history. Now you have a chance to enjoy its beauty and heritage!
Find more information here:
whc.unesco.org
I had the opportunity to step into the evolution of Jordaan.
Once a humble working-class enclave, it has now transformed into Amsterdam’s hippest neighborhood!
Here, you can stroll along streets lined with art galleries, vintage boutiques, and bars.
Amsterdam’s Nine Streets, nestled behind the Royal Palace on Dam Square, attract both locals and tourists alike:
www.iamsterdam.com
Lose yourself along the cobblestone streets and peaceful canals of Amsterdam’s historic district!
Now, get ready for a journey through time. In just 40 minutes, you’ll zip through 400 years of history, starting from a swampy area.
The best part? This museum tells how Amsterdam, a city built on water, came to be:
grachten.museum
The museum itself is housed in a jaw-dropping building on the Herengracht.
Once you’re inside, grab an audio guide and settle in.
Before you know it, the lights dim, and bam! You’re whisked back to 1600, smack dab in the middle of Amsterdam’s golden age.
But wait, there’s more! This museum isn’t just about history.
It’s also about the city’s vibrant life.
The doll’s houses are straight out of the past and snippets from cult classic movies.
Yeah, it’s that cool.
Ever wondered what it’s like to live on a houseboat? Well, now’s your chance to find out!
Step aboard the Woonboot Museum, a cozy floating museum housed in a converted cargo ship from 1914:
houseboatmuseum.nl
You can sip tea and enjoy cake while lounging in retro armchairs.
But that’s not all — Amsterdam’s houseboat scene is a unique way of life. Dive deeper into its story at the Boat Museum of the Canals.
Located on the famous Prinsengracht, this museum offers a glimpse into Amsterdam’s aquatic past and present.
Learn about the evolution of houseboats, canal history, and more.
After all, where else can you get a firsthand look at life on the waterways?
Explore one of Amsterdam’s most powerful historical sites, the Anne Frank House.
Enter the hidden annex where Anne Frank and her family sought refuge during World War II.
Here, you’ll uncover the truths of the Holocaust:
www.annefrank.org
In this museum, you will see Anne’s actual diary and other relics.
I was inspired by the lasting message of courage and hope.
Experience the world of art at the famous Van Gogh Museum.
You will see the largest collection of Vincent van Gogh’s masterpieces!
This museum provides a close look into the life and art of the iconic Dutch painter:
www.vangoghmuseum.nl
Admire his lively paintings, sketches, and personal letters, witnessing the journey of his artistic brilliance.
Dive into centuries of Dutch art and history at the legendary Rijksmuseum:
www.rijksmuseum.nl
Discover masterpieces by Rembrandt, Vermeer, and other masters, highlighting the richness of Dutch culture.
From stunning paintings to decorative arts and more, the Rijksmuseum invites you now.
As soon as I walked into the Heineken Brewery, the delightful aroma of hops surrounded me.
Exploring the brewery’s vats and vintage equipment, I discovered the story of Heineken’s beginnings and their dedication to brewing excellence:
www.heinekenexperience.com
No wonder it’s my favorite beer!
The tasting room was a highlight for me.
With every sip, I savored the essence of Heineken’s craftsmanship. Heineken truly deserves its high regard in the brewing world.
Do you enjoy this beer as much as I do?
As the sun dips below the horizon, Amsterdam ignites with exciting nightlife.
The Red Light District, famous for its legalized prostitution, is a must-see spot and that caught my eye too:
amsterdamtickets.tours
I wandered through lively streets with friends, enjoying its unique vibe.
But there’s more to see in the district than just its reputation. Amongst the buzzing nightlife, you’ll discover a fascinating mix of history, culture, and cutting-edge experiences.
Explore cozy cafes, trendy bars, nightclubs, and live music spots.
Amsterdam offers endless possibilities for nighttime adventures.
Whether you’re into groovy beats or prefer a chill night with locals, the city promises unforgettable experiences until the early hours.
Ready to dive in?

In conclusion, Amsterdam invites adventurers with its captivating mix of past, present, and excitement.
Whether you’re gliding along its famous canals or diving into its rich art scene, this city has something for everyone.
So, what are you waiting for?
Get ready for an epic adventure through Amsterdam’s beating heart!

The last time I ventured to Amsterdam was 20 years ago, so I decided that it was perhaps time to make a return visit and see what had changed. When most people think of Amsterdam they automatically and quite rightly think of Anne Frank, the beautiful canals and the tulips (& maybe even the brownies).
However, as is always the case, going slightly further afield can offer other sights and events. Having been there before, I had already visited the Anne Frank house and museum, and so I decided to spend the limited time that I had available on simply exploring areas of the city and visiting a few other select attractions.

Today is the 7th day of my August Amsterdam Adventure, and I went to the Rijksmuseum, the National Museum of the Netherlands. I had the opportunity to see the famous painting “The Night Watch,” which is undergoing restoration, a process being documented every step of the way. The Museum has published extensive information about it online.
I spent two hours looking at only a fraction of the work on exhibit and am looking forward to doing more of a deep dive this month into the art available to residents and tourists in the Netherlands. Today’s visit included works by Rembrandt, Vermeer, and Van Gogh, among many others.
I will be visiting the Van Gogh Museum later this month, as well as the Fabrique des Lumières exhibit of the Dutch Masters, and I will write a lot more about them. I will be keeping a travel log about my adventures here:

Amsterdam by Ian McEwan certainly isn’t the first novel in the history of literature that deals with moral hypocrisy in a corrupted society, nor is it the last. But the way McEwan deals with it, the approach, the focus — it is all so fresh (even now, in 2015) and remarkable. The narrative instance doesn’t criticize and doesn’t even laugh at those characters. Instead, we, the readers, are encouraged to take the protagonists seriously. There is no bare sarcasm, only the finest irony, essential to characterization and plot. McEwan is a master of the free indirect style. We are in the characters’ heads, thinking their thoughts, afraid of their fears. We are worried that Clive will end up just like Molly. And there is Vernon with his feeling of non-existence, which is a postmodernist moment, for he certainly does not exist until someone reads the novel.
The introductory setting is hilarious. Two middle-aged guys are attending an ex-lover’s funeral. The ex-lower was a kind of femme fatale cliché of the XX century. The sound of the name, Molly Lane, somehow recalls Molly Bloom. There is, also, at least, one more ex-lover of hers, and her husband. They are all connected in various ways, but the existence of Molly deepens those connections. The first two guys are friends and, which is more important, they give us the first two points of view. They are the good guys. According to them, the husband is stupid and possessive. The third lover, a politician, is an enemy of the previous three.
The language of the novel is extraordinary. Characterization is delicate and minutious.
So, we have two bad, and two good guys. And then Vernon appears to be quite immoral and without human principles. Nevermind. There is Clive, with his moral superiority. He is the one who really loved Molly, who deeply misses her, and who doesn’t even want Vernon to publicly humiliate the arch-enemy, by publishing his photos in women's clothes, taken by Molly, and provided by her husband. We also read a long and rather pathetic passage about how Clive had always been a so much better friend to Vernon than he was to Clive.
Just a few pages later, this morally superior guy goes hiking, in search of inspiration, and then witnesses an act of violence, perhaps a murder, and just walks away, because, for god’s sake, he has the symphony to write!
After less than half of the novel, there is no good protagonist left for us to feel empathy for. But, instead of becoming boring, the novel’s plot starts to accelerate, preventing you from letting it from your hands before you’ve read the very last page of it.
The main plot triggers are behind us by now. Clive and Vernon have made a pact: if one of them gets ill the way Molly did, the other will arrange euthanasia abroad. After that, they’ve had the first, but crucial, argument in the history of their friendship. It is about embarrassing photographs of Foreign Minister, Julian Garmony, which were about to be published in the magazine that Vernon runs.
Now comes a deus ex machina — and the first spoiler to Vernon’s plan. A new character, the Minister’s wife, gives a press conference, which turns things upside down. On the sudden, it is not the politician’s head urgently needed on a plate, but Vernon’s.
Vernon and Clive are mad at each other, as they both feel betrayed. They start to hate each other and, in the end, mutually arrange a murder in Amsterdam, where the grand premiere of Clive’s symphony is about to be performed.
It is Molly’s husband who, followed by now ex-Foreign Minister, buries them all. The most of his wife’s former lovers are dead, and now he recalls memories of Vernon’s wife, who used to be wild. He is about to call her for a dinner. So, who is laughing now?
We are. At this moment, I can’t recall any other piece of prose in which the death of the main characters produces such a comical effect. It is even not morbid humor; it is just humor, and it is great.
Ian McEwan won the Man Booker Prize for Amsterdam in 1998.

Welcome! Happy to see you in the seventh part of my Vuejs Amsterdam Conference 2022 summary series, in which I share a summary of all the talks with you.
You can read my JSWorld Conference 2022 Summary series (in four parts) here, where I summarized all the first day’s talks. You can also find the previous Talks of the Vue Amsterdam conference 2022 in my blog.
After two and a half years, JSWorld and Vue Amsterdam Conference were back in Theater Amsterdam between 1 and 3 June, and I had the chance to attend this conference for the first time. I learned many things, met many wonderful people, spoke with great developers, and had a great time. On the first day the JSWorld Conference was held, and on the second and third days, the Vue Amsterdam.
The conference was full of information with great speakers, each of whom taught me something valuable. They all wanted to share their knowledge and information with other developers. So I thought it would be great if I could continue to share it and help others use it.
At first, I tried to share a few notes or slides, but I felt it was not good enough, at least not as good as what the speaker shared with me. So I decided to re-watch each speech, dive deeper into them, search, take notes and combine them with their slides and even their exact words in their speech and then share it with you so that what I share with you is at least at the same level as what I learned from them.
Everything you read during these few articles is the result of the effort and time of the speaker itself, and I have only tried to learn them so that I can turn them into these articles. Even many of the sentences written in these articles are exactly what they said or what they wrote in Slides. This means if you learn something new, it is because of their efforts.
Last but not least, I may not dig into every technical detail or live codings in some of the speeches. But if you are interested and need more information, let me know and I’ll try to write a more detailed article separately. Also, don’t forget to check out their Twitter/Linkedin.
Here you can find the program of the conference:

I’m not the author: it’s written on this bicycle basket!
Three words, just as inspiring as the plastic-cleaning initiatives carried out along the river.
This city offers endless sources of inspiration, from biking and boating to street art, nature, shopping, museums, architecture, food, and even cannabis!
For those seeking a thrill, dare to swing into the void at the top of the XXX tower, with its swing above the abyss.
However, cycling in THE bicycle city can be just as exhilarating, having to watch out for fast-moving cyclists and pedestrians.
The key to this city’s success lies in its diverse offerings, ensuring that everyone can find their way around.

This month I am engaged in an experiment. Normally I spend a lot of time with my family, who live only a few doors away from my apartment in Amsterdam. However, they are on a month-long adventure to Great Britain, leaving me on my own. Rather than feeling sorry for myself, I am creating a month’s worth of exciting touristy plans where I am going to pretend to be a tourist in my own city.
I haven’t developed a full itinerary yet. Today, August 1st, I helped my family get to the train station, then came home and relaxed after several days of helping them pack for their own adventure, which consists of biking all over Great Britain and camping for a good portion of that time.
I am also getting started on creating a calendar. I am going to publish the first draft of it, which will consist of a few plans I’ve made in advance by necessity, such as making reservations for the Van Gogh Museum and my oncologist appointment, which was scheduled six months ago. I will add activities as they arise—some of which will be pre-planned, and some will be scheduled the way I most enjoy things: on the fly, depending upon my mood and the weather.
There are a number of things I don’t want to miss, such as going on a canal cruise or visiting some of the less…

Cities and their spaces are designed experiences — we’re just not always aware we’re users. Within these spaces, we encounter countless touchpoints — physical, emotional, and social — all shaping the way we experience them.
With a background in product design and professional experience in UX, I’ve always understood user experience as something holistic, more than digital interactions. But during a recent trip to Amsterdam and Dubai, I noticed something deeper: cities themselves are designed experiences.
Walking through these two very different cities made me reflect on how much urban design and service design overlap. From the ease of getting around to the emotional tone a space creates, I started seeing each city as a living system — one with its own user flows, pain points, and design choices.
In this article, I share some of those observations from my personal experience and the UX lessons I took from them.
My trip began in Amsterdam —a city where user experience extends beyond screens, shaping how people move through their environment every day. One of the first things I noticed was how bikes aren’t treated as a leisure activity or exercise, but as the primary means of getting around. People bike everywhere, even to nightclubs.
Back home in Portugal, cycling is more of a weekend activity — something for fitness or family outings. In Amsterdam, it’s everyday life. That difference struck me, not just because it was unfamiliar, but because it revealed something deeper: how infrastructure shapes behavior, and how behavior, over time, becomes culture. The flat terrain, narrow streets, and widespread bike infrastructure all work together to make biking the most natural choice.
Design made it easy. Culture made it normal.
As I walked alongside the canals, passing locals on their bikes or stepping out of houseboats, I began to understand something about pace and emotional design. The layout of the city encourages slowness. Not in the sense of inefficiency, but in presence. The kind of design that makes you look around more, breathe slower, take things in. Amsterdam moves differently — both physically and emotionally. The environment isn’t just designed for mobility; it’s designed for human connection.
One small detail that caught my eye — and kept coming back to me — was something I might have overlooked if I hadn’t asked about it. I noticed strange hooks jutting out from the top floor facades of the narrow houses. Curious, I brought it up to the friend travelling with me, who had already been to Amsterdam and explained that these are centuries-old fixtures for moving furniture and goods through windows. The buildings are too narrow, the staircases too tight, and so people developed an outside-in system. A centuries-old solution to a simple but real problem:
“How do you get your couch into a house with stairs too small and steep to carry it up?”
It’s a quiet example of design under constraint. Faced with tight architecture (partly shaped by historic tax laws), people innovated through a humble, mechanical workaround. What struck me most is that it’s still used today. It reminded me of a moment in Urbanized, the documentary by Gary Hustwit, where it’s mentioned how the most meaningful urban innovations often come from the bottom up — citizens adapting space to fit real needs.
The second and final part of the trip was spent in Dubai. If Amsterdam felt spontaneous and human-scale, Dubai felt curated — like someone was handling it for me.
Getting around wasn’t just about driving — it was about being moved. From valet parking to full-service fuel stations where we never had to leave the car, every step of the journey felt taken care of.
Across both service and transport, I noticed a pattern: the city was designed to require less from me. Less friction. Less effort. Fewer choices to make. I could compare it to a seamless user journey where each step is thoughtfully designed, with no critical pain points.
In UX, we talk about reducing cognitive load and anticipating needs. In Dubai, it felt like that idea was everywhere. From how you moved to how you were received, the environment kept stepping in for you before you even realised what you needed.
As I settled into Dubai, it became immediately clear that the city was designed with an extraordinary level of attention to detail. In fact, it was so present that I almost didn’t realise it at first.
It wasn’t just that Dubai was clean — it was that someone was always cleaning it. From mall bathrooms to rooftop clubs, I saw staff quietly maintaining the space, constantly resetting it. And that’s when it hit me: it wasn’t just about upkeep; it was an integral part of the user experience.
Most people only notice cleanliness when it’s absent. In Dubai, it was so proactive and seamless that it became a continuous, visible signal of care. There was a sense that the space was always ready for you, that someone had already anticipated your needs. This wasn’t just about hygiene; it was about creating a sense of psychological safety, comfort, even luxury. Cleanliness here didn’t just make the space more pleasant; it made you feel valued. It told you: your experience matters. Everything was designed to make you feel supported, reducing mental load so you could simply exist in the moment without worry.
It reminded me of how digital services work in the background — updating, syncing, backing up — without you having to lift a finger. You don’t see it, but it builds a foundation of trust by keeping everything running smoothly. In Dubai, this same principle applied to the physical environment, where every detail felt carefully planned to keep things effortless.
Behind this seamless experience, of course, is a larger system of labor and structure. Dubai’s focus on high service standards relies on a workforce of trained individuals, which are migrant workers. Their work enables this constant care, and it’s important to acknowledge that the experience of ease and luxury is held up by a whole infrastructure designed to support it.
As a tourist, everything felt designed to be easy, polished, and thoughtful. Not just functionally, but emotionally. It was the kind of design that made you feel cared for, without even realising it.
On a final note, the most striking aspect of my travel experience was how I was addressed. I was consistently greeted with “madam”. It wasn’t just politeness. It was a signal — a small, repeated gesture that carried emotional weight.
You’re seen. You’re respected. You’re valued here.
And what struck me was how consistent it was. Whether I was at a humble restaurant or shopping, the tone didn’t change. The same level of care and attention showed up everywhere. That consistency created something rare: a shared emotional tone across different service levels.
In a way, this mirrored what I’d already been feeling in Dubai: that the city was designed not just to function well, but to make you feel looked after. The details weren’t loud — but they added up. And sometimes, all it takes is a single word to shape the emotional tone of an entire place.
Luxury in Dubai is easily accessible. The views are framed just right, designed to impress and soothe. You got the sense that someone had considered how you might feel at every turn.
Of course, none of this is accidental. Dubai’s focus on aesthetics and hospitality is a cornerstone of its identity. The city markets itself on these experiences. It is curated — carefully and deliberately — to feel seamless. But even knowing that, it still worked. What stayed with me wasn’t the imposing skyline or luxury touches, but the quiet signals of care: a clean space, fuel stops anticipating needs, and a respectful “madam” at every place. It reminded me that thoughtful environments — digital or physical — aren’t just designed for function. They’re designed to shape how we feel.
In Dubai, that feeling was clear: you’re being looked after. It was frictionless, anticipatory, and emotionally consistent. A good experience designed end to end.
Looking back, it’s clear how deeply our environment shapes our experience — often in ways we don’t even realise. Whether through frictionless mobility systems, services that anticipate needs, or subtle cues that build trust and emotional safety, thoughtful design operates on many levels at once.
What surprised me most was that, in a place known for innovation and cutting-edge tech, it wasn’t the digital interfaces that left the strongest impression. It was the experience of navigating the city itself — the people, the spaces, and the seamless care in every interaction.
Great user experience — whether in a product or physical space — isn’t just about usability. It’s about how we feel while interacting with it: confident, cared for, at ease.
This trip reminded me that UX and service design extend far beyond screens. Every touchpoint — human, digital, or physical — shapes the journey. And in the best cases, that journey feels seamless — not because it’s invisible, but because every detail works in harmony to support the user.
A note on context
The perspective in this article comes from my experience visiting Amsterdam and Dubai as a tourist. While my time in Amsterdam was shaped by exploring the city on my own, in Dubai I stayed with people who live there. That experience gave me a different kind of access — more immersive and seamless — which naturally shaped how I experienced and noticed the city.

When I woke up the next day I knew I was cooked. I’d wanted to go to Italy, but that wasn’t realistic anymore. My engine was puttering. Plus, I was almost out of Adderall. I only had 4 pills left, enough for one more day and a plane flight. So, by that math, I had one more night left.
Using the hostel computer, I booked a one-way ticket from Amsterdam to O’hare for the following day at 5pm (17:00). I also booked new lodging for my final night. It was an outdoor campy-type place about 20-minutes away from the city center. On their website, it looked more like a trailer park than a hostel. There were no amenities other than the communal grills, firepits, and bathrooms. It was definitely weird, but I didn’t mind weird, so I rolled the dice, hoping for a day of peace and quiet. I had a lot of notes to go through and memories to piece together, and that seemed like the perfect place to do it, away from the world, on mushrooms, in a trailer. That’s what Hunter Thompson would have done to make sense of a romp of that magnitude, and Hunter was my North Star.
After checking out of the hostel and saying goodbye to Karim, I went to take care of one last errand. What do you do when you’re completely exhausted and need a little extra pep that speed can’t give you? You buy shoes, of course. The right pair of shoes can give you super powers. Throw in a haircut, and you can defeat an army.
Before passing out at the concert, I remembered noting that Raekwon had on a snazzy pair of blue and red Nike Dunks. That’s probably what planted the seed. Plus, my brown low-top Converse were mangled and nearly unwearable. So, I set out on a mission to find the perfect pair of life-saving shoes to propel me through the rest of the trip.
After an hour of searching, I was just about to give up, when I saw them in the window of a skate shop. I immediately knew they were the ones. I stood staring at them like Wayne from Wayne’s World did with his dream guitar. They looked like beautiful chocolate covered bananas, immaculate, and completely in line with my style, other than the 130 Euro price tag. They were emergency medical shoes though, so cost be damned. (Insurance should really cover fly shoes).
I paid the guy right after lacing them up and gave him my old Converse to toss. I felt like a new man. I was ready for whatever the next 24 hours had to throw at me.
After buying some mushrooms (I still had a ton of weed left), I checked out of my hostel, called a taxi, and headed to the trailer park. Saying goodbye to Amsterdam wasn’t easy, which made the ride a little emotional for me. Throughout my hectic 6-week trip, Amsterdam had been my home base, a place where I always felt comfortable. For some reason I just fit in there. The city opened their arms for me — Willy Nelson, Karim, the bouncer at the Melkveg, Neil, even the pseudo-pimp who chose to spare my life— they all looked out for me at a time when I needed it most. I felt so grateful to all of them.
I saw hippies before I even got out of the taxi, which made me uneasy. (For someone who doesn’t like jamband music, I find myself around people who do quite often.)
“Don’t worry about the hippies,” I told myself, “ you’re motherfucking John McEnroe.”
I wanted to get into the mushrooms before the sun went down, so as soon as I familiarized myself with the trailer and the surrounding area, I got right to it. I’d purchased the same style of mushrooms I had before. I’m that way with everything. If I like something, I will continue with it until it burns me, be it restaurants, people, or socks. I always get out when the gettin ceases to be good.
I took them around 5pm and wandered around in my flip flops, waiting for them to kick in. When they did, they kicked in hard, like a mule or the DEA. I took the same amount as the last time, but for some reason I was 10 times as high. When I went back into my trailer to gather myself, the exact opposite happened. I completely freaked out. My vision wasn’t right. I had no clue what was going on. I grabbed a pen and wrote, “EVERYTHING IS RED”. There was a mirror in the trailer, and I made the mistake of staring into it. DO NOT make that mistake during a bad trip. During a good trip, maybe, but never during a bad one.
The mirror was firey red and my face was peeling off. Blood was dripping from my chin, it was a horrifying scene. There was also this awful sound, like the kind you hear when someone presses the red emergency button at a nuclear power plant. My brain was in crisis.
I splashed water on my face in an attempt to tamp down the flames, but it didn’t work, so I started removing my clothes. They had bad juju all over them, and they needed to go.
As I was taking my pants off I looked down. That’s when it hit me.
“I’m not wearing my shoes! What the fuck was I thinking!?”
As soon as I put them on, my vision went back to normal, and the blaring alarm in my head stopped. To make sure I wasn’t losing my mind (I was absolutely losing my mind), I took them off again. Everything turned red. I put them on once more. No red.
Then, I heard a knock at the door.
“OH SHIT,” I whispered, tossing on a new shirt.
If you’ve ever taken hallucinogens, you know a knock at the door is the last thing you want to hear. The sound itself is paralyzing. Anything can be behind that door, and I mean ANYTHING. There are no limitations to what the brain can conjure.
Then, there was a second knock.
They weren’t going to give up, I could feel it in my bones. I had to open the door and face my fears. Most trips, in some way or another, are about facing your fears.
I walked over to the door and placed my hand on it to see if I could feel any weird vibrations. Nothing.
Then I grabbed the knob and turned it slowly, hoping the person had already left. When I opened the door I was greeted by a smiling, shirtless hippie with dreadlocks.
“Hey, sorry if I scared you, man. I’m Liam. I wanted to invite you to join the group. We’ve got a fire going and we’re just jamming out. It’s pretty chill.”
While I tried to comprehend the words he was saying, he began staring down at my feet intently.
“Those shoes. They’re amazing,” He said, slowly.
“Trust me, I know. I’m really high on mushrooms and they just saved my life,” I told him, just as slowly.
“Ha, sounds intense. I’m on mushrooms too. We all are.”
Before I could tell him I didn’t do well in groups, Liam walked me over and started introducing me.
“This is Sam. He’s really high. Be nice to him.”
“Sweet shoes,” one of them said. “They look like chocolate covered bananas.”
“They do, don’t they?” I said, enjoying my inside joke.
We hung out for a few hours. They played their guitars while I just stared into the fire. We didn’t talk much, but it was nice. No one felt the need to fill the air with bullshit. We just utilized the good vibrations to enjoy our own thoughts. The red was a long lost memory, and the fire didn’t scare me one bit.
When the drugs started wearing off I thanked the guys for their company and made the walk back to my trailer to call it a night. To be safe, I kept my shoes on inside. I wasn’t going to make the same mistake twice. Lying in bed, I grabbed my notebook and a pen.
A+ in group setting
Was Johnny Mac a hippie?
AM I A HIPPIE?!
I stayed in bed until noon the next day, relaxing in silence and smoking joint after joint. I felt terrible about wasting weed and I still had a quarter ounce left that I didn’t want to just leave in my trailer. If I’d seen anyone on the property other than the manager I would have given it to them, but I didn’t. When the cab driver picked me up, I could tell he wasn’t an option either, so I just stuffed the remainder into my pants pocket, assuming I’d be able to give it away at the airport.
After the cab dropped me off, I stood right in front of the exit, next to the “No Weed Past This Line” sign, and held the baggie in my open hands. “Free weed, get your free weed. Take as much as you want. Free weed here,” I yelled like a peanut vendor. People just walked right past me though, one after the other. I was in disbelief. No one wanted free weed. Every 20-something that I stopped declined. Some said they had their own, while others declined based on strain preference.
“These snobby bastards,” I thought.
I stayed as long as I could, smoking cigs, and advertising my goods. After an hour of embarrassment I gave up and threw it in the garbage (just like the stand-up comedy fliers I used to pass out in exchange for stage time). I was pissed off for the first time since I’d been in Amsterdam. It wasn’t the weed thing, I was just irritable. I didn’t want to go home. Home was where the problems were, where that awful basement was and all those terrible memories. I had no place else to go though. It was my mom’s or nothing, at least for a little while.
And just like that, my trip was over. I felt trapped again.
The flight home was anxiety filled. Instead of reading or writing I just sat there and stewed. I’d quit comedy, graduated college, left to find myself, and returned to the same exact spot, completely clueless about what to do next. The only thing I knew was that stopping to mourn and take care of myself was not an option. I had to keep running, no matter the cost.

After visiting the many great talks of the Voxxed Days I started my journey home to resume my responsibilities as a parent. While leaving the conference location I saw people already entering the Pathé building for the movies that evening. While part of the community was still sharing their thoughts upstairs at the venue I looked back at a great conference. The nine or so hours I stayed flew by and this was all made possible by Codelab, sponsors and volunteers, so thank you for your efforts.
I saw many familiar faces that also decided to do something else than work, meetings or chores that day. The sun was definitely shining outside the sky was blue and people were happy. IT people almost naturally retreated to the dark movie theatre rooms.
The conference started for me with Sander Hoogendoorn talking about AI and what it can bring developers and companies. A massive boost in capabilities, creating bigger things with the same team. In my opinion the use of AI will probably increase the amount of tech debt and developers will be still needed to actually fix problems and write better code. Sander also mentioned that AI must be seen as a tool for developers it would be good to embrace it or you will miss opportunities.
After that Sander Mak told a story about taking risk and not being afraid to fail. Failure is part of learning, true words. At the company Picnic they introduced Calcite for querying over databases, this lead to many changes and some very challenging ones. This change allowed the more technical business users to get data with their own queries without going directly to the separate databases. Calcite provides federated querying and makes queries database independent. I left the room with a positive vibe both keynotes were great.
Many more great talks followed and many of them I was not able to visit. I very much struggled with the fear of missing out. One of the talks I really liked was about Redis 8. Raphael De Lio showed in rapid pace, and with a live demo, some of the new features which include fast vector search. Something that makes Redis very useful for AI applications.
One of the overlying themes of the conference I observed was loose coupling, on every level of a software platform. In the code as the hexagonal architecture and the use of Spring Cloud Functions. The latter is ideal for separating business logic from cloud specific logic Elena van Engelen-Maslova told us. For logging, tracing and metrics the use of Open Telemetry and on the infrastructure side the use of tools like Rancher. Also for testing the need for better integration testing between external interfaces has become possible with the use of a tool like Testcontainers which was mentioned in the talk of Adam Michalik.
It’s nice to get advice which I can apply directly the next day and that was given by Paco van Beckhoven about merge requests (roll eyes, yes Gitlab). A template for a merge request with checklists is useful according to him. Also it always good to provide the reasons for the changes in the merge requests. I think carefully reviewing MR’s will become even more important if more of the code is not written by a person
It was getting late and the final talk would soon start. I did not know what to expect. After 5 minutes it became clear it was like a nightmare story for engineers. Adele Carpenter provided a story about airplane systems and how we as software people can learn from the reasons for planes crashing. Often it was mixture of systems having no useful alerting and redundant systems making it more complex to understand what is going on for the pilot. This hits home because badly communicated redundancy was the reason for a recent production failure of a system I am working on.
While walking back to the metro station I was divided, on one hand I felt comforted because I had seen people doing their utmost to improve and create software, platforms and processes and on the other hand the need was shown for even more secure, green, reliable and well architected software. The world as we know has become more unpredictable and with IT becoming more critical it feels like we need to be better prepared for the unexpected.

I used to think flowers were a sign of weakness, a delicate fragility that I couldn’t afford to indulge in. Femininity seemed like a luxury, something I couldn’t permit myself to embrace. I hid my love for it, buried deep where no one could ever find it.
But she did.
I was walking down the street when I saw a bunch of blooming flowers, I photographed it then a smile formed on my face, feeling giddy with all the colourful blossoms in front of me.
She had a way of unravelling me, peeling back the layers I had so carefully constructed. She learned my language, deciphered the unspoken truths I kept locked away. She discovered my secret affection for spring, their vibrant petals whispering of beauty and life.
Someday,
she would say, her eyes twinkling with dreams,
we’ll go to Amsterdam together and walk through fields of tulips.
I never believed her. Not really. Our lives were a constant dance of reality and dreams, with reality often winning. But she was different; she believed in the power of dreams.
The rain drizzled gently against the cobblestone streets, each droplet a whisper of sorrow from the grey sky above. A lone figure stood by the edge, cloaked in a heavy coat that did little to shield against the biting chill of late autumn.
We never made it to Amsterdam together. Life intervened, pulling us apart in ways we couldn’t mend. Two years passed since the last time she learned my language, each day stretching the distance between us. I thought time would dull the ache, but some wounds only deepened.
Then, I received the call. The words were cold and final:
She’s gone.
She had gone to Amsterdam alone. She had gone to find solace among the field of tulips, but now, she lay beneath them, the place of our unfulfilled dreams.
I booked a flight without thinking. The journey felt like a cruel joke, a pilgrimage to the land of what-ifs.
As the plane descended, I remembered her voice, her promise of tulips, and my heart shattered once again.
I made my way to her grave, a simple plot marked with her name. Tulips surrounded it, their colours mocking my pain. They were the flowers I had secretly loved, the ones she had promised to show me. And there she is, in the middle of it all.
I let the tears fall, unchecked and raw. The tulips swayed gently in the breeze, their petals brushing against my skin. They felt like her touch, a reminder of what I had lost. She had been my only refuge, now, she was gone, and all I had left were these cursed flowers.
Standing up, I whispered to the wind,
Meet me in Amsterdam.
but there was no one left to hear. The tulips nodded as if in understanding, their vibrant colours a silent testament to a love that could never be.
From now on, I would walk through life crying for flowers, for the tulips, for a dream that died too soon, I buried my heart among the petals and turned away, forever changed.

Two weeks ago I decided Amsterdam would be my place to settle, hoping finally this would be the place for me and even though I had been warned by my peers and colleagues, I did all my homework, studied the market and told myself that it couldn’t be as hard as finding an apartment in China, where everybody just spoke Mandarin to do so.
I was extremely wrong, the market here is insane, maybe because we are in a post-covid season and the city is blooming with tourism, perhaps is the interest younger people have towards trying the so-called “legal drugs”, it might be due to the high season rental as schools and Universities are starting again or simply just a slip from the Dutch government when considering housing options for everybody.
The reality is that thousands of people are competing on a daily basis to find an apartment, a room or at least a long-term stay without paying a kidney and a half for it.
I got an Airbnb type of apartment via Expedia, it was a great deal for one week, only paying 917€ after my Genius 30%…

Amsterdam moves. People walk briskly, bikes fly past, trams glide along their rails. Everyone seems to have a place to be, a purpose to fulfill. And yet, despite the chaos — bikes weaving through pedestrians, cars stopping and starting, boats slipping quietly through the canals — there’s a strange kind of order. No honking, no shouting, no visible frustration. Just movement. It feels like watching a symphony with no conductor, a city that somehow just knows how to keep itself in rhythm.
I sit by a restaurant window and watch it all unfold. The rain-speckled glass blurs the edges of passing figures, turning them into something out of a painting. I catch glimpses of them — sharp jawlines, loose scarves, hands tucked into the pockets of long coats. I find myself romanticizing over every woman that walks by, assigning them stories they’ll never know they’ve been given. She’s on her way to meet a friend. She’s heading home after a long day at work. She’s just as lost in thought as I am.
And then there are the couples. The ones who share a cigarette outside a café, the ones who lean into each other on their bikes, the ones who don’t need words to fill the space between them. I am content here, alone, but I can’t help but envy them. Amsterdam is beautiful on its own, but I imagine it would be even better when shared.
The Dutch language wasn’t a necessity — I could’ve gotten by just fine without it — but I’m glad I learned it anyway. Even simple exchanges feel like small victories, a way of stepping further into this place instead of just passing through it. And the food? The beer? It all just sits better. There’s a freshness to it, a simplicity. I don’t leave meals feeling sluggish, just satisfied.
Maybe that’s the feeling I’ll take home with me — not just the admiration, not just the longing, but the quiet contentment of being here. The realization that I don’t have to understand how everything works to appreciate that it does.

Hoy again! The capital of the Netherlands holds a special place in my heart. Never have I liked a big city as much as Amsterdam. It booms with people from all over the world, the standard of living is exquisite and there are so many bike lanes! Find yourself wandering around Amsterdam, taking in the canals, the houses among them, the marvelous new architecture, and experiencing this small, but beautiful country. Here are 5 more places to go to in Amsterdam:
This one is for street art lovers: The NDSM Werft across the river has some of the best street art I have ever seen. You can find the famous “Let me be myself” banner of Anner Frank here. It is the perfect place for an industrial and colourful photoshoot with vibrant and exquisite street art as your background. Or just look at all the cool art displayed by many…

By Johannes Novy
When COVID hit the Netherlands in 2020, Amsterdam emptied of visitors overnight. Long-term residents, inured to the permanent noise and litter and tourists peeing in the streets, welcomed the newfound tranquillity. The pandemic, they told the Washington Post, was “a blessing in disguise”.
COVID has offered a rare, if not unique chance to address tourism’s enduring problems. From how people reach destinations to how tourism is managed within the cities it floods, not to mention the way its benefits and costs are distributed to local communities, the burden of overtourism has long been a concern.
Amsterdammers aren’t the only city dwellers to perceive the current pause as a much needed relief. From Kyoto to Venice, residents see a return to pre-pandemic tourist numbers as a threat, not a promise.
For years, we’ve been told that tourism needs to be sustainable, without much consensus on what sustainable tourism looks like. COVID, meanwhile, has seen the term “resilience” become a go-to for industry insiders and policymakers. But what exactly is resilient tourism? And can it make our cities any more socially and environmentally responsible? Can it make them any better to live in?
Broadly conceived as the ability to manage adversity, resilience is touted as an essential quality for coping with uncertainty and change, stress and shock. As trends go, resilience isn’t new. It was Time Magazine’s environmental buzzword of the year in 2013. It has since become one of the dominant tropes in contemporary debate on everything from island studies and child psychology to urban disaster risk reduction.
The pandemic has of course brought global tourism to a virtual standstill. In 2020, 1 billion fewer international trips were made to tourist destinations than in 2019. Up to 120 million jobs were threatened. So thinking about how this industry, which previously supported one in ten jobs worldwide, might cope with the stress and shock of COVID is no bad thing.
However, critical geographers and political sociologists alike have warned that the concept of resilience is in danger of becoming as empty a notion as sustainability. It has its roots in ecological and engineering thinking, wherein it refers to the ability to return to normal － to a state of equilibrium — after a period of adversity. Critics argue though that, in the social world, we deal not with equilibrium structures, but constant flux.
In a city, there is no normal state to return to. And those affected by natural hazards — a coastal mega-city prone to flooding, say — were vulnerable to begin with. Returning to an original state is therefore as undesirable as it is impossible. Instead, cities adapt.
More broadly, resilience thinking is deemed inherently conservative. With the emphasis it places on bouncing back, it is underscores reactive and short-term solutions. These distract from the need to address the root causes of major challenges such as climate change.
It is also not as harmless a theory as it may seem. When politicians insist that investing in a more resilient city is plain common sense, they often downplay issues of power and inequality. New Orleans is a case in point. Rebuilding after hurricane Katrina in 2005 came at enormous social cost, when the city privileged economic gain over the needs of marginalised communities.
Resilience is nonetheless an elastic concept, and it is increasingly associated not only with the ability to bounce back after a setback, but also to bounce forward — to a new and better state. The UK government’s slogan “ Build Back Better”, has become the mantra for a myriad post-COVID ambitions, particularly with regard to tourism.
That said, as travel restrictions are lifted and the cruise ships return to Venice’s St Mark’s Square, mere weeks after the Italian government promised they wouldn’t, it looks like this golden opportunity to rethink tourism has been lost.
Governments generally seem more interested in a return to business as usual than in thinking about how much tourism we can actually afford. Calls to come up with a fairer, less exploitative model have, at best, been met with a muted political response. Governments appear loath to discourage business trips, despite climate scientists advocating for less air travel, because they bring in money.
Any attempt to make tourism truly resilient, however, has to go further than short-term economic recovery. It has to address the tourism sector’s carbon footprint and its injustices and ethical quandaries.
In this respect, Amsterdam presents an interesting model. COVID has accelerated the implementation of several measures under consideration well before the pandemic took hold. The city has adopted ordinances that variously prevent souvenir shops from displacing local businesses, developers from turning residential spaces into holiday lets, and new hotels from being built.
Elsewhere, it has hiked up the tax tourists pay for overnight stays and introduced measures to reduce the so-called incivilities (littering, public urination) they unthinkingly leave behind.
More broadly, it has become the first city ever to embrace British economist Kate Raworth’s doughnut economics model for sustainable development. This theory centres on the environment and the basic needs of its citizens as opposed to economic growth. The council has pledged to use it as a guideline for all future policies that govern urban life — from emissions regulations to fixing the city’s housing crisis.
It is still too early to say whether these efforts will pay off. Without a similarly bold rethink, though, more residents will likely rebel against the touristification of their communities. If, on the other hand, more cities follow the Dutch capital’s example (as Copenhagen, Brussels, Dunedin in New Zealand and Nanaimo in Canada are reportedly doing), the idea of a real bounce forward might indeed apply.

Within minutes of having waved each other goodbye we received a call from the friend. He seemed worried, having received some information about the train schedules, and wanted to make sure we had not been affected.
It happened to be the final episode of what had been a forgettable trip to what is otherwise among the most preferred travel destinations for my partner and I.
There are lots of things about the Netherlands that we simply adore, and it is precisely these aspects that make us head to that country over and over again.
The Netherlands is by far the country that we have visited the most, so much so that every time we head there, we have to look for places that we are yet to visit. It is also a fact that, while we have been to a lot of places in the Netherlands, there are still quite a few that we are yet to visit.
Having said that, there is also a flip side to everything, and this narrative is about a trip to the Netherlands when nothing seemed to work for us.
Amsterdam is the largest city in the Netherlands, and definitely the most beautiful. During my early visits to this country, it was palpably the first…

By the time we visited Amsterdam, we read enough blog posts and talked to other travelers who raved about Amsterdam and figured we just had to go there. It just didn’t do it for me.
As a person who enjoys the beauty of architecture, it wasn’t as stunning in comparison to the other places I’ve just traveled through in Europe, Brussels and Barcelona. Amsterdam is a place of things to do over a place of things to see. If you really want to enjoy Amsterdam then you should focus on the houses, and museums, as there are few stunning points of interest in the city.
Amsterdam felt like a trip to Brooklyn, N.Y. on steroids, which made sense after I learned Brooklyn and Harlem were designed by the Dutch and New York used to be New Amsterdam.
Being that Amsterdam is a place of things to do, I focused on food, museums and the major attractions.
The major visually pleasing attractions:
Must try foods / snacks:
Must Do Activities:
Note: Only a select few ‘coffeeshops’ sell alcohol at theses establishments
I think 2–3 days in Amsterdam is more than enough to be able to enjoy what it has to offer. I’d schedule the visit for a weekend so you can enjoy the party scene in Amsterdam as well. I can’t say I’ll be back to visit any time soon, but I will say this is a place I could easily live in because there’s plenty to do.
Pro Tips:
Almost everyone in Amsterdam speaks English
The Dutch are very rude, but just be aware of it and accept it , New Yorkers are rude as well
Bicycles have the right of way, get out of the way or they WILL hit you
Look left and right before crossing and beware that you’re not accidentally in the bike lane

Amsterdam is a truly unique and beautiful city that’s well worth a visit on any European adventure. It’s best known for its canal houses, abundance of tulips, and easy biking trails. With world-class museums, quirky festivals, theater, live music, laid-back bars and delightful restaurants, there’s never a shortage of things to do and see in Amsterdam… The best word to describe Amsterdam is ‘tolerant’. The world famous red-light district, coffee shops might make it a city of sin, but in truth, it is a city of freedom. And in freedom, most people find sin…

“Your body is not a temple, it’s an amusement park. Enjoy the ride.”
-Bourdain
The ferry dropped us off at the Amsterdam Centraal train station at 2pm, amid the most perfect spring day. It looked like a real-life Truman Show, the way everyone was smiling and laughing without a care. Even the pigeons looked happy, chilling by the canal, generously sharing food.
It made me wonder…
Are people happy because they’re in Amsterdam, or do happy people just gravitate there, making it so? Hard to tell. Sounds like a chicken/egg situation. Speaking of which, I’ve always wondered if people weigh more because of their genes or because their caloric intake is higher, and they work out less. Like, if you took two people who eat and workout the same amount but one’s family has been fat for generations (like mine) and the other skinny, would they end up weighing the same exact amount? I ask because I’ve always felt predisposed to fatness due to my dad’s genes.
Before looking for a hostel, I wanted to get high, so I went in the first “coffee shop” I saw. Now would be a good time to describe the difference between coffee shops in America and coffee shops in Amsterdam. They look the same, except in Amsterdam, some sell weed. Pretty simple.
I ordered a pre-roll and a latte. If cocaine and heroin together is a speed ball, weed and coffee together is more like a curveball. Part of me felt demure, sitting there smoking a joint by myself in a café. The other part though, was high as fuck, and VERY paranoid. The American penal system was so ingrained in me that my Pavlovian response to being high was an intense fear of the police. No matter how much I reassured myself that I wasn’t breaking the law, I couldn’t shake the fear of being arrested. You don’t realize you’re paranoid amidst the paranoia. If you did, you wouldn’t be paranoid.
*
On my walk to find a hostel I couldn’t stop laughing at the ridiculousness of the street names. I wrote some of my favorites down. I also made up some of my own. See if you can guess which are which. I can’t even remember myself.
- Brouwersgracht
- Hosenlendinvein
- Princeneiland
- Amsterveenseweg
- Grunarpeilveg
- Einelpenilhar
- Brouwersgracht
The hostel I chose was a far cry from The Flying Pig, the “it” place I’d read about in my research. The Flying Pig was the most popular hostel for people under 30 (still is) because it has a weed smoking section in the common area where they have pipes and bongs to rent. There was a communal element, one I was not looking for. I don’t like being part of groups and try to avoid it whenever possible. I want to do what I want to do, not what “us” wants to do. “Us” is always some lame compromise. Instead, I went with an off-brand hostel, one that catered to an older, more laid-back crowd. When I booked it online from London, the picture made it look like a nondescript Holiday Inn Express. It was a little off the beaten path, but not too far from the action. It seemed clean, calm, and quiet, exactly what I wanted.
When I checked in, it did seem both clean and calm. But, to my surprise, I heard jackhammering. When I inquired, the manager told me there would be construction every day from 9am-5pm. I thanked him and went up to my room.
That’s how I am, I thank people who inconvenience me. I’ve always been way too accommodating, even to my own detriment. I try to save the world one favor at a time. I could have very easily found another hostel that didn’t have Jackhammering, but that, somehow, in my mind, would have been considered breaking a commitment. The hostel was probably struggling because of the jackhammering, and I wanted to help. I know, that’s crazy.
When I got up to my room, there was, in fact, a man jackhammering five feet from my window. It sounded like the gunfight from Heat. So, I turned right around and got out of there.
On my way down I saw the Manager again.
Manager: Sir, how is your room?
Me: Perfect. Thank you.
I still had an hour to kill before the jackhammering stopped, so I set out to buy weed, enough to last at least a week. After 5 minutes of walking, I stumbled upon a place called Coffee Shop Bob Marley. From the outside, it looked exactly like you’d think it would, Jamaican flag, pictures of Bob, Wailers albums. It was corny, but it would do. Afterall, they had weed for sale.
When I entered, I was greeted by an old budtender who looked exactly like Willie Nelson, all the way down to the bandana. From his voice, I could tell he was an American ex-pat. He handed me a Trapper Keeper-style three ring binder. In it were plastic pages with little slots for what traditionally would have been baseball cards. Instead of cards though, each quadrant contained a nugget of weed, along with a description (e.g. purple haze: mellow, euphoric). It was the first time I’d seen such a professional setup, and it blew me away. I’d smoked weed daily for 5 years but had never dreamt of such a variety. I’d hit the motherload.
After much consideration, I selected 4 indica strains and paid Willie 60 Euros for the 14-gram purchase, an amazing deal anywhere in the world at that time.
Me: May I light up in here?
Willy: Of course. The smoking room is in back.
The smoking room was just a small, curtained off area with a few high-top tables. A Bob Marley music video played on the television hanging on the wall. I put my bag down and removed a grape White Owl cigar that I’d bought before leaving London. At the time I was still smoking blunts and I wanted to “represent” my “culture” while in Europe. Ha. What I didn’t consider, was that I’d barely smoked the previous two weeks in New York. And, though I smoked a few hash spliffs the night before in London, my tolerance was still lower than usual. Regardless, I went ahead and rolled a 2.5-gram monster of Afghan Kush.
There were two other people in the room with me, a couple, who both appeared to be in their 30’s. I couldn’t hear their voices, but I assumed they weren’t from America. I did that with everyone who wasn’t traveling in a group. There’s just something about Americans, we love traveling in guided groups. Very rarely did I see a duo of American travelers, let alone a solo one. When I dumped the guts of the blunt into a garbage bin near the wall, they stared in my direction. They didn’t say anything, but I could tell they were interested in what I was constructing. I was proud of my blunt rolling skills and wanted to put on a show for them, so they could see how we did it in the states. I considered myself an ambassador.
After licking the blunt closed, I sparked my lighter, running the flame along the paper to dry it out. Then, I lit it, taking a deep drag and coughing slightly. The couple, again, glanced my way. I looked back at them, smiling like a cool dude.
About halfway through the blunt, I realized I’d made a huge mistake. I wasn’t cool at all. In fact, I was sweating bullets and overcome with dizziness. I could tell the couple wanted to check on me, they just weren’t sure if it was their place to do so. I mean, I must’ve known what I was doing, right? You don’t just roll a blunt like that if it’s your first time smoking weed.
My equilibrium was totally askew. I gripped the small, circular table like we were Greco Roman wrestling. I had to say something before it was too late.
Me: My name is Sam. I’m from America. If I die, my mom’s name is Audrey —
Then I passed out and fell off my chair.
When I came to, Bob Marley’s I Shot the Sheriff was playing on the tv. The couple was hovering over me, disturbed, their highs obviously ruined. Willie was concerned too, standing over me with a bottle of water. I didn’t even know how long I’d been out.
Willy: We were scared, man. Glad you’re ok. We don’t even allow cigars in here.
Lady: That was so scary. Why would you try smoking that whole blunt?
Me: You know what blunts are?
Guy: Of course. We’re from America too.

On my way back to the hostel, I passed what looked to be the strangest food establishment I’d ever seen. It reminded me of a Gray’s Papaya, a New York hot dog chain I loved, in that there was no seating inside. In fact, there was nothing at all inside. It was just an empty room, like an American check cashing place. Yet, it smelled like fast food. It was too weird to not investigate.
When I went in, I thought I was tripping out. I was still extremely high and woozy from the fall, but I was pretty sure I was standing inside a life-sized vending machine. The walls were lined with rows and rows of slots where hot food was kept. There must have been a kitchen in the back where everything was prepared, but I didn’t see one, nor could I hear one. The only sign of human life was the hand of an employee replenishing the stock after a sale. I didn’t love the impersonality of it all, but I had to admit it was ingenious.
My dad would have loved to have access to a place like that, where he could anonymously buy food without the judgement of a cashier. It’s just you and the food, no interaction whatsoever, perfect for an addict.
I was enjoying my burger on a nearby bench, when off in the distance I saw the glow of the Red-Light-District. Until that point, I’d thought the name “Red-Light-District” just referred to the illicit activities that went on there, I didn’t know it was a literal description of the place. It looked like a devilish carnival, the dope dealers being the carnies, and the ladies, the rides. Young adults, mostly backpackers, lined the outskirts, trying to get up the nerve to make the plunge. “How pathetic,” I thought to myself. “I can’t believe I’d wanted to do this.”

March 26, 2006
After a wonderful night of stoned sleep, I woke up to my alarm at 8:45am, which left me the perfect amount of time to shower, eat, do laundry, and get to the Smart Shop right when it opened. They call places that sell mushrooms “smart shops” the way they call weed stores “coffee shops”. I’ve always found that to be telling. Those are delicate, non-fear inducing terms. We don’t have “safety stores” in America, we have “Gun and Ammo” shops. Rather crude, if you ask me.
I’d done mushrooms a handful of times before, with experiences ranging from spiritual bliss to utter madness, but I’d always learned something about myself in the process, and that was the most important part. Wait, that’s not totally true. Sometimes, I just spend 4 hours in the bathroom trying to wipe pee that isn’t there off my pants. A psychologist would have a field day with that one.
When I entered the Smartshop, I was greeted by the kind of guy you’d think would be running a psychedelic mushroom store, long hair, flannel shirt, monk vibes.
Clerk: How may I help you?
Me: Can you please advise me on which mushrooms I should take, and the quantity?
Clerk: Of course. That is exactly what I am here for. Have you done psilocybin before?
Me: Yes, maybe 20 times.
Clerk: Ok, let me walk you through what we have.
He took me over to a glass case with about 15 varieties of mushrooms, some wet, some dry, all of them unique in shape and color. He walked me through their different levels of potency and their array of effects.
Me: How about something in the medium-strength level?
Clerk: Sure. Would you like to see visuals?
Me: Yes, please.
Clerk: I suggest 1 to 2 grams of the High Hawaiian variety, dried.
Me: Will they make me laugh?
Clerk: Ooohhh yeah.
I paid him 25 Euros and exited the Smartshop with my mushrooms. Then, I walked over to the canal. There was a light mist, so I found an unoccupied bench and dried a small spot for myself. I took the mushrooms out of my bag, along with a banana I’d saved from breakfast and a bottle of water. Then I said my usual pre-hallucinogen prayer. “Lord, please look after me during this trip. And please, please don’t let me think I peed my pants.”
Once I had the mushrooms down and the nausea passed, I sat back and read my book until the words no longer looked like words, maybe 30 minutes. That’s when the laughing started. EVERYTHING was funny. I spent 10 minutes laughing at my shoes because they looked like chili dogs. Then it was the word “wanker.” I couldn’t stop saying it. “Oy ye wanker”, “Aye wanker, quit ya wanking”, “Bloody, scheming wanker.”
Down the canal a few hundred yards away, I saw a tourist boat slowly approaching. There were about 20 or so passengers, all of them Asian. They looked so happy, with their big visors and smiling faces. I was overcome with the urge to connect with them. I stood up and waved my arms, yelling to them as they passed.
“Helllloooooo!!! Welcome to Amsterdam!!!”
They waved back jubilantly, while I cry-laughed in the rain like a maniac, yelling in their direction as they passed by my bench.
“Enjoy your staaayyyy!!”
I greeted 8 boats-worth of people over a 2-hour period. For nearly my entire trip, I worked as a volunteer civil servant for a city I’d just arrived in. You never know where hallucinogens will take you.
I walked back to the hostel soaked; my feet pruned from the rain. What I needed more than anything was a peaceful place to come down and dry off. When I got to my room, I was delighted to find none of my roommates there, a rare occurrence in a 4-person room. I toweled off and hung my clothes on the edge of the bunk before getting into my bed to reflect and relax. I couldn’t have felt calmer, laying there. My heart was pure, and my thoughts, loving.
Then the jackhammering started up. I’d completely forgotten about it. And this time, because of the mushrooms, it sounded even louder and more menacing than before. My trip was turning dark, and I had to make a move. Either go down and watch the BBC in the lobby, which would inevitably end up in conversation, or spend the next hour showering.
I went with the shower.
*
March 27, 2006
I came to the next morning, feeling exfoliated, if nothing else. My clothes were dry, finally, so I set out to find an outdoor market where I could buy an extra pair of cheap pants in case I found myself in a similar situation again. In America, we call them swap meets. They’re the same thing, just with a bad name.
When I was on my way out, I saw the manager.
Manager: Sir, how has your stay been?
Me: Perfect. Thank you. Is there an outdoor market where I can buy pants and food?
Manager: The Albert Cuyp Market would be the place.
To his credit, it was the place. Within 10 minutes of being there I bought a pair of cheap sweatpants, an onion and herring sandwich, and a crepe. I am perhaps the only person in history to purchase those 3 exact items at once. I wanted to experience the local delicacies though, and figured I could knock em out in one fail swoop. The meal brought back memories of my Bubbie, who I missed dearly. She loved herring and crepes (separately). Seeing me holding them at the same time would’ve given her a good chuckle. She’d probably ask, “What is it, my birthday?” My father loved crepes too, but the image of him eating 30 crepes is not a pleasant memory to conjure up.
After finishing my meal, I went in my pocket for dessert, 20mg of Adderall. My mom told me my Bubbie took uppers in the 60’s, when they prescribed it to housewives as a weight loss drug. I bet her grandma was a speed freak too, drinking that Coca Cola with actual cocaine in it.
I needed to charge up, and without sleep, Adderall was the best way to do that (even with sleep, for that matter). I was on a mission to find a bar that evening. And not just a bar for that night, but one I could call home in future visits. I still had a month or so left in my trip and knew I’d be back to Amsterdam, so I needed to have a reliable place to hang my hat. Bars are that important to me. I can’t just go any old place to drink willy nilly. I need a home base, somewhere I feel comfortable, where they know my name. Like the Commonwealth.
I had no clue where I was going to find it, but I knew I’d know it when I saw it (the same way pornography was defined by the Supreme Court in 1964). It took some walking, but then I stumbled upon what was undoubtably the place. I was standing at the corner of Nieuwebrugsteeg and Warmoesstraat, right where Warmoesstraat turns into Sint Olofspoort. I’m serious. I looked up and there it was… The perfect bar. The sign under the awning read: “H. Murray’s Bar.” Next to it was a smaller sign that read “Anno 1619.” It looked to be more of a house than a bar. There was even a Golden Retriever in the window, standing with its’ paws on the sill. A bar dog is a surefire sign of a good bar. If it’s good enough for a dog, it’s good enough for me.
I entered like I was returning home.
Me: Hi. I’m Sam.
Neil: Hello, friend. I’m Neil. That’s Lilly (pointing to the dog). And that’s Norman (pointing to the only other man sitting at the bar).
Me: Hello gents. May I…?
Norman: Pull up a seat, Sam.
Me: I’ll have what Norman’s having.
Always drink what the house drinks. It will endear you to the crowd. For me, that only backfires when the house drink is Sambuca. I hate Sambuca. It tastes like Christmas tree water. Or Malort. Don’t even get me started on the Chicago bars that push that lighter fluid on their clientele. Monsters.
We got to talking and time got to flying, the way it does when you’re around good people. Norman told me about his time in Berkley, about how he knew Tim Leary, Tom Wolffe and the Merry Pranksters, people I’d only known from books like The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, and Hunter’s Hells Angels. We shared the same sense of humor too. When he told me his favorite comedian was Steven Wright, I knew we were cut from the same cloth, only a generation apart.
Steven Wright is one of the more obscure, odd comedians; real dry, great word economy. He can make you laugh in less than 20 words.
“A lot of people are afraid of heights. Not me, I’m afraid of widths.”
“I think it’s wrong that only one company makes the game Monopoly”
I told him to look up Mitch Hedberg, but didn’t bother telling him how Mitch’s death contributed to my quitting stand-up, or that I even did stand-up at all. I couldn’t have done that without crying, so I just listened and enjoyed being a guest.
I wish I remembered more of that night, but that’s how it goes sometimes. I’ve always found sacrificing memory for fun to be a fair trade. Not everything has to be remembered and documented with a picture. I can’t recall most of the best times of my life and I’m just fine with that.
*
March 28, 2006
They started jackhammering bright and early the next day. Still half-drunk, wearing my clothes from the prior night, I darted down to the lobby to get breakfast before it ended. While scarfing down cold eggs and toast, I checked my pockets and counted the money I had. It was the same exact amount I’d gone out with the night before, along with a few grams of unfamiliar loose weed. John Mulaney has a joke about blacking out and coming home with more money than he left with, and that’s exactly what happened to me. Neil didn’t even charge me. He must’ve denied my attempts at tipping too, because every dollar was still in my wallet. I couldn’t recall his kind gesture, but I was sure I hadn’t just skipped out on my tab. I mean, I was pretty sure. When I’m blacked out, I’m more inclined to try and pay twice than I am to skip out on the bill. One time in New Orleans, I paid my tab, then sat there trying to pay my tab again, four more times. The bartender eventually threw me out.
Some hair of the dog seemed in order. “Hair of the dog” means “Alcohol.” They used to rub it on dog wounds. The way it’s colloquially used now is to say, “you can’t get hungover if you stay drunk.” I still had about an hour before the intense hangover would take hold, and figured a large quantity of Adderall and drinks could fend it off.
I found a nearby Irish Pub and ordered a shot and a beer. Realizing I was American, the bartender tested me before serving me.
Bartender: Do you like George Bush?
Me: He’s a cunt.
Bartender: Guinness and Jameson coming right up.
I drank and gobbled pills the whole afternoon and into the early evening, until I could hardly see straight. Bender mode, engage.
Let’s talk about benders for a minute… During 24 hour-plus drinking benders, your brain swells to the point you can barely remember who or where you are. You become erratic, uncontrollable. For no reason at all, you push over garbage cans, rip signs out of the ground, and piss on walls. And you’ll fuck anything with a pulse. You become possessed. And the choice remains… Give up and succumb to the impending hangover or continue on with disregard for all human decency. Either way, you’re fucked.
I marched on. After leaving the bar, I bought a 20oz Heineken and brown bagged it on my walk to nowhere. At least I thought I was going nowhere. My subconscious had a different idea though. I didn’t realize it at first, but I was retracing my steps from the previous day. My boozed soaked brain was leading me to the very place my sober brain found disgusting. I didn’t even realize where I was going until I saw the glowing red lights.
*
I walked the entire length of the Red-Light District multiple times, prowling amongst my fellow creeps, trying to find the perfect lady. I have always been a very discerning shopper, that time being no different. I didn’t just want any random lady; I wanted one who showed interest in me. God, that’s pathetic.
The women all had their own room where they sat, positioned toward the outer sidewalk. The ones who were “busy working” had their large window covered with a red curtain. The others, who were “waiting for work,” had their curtains drawn, allowing you to see the entire layout of the room. They were all similar; a bed in the corner, a small nightstand, presumably for keys or other knickknacks that may interfere with the coitus, and a few mirrors. Everything was red, the lights, the bed, the carpet… Like white is the safest car color, I think red makes for the most fucking.
All the women were objectively gorgeous, much more gorgeous than the sex workers I patronized in Tijuana the prior summer. They were hideous. And they robbed me. I don’t want to talk about that though. These ladies weren’t beaten down, figuratively speaking. They looked confident, even proud, like hard working small-business owners. Some of them weren’t even dressed scantily and gave off a “take it or leave it” vibe, which I dug. There were no pimps in sight either. Just the ladies and their red rooms.
With each trip down the corridor, I narrowed my selection, like I was hosting my own March Madness tournament, pitting lady against lady, with the winner advancing to the next round.
The eventual winner was white, with long, dark brown hair, and weighed about 150 pounds. She curled her index finger and invited me in, licking it between curls with the effort of a champion.
Inside, I met the pimp. He may not have been a pimp technically, but he held the money like a pimp does. And probably for the best. I gave him 50 Euros and he gave me a single condom. He didn’t say a word. Then, he opened the door to the red room.
Tonya: I’m Tonya. What’s your name?
Me: I’m Sam.
I forgot I could lie.
Her bubbliness left. Now she was working. She’d already caught her fish; the rest was just fileting.
Tonya: Bed or standing?
Me: Uhhh, standing.
I feared I might pass out if I lied down
She turned around and faced the dresser, gripping the top of it with her hand. Pulling down her black, lace panties, she began to prepare herself with one hand, the other braced on the dresser. I took my pants down, following her lead.
Lady: Ok, ready.
I tore open the condom and put it on. Then, I inserted myself.
When she moaned, I gained confidence. I started to go faster, and she moaned more, my confidence growing stronger yet. I took my left hand and slapped her ass cheek.
That’s when the pimp came bursting in.
Pimp: NO, NO, NO! NONE OF THAT!
He was pissed. I looked over at him to apologize for my lapse in judgment, and while doing so, ejaculated into the condom I was wearing. I knew I was jizzing. He knew I was jizzing. I knew he knew I was jizzing.
We both jumped back.
Pimp: Ok, that’s it you’re done.
Me: But I didn’t even cum.
He pointed to my shriveling dick.
Pimp: Yes, you did.
I had no recourse. There was jizz in the condom and I couldn’t remove it in his presence, causing a smoking gun, “gotcha!” type of situation. So, I waited until he left the room, then I got dressed, alongside Tonya.
Me: So, Tonya. Thank you very much.
Tonya: (doing a crossword puzzle) Yeah, whatever.
Me: Have a good rest of your evening.
*
March 29, 2006
I woke up the next morning wreaking of vomit. I’d gone to a bar to cement my blackout after having sex with Tonya, but unfortunately, I wasn’t able to drink enough to forget I came while looking into another man’s eyes. I guess that’s the type of memory no amount of alcohol can erase. To this day, I still see his face . I like to think he still sees mine too and were forever cosmically connected through semen.
I knew I’d be back, but I had to get the hell out of Amsterdam, pronto. I needed a reset. I couldn’t fall deeper into depravity so early in the trip. I had to pace myself if I wanted to survive another 2 weeks on the road.
After showering (I know, I’m disgusting for not having showered the night before. Get off me), I headed to the train station and looked at the big board to see what my options were. Paris was appealing but I wasn’t mentally prepared to take an 8-hour train ride. That would have left far too much time to reflect on the previous night. So, when I noticed the option to take a 4-hour bullet train, I jumped at the chance and made a reservation for the 11am departure.

I heard the conductor’s announcement as we approached Rotterdam train station — “Watch out for pickpockets!” We had nothing valuable in our pockets, I thought. The thieves would be disappointed if they picked OUR pockets.
We had barely arrived in Amsterdam two days prior, but we jumped right into action. There was too little time and too much to see. Our American employers weren’t sympathetic to our desire to see the world, and our European or Aussie friends weren’t helping when they flaunted their five-day stay at a place and uncertain departure. We heard that all of Europe shut down in August. What?! What if I got appendicitis?
Jet lag is for wusses and we are biased for action. We have to be. We got our bearings during the first evening in Amsterdam so upon our return from Belgium, we would have an optimized route to tackle our must-see list. The day before, we wandered through Delft and Leiden while keeping an eye on the watch. Thank goodness for the Netherlands’ robust train system and the manageable size of the country. Those little towns were charming even in the rain and vendors in the open market didn’t complain, so why would we?

Back in July of 2023, I flew into Amsterdam to start my new life. Amsterdam was going to be it for me. The magical canals, the tulips, the summer sun.
It was the place to be.
I understood there was a lot of weed in Amsterdam, I’m not a user but I’ve never been bothered by other peoples choices as long as there’s no pressure for me to partake.
I was excited — I’d heard so many good things about the Dutch culture, they’re friendly and community minded, they love flowers, and are some of the happiest people on earth.
I was convinced that I would step into Amsterdam and say, “this is my home,” and live here happily for the rest of my life.
I know, I set very realistic expectations for myself.
I did not own a jacket. The wind whipped you like a smoothie, what more can I say, I’d just arrived from Spain and I was cold.
I ate a sausage roll and felt like I was back at home, then I was annoyed because right next door was a salad bar I hadn’t noticed. I walked out the door, caught a taxi and asked them to drive me to my hostel.
They said, “This is not a good area.”
I’ve heard that so many times. It’s a tradition of mine to book a dodgy hostel the first night in a new country — never on purpose.
I hopped out of the taxi, payed the million bucks, and headed on in. The reviews had been good; they provided all meals if you wanted them too (and can pay for it), the common area was social with table tennis and pool and a bar.
All of this was true, and the staff were lovely. The only problem was everyone was buzzed. Is that the right slang?
Everyone checking in was out of it. Not like they’d taken a few puffs at a concert — they were not there at all. Had I walked into a hostel or a hospital?
The only problem was everyone was buzzed.
I checked in and was treated like I was also very out of it. I went to my hostel room, dumped my bag and decided to go exploring.
I enjoyed a walk through a lovely park, I was stopped by a guy who tried to get a lot of personal information from me and I assertively said, “I’m going to leave now.” Which I was quite proud of myself for doing.
I found another lovely park but it was filled with homeless people, and people on drugs. I left pretty quick.
I sat down at a restaurant and tried to get some food in me, and a cool drink. It wasn’t hot but sometimes you have to fake it till you make it.
Pro Tip: If you’re ever alone and feel less than 100%, you need to eat. Even if you’re not hungry, just pick at something.
So I ordered with a grumpy waitress, and tried not to cry as I thought about how all my dreams had been crushed in just a few hours. I was alone in a scary city. I had walked for about three hours and hadn’t made it to the Anne Frank House like I wanted, instead I was tired, scared, and the most alone I’d ever felt.
While sitting at this café fighting back tears I remembered I was in complete control of my life, choices, and actions. So I looked up hostels elsewhere. I had been told to go outside of Amsterdam and explore little towns, so I thought I’d do that.
I looked on booking.com and picked the cheapest hostel with at least an 8/10 rating. The place was advertised to be quiet, along a canal, and within walking distance to a conference centre. The complete opposite to my vibe but I was tired and I thought it’d be worth a shot.
I caught a taxi back to my hostel, contacted home, and went to bed with a very early alarm set for the morning.
The next day was the start of my overseas adventure, I just didn’t know it yet.
Have you ever been in a situation where you felt uncomfortable?
Have you ever felt unsafe in a new city?

If it’s both terrifying and amazing then you should definitely pursue it — Erada
I didn’t wake up one day saying, okay I am going to work abroad. I started looking for a new job about two months after my current company at the time, Aereo, lost their case at the Supreme Court. I was perusing the job boards and kept coming across the job post UX Designer at Booking.com.
Since I have started working, two years ago, I have been anti-corporation / anti-big team. The first job that I had after college was at a company called Pingg, a start up with a team of 10 people. I absolutely loved my time and the people at Pingg. Pingg was bought by a big corporation and many things that I loved about the start up life changed. After a couple of months, I moved on to Aereo. I knew taking the job was risky because they were involved in legal battles, but I thought it was worth the risk. I believed in the company’s mission, liked the team, and was happy to be back in the start up world. Unfortunately 3 months into my new job, we were shut down by the Supreme Court.
I stayed at Aereo for 5 months after we were shut down. There were some glimmers of hope here and there, but nothing concrete. After a while, I felt like I was wasting my time. I wanted to be learning and working, not just sitting on my hands.
So after doing some interviews, I finally manned up and applied for the UX Designer job at Booking.com. Even though it was a large corporation, there was one paragraph in the job post that really stood out to me:
Our guiding principle is that by helping our users we help our business. As a designer in our Front End team you’ll be a key part of the idea generation process, working in a small startup-like group which takes full ownership of their part of our platform. You’ll work with developers, product owners, copywriters and user researchers to conceive, analyse, hand code & test your ideas.
This is exactly what I like to do. I love starting with an idea and following that idea from creation to production. On the first phone interview, I made sure to ask if this was really the way that they worked. After the first interview, I already started to have anxiety. Am I really doing this? Am I really applying to a job in a different country? Well after another phone interview, and an in-person interview in Amsterdam, I am really doing this.
So did Amsterdam have anything to do with the job? Yes of course, but not until after I decided I actually liked the job itself. I have always liked the idea of taking a couple of years and living and working abroad but never thought that I would actually do it. Originally I thought that if I lived abroad it would be in London. I studied abroad in London and absolutely loved it. But, London is a lot like New York: major city, cabs, native language of English, a lot of the same stores and food.
In Amsterdam, I am hoping to get a very different cultural experience. Hopefully I will learn a new language, experience a different culture, try new food, get around on a bike, and travel throughout Europe. I am young and have nothing keeping me here in New York right now. I am definitely sad about leaving New York / America and I will obviously miss my family and friends, but it is the perfect time to take this opportunity. If I had this opportunity and did not take it, I know that in 10 years, or even in a month, I would look back at this missed opportunity and kick myself.

Amsterdam used to mean something to cigar lovers. Or so I’d read¹. The stories painted a picture of cigar lounges that weren’t just places to smoke, but sanctuaries — spaces where a man could light up, lean back, and let the world turn without him for a while. The kind of places that made you feel like a part of something.
But the Amsterdam I found wasn’t that.
I arrived in 2024 chasing those stories. Before my trip, I’d done the usual research, looked up the names that still carried weight in cigar circles. P.G.C. Hajenius — a name spoken with reverence, a temple to tobacco since 1826 , P.G.C. Hajenius, one of the oldest cigar shops in the world — was the first on my list. Its Art Deco interior, legendary humidor, and the ghosts of cigar lovers who’d passed through its doors made it a destination in itself.
But my planning led to discoveries I hadn’t expected. A few phone calls, a dive into the city’s laws, and the truth hit home: Amsterdam’s cigar lounges were no longer what they’d been. The 2008 smoking bans had started the slow dismantling, and the 2020 regulations had finished the job, leaving even the likes of Hajenius a shadow of its former self². By decree of Dutch law, every cigar lounge in Amsterdam was snuffed out as of January 1, 2022 — a quiet funeral for a once-thriving culture³.
I couldn’t bring myself to go. Not because I was afraid of disappointment, but because there’s a point where preserving the memory of something becomes more important than confirming its absence. I didn’t want to see that grandeur stripped down, repurposed into some polite, sterile shell. Maybe one day I’ll go — not to chase what was, but to see what remains. But this trip wasn’t the time for that.
Instead, I focused on the present. I had one day left in Amsterdam, and I wasn’t about to waste it wallowing in nostalgia for a past I’d never lived. That’s how I found myself at Cigaragua.
Cigaragua isn’t a place trying to recreate the golden age of cigar lounges. It doesn’t have the leather armchairs, the paneled wood, or the ghosts of old men swapping war stories⁴. Instead, it’s defiantly modern. Clean. Unapologetically Nicaraguan.
The shopfront is subtle, but its presence is bold, standing as a rare holdout in a city that’s lost its love for cigars. There’s no room to linger — not because they don’t want you to, but because the city doesn’t. Amsterdam has no place anymore for the kind of slow, social rituals that make cigars more than just tobacco. Cigaragua has turned their cigar room into an extra storage space because of this.
What Cigaragua does have is quality. Their selection is a celebration of Nicaragua’s best — a curated homage to a country that’s made itself synonymous with craftsmanship in the cigar world. The staff know their stuff, too. They don’t just sell cigars; they respect them.
I walked out with two: the Sobremesa Brûlée Blue, a cigar that would later redefine my idea of a dessert cigar, and the Perdomo Double Aged 12-Year Vintage Connecticut, with its flawless construction and pedigree of aged tobaccos.
I didn’t smoke them in Amsterdam. This city, for all its indulgences, no longer felt like a place for that kind of moment. But that’s another story: Two Cigars, Two Journeys: a Prelude to Nicaragua
Walking through Amsterdam’s streets, it’s impossible to ignore its contradictions. The air is thick with the scent of cannabis, rolling out of coffee shops without apology. The red-light district glows like a beacon, a carnival of curiosity and hedonism. This is a city that markets its indulgences with pride — except, apparently, for cigars.
The hypocrisy isn’t just glaring — it’s comical. You can sit in a coffee shop and light up a joint without a second thought, but a cigar in a lounge? That’s where the line is drawn. Amsterdam hasn’t turned its back on vice; it’s just decided which kinds of indulgence are acceptable. And cigars, with their air of refinement, their association with slow, thoughtful leisure, have been left out in the cold.
I’m not shocked by Amsterdam’s decadence. I’ve seen enough of the world to know that people will always find ways to indulge. I don’t judge it. But I do call out the hypocrisy — the selective morality that lets one kind of smoke flow freely while stamping out another.
For all the disappointment I felt, Cigaragua gave me hope. It’s not trying to reclaim the past or fight the tide of change. It’s simply standing firm, celebrating the craft and the culture that cigars represent.
Maybe Amsterdam will come around. Maybe, one day, the pendulum will swing back, and the city will remember what it’s lost. And maybe, when that day comes, I’ll walk through the doors of P.G.C. Hajenius — not chasing the past, but ready to face whatever remains. Until then, I’ll carry the memory of what Amsterdam could have been, and the promise of what it still might become.
Because even in a city that’s turned its back on cigars, there’s still room for moments that remind you why they matter. And sometimes, that’s enough.
— — Footnotes — — — — — — — — ¹ I’ve read a number of pieces about Amsterdam’s cigar legacy, such as this one: https://www.cigarinspector.com/cigar-library/amsterdams-cigar-lounges/
² Only after having checked into my hotel in Amsterdam, I started catching up on updates, including this curious insight: https://www.zigarren.zone/en/netherlands-bans-cigar-lounges/But the subject has been covered much earlier, a good example is this 2017 micro-document by David Fuller: Banning Tobacco in Cannabis Cafes?
³ On the subject of cigar lounges being banned: The new law that came into force on January 1, 2022 regarding cigar lounges is not directly aimed at the few cigar lounges, but rather at the large commercial buildings that have smoking areas. Unfortunately, cigar lounges are also affected by this change. They will therefore also had to close.
⁴ Had I traveled to Amsterdam few years earlier, I would have been able to experience Cigaragua when it hosted a cigar lounge. In fact I was looking forward to it, after having seen information such as this piece from 2019: https://www.cigaraficionado.com/article/where-to-smoke-cigaragua-amsterdam

My love for Amsterdam was ignited when I met some friendly Dutch fans at a soccer World Cup match.
This was the year 2010 when South Africa hosted the Soccer World Cup.
The energy and friendliness of the Dutch planted the seed that left me wanting to visit Amsterdam.
Just their warm energy had me drawn to them.
My visit to Amsterdam was everything I expected and much more.
Just like in the soccer match, the people I came into contact with, in Amsterdam were warm and friendly.
Being around people with this energy always leaves me on a natural high. My heart feels at peace.
Waking up each morning and exploring the city was always a fun adventure.
Public transport is extremely reliable and efficient. I did a lot of walking in Amsterdam. I also rented a bicycle.
I love cycling!
Cycling in the streets of Amsterdam was a uniquely different experience.

It is hard to believe that it has already been over a year since I first left the country. I have spent my whole life with a passion for travel but up until last year I was spending all of my time and funds on hopelessly driving or flying from one side of the country to the other.
Don’t get me wrong I love the views in the US but I always wanted to get some stamps in my passport and really experience different cultures and what else the world had to offer!
I spent as much time as I could traveling last year and after experiencing 8 different countries in those 12 months, I have finally come to the conclusion on my answer for the question I get all the time, “Where should I go first?”
With a smirk on my face I enthusiastically reply “Amsterdam!”
Most people are scared or nervous about what to expect when they leave the country for the first time and for good reason. There are so many things to consider like:
what kind of currency do they use?
Is it safe?
How will I get around?
What language do they speak?
These are all valid questions that I ask every time I begin planning my next adventure and something that everyone should look into before…

I was sitting in Naples airport waiting for my flight back to Amsterdam after my New Year’s holiday. People were coming and going with their usual murmur, and the loudspeakers were announcing things in Italian that my mind, despite understanding, ignored. I looked at all the faces, searching for a familiar one that made me feel at home. I must admit that at that point, I had already spent quite some months wondering about the meaning of “home”. What was home? Where is your house if you’ve left your country, and your family did as well?The people around me were dragging their suitcases, their inflatable pillows, their children. Suddenly, a voice crept into my thoughts; it was the loudspeaker saying in Dutch that the flight 4091 with destination Amsterdam was going to leave on time. Strange, I thought, that Dutch has my attention and Italian doesn’t.
Five years and nine months ago, I started writing a piece called “Three Months in Amsterdam.” It took me so long to finish it (like all ideas that spring up from the back of my mind and I marinate without cooking) that spring passed, and the piece had to be retitled “Six Months in Amsterdam.” Knowing myself, not so bad. It’s not six months anymore; it’s six years, plus a few more winters and springs.
In practical and numerical terms, my life in the Netherlands can be summed up as 1 pandemic, 4 houses, 11 roommates, 3 jobs, 7 months of unemployment, a few gyms, 5 stolen bicycles, a few hundred acquaintances, a handful of friends, 22 or 23 romantic platonic crushes, 3 bike crushes, 1 Dutch boyfriend (ex-boyfriend), and a ton of questions.
Living in the Netherlands is something I choose every day, especially on winter days, pedaling through the rain and against the wind is where love is tested. It’s easy to choose Amsterdam in spring, when the streets are filled with flowers planted by the city (oh my taxes look so pretty!) and the cherry trees are blooming in the forest. When the streets are filled with happy people, sipping white wine while sitting on the sidewalk, young people (!) playing jeu de boule at the park, and the barbecue my neighbor and I make on the sidewalk with meat he brought on one of his flights to Argentina and passed through customs with dubious techniques.It’s easy to choose Amsterdam in summer, with the sidewalks already decorated with the chalk drawings of the neighborhood children, when the heat is 25 degrees, and you get ice cream at work. When the team returns to play volleyball at the park, and I can pedal around the city with my floral dress blowing in the wind, on my way to jump into a canal or to put my bike on my sister's and brother-in-law’s boat for a ride after work. Amsterdam in summer is a playground among gardens of happiness.
When winter comes, the story is different; the city becomes quiet, calm. It’s a bit of a relief not to have to leave the house every day, to make a winter plan, to learn something new, to buy candles because they make the night more cozy, or like Dutch people say gezellig. No one writes to go to the park anymore, unless it’s those two autumn days when all the trees in Vondelpark are a different color. No, when winter comes and the sky is gray, it’s not so easy to choose the Netherlands; even my freckles disappear. When winter comes and no one sees the sun for 20 days, doubts also arise: Why do I choose to live in this place? Am I always going to live in the shade under an overcast gray sky?
The key to escaping the existential emptiness that the lack of sun brings is nothing more and nothing less than to leave. Yes, leave. If privilege allows, all migrants try to escape. I go to see my parents and my brother in Spain, to the mountains in France, to some island where “clouds” is not a topic of conversation. I escape on Wednesdays to my comedy club to make strangers laugh, or to be entertained by my comedian friends, I escape between the keys of a piano I can’t play or take refuge at the gym.
Perhaps the strangest thing about having migrated six years ago is that my family also left Argentina, and we live spread across three countries in Europe. Sometimes I like to say we’re reverse colonizing, a TEG in real time. I also like when people ask me about my parents, to say: “They’re in a better place” and then clarify that they live in Spain as well as one of my brothers. That they adapted to other latitudes and now say words like “majo” and “guapa”, that they occasionally have a whole leg of ham at home, that they like to have bread with tomato for breakfast, that they eat eggs with chips and meat at 10 am and they go out for tapas and to see their friends at the bar.
That they also maybe sometimes wonder where home is.
A few years ago, I had two Argentinian brothers, but now I have a half-Spanish brother and a half-French brother, who has blended into the culture spectacularly. This includes having a French accent when he speaks English, which confuses my friends in Amsterdam, a lot lot. On the other hand, my brother-in-law, who used to be Argentinian, is now Argentinian-Dutch, and beyond what the papers say, he loves to eat bitterballen with beer and if you ask me, that should be worthy of a Dutch nationality. Sometimes I ask my sister if she suspected that her life would be like having dinner at 6 p.m. and that every plan would include a bicycle, if she ever suspected how difficult it would be for her to make new friends in this place.
I wonder if I, too, should be given a Dutch passport after having carried things in my bike like a desk and chair on a single trip, a case of beer, a Dutchman, a small tree, a computer screen, and a coat rack. Perhaps it would be worth it of a Dutch passport my new ability to set boundaries, to be incredibly direct, to ask everyone to pay their share after inviting people for dinner at my house, to have events planned six months in advance and to own that raincoat that opens like a tent so your legs don’t get wet when you pedal.Would my love for Dutch urbanism and design, and my fondness for those classic Dutch songs by Andre Hazes that sound like a grandmother’s ballad, deserve a Dutch passport?
Sometimes loving a country that isn’t your own feels a lot like cheating on a loved one. Forgive me, Argentina, I didn’t know I was going to fall in love. I still think of you on rainy afternoons, on barbacueless Sundays, and when I notice my friends growing old so far away.
But don’t wait up for me.
If it’s any consolation, the truth is that I miss things: the culture, the sun, the alfajores, the Paraná River, my friends, some parts of my extended family. Then I open Twitter and see what the drama of the day in the country is. I go to eat empanadas at a little argentinian paradise called La Reinita, I listen to “Adios Nonino”, which is the song my friend Fede always listens to, and the tango makes me melancholic, which is the only emotion that goes well with it. I think about Messi more than I’d like to admit, and I carry a little Argentinian flag on the back of my phone so I don’t forget that other place I love and has given me so much.
But despite the wonders I can say about my life in Amsterdam after so many years the fantastic becomes familiar, and what keeps me here, I have to admit, are my friends. What I would do without the love of these people, I don’t know. They’re living their own migration experience, and from different places, we share something that is common to all.
I landed at Amsterdam Airport after a few hours of travel. Stepping off the plane, I felt an immediate and unexpected relief at the familiarity of the airport: how tall the people were, hearing people speaking Dutch, the friendly voice on the loudspeakers announcing the trains. Then I knew it: my house is here and my home as well.

Here for the travel advice and not to read my life story? Jump to Travel Recommendations for the tl;dr [too long; didn’t read] to plan your trip to Amsterdam now!
I felt giddy as my flight touched down. I was passing through the city somewhat incidentally. My end destination was Portugal but it was cheaper to fly through Amsterdam first. So I stretched my layover into a three-day trip. This gave me one day to recover from jet lag and a solid two days in Amsterdam to explore.
Amsterdam is one of those cities proceeded by its reputation. Personally, it has loomed large in my imagination for decades. A place where prostitution is not only legal but flaunted. Where weed, magic mushrooms, and who knows what else was accessible long before even medical clinics were open back home in California. A place where kids going to what at the time I considered “real” or four-year colleges would go to spend a semester abroad. It seemed like such an exciting and luxurious opportunity. One that I could only dream of as I worked my way through community college as a waitress to supplement my scholarships and financial aid.
I wanted to ride a bike around and meet new people from all over the world. Wear cozy sweaters and do drugs in coffee shops and bars. The fact that this was exactly how I was already spending most if not all of my time right at home in San Francisco and Oakland did not make it seem any less exotic.
By the time I finally had the chance to make that pilgrimage, I was in a very different state of mind. I spent my two days in Amsterdam on history and art tours. Taking in the old buildings and even older paintings. Trying new foods such as stroopwaffle (yay!) and pickled herring (nay).
Amsterdam is expensive! Hotels, hostels, and Airbnbs are all expensive. I ended up staying at CityHub Amsterdam, a capsule hotel. Overall, it was a good experience. I don’t really spend time in the hotel when I am traveling so this was a good option for me. It was clean and quiet. I loved the location. There was even a street market right outside where I stopped every morning for a fresh squeezed juice during my stay.

I don’t have much in the way of tips for this trip. It is easy to move through the city and everyone speaks English. The one thing I want to mention is, watch out for bikes! There is a lot of bicycle traffic and one sure-fire way to get cursed out from an otherwise friendly and easygoing local population is to cross the bike lane without looking.
Back to top
Start your day with a free walking tour! This is a great way to start your trip, especially if you are short on time. I recommend taking one the first day to help you get oriented. Free Walking Tours Amsterdam is the one I went with. I took the classic tour, but they have several other options to chose from depending on your interest. There are also many, many other options to choose from when selecting a free walking tour.
This style of tour is available all over Europe. I have even started seeing them in some places in Latin America as well. They typically last 2–3 hours. Your guide will give you some historical context for the city and show you the main sights within walking distance. The tours are indeed free, but the guides are only paid through tips. Have cash on hand to fork over at least €5-€10 once the tour is over.
Back to top
Consider grabbing lunch or dinner at this trendy food hall. It is modeled after a concept that has taken the world by storm. Foodhallen is one building with many different stalls inside that offer different types of cuisine. You can order from any one that catches your fancy and grab a spot amidst the communal seating.
Back to top
In the evening, I recommend heading over to NDSM. This cultural hotspot is a collection of contemporary art studios and rotating exhibitions in a giant converted warehouse. You may catch a music show or a performance. There are also a few places to eat while on that side of the river.
The easiest way to arrive is to take the F4 ferry from Amsterdam Central Station. It is free and runs every 15–30 minutes. Be sure to hop back on before the ferry service ends at midnight.
Back to top
There are so many different options to choose from, but Rijksmuseum is the crown jewel of museums in Amsterdam. This one is a must-see for any visitor. You can purchase your timed entry tickets the day of, but I recommend buying them a day or two before if you are on a strict schedule and need to be at the museum at a specific time. I also recommend coming here first and then exploring some of the other must-sees in the city such as the Van Gough Museum or the Anne Frank House Museum.
Back to top
All that wandering around and viewing of those giant Renaissance paintings of food in varying states of decay is bound to make you hungry. After visiting Rijksmuseum it is just a short jaunt to Albert Cupstraat Markt. This market stretches several blocks and includes giftable wares, flowers, and most importantly, traditional Dutch cuisine. Be sure to try the stroopwafels, pickled herring, bitterballen (meatballs), and patat friet (french fries).
The market is open 9:30 am-5:00 pm every day except Sundays.
Back to top
The Central Park of Amsterdam is worth strolling through on foot or by bike and is close to both Rijksmuseum and Albert Cuypstraat market. It’s a beautiful place to stop and take a rest on one of the many benches lining the park paths before continuing on with your busy day.
Back to top
No stay in Amsterdam would be complete without a stop at the famous Red Light District. Locals hate it, tourists love it. If you are visiting, I think you have to go at least to see it. There are even historical tours during the day for the faint of heart. It’s easy to find a burlesque show, sex show, or just head out on your own to experience the scene at night.
If you do go in the evening, be prepared to witness the true spectacle, the endless parade of bachelor or “stag” parties crowding the street. You will mostly see women in windows soliciting their wares as you walk the streets, which is to say, themselves. I enjoyed watching the full spectrum of how these women interacted with the passing crowd. Some were dancing, some were trying to entice potential customers with a flirty, joking manner. The most conventionally attractive were visibly bored, doom scrolling on their phones and awaiting their next client without having to put in much effort.
Back to top
I was traveling alone for this trip, so I didn’t have the wild adventure I might have otherwise. But as I get older and wiser, I can’t help but grow in my appreciate of the quieter side of cities and life itself. The joys of earlier mornings, sans hangover. Trying new foods, even if it is for the first and last time. And most importantly, whether it be through observing classical art or observing my fellow tourist on their worst behavior, always learning something new whenever I have the opportunity.

Time flies — it’s been almost a year since I moved from Prague, Czechia, to Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
I loved Prague, but Amsterdam quickly captured a special place in my heart. It feels like home here. And thanks to the rare combination of calmness and just enough excitement, I’ve decided to stay here a little longer and build a stable base.
This is my analysis of how it is to live in Amsterdam. Based on ten criteria, I evaluated the quality of life in Amsterdam. Please note that this article is based on a combination of facts and statistics, but mainly on personal experiences.
Since the introduction of the Safe Cities Index, a report from The Economist Intelligence Unit, Amsterdam was always in the top 10 safest cities globally. In the 2021 report, Amsterdam was in second place on personal security, just behind Copenhagen.
I can see why Amsterdam consistently ranks that high. It feels incredibly safe here. A walk in the middle of the night? No problem. A late-night bicycle ride through the park? Don’t worry. I go running daily (often late at night) and…

Clue’s in the name really, it’s an exciting insight into the mysteries of the infamous Red Light District. This museum gives you all the juicy and hush hush secrets of the industry. Here are some reasons why it should feature on your itinerary:
· For one, its location is a former 17th century brothel in the centre of the Red Light District (how much more authentic can you get?!)
· It provides personal stories and accounts of prostitutes who’ve worked in Amsterdam throughout the years; some are extremely emotional and hard hitting.
· You can sit in a Red Light Window (which is a fab photo op!) and visit the room of a girl who worked at the brothel for 7 years.
· It has the last prostitution office in Amsterdam (everything in there is still untouched!).
· It’s on the cheap side! If you go to a tours and tickets shop which are located around Amsterdam or book online in advance its further discounted.
Businesses in the Red Light District do not allow people to take photos. You most likely will have your phone confiscated. You’re putting yourselves at risk if you try! Staring isn’t banned but, understandably, the women don’t like it. Some are very smiley and open, others more reserved. I saw a girl use a curtain to cover her face when a group of tourists wouldn’t stop gawping. Although sometimes it’s difficult not to look, don’t be disrespectful or excessive!
If you’re a history lover, like myself, I imagine this biographical museum would tell the perfect story of arguably the most renowned holocaust victim. I say ‘imagine’… because we didn’t manage to get in! From 9am-3.30pm the museum was reserved for people who had booked online. From 3.30pm a GIGANTIC queue formed which was at least 3 hours long, at which point we abandoned the idea and went to grab a pint.
My advice is DO buy tickets online if you want to visit without the hassle. Plus, I’m aware tickets online sell out quickly so book asap!
Like ‘The Red Lights Secrets museum’, it is anything but boring! From giant penises to an automated farting flasher … it’s great for a giggle and fab if you like art that’s a little out of the box! It’s also cheap as chips (literally…there’s a chip shop across the road which is more expensive) It only costs $5!
It’s a cool photo opportunity and if you’re athletic enough you can climb on the giant letters (note I chose not to!)
This is probably one of my greatest regrets of the trip. EVERYONE and I mean everyone travelled by bike. We decided to walk pretty much everywhere and it resulted in extremely blistered feet. Although walking is beneficial sometimes (at night or if you’re exploring) I’d say biking is the more fun and efficient option. There are places to hire bikes dotted around Amsterdam, they aren’t hard to come by. Although do be careful if you do go on a bike because people cycle like they are competing at a velodrome, which leads perfectly to my next point.
I had a few close shaves whilst obliviously standing in a lane attempting to navigate myself. They can be quite discrete, so just be on the lookout.
Lots of people hire out bikes purely to cycle round this serene environment (and it is quite big so if you want to see all of it, biking is probably the way to go). On a sunny day, it’s full of people listening to music, having picnics and lazing about on the grass. It’s incredibly beautiful and a relaxing pit stop from the business of the city centre.
This 22-floor tower is a bar/restaurant and gives an amazing 360˚ bird’s-eye view of Amsterdam. Drinks are a little on the pricey side but remember, you’re paying for the experience as well- it’s a second to none vantage point and the cocktails are huge! Also, if you are a bit of a daredevil, A’DAM lookout- ‘Over the Edge’ is Europe’s highest swing. You get to swing 100 metres above the ground right at the top of the building (fair to say I was not tempted).
Generally, alcohol is expensive, so pre-drinks are essential and supermarket prices aren’t bad for a bottle of wine or a few cans! This capital is obviously known for its cannabis culture and wide range of coffeeshops (which are just as common as bars). Prices are much cheaper so it’s a sound alternative- when in Rome, do as the Romans do (Or in this case, when in Amsterdam, do as the Dutch do!) …
Like most cities the further into the city centre you go the more expensive things become. This is the case for both food and drink. Some of the best bars and eating places were scattered on the outskirts! Check out the map at the bottom of this post for a few ideas!
The great thing about Amsterdam is the diversity and element of surprise around each corner. Whether it’s exploring the Red Light District, coffeeshops, museums or just strolling by the gorgeous canals, it’s impossible to be bored so allow yourself to wander and take it all in!

The Netherlands has proven to be home to a very diverse group of people in my short time here. While researching I found that the US is technically more diverse but given how much larger of a country it is than the Netherlands, different nationalities, cultures, and races tend to be more spread out and isolated as a result. I have been to many large cities in the US (New York, Washington DC, Miami, Detroit, etc.) and while they are all diverse to an extent, it always seems there is one dominant culture or nationality in each city. This is why to me Amsterdam is a true cultural blend with people having heritages from all over the world and potentially living in the same city block. This made me question why the US is like this and how Amsterdam seems so much more diverse than the US even though it statistically is not.
The simple answer is because of the Dutch themselves and their acceptance of immigrants and refugees. The Dutch have, for centuries, been a safe haven of sorts to people from European, Middle Eastern, or Asian countries and this has led to a high number of immigrants fleeing their home country for Amsterdam. The Dutch advocate heavily for inclusion instead of immigration which has allowed these immigrants to feel safe and comfortable in Amsterdam which in turn leads to them staying and starting families. This is enhanced by the fact that they have a labor migration program that helps skilled workers migrate to the country in order to work. This has the effect of also solving holes in the employment market by filling jobs that are most necessary with immigrants who possess those skills. The most recent “Multi-year Policy Plan for Social Issues” spanned the years 2015–2018 and focused on anti-discrimination, LGBTQ+ rights, and empowering women. These are all issues the US is just now starting to even address let alone solve.
These factors all relate to the 20th and 21st century and the Netherlands has been around for much longer than that, so things have been trending this way for a long time. The Dutch built an empire through trading in the “Golden Era” which was the 16th and 17th centuries, and this was what, unknown to them, got the ball rolling on making Amsterdam so diverse. The addition of colonies started the trend of immigrants leaving for Amsterdam whether it was under their own free will or not did not affect the outcome. The outcome was that many people from South America, The Caribbean, Indonesia, and India ended up residing in Amsterdam throughout the 17th and 18th centuries.
The Netherlands relied heavily on trade which brought foreigners from other countries to the ports of Amsterdam and Rotterdam. These foreigners were trading with the Dutch, not immigrants from one of their many colonies in this time period. Many of these foreigners became immigrants over time whether for profit, the culture, or whatever reason. In turn, this resulted in an even larger influx of immigrants than that of individuals coming from a colony. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, this would continue and be more focused on specialization. The Dutch needed people with different skills, and they didn’t care where they came from, how they talked, or what they looked like. The opportunities of the city of Amsterdam were too enticing to some and this is a major factor in my observation of dense clusters of diversity in the city.
The opportunities didn’t stop at just the jobs though, the Netherlands is home to many prestigious schools and universities which also has a role. People do not just immigrate to Amsterdam for jobs, many do it for education. However, when the job and educational opportunities are combined, along with the respect Dutch citizens have for immigrants, people are more likely to completely emigrate to the Netherlands. A lot of foreigners in the US are not immigrants and live in the US on school or work Visas. The negative view Americans have on immigrants results in many of them going back to their home country after their Visa expires. The Netherlands provides them with a home away from home in a sense and ultimately more immigrants chose to stay. Policy: Diversity — City of Amsterdam

How a visit to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam made me see art — and life — a little differently.
“There are so many people … who imagine that words are nothing. On the contrary, don’t you think, it’s as interesting and as difficult to say a thing well as to paint a thing. There’s the art of lines and colours, but there’s the art of words that will last just the same.” — Vincent van Gogh
The Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam wasn’t just another stop on my trip — it was an experience that has sat with me long after I left. Walking through the galleries felt like stepping into someone’s mind — chaotic, confusing, beautiful and deeply human. A stark contrast to the sensory overload of the Red Light District. It was a reminder that cities hold entire worlds within them, and this was one I wanted to stay in for a while.
I took my time. My friends, not exactly museum people, humored me the best they could. But I was walking through on my own timeline, looking at every painting, reading every plaque, walking through the life of a man who saw art and color in ways other’s couldn’t. I’ve always been drawn to words, to how they hold meaning beyond what we can easily explain. And Van Gogh, for all his beautiful paintings, was also a writer. His letters to his brother Theo were displayed throughout the museum and were filled with thoughts on life, art, struggle that somehow still resonate over a century later.
I think a lot about whether I’m on the right path, if the choices I’m making now will lead somewhere meaningful. Van Gogh didn’t have certainty either, but he worked anyway. That’s the thing: we don’t get guarantees. We just have to keep moving, creating, learning and hoping that the fire we listen to inside us means something.
There’s something about being in a new place, a new country, that sharpens my senses. Colors seem brighter, sounds louder, details more prominent. Travel makes you look closer at the world, but I don’t want to need a plane ticket to notice things. I want to carry that kind of attention with me every day, the way Van Gogh found beauty in the most ordinary things — a field, a flower, a patch of sky.
Travel forces you to be okay with not knowing what you’re doing. I’ve seriously messed up languages, taken the wrong trains and gotten lost in cities with a dead phone where I don’t even know the alphabet. But I figured it out. That’s how we learn — by doing, failing and trying again. Van Gogh painted relentlessly, even when he doubted himself. I think that’s how I want to live: always trying, always pushing toward something better.
My friends waited for me while I lingered in the museum, laughing at my obsession but letting me have my moment. Travel is filled with these fleeting experiences, but the people you share them with are what make them real. I’m slowly learning that home isn’t a town or even a continent — it’s the people who let you be exactly who you are, whether that’s standing in front of a painting for way too long or getting lost in a city together.
I often find myself feeling unsettled, like I’m searching for something I don’t quite know yet. But then I remind myself that not everything makes sense right away. Van Gogh knew what it felt like to struggle, to wonder if things would ever get better. But he kept going. And I think that’s all any of us can do: keep going, keep searching, keep trying to make sense of it all.
I left the museum with postcards, a book of his quotes (which inspired this blog) and a feeling I couldn’t quite name. Maybe it was a quiet understanding. Maybe it was comfort. Maybe it was just the realization that, across centuries, across continents, some people just get it.
As I stepped back into the streets of Amsterdam, the world seemed slightly different — like I was seeing it through his eyes, noticing the colors a little more, the details I might have otherwise missed. Maybe that’s the real gift of art, not just what it shows us, but how it changes the way we see everything else.
“For my part I know nothing with any certainty, but the sight of the stars makes me dream.” — Van Gogh
And maybe, for now, that’s enough.

Day 44 — Amsterdam
I am sitting here on my tiny balcony. The air still feels crisp and humid because of last night’s rain. There is no doubt, I am back in Holland.
Back in Holland after 3 years of travelling around as a digital nomad.
But for the very first time, I don’t feel an immediate urge to pack my bags and hop back on another plane. Something needs to change first.
When I started my solo trips around Europe a few years ago, I was terrified that I would constantly feel alone. The mere thought of dining alone in restaurants, going to parties where I knew no one, or feeling lost in an unknown city, freaked me out.
And the alternative—approaching people and socialising—was even scarier.
But life is different now. I doubt if I will ever lose my moments of social awkwardness, but I made a habit of throwing myself into new situations. I learned how to surf, tried to learn how to dance and turned strangers into close friends.
Living a cliche digital nomad lifestyle. Yet, I am somewhat done with it. It feels like I finally graduated.
Don’t get me wrong. I live a privileged life. I love the adventure, the novelty, the thrill and there is nothing quite like connecting with new people. I love new stories, waiting to be unpacked.
However, the biggest downside of a nomadic life is — no surprise— the fact that everyone leaves again. I know now that it is possible to build deep connections within weeks, sometimes even hours. To cry, laugh and share life stories together.
But maintaining them is a different story. It’s almost impossible to stay close while being separated by different time zones. Especially for a terrible Whatsapp’er like myself.
I struggle with the need to always build new deep connections from scratch. I struggle with friends — or myself leaving after a few months. I don’t want that no more. Again, something needs to change.
For years, my biggest desire has been freedom, the freedom to travel and explore the world. But slowly I am witnessing my desires change. Does my longing for freedom still outweigh the struggle of often missing close friends and family?
How do I balance freedom with maintaining deep, long-lasting connections? I can’t simply take my loved ones with me.
Or can I?
Well, I am going to give it a try.
In the upcoming period, I will record conversations with those around me, wherever I am. Much like interviewing famous podcast guests.
Allowing us to dive deeper than casual small talk, and hopefully resulting in an album of conversations — souvenirs for when our paths diverge again.
The goal is not to share them publically and rack up millions of downloads. Quite the opposite. I can be a DJ without a crowd. I am recording these conversations to get to know the people in my life better, explore their stories, and to laugh and create lasting memories.
I don’t know if we will like it. But trying is the only way to find out. Trying to lean into whatever excites me, intrigues me, into what I consider meaningful.
And this idea definitely feels meaningful to me.
I am sitting here on my balcony staring at the sky. The sun slowly breaks through. I am feeling the energy of trying something new.
Let’s go.
— -During the upcoming period, I will record some podcasts and I am looking for cities to settle instead of always travelling around.
“Know when it is time to move on, know when you graduated.”

When I moved to Amsterdam, 24 years ago, there were innumerable comments along the lines of: “Oh yeah… Amsterdam, eh?! EH?!! Nudge-nudge, wink-wink, EH?!!”.
To the uninformed I was relocating to a cesspit of iniquity, a European Gomorrah of rampant drug taking and prostitutes for sale in the windows of every street. Everything, people supposed, a single man in his early thirties could desire. Except it wasn’t. Because Amsterdam wasn’t — and isn’t — like that at all.
Yes, the notorious red light zone de Wallen (“the walls”) exists, with its women — most probably sex-trafficked — sat in illuminated windows looking bored while awkward men leer at them from the outside. And, as you walk through quaint backstreets, the barely disguised whiff of weed tickles the nostrils as it pours out of semi-legal coffee shops. However, this is just a tiny slice of Amsterdam, one of the jewels of Europe, with its Instagramable canals, medieval architecture, vibrant culture and a history and charm matched only by the likes of Paris, Seville or Prague.
I am naturally biased, having once lived in or near Amsterdam for the better part of a decade, as well as being a frequent visitor for almost 30 years. To some extent, too, the seedier side isn’t as bad as it could be (ditto, Hamburg and its somewhat cartoon-like Reeperbahn), but I get where the city authorities, and indeed the Dutch government, are coming from in wanting to clean it up.
Conscious of this reputation, tourists are even being discouraged from visiting the de facto Dutch capital, though this was initially a measure to cut down on overcrowding. An environmental measure was also introduced to cap flights arriving at Schiphol, Amsterdam’s massive, seven-runway international air hub, which this year alone has reduced the number of flights from the UK by 22% compared with pre-Covid travel. The Netherlands Tourism Board has even been actively promoting places alternatives like Eindhoven — a city I know well from my career at Philips, which was founded there.
But with the exception of football nerds wishing to see the PSV Stadion, or the even more niche interest of the Philips lightbulb museum, Eindhoven is largely a ‘company town’ with little to offer tourists compared to the cultural riches of Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum, the Anne Frank House, the canals or the Negen Straatjes (‘nine streets’), not to mention its wealth of cross-culture cuisines.
Amsterdam has always been one of the most welcoming cities in Europe, in one of the world’s happiest nations, according to research by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. But those same people are understandably tired of the stag-weekenders who spend their time in the city getting drunk, fighting outside bars and urinating in canals (before then falling in), or swaggering about the red light zone leering at its most unfortunate residents.
This has now been reflected by an online campaign specifically targeting 18–35-year-old British men, with one ad showing a young man being arrested and put in a cell with the atypically Dutch-blunt caption: “So coming to Amsterdam for a messy night? Stay away.”
In recent years the city has made efforts to combat the vice industry (believed to be controlled by a combination of rival Turkish and Albanian organised crime), both to cut down on the sex tourism as well as the exploitation of vulnerable women. The drugs trade, run by the same gangs, has long been associated with this, with politicians arguing that the liberal experiment, dating back to the 1970s, which legitimised cannabis use as long as it is sold in limited quantities in coffee shops, has failed. Weed sales have been regarded as a gateway to sales of harder narcotics, all with associated criminality invariably leading to violence.
When I moved to Amsterdam in 1999 moves were already in place to tackle drug tourism, prompting a national ban on the sale of magic mushrooms and an increased regulation of cannabis sales, and aimed at striking a balance between tourism and public safety. Simultaneously, concerns about sex tourism and human trafficking prompted initiatives to regulate prostitution and improve the working conditions of sex workers. There were also measures to reduce the visibility of the red light district, with an effort to redevelop Amsterdam’s central neighbourhoods by encouraging new businesses to move into streets previously dominated by the sex and drug industry.
Sustainable tourism has also been promoted, with a campaign calling for tourists to “Enjoy & Respect” Amsterdam, and embrace its rich cultural artistic heritage rather than its seedier attractions. However, in also addressing both ‘over-tourism’ and sex/drug visitors, businesses relying on tourist euros have expressed their concerns at any effort to drive down undesirabled, especially in the wake of Amsterdam’s post-pandemic recovery.
It is, then, a dilemma. Amsterdam — like everywhere else — suffered greatly from Covid travel bans and lockdowns, as the city’s hotels, bars, restaurants and shops saw business plummet. The campaign against young male Brits is targeted, but it is hard yet to gauge whether it will be either effective in achieving its aims, or detrimental to the local economy.
As a champion of Amsterdam, however, anything which can successfully eradicate city’s “nudge-nudge, wink-wink” association, and works to enhance and embrace its unique identity is a good thing.
The city is more than simply a living museum, but its heritage — dating back to the 13th century when a small fishing village was established along the Amstel River — is more than worthy of protection. This is the city that was at the heart of the Dutch Golden Age in the 18th century, becoming a trading hub, with the construction of its famous ring of canals earning it the “Venice of the North” nickname. Its commercial and artistic foundations are still to be celebrated, either in the traditions established by the Dutch East India Company, one of the world’s earliest multinationals (and the genetic origin of the Netherlands’ global business outlook), the foundation of one of the world’s first stock exchanges — the “Beurs” (although Belgium’s Bruges lays claim to the oldest, its bourse), not to mention the work of Rembrandt and Vermeer during that same era.
There are those who see the see the discouragement of tourists looking to have the wrong kind of good time as being to Amsterdam’s financial detriment, not to mention to the detriment of its charm. But, just as New York — established as New Amsterdam — cleaned itself up in the early 1990s to its immeasurable benefit as a tourist destination, Amsterdam’s crackdown on Brits seeking to exploit its underbelly will go a long way to lessen the profile of that reputation. It will surely only enhance what those like me who know it, know it to be the real Amsterdam.

Imagine, walking on a cold rainy day, lost, dragging a broken suitcase through slippery and bumpy old streets whilst trying not to get killed by cyclists coming from all directions.
This is me arriving in Amsterdam 5 years ago. Definitely not the best welcome-card from the old charming Dutch capital.
At the beginning everything was new and although I arrived with some previous international experiences, all of it felt like a big swirl of excitement, freedom and insecurity.
The job was actually the main reason that brought me here. Joining VBAT, a branding and packaging design company which I admired since the beginning of my career and becoming more specialised in packaging design seemed like the perfect step in my career.
I was ready to start my new adventure, but I needed one last thing, a Dutch bike.
Having a bike means the freedom to go everywhere in this town and country and like a very old Johnny Cash song says, “I’ve been everywhere man”.
And that’s what I did:
I’ve been…
…in East, West, North, South, De Jordaan, De Pijp, De Baarsjes, De 9 Straatjes. Westerpark, Vondelpark, Rembrantpark, Sarphatipark, Street-markets, Neighbourmarkets, Sunday market, flea market. Museumplein , Dam square, Red light, Green Light. On the boat, on the train, on the tram, on the bike.
Being on a bike in Amsterdam gives a totally different living experience. Here I just need to cycle around and absorb everything that this city has to offer from street-art to architecture, graphic design to music and nature.
However, (to enjoy it fully,) I really needed to step-up in my bike skills. My biggest achievement so far was to carry somebody on the back, together with a crate of beer. Nothing to be proud of compared to what Dutch people can do on a bike though.
I’ve tasted…
…Bitterballen, Haring, Stroopwafels, Frikandel, Oliebollen, Kibbeling, Poffertjes, Stamppot, Pannenkoeken, Kroketten. Edam kaas , Boeren kaas, Gouda kaas, Maasdamer kaas. Heineken, Amstel, Grolsch, Hertog Jan, Brand Bier, Jopen Bier, Dudels Bier, Oedipus Bier.
There is loads of beer brands in this country from big brands to craft brands.
I’m not a real beer connoisseur and I still love the good old Portuguese Sagres, but I did became quite addicted to looking at beer labels and bottles. A strange behaviour for most people, but for me as a designer at VBAT an easy and fun way to do research and get inspired.
I’ve seen…
…Sun, hale, fog , snow, ice, drizzling rain, heavy rain, freezing rain, lots of rain.
Talking about the weather sounds pretty much like a cliché anywhere else. Here it is not only a fundamental topic of local conversation, but there is actually a lot to talk about. The weather is much more unstable compared to sunny Portugal. This brings more contrast between the days and seasons, transforming these supposed to be boring flat lands into a magical place of contrast and colours.
I’ve met…
…Italians, French, English, Russians, Brazilians, Spanish, Polish and of course Dutchies.
There is a lot to say about Dutch people but one thing I still find quite remarkable after these 5 years: opportunity.
Since the beginning I felt that The Netherlands and especially Amsterdam is a place full of opportunities, attracting people form all parts of the world. I especially enjoy the fact that living in such a diverse community enables you to meet all sorts of people and creative minds.
I’ve made…
…Sketches, drawings, songs, coffee, designs and redesigns.
At VBAT, the redesign of Canei Frizzante Originale is one of the projects that I feel most proud of. Not only because of it’s design, but also because I received the 2018 Best Packaging Design award in beverages in The Netherlands for this project!
I also had the opportunity to design and develop a very special project, the Strum Coffee Brewery. A small brewery built to produce cold brew coffee, one of my favourite Summer coffee refreshments.
Looking back it has been a great roller-coaster of experiences. A journey with curves that make you sick, bumps that make you fly and loops that give you the most unexpected sensations.
Not so long ago it was just another cold rainy day. I was in an Old Amsterdam Cafe together with my Dutch girlfriend. We were having a beer and sharing a small portion of bitterballen when I say out loud “gezellig”. This doesn’t necessarily mean I’m doing great in my Dutch lessons, however I suddenly understood the full meaning of this word in harmony with what was around me.
I understood that I became part of this world. I became part of Amsterdam.
I realised that perhaps I haven’t been everywhere, but for now I also don’t need to go anywhere.

My vision when I agreed to volunteer with U.Gent was not to spend a ton of time in cities, but I had a weekend to myself and thought that traveling might be a better use of my time than remaining in the home city. So I decided to go to Amsterdam. Its appeal to me was greater than that of Paris, the next-nearest major city. Following my positive experience day-tripping to Bruges, the idea was to have a chilled out weekend in a well-touristed place, where most sights would be accessible and friendly to English-speakers. Legal weed was a cherry on top. The weekend wound up being far from relaxing, but I gained some largely superficial impressions of the city, and learned more lessons on spur-of-the-moment traveling.
The journey began in Antwerp, the city that’s hated by Belgians the same way that Boston is hated by other New Englanders. According to residents it is “THE city”, and the rest of Belgium just serves as parking. I’d made a note to not visit…. but all trains to the Netherlands route you through Antwerp so I had no choice in that matter. The Antwerp train station precipitates the start of what feels like a real European adventure to the Other Low Country. It’s three levels of rails stacked one on top of the next. The surface level is vaulted in an expansive glass arc of windows and decorated with enough marble and carved stone to impress all of the inferior non-residents arriving to its port. The atrium between the two sides of tracks plunges all three stories underground where it’s cold like a cave. This is the level reserved for the long distance trains. I squint up at the glasswork far above. Here it is dark save for pulses of neon blue light on the pillars. I understand that Gentians see this place as stuck up, but the train station makes me believe it actually is modern and cool. I feel like Gretel wandering into the deep woods in this vast place in a little starry summer dress and a bag on my side.
I’m told by a man on the train that Amsterdam “is not the Netherlands”. It’s like Antwerp in the sense that everyone who actually lives in the country hates it. I am not deterred but a little more curious as to what I’ll find there. International travel is uneventful within the Schengen region of the E.U. and there was no indication of when we crossed the border of Belgium into the Netherlands.
The buildings are like a solemn box of chocolates (or tombstones), all blacks and dark browns with white window frames. This contrasts the sandier and whiter Low Citites of Gent and Brugge. It’s like the city is perpetually bracing for a terrible storm, or a long-dark winter. The barges and houseboats are stoically shaped, not flashy or fun. It’s beautiful, but looks at home in cloudy weather and rain. This aesthetic contrasts with the most famous decorative themes of the region: tulips and painted porcelain tiles (interestingly, both imported from Persia in the days of the Ottoman Empire). I like to think the cultural obsessions with these things were precipitated in part by the otherwise complete colorlessness of the city landscape. Certainly both tulips and tiled surfaces are natural fits with the damp, mild temperatures of the region. I like that the city uses the abundant water and flatness for transportation by boat and bicycle. It feels integrated with its surroundings.
I’d like to say that these were my first impressions of the city, but they were not. My first impression was of the second-largest crush of tourists I’ve ever seen after Times Square. The downtown streets are fraught with people wandering aimlessly, stopping dead in their tracks and struggling with ungainly loads of luggage and bags. There’s a huge difference between this behavior in diffuse, manageable situations and at this scale. I find it really stressful, especially as I attempt to find a bike, an affordable place to sleep last-minute, and finally some orientation to the city. There is a telling lack of thru-traffic that suggests the locals aggressively avoid the historic downtown. I turn my first corner in the narrow alleys between the dark brick buildings and come face to face with three head shops, side by side. There are some young-looking burnouts on cushions gazing at the street from an open-air cafe, sitting beneath a canopy of Far-East-looking scarves. Clouds of pot smoke roll onto the street. I question the authenticity of everything I see. There’s no speaking among tourists: a man and woman loudly drawl to one another in North Carolinan accents, then politely nod and bow to me in an attempt to silently indicate they want to get by. I sense that everyone here speaks English but we are unwilling to assume it of each other.
Amsterdam appears to be the European equivalent of Las Vegas as a destination for epic bachelor/ette parties. Small herds of men or women (exclusively single gender groups) trawl by, dressed in matching t-shirts or costumes. Usually one of their numbers is dressed even more ridiculously than their companions: fur coats, fake breasts, and several animal onesies among the sightings. There was a lot of broken glass on the ground, and some of those twelve-person bicycle tour carts that have a keg in the middle.
The boats on the canals appeared to carry a possibly more local crowd. Although there were barges of well-behaved tourists, some aboard for city history and others for wine and cheese, there were other smaller private barges cruising the downtown. These hummed with loud music, full of assorted young men and women looking for all the world like an Abercrombie and Fitch ad. Their leisure time was on display for all as they crawled by just below street-level.
The Red Light district really is everything that its depictions in crappy movies have promised. There were even actual red lights! The first time I saw a prostitute in a window I thought she was a poorly-dressed mannequin until she moved. In Amsterdam there seems to be a culture that is defensive of the sex workers’ rights, privacy and respectful of their profession. I wondered whether I was supposed to give them a nod of solidarity… although none were bothering to make eye contact with female passersby. Turns out white lingerie really pops under UV light. I walked by some fascinating shops — leather and rubber clothing boutiques; lingerie and toys suitable for every kind of body; sex shows; and an overabundance of racy souvenir shops that touted glassware, cannabis ice cream (no psychoactive effects, it just happens to contain cannabis) and some truly alarming postcards. I can only imagine what would happen if you turned a group of 18–19 year-old Americans loose over here. Everything, every vice is available and visible in shop windows. It strikes me that rule-breaking and drug theory by word-of-mouth is a large part of the novelty of American illicit-substance culture. How many wannabe Dharma Bums and Gonzo Journalists would become disillusioned if they could just pop into a shop and purchase mind-altering substances from a professional?
A couple years ago the Netherlands proposed a ban on visitors purchasing recreational drugs. Store owners and residents protested, claiming that the subsequent influx of illegal dealers would cause far worse problems for their urban areas. So now, any person over 18 can purchase whatever they want at dispensaries and koffieshops, the latter’s marijuana distributing license indicated with a subtle green and white sticker in the front window. There were formal and handwritten signs scattered throughout the red light district discouraging the purchase of drugs from street dealers. The signs the same vocabulary you might expect on a sign discouraging people from feeding the squirrels: “They are violent and aggressive”. There were similar signs prohibiting the use of hard drugs.
Drug dispensaries were situated abreast of all other shops in the historic downtown (and, I assume, are scattered throughout the city in lower densities). They seem to keep marijuana separate from places that sell other recreational drugs. I found the reading material on the counters of these dispensaries to be fascinating for its professional and informative tone: each variety of MDMA or psychedellic mushrooms was listed with the exact potency, chemical content and characteristics as well as all potential risks. Some stores had small lounges in the back stocked with incense and picture books.
The koffieshops I investigated ran the gamut from seedy underground dives to quiet and pleasant airy street-level establishments — they all do sell coffee, anyhow — but no alcohol. The strains of weed available were presented like a wine list, with variety names displayed next to a series of smiley faces indicating their characteristics. A joint costs about $3.75 USD.
Late at night I saw a crowd gathering around the front window of a pub: just inside were about seven raucous French or Italian men, all wearing surreal Mr. Bean masks and posing for photos by the streetwalkers below. I walked into a club filled with blacklight and guys and girls with glow-painted faces. Heavy fog was provided by the abundance of assorted smoke. It could have been a music video. At midnight I followed a crowd of “Woo girls” away from the center of town towards where I’d left my bike (it’s impossible to cycle in the tourist district). All wore matching pink tutus and pink and black striped socks. There were several open bottles of wine and liquor between them and they would periodically rally to shriek “WOOOOOO” while doodling over the sidewalks like bees through a field. Street performers, cafe-diners and other pedestrians would WOOOO back, or playfully swerve towards them.
The best part of my just-over-24 hours in Amsterdam was my late night bike ride out to my hostel. The tourist clots disappeared once free from the Red Light district, although chatter from isolated cafes and clubs wafted from the buildings. I rode along the Amstel on a bricked bike path. It was, like every other bicycling experience here, supremely flat and smooth. I cruised along silently, the clamor and stimulation of the perpetual tourist party fuzzing to white noise as I contemplated the stern facades of buildings now bathed in flat orange lamplight. The river was smooth and black and the barges were moored until morning. The night air was cool so long as I maintained some speed, and I saw more pedestrians than cars in the shadowy black and orange side streets. I began to imagine the mode of transportation suitable for this dream-world Amsterdam and found I was at a loss — nothing short of boats piloted through the air, animated serpentine dragons and other space-bending means seemed appropriate. It was a still, and magical time and I felt like any number of impossible things could happen in such an environment.
Morning breaks over Amsterdam and I’m unsure of what I’ll do. The rain is on “soak” setting outside and it strikes me as appropriate weather for this land of heavy black bicycles, heavy black rivers, heavy black boats and heavy, precariously forward-drooping black buildings. The desperation of yesterday’s fight to secure housing and maintain personal space is behind me: after the otherworldly spectacle of Midnight Amsterdam I slept heavily in an unexpectedly dark, quiet and clean location. Unfortunately my quest for good breakfast leads me inevitably to a tourist cafe. The Low Countries do not go out for breakfast. The streets are deserted until about noon, and I use the solitude to poke around residential neighborhoods. Their canals are swollen with fresh rain. Wisteria was made for a black brick facade in such an environment. I drift like a balloon on the breeze into the city’s little Tulip Museum. It feels homemade despite its slick graphics, and is very apparently curated by people who geek out about rare tulips in the same way that others might revere rare birds or cars. The section on wild tulips makes a compelling case for visiting Kazakhstan… a very compelling case. On the street I pass a squinty-eyed guy in a marijuana-leaf print windbreaker and sweatpants, leaning against the rail of a canal bridge and providing apparently unhelpful information to his girlfriend, who is staring blankly at the screen of a phone.
There’s a postcard of some of the city’s graffiti: the iconic portrait of Anne Frank in black and white, bedecked with a colored hipster scarf. My interpretation of the artist’s message is that if she were around today, she’d be invited to be a part of their crew. I wonder when some of the buildings will finally slump over into the street, when the city stopped being a major port, so many questions unanswered as a result of my own lack of research. I head to the city library, a great five or six-storied structure on the waterfront with the best view of the historic city (all skyscrapers are relegated to the outskirts). The library is an awesome building, with creative, modern architecture, fun reading nooks with curtains and space-age chairs, art installations and interpretive material. Some books are in Dutch, others in English. There is an installation about a proposed plan to renovate the downtown historic district. Amsterdam fears “The Venice Syndrome”: having a downtown economy so reliant on tourists that there is no longer means for residents to survive. They reference New York (never forgoing an opportunity to mention that originally it was New Amsterdam) as a city that is modern, vital and still remains a tourist destination. I admire the city’s fight to reclaim its downtown. On my way out I’m interviewed by several schoolgirls who claim to be doing a project for their English class. They tell me some riddles whose punchlines are somewhat lost in translation. I pass a flock of tourists, mesmerized by a tiny 3D printer at work in a shop window. I consider the myriad other technologies and symbols of progress that have been on display in these shops since the construction of the city. Perhaps there is a future for this place not entirely rooted in its past.
Lessons learned:
-You can’t wait til day-of to book a Couchsurfer destination or a hostel on a weekend.
-When things start going wrong in an unfamiliar environment, eat something. Or have a coffee. Or both.
-Don’t second guess expenditures once they’ve been made.
-Research the cost of getting to and from your destination and adjust your expectations of further costs from that number.
-Being alone and female invites lots of attention from strangers. In other places this has been fine, but in Amsterdam I felt like I could get lost down a crack in the crowded tourist party. Related: If you think you might want to do anything edgy, bring someone else.
-Either research the good spots in advance or go on the advice of others… but do one. Especially for areas with cultural significance (as compared to just wilderness significance, which I’d argue is more amenable to uninformed interpretation).
Under what conditions would I return to Amsterdam?
-At night, especially at night in the snow for the aesthetic experience
-If I could avoid the crowded Red Light District unless friends and I had explicit plans to be there
-If I’d read some more history, particularly literature, about the somber maritime town
-If I had a map of the anonymous sculpturework squirreled away around the city, and other hidden treasures.
Honestly, you might be better off with Gent. Older, less somber, same amount of bikes and almost as many canals, but no herds of tourists and instead, a vital city. No pot either, but eyyy. Perhaps I too am learning to appreciate the shadow of the local steeple.

If you are at all familiar with Amsterdam you’ll know that one of the main sources of transportation is the bicycle. Whether you’ve been there yourself, or seen it in movies and TV shows, bicycles are one of the main characters of the city.
If you are a pedestrian, as you wander the streets it’s quite a feat to stay out of the way of those who are on two wheels. It is not always easy.
Thankfully they have bells on their bikes and they are not afraid to use them!
As a photographer, the bikes make it easy to find little scenes within the areas you wander. They make a great subject and help tell the story of Amsterdam in your photos.

Yes — is the answer of the general public in the Netherlands, including politicians like Pieter Omzigt (source).
The housing crisis in Holland is real. Like any hot political issue, its multiple dimensions are difficult for people to understand, and politicians promise to solve it with a quick measure that sells. What currently sells is curbing migration. A smug Highly Skilled Migrant is a perfect face of the housing crisis for a populist leader.
The facts are: an average Dutch person can’t afford buying a house. An average expat can. Prices of properties in big cities are skyrocketing. Expats are able to participate in the bidding process by putting a lot of cash upfront.
But is that what is really destroying the housing market in the Netherlands?
As someone who has gone through the pain of, has been enjoying the privilege of, and feels the hate for buying an apartment in Amsterdam, I’m here to talk you through the mechanism of this scapegoating.
First and foremost, it’s obviously not just expats. But they became the face of the crisis, because
Only the upper middle class can afford to buy a property in big cities. In big cities in the Netherlands, that upper middle class happens to be significantly represented by expats.
What is upper middle class? An average annual salary in the Netherlands is €44k, and €70k is considered a high income. I couldn’t find statistics on an average expat salary, but from my experience as a recruiter, I’d say it sits in the ballpark of €70 to €120k. Most people wouldn’t relocate to this expensive country for a salary lower than €70k, and it’s also the minimum salary needed to be eligible for the 30% ruling. On the other hand, if you’re earning more than €120k already, it means you’re probably well established and settled in your current country, and so less likely to relocate.
From what I’ve seen in the housing market, I can confirm that if you’re on the lower end of this ballpark and are buying alone, you’ll have a tough time. But if you are a couple, or an individual at the other end of this ballpark and interested in a small flat, you’ll be able to afford what you want. This has nothing to do with being an expat, though, but everything with how much you earn, your relationship status and stage of life.
It’s not rocket science that DINK (=double income no kids) couples have the most financially comfortable life in the whole working population. And it’s not rocket science that a 30-year-old machine learning engineer has a high purchasing power for what he (and it is most often a he) needs. And it’s not rocket science that these people are successful in the housing market, whether they are Dutch or expats. Banks know it, because when they give a mortgage, they calculate it from the gross salary, which is not affected by your tax breaks. They are just happy to give you a 100% mortgage with the highest interest rate. Why then would it be difficult for anyone in a stable, decent paying job to get on the property ladder?
That’s the reality. Not in popular European cities anyway, which are all experiencing some form of a housing crisis. You have to have a deposit, either formally or as a bid.
It’s that simple:
There are many professionals who want to live in big cities, and not enough flats available to buy. And so, the property prices are very high and an upfront cash commitment is needed to prevent excessive borrowing and mitigate risk. The less flats available and the more people in a city, the higher the property prices. The higher the prices, the higher the required deposit (or bid).
This is why it’s difficult for most people to buy a flat. It’s a separate issue from the number of expats in the city, or their purchasing power.
What makes it easy to buy a property in the Netherlands is a possibility of a 100% mortgage. In theory, you don’t have to have any savings to put upfront for your purchase.
What makes it difficult is the bidding war. In practice, you have to have a lot of savings to take part in it.
Overbidding is prevalent in big cities. That’s what Pieter Omzigt is referring to when he accuses expats of ruining the real estate market in Amsterdam.
Let me explain the issue.
When you make an offer on a flat, you place a blind bid, much higher than the asking price. Technically, you can do it as an individual, but in reality, everyone knows that only the bids represented by agents are considered. Your agent is there to help you figure out the size of the bid. Currently in Amsterdam this hovers around 15 to 20%. There is a caveat: you need to have this money in cash. The bank will not include it in your mortgage.
An average flat size in Amsterdam is 70 square meters, an average price per square meter is about 8k (source). To bid on a flat like that, you’d need to have a nice chunk of cash saved, namely, at least 100k.
Because of the 30% ruling, a tax benefit I described in the previous article, expats are seen as the only ones capable of saving such an exorbitant sum of money. I would argue that this isn’t accurate. I’d describe the group who can do that “supported high earners”.
Having lived in London thought all my twenties, I can compare its housing situation to Amsterdam. Foreigners in London look at their British colleagues with envy. The Brits are able to buy a property at the stage of life when expats still barely keep their head above water. That’s because they are getting help from their parents: either in the form of a roof over their head, or “pocket money”. They are supported until they can save for a flat deposit, and fill the office space with relentless real estate chatter (oh the British office culture, how little do I miss you!).
In Amsterdam, expats don’t look at locals with envy, because they have their own tax breaks that others are envious about.
The 30% ruling compensates for the comforts of being a local. In relation to housing, these boil down to two crucial factors: relying on family support as a young adult and being able to rent a cheap flat. The most fortunate locals combine both.
It’s pretty obvious that people with rich parents, or those who choose to live with their parents for longer, are better equipped to buy a property. You may wonder, though, what does being a local have to do with cheap rent? Surprisingly a lot, not that you’d know if you didn’t have close Dutch friends, since they don’t brag about it to expats.
Any Dutch person that I know well enough to ask about their rent (I’ve counted and there were eight of them) spends way less money on it than an expat. Believe me, up to a half. There are three main reasons for that:
Locals have a broader network, so they know a friend of a friend who is willing to sublet their flat without registration, meaning, illegally. And most Dutch people don’t need to be registered in Amsterdam, because they never de-registered from their parents’ address. That’s the first and most common reason for cheap rent and saving potential.
Of course, many locals are renting their flats legally. However, they usually would have found them a few years ago, when prices were very different. Since then, the law has been protecting them from steep increases in rent cost, or being kicked out.
Finally, in some (not so rare) cases, locals just know how to get into ridiculously cheap social housing by fulfilling the income criteria on paper, and then holding on to that housing for the rest of their lives.
These are the types of advantages without which, I would argue, you cannot save enough money to buy a flat in a city, any popular city, not just in Amsterdam.
In that way, sure: there is a group to envy and hate for their purchasing power. It’s the high earners supported by the extra advantages that allow them to save tens of thousands of euros. It doesn’t equal expats, and it’s not limited to Amsterdam.
Expats who are destroying the housing market make for a good story. Sadly, the story is bigger and more negative. Nobody is breaking the market, the market simply is broken: it favours people who can save around 100k and pay a high monthly mortgage. Expats play along with the system and use their tax advantage to enter the game, just like a local would use the money that their parents (for example) give them.
People in the Netherlands, with their values of equality and fairness, seem to have an impression that everyone should be able to afford living in a big city. With globalisation, European open borders, post-covid reframing of working conditions, and specialised white-collar workers picking and choosing their places of work, this has long stopped being true.
Properties in popular big cities are not accessible for regular earners, expats or not. And so the hate aimed at expats is not for buying flats, but for being a high earner.
Which, as I explained before, is the whole point of becoming an expat in the first place.
My Dutch neighbour, if it annoys you that someone moves countries to earn well and have a good quality of life, what’s stopping you from doing the same?

5 Underexplored Areas in Amsterdam: For If You Just HAVE to Visit,https://medium.com/@elliegood/5-underexplored-areas-in-amsterdam-for-if-you-just-have-to-visit-c8d5a4f3e305,"Sign up

I already wrote a piece about the tourism industry in Amsterdam and how it’s completely out of control. So, my first recommendation is to definitely go to other Dutch cities if you can. However, I’m still torn by the fact that I love my adopted city and hope that others can experience and fall in love with it in much the same way that I did.
Most tourists never go out of the Center (Centraal) area of Amsterdam. While there are certainly cool canals, beautiful architecture, and a ton of historical monuments, the Center is just one small part of the incredibly varied tapestry that is this beautiful city.
So, if you absolutely HAVE to visit Amsterdam, consider easing the tourism crisis by finding a hotel in or exploring one of these areas.
My absolute favorite area of Amsterdam. Green is the operative word here as there are trees and parks EVERYWHERE! Go to Oosterpark, with a huge open green space, some interesting sculptures, and the National Slavery Monument (commemorating the end of slavery in the Netherlands). Oh, it’s also right behind the Tropenmuseum (Tropical Museum), which was originally created to showcase and educate Amsterdammers on The Netherlands’ colonial properties overseas but has been turned into a way for the Dutch to grapple with and better understand this bloody history. It’s definitely not perfect but they’re trying much harder than a number of other museums (*cough* British Museum *cough*).
Also in Amsterdam Oost is the Dappermarkt, one of the several excellent outdoor markets around Amsterdam. It’s open Tuesday — Saturday and has delicious food, clothing, and just about anything you could ever want with some really good prices.
De Plantage is a set of islands perched between Amsterdam Oost and Centraal. It’s notable for the beautiful architecture, trees and parks everywhere, as well as HORTUS and ARTIS. HORTUS is the Royal Botanical Gardens and has a great collection. Honestly, while ARTIS is nice, unless you have kids, there are much better (and cheaper) zoos to go visit in other cities.
This area is definitely one of the most underexplored AND undervalued parts of Amsterdam. Think Brooklyn before it got overly gentrified (but it’s on its way…). Noord used to be considered a working-class area, with shipyards, docks, and factories. In the second half of the 20th Century much of that industry began to move out, especially as Amsterdam moved from being a regional town to a world-class city. Eventually, Amsterdam figured out that there was a huge underdeveloped area just north of Central Station (which makes it a great place to stay when you’re visiting *hint hint*). Today, you can still see remnants of that history, as most of the industrial areas were repurposed to house various enterprises.
While you won’t see any historic canal houses, this side of Amsterdam showcases the ‘alternative, counter-culture’ heritage that the city is known for. Notable things to see are the Boatel, a cruise ship fully repurposed as a hotel, Cafe De Ceuvel, a start-up eco village made of old houseboats, working to clean up a former boatyard and promote environmentalism, and the monthly flea market at NDSM Wharf.
The De Pijp district of Amsterdam was originally known for being like Amsterdam Noord is now, working-class homes and businesses that eventually gentrified. Except, that’s already fully happened now. De Pijp is fully 100% gentrified. Not to say that there aren’t fun things to do, just that you’re going to find about 3 gluten-free, vegan, holistic, non-GMO jackfruit pulled pork/burger places for about every person who lives there. There is so much dining but often at slightly higher prices (and more Americanized) than what you’ll usually pay in other areas of Amsterdam.
The big star attraction of De Pijp is the Albert Cuypmarkt, the largest outdoor market in Amsterdam. This is the big one and it is super-impressive. Weekdays are mostly vendors selling tourist things but Saturday is the best day for a visit, with real Amsterdammers coming to do their shopping.
Other fun things to do include taking a load off in Sarphatipark, one of Amsterdam’s most impressive parks, heading to the Heineken Experience to see the original brewery, or walking over to Museumplein to visit the Van Gogh or Rijksmuseum (book tickets ahead of time). Ok, technically Museumplein isn’t in De Pijp but it’s right next door so I’m counting it.
This area is characterized by big, old 19th century warehouses, lovingly restored to become housing/event space/bars, etc. This entire area used to be for loading and unloading all kinds of cargo ships, especially once Amsterdam Central Station was built, which changed some of the harbor space.
Stop by De Gooyer, one of the few windmills still located within the Amsterdam city limits and have a drink next door at Brouwerij ‘t IJ, the first microbrewery in Amsterdam. Located in a converted bathhouse, its logo is an ostrich with a large egg, which is a Dutch pun. IJ (pronounced like ai) is a well-known river in Amsterdam which also sounds like ei, the Dutch word for egg.
Also while you’re here, take a stroll down Czaar Peterstraat, a beautiful tree-lined boulevard with cute shops and fun places to stop. It’s one of my favorite streets because it’s just so peaceful, you can’t believe you’re still in Amsterdam.
In the summer, walk down to the Marineterrein. Part Dutch naval base, part public access swimming pool, this area is one of the more interesting areas in the city. While part of the Marineterrein is a fully-functioning military base (DO NOT TRESPASS!), a small part has been opened up along the water. Signs are very clear and gates are incredibly obvious. You can enter from the south entrance at Kattenburgerstraat or from the north entrance at the Kommandantsbrug (near Mediamatic). Come for one of the closest areas to Centraal where you can both swim and grab food/drinks at the conveniently-located bar. Definitely a hidden gem.
Anyway, that’s all I have for right now! Stay tuned for more travel tips and please consider helping to ease the Amsterdam tourism crisis by staying or visiting these other areas of town!

Amsterdam is a gorgeous city with beautiful canals and architecture. I was lucky enough to explore it this summer with my mom and my grandparents.
When my mom and I arrived, we took a taxi to the hotel. It was a Tesla. The driver said that soon, most taxis in Amsterdam would be Teslas, to help the environment. We checked in at the Pulitzer hotel, which was made up of 6 canal houses.
The first thing we did was walk around. The Pulitzer was situated on a canal, near the city center, so there was lots to see. First, we visited the Tulip Museum. Tulips used to be a very valuable item in the Netherlands. The best tulips could be sold for almost as much as a house!
Then we stopped for a snack at Pancakes. Amsterdam. Dutch pancakes were kind of like French crepes. They were delicious. After our pancakes, we walked back to the hotel and asked for directions to Momo, a sushi restaurant. It was a 2o minute walk. We had sushi and steamed fish for dinner.
The next day we did the Flowers of Amsterdam Tour with Hanneke. We went to a flower factory and saw flowers being carried away for auctioning and exportation. Next we went to a rose grower. There were rows of roses and each of them smelled fantastic. There were also lots of animals. Fish and turtles in a pond, chickens, and kittens.
After, we went to the town of Haarlem and explored. We had lunch and went to the oldest science museum in the Netherlands. When we got back, we met my grandparents and had delicious Thai food for dinner.
At 10:00am the next day, we had a small group tour about Jewish history. It was pretty long and not very fun, in my opinion. It was a lot of lecturing from our tour guide. We learned a lot, but it was boring. Then late in the afternoon, we went on a boat for a tour of the canals. It was relaxing and enjoyable.
We had another tour with Hanneke at the Rijksmuseum, an art museum. We saw a variety of different painting from different artists, the highlight being the Night Watch, by Rembrandt. We ate lunch at the Rijksmuseum. Then we were supposed to take a painting class but they switched the location on us and we couldn’t make it.
Then we took the tram to the The Royal Concertgebouw and saw the Robeco Jazzclub show. It was my first Jazz show and I thought it was pretty good. We had Chinese food for dinner at Chang-i.
The next day we went relaxed and went shopping at the 9 streets. We didn’t really do much.
In the early morning, we did a photo shoot on the streets of Amsterdam. It was fun and we got great pictures. Next we went to the Anne Frank House. It was amazing how they hid for so long in such a tiny space. Then at night, we went back to the Concertgebouw and saw a string quartet. They did cool things with their instruments and had a dog machine and lights.
The next day was the Amsterdam Pride Parade. It went on for hours. Boats on the canal paraded by filled with crowds of people dressed up and flourishing signs. The horde of people watching screamed and shouted. It was chaotic.
The next day, we went to Schiphol Airport and flew home.

Over the Hill, Part Thirty-One: An Introvert’s Guide To Amsterdam
Amsterdam is a city best known for its parties and ‘extra special’ brownies, but we didn’t have the time, money, or inclination to do any of that, so we only planned to spend one day there, to try and get an introvert’s perspective of the city.
As we got the train into Amsterdam we were already facing a compromised day; the Royal Palace was occupied, meaning that we couldn’t visit the State Rooms, and the Anne Frank house had decided to do renovations, and to restrict the amount of people who can go in, something they’d obviously decided recently, as it wasn’t there the last time we checked the site a few months ago. So the Anne Frank House was booked out as well, meaning the top two things on our list for Amsterdam were both out of commission, at least for us.
We got off the train at Amsterdam to a literal sea of people; it was almost a shock after Rotterdam, as people streamed in every direction around the station. We decided we needed to do two things first; pee, and find a map so I didn’t have to pull out my iPad every five minutes. We found the tourist centre, but it quickly became apparent that they were more interested in taking money from tourists as opposed to helping them; the toilets cost a Euro to use, while the only decent maps cost money as well. We decided to keep our money and continue on, slightly disgruntled with Amsterdam, and find the way ourselves.
First stop was the main square, and the Royal Palace, which turned out to be rather unassuming, at least from the outside. After that we managed to find the Begijnhof, a cloister of single, religious woman similar to the one we saw in Bruges. This one wasn’t quite as impressive, although their little church was nice (like most things from Bruges, it’s hard to do a fair comparison). From here we strolled through the old city, taking in the sights, but again it was hard not to compare it to the canals in Ghent and Bruges, which were far prettier. Oh Belgium, you ruined us for everywhere else!
After passing a series of art museums, none of which I had any interest in, we arrived at a Diamond Museum, not because I’m obsessed with diamonds, but because the creation of them is actually quite interesting. The museum started off by showing you how they’re made (deep, deep underground, before being pushed to the surface by erupting volcanoes), before showing you how they’re categorised. Fun fact; a carat is a term of weight for diamonds, not an indicator of clarity or purity. From there we saw different types of diamonds, (including black diamonds; cool!), and replicas of really famous diamonds, including some of the famous Cullinan diamonds, which we’d actually seen weeks ago at the Tower of London! The diamond museum was interesting, and anything that increases my knowledge base gets a tick from me.
Upon leaving the diamond museum we decided to venture back into the old town, and try to find somewhere for a late lunch.
We settled for a quaint little restaurant down a small street called the Pantry, which specialised in Dutch food, something we hadn’t had a lot of (stroopwafel and Dutch pancakes notwithstanding), as we’d been cooking our own dinners. To start off we had some bitterballen, which is a strange little breaded ball of cheese and beef, and then for our main course, we had something that closely resembled shepherds pie, but with cheese and cauliflower added to the mix, and a trio of different mashed potatoes with a smoked sausage. Everything was really nice, and we left the restaurant satisfied with our selection for lunch (and with Dutch food in general).
There weren’t really any other sights that we wanted to see, so we decided to go for a wander through the Vondelpark, a large park just outside the old town. It was hot on this particular day, and it seemed like every teenager in Amsterdam had descended on the park to sunbath and chill out, (beaches are not a thing in the Netherlands), but while it was saturated with people, the park itself was beautiful, with some lovely trees, lakes, fountains and bridges. Alex and I had a really nice walk up and down the park; we saw lots of dogs around, including a pair of huskies who kept stealing food from a poor Asian couple as they were trying to have a picnic! Cheeky rascals.
From the Vondelpark we made our way back to the train station, and made our way back to Rotterdam for our final night at Peet’s. It’s hard to categorise the Netherlands, because unfortunately, we didn’t get enough time there. Despite staying there, we never got a opportunity to walk around central Rotterdam, or visit The Hague. Our visit to Amsterdam was short as well, but I wasn’t a big fan; it was far too touristy for my liking, and seemed more suitable to people who want to party. Hopefully in the future we’ll get to see a bit more of the Netherlands (including their national parks), but right now we had a date with a plane, and that meant a trip through Western Germany.

3 different trips of varying lengths, right from 4 hours to 7 days has given me a good insight into this amazingly vibrant city.
For all those thinking this post is gonna be about the coffee shops, red light district and other decadence that this city has come to be known for, I would suggest you head else where. In my eyes, the city is so much more than the chaos of Dam Square, the drunken debauchery at Leidseplein or the feverish squeals of teenage boys at seeing the red light district for the first time. Don’t get me wrong, those areas are not to be missed and do head out into town and hop into the nearest bar to down your glass of the Dutch Genever but then make sure to uncover the actual appeal of the city too.
So here are my top things to do in Amsterdam.
This is the best advice I received a couple of years back from a friend. If you truly want to explore the city and get a feel for it, there’s no better way than to actually experience living in it. I’ve spent time in 2 different hostels, an Airbnb apartment, and a Hotel at Amsterdam in various neighborhoods and if I had one single advice to give to anyone heading to Amsterdam, this would be it. Do not, by any given means, no matter what it takes, stay in the center of town. The center is buzzing with people from all across the world, the vibe is electric, the feel amazing and the experience… well, not exactly Amsterdam. Unless you want to see 10 groups of men celebrating their bros last few days as a bachelor by dressing him up in a frock.
If you get the chance, stay just outside the center. The city is not large and is very well connected by trams and the metro. You can easily find an amazing hotel or apartment in areas like Jordaan, De Pjip or even Amsterdam Noord (a 5 min ferry ride away). Every neighborhood has something different to offer and you can choose your stay based on your interests. The iAmsterdam website gives a quick look at the various neighborhoods here
One of my favorite ways to chill in Amsterdam is to just sit by the canals and watch the city at work. Every canal has something different to offer, few are used extensively for transport, while some others are used by the tourist boats and some others are used just for the houseboats. None the less the canals are extremely calming and you can get to learn a lot of the cities nuances through them.
Some of my favorite places in Amsterdam are also right next to the canals. Check out Waterkant (Outdoor 1 on map) if you are looking for a great place to spend the evening with a couple of beers and some great company.
A visit to Amsterdam is incomplete without a visit to the flower market (Experiences -4 on map). If you have spent any amount of time in the city you would already know of their obsession with plants. Every house has a myriad of blooms popping out from every window and balcony. Even the boats are usually covered with tons of potted plants and it does not stop there. Once you enter the houses, restaurants, hotels or even a pub, you are sure to find a plant on your table or next to your bedside.
I absolutely adore the country for this obsession and make it a point to spend some time at the flower market. Though a little touristy and overpriced compared to some of the other shops I have found in smaller markets and towns, it is a great place for anyone to take in the diversity that the city has to offer in terms of people, plants, culture and even food. From tiny succulents to age old Bonsais, you can find it here.
If you are visiting during the spring, the market will be filled with Tulips of every single color imaginable. Trust me when I say this, it can cause a color overload and you with thank the gods that the sky is dull and dreary.
Not visiting in the spring, you can still pick up Tulip buds to take home with you. Unlike the Tulip mania period when a single bulb could sell for millions, these bulbs are quite reasonable and from what I’ve heard through friends, have a pretty decent success rate. Make sure your country allows you to carry them in though. The shopkeepers usually know the rules for most countries, just ask.
If you have time, visit Keukenhof gardens but only if you can deal with crowds and haven’t blinded yourself with all the color yet.
The garden is open to visitors only during the Tulip festival which lasts a couple of months and the team takes an entire year to landscape and maintain the gardens for this showing. You will be amazed by the variety of Tulips and other flowers showcased here. Be sure to get there early to avoid the crowds and carry some food, the stores there can be a bit pricey.
If you are lucky and visit at the right time, the tulip fields close to Keukenhof are supposed to be breathtaking. We were ready to get away from the crowds and the overdose of beauty and therefore decided to skip out on the fields that were almost bare by the time we got there.
Amsterdam is filled with great choices for food. Being a tourist hotspot you can find every type of food and drink that you would want. Here’s a quick list of Do’s and Don’t that I would suggest.
Check my recommendations for places to eat on the map.
The city is filled with amazing architecture, beautiful bridges, and stunning museums. Keep your eyes open, you will be amazed by what the city has to offer. A stroll through the city will take you past some of the prettiest sights you would have seen in ages.
Amsterdam has quickly become one of my favorite places to visit due to the huge variety of experiences it offers. This post is far from complete and just a quick look at the city. Hopefully to be followed up with more.

Empty, really. For the first time in three months trains were going regularly again, and although it is advised to still stay home and only use public transport for critical trips, I took the opportunity to go see my mother. Is it the smartest thing to do? Not sure. And despite it being a terrible situation in which we now find ourselves, it is bringing out the true beauty and reality of places, like Amsterdam.
A city that has grown to become a touristic hub is finally showing its real side in times of this pandemic. Where masses of British and American tourists usually flood the trains from the airport to the city centre , I could now count the number of people on the train platform on my two hands. It’s strange to imagine what one of the busiest airports in the world is like during times like these. News reports headlined incredible reductions in tourism’s and flights, both internationally and intercontinentally, but it’s only when you’re in the train from the airport and at the airport yourself that you realize how much of an impact this virus has. It also made me realize how many tourists Amsterdam counts all year round, and perhaps also how dependent the city is on what we often call “cultural terrorists”.
Only later on in the evening, when mum and I cycled towards the city Centre, did I realize how dependent we ‘Amsterdammers’ are on tourism. To see an empty train station and airport is one. But to see any empty Dam square, well damn, that was just fascinating. The occasional saxophone street artist tends to get swallowed up in the groups of tourists. But last night, it was surrounded by nothing but a few locals and pure emptiness. Almost lonely. For the first time, the saxophonist was heard on a square that is extremely symbolic to the city and the country in every day life. No more police sirens, trams, and old diesel driven garbage trucks. This is not how I know Amsterdam, but it definitely felt like this is how it should be. For the very first time I was not ashamed of ‘my’ city.
A city in which trams are usually stuffed with people, now only accepts a maximum of 40 passengers per ride. A city where cafes and bars will always serve people, even if there is no space, are now left dead empty or still remain closed. A city where canal and river cruises destroy the waters of the centre, is now so empty that citizens are taking a swim. And a city where one usually has to slalom through tourists, is now so empty and clean that it just simply unbelievable and unimaginable. It almost feels wrong. But definitely a city that now feels like home, more than ever before.

Traveling has always been a big part of my life, especially now living in Ireland — All European countries are “literally” a quick flight away!
We went for a quick getaway, arriving on a Thursday evening and leaving on a Sunday morning. Two full days was all it took to fall in love, of course, the amazing sunny weather contributed. However, the diversity of people walking around, mixed with the thriving culture only made exploring the streets that much more exciting.
Skipping all museums on this trip but one (we ain’t got no money…and we’ll be back), day one started with a free walking tour hosted by local Dutch guides. Unaware of just how educational and fun the tour was going to be, time flew by as we learned about the history of Amsterdam. All our trips will now begin with walking tours — they gave us the BEST advice on what to do and what to see. Such as the difference between Coffeeshops and Cafes! (important information as tourists, people!)
For lunch, we attempted following the directions we received from our tour guide and ended up finding the best little place for the famous Dutch cone fries.

There is so much more to Amsterdam than coffee shops and the red light district, yet for some reason people still come to the city and barely scratch the surface! With affordable flights from Europe and soon a three-hour train from London, Amsterdam is more accessible than ever. Even after living in the Netherlands for half a year, I still feel like there is so much more to see, but hopefully this guide will give you a few off-the-beaten-track ideas.
Friday evening: You’ve stepped off the plane from your after-work-flight, and have dropped your bags at your boatstay on the canals of Dam, now you’re hungry and eager to get out and about. Luckily, a unique ramen experience awaits you: Men Impossible. You need to book in advance, because Atsushi, the guy who owns, cooks, hosts, serves and entertains this fine establishment, doesn’t want guests to feel rushed, so limits the amount of covers per evening. This little restaurant is beautifully decorated, with one large, communal table that encourages conversation and connection.
Friday drinks: You’re full of delicious ramen, and feel like a nightcap. This is where you want to avoid the raucous tourists and just chill out with some locals. Cafe Gollem is one such place, offering a selection of 200 different beers with a great, relaxed atmosphere and real, Dutch patrons.
Saturday morning: Wake up, grab a coffee and a bagel, and head into Dam square for the free walking tour! The people who take you really love doing their job, and the tour is fun, informative and touches on a great array of historical moments in Amsterdam’s history.
Saturday lunch: After the tour, you might want to eat something a little more refined than the chips (save those for later), and what better way to warm yourself up than a delightfully spicy Indonesian lunch at Sampurna? Opposite the flower market, the decor is dark and cosy, with statues and shell decorations that tinkle while you eat traditional food that reminds you what a rich and diverse society Amsterdam really is.
Saturday Afternoon: Walking off your meal through the flower market and enjoying the tulips and bulbs, you feel like doing something a bit different. How about visiting a cat sanctuary, on a boat? In the 1960’s, Mrs v. Weelde acquired a barge opposite her apartment, and filled it with the cat’s she’d been rescuing for years. Now you can visit it and stroke the cats, learn about their mission and donate some food or toys for the resident felines!
Saturday Dinner: Get yourself over to Taste Before You Waste, for a donation based, food-waste dinner that will nourish your body and soul. The philosophy is simple: they save food that would otherwise have been dumped, and turn it into a delicious dinner that you pay as much as you are able for. The money raised goes to continuing their efforts and improving food education.
Saturday Evening: Time to go back to the boat stay, have a disco nap and get ready for a big night out. There are some great bars where you can drink and bars where you can dance, but if you’re looking to party, head to de School and literally lose yourself on the dry-ice filled dance floors until the early morning. It has a random door policy so don’t be deterred if you see people in the queue being turned away, just be cool, calm and polite, and you’re sure to make it.
Sunday Brunch: You’re probably feeling pretty tired from last night, so ease yourself into the day with brunch at Pluk: the food is Instagram worthy, not too busy and has a calming, monochrome decor that will keep you grounded until you’ve got some food in you.
Sunday Afternoon: You’ve filled your tummy and you’re ready to explore a bit of culture before you leave. Jump on the train and a bus to Zaanse Schans to see some real life windmills that are still sawing wood, crushing spices and grinding flour. Walk around the reclaimed land and feed the goats and chickens, taste cheese and hot chocolate in the little village and get some great pictures of old Dutch life. Each of the working mills offers a guided tour and little museums which tell you about their history and modern-day purpose.
A whirlwind weekend in Amsterdam that has hopefully shown you a few different sights to the ones you saw when you were inter railing at eighteen. I hope you enjoyed your trip!

I’ve visited many cities, but few ignite and fire up the genetic glitch that pushes me to look through the viewfinder more than when in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The city has inspired generations of artists of all kinds. Today is no different.
I’ve literally stood on streets, turned 360 degrees, and seen something I’d like to photograph at every angle. Amsterdam is a photographers Disneyland, Super Model, World Series Champ, and Christmas Morning all rolled into one.. and she likes her photo taken!!!
Some of my favorite days have been those just wondering around the streets of this amazing city with just my camera and time to get lost. When asked about it, I usually say, “It’s like walking around inside a giant museum, but it’s a city! You just have to go, I can’t explain it well enough in words for you to understand.”

(British spelling)
I finally landed in Amsterdam after a nightmarish flight from Tallinn. The extremely loud volume of the pilot’s announcement was hurting my ears.
“Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Amsterdam. We have to taxi for ten minutes. Please, remain seated until the seat belt announcement is off. Thank you.”
His voice sounded distorted. I had to cover my ears with both my hands. I had forgotten to bring any earplugs with me. In the past, I used to carry several pairs of earplugs conveniently distributed in all my bags.
“It seems I have forgotten everything about my travel essentials.”
Whilst blaming myself for my oversight I took the obligatory photos of aircrafts. Flashbacks from my last time in Amsterdam began to pop up into my head, uninvited.
My previous time in Amsterdam was nine years ago. Time really flies, doesn’t it? It was May 2015. I was attending a conference for the electronics supply chain industry. I was writing about the conference and the latest news for electronics supply chain professionals for EBN (Electronics Business Network), now EPS News.

Before leaving my safe D.C. haven and flying thousands of miles across the Atlantic, my friends who had gone abroad the semester before told me that it changed their lives, how they would go back in a second, and how lucky I was that I had the experience ahead of me. Few people mentioned challenges, or if they did, it was because they had to eat too much rice or had too many crazy nights out. For most people it seemed like their experience in Europe was spent drunk 90% of the time, something I wasn’t particularly searching for in an abroad experience. So I was wholly unprepared when I came to Amsterdam and struggled in many unexpected ways. I hate saying I struggled because I feel so privileged that I could even study abroad and spend four months in Amsterdam. Who complains about getting to live in Europe??? I found myself looking at my Instagram and Facebook photos wondering if my pictures really represented my experience at all. But in the interest of being honest and transparent, I figured it was best not to sugarcoat my experience. Whenever people ask me how my time in Amsterdam is going, my automatic and natural response is to say, “Amazing, I love it!” when in fact it has not been without obstacles that often left me questioning why I left D.C. at all. Why is our natural response to say what we think people want to hear even if it is far from the truth? It’s hard to say that you don’t love something, and even harder to admit that you are probably partially, if not fully, responsible for that. Convinced my generation has a fear of mediocrity, I found myself trying to portray my experience in a positive light just to make people think I was having the stereotypical abroad experience. It was definitely difficult writing this because I feel guilty and ungrateful for not loving my time in Europe, for not cherishing every moment. It almost feels socially unacceptable to question anything that should be wonderful. But going abroad was tough, and I wanted to explain the good, bad, and ugly and go beyond my usual rosy response.
I think of myself as a pretty adventurous person, relatively adaptable, and definitely good at taking on new situations, but Amsterdam tested that. I sat in my room after the first week of classes and cried for hours. I felt so alone and isolated. Maybe that was due to the fact that I lived 25 minutes outside the center of the city, or maybe because I had never before lived in a room by myself. Regardless, it was tough. It made me truly appreciate having someone at home to ask you how your day was, or always having someone available to vent to. I pride myself on being strong and independent, but being alone truly tests your sense of self. It wasn’t as much that I was physically alone — I had classes every day where I saw plenty of people — but I felt emotionally lonely. My mom wasn’t available to talk as much because of the time difference, I didn’t make a lot of friends where I lived, and the friends I made mostly lived in the city, which was a long commute, especially late at night when they all met up. Usually high-spirited and positive, I didn’t feel like myself. The first few weeks were a lot: figuring out the transportation system (aka I hate being late, so getting to class hours early), navigating a dutch grocery store, deciding how comfortable I was biking without a helmet. I struggled with money, weight, exercise, unhealthy food, technology. Every day was a new challenge and new growth.
For me, transitioning to new things has always been pretty easy. My freshmen year at GW I made friends instantly and never felt homesick or alone. Even during my first summer working at camp, I felt like I fit in and made friends effortlessly. But abroad was different. Obviously, I was in an entirely new culture that speaks a language I literally know not a word of, but it was more than that. Living far away without people to help me feel comfortable is definitely difficult in a way I wasn’t expecting. It is easy to say you love alone time until that’s all you have. I quickly realized that maybe I wasn’t well equipped to go abroad. I don’t really drink or stay out late or enjoy deviating from my routine, so where did that leave me? When I asked some of my friends here why they went abroad, common answers were to get away from their university or a bad relationship or to travel around Europe. Hearing them talk about why they went abroad made me realize that I may have gone for the wrong reasons or because I thought it was something I had to do. I wasn’t trying to get away from anything (other than maybe Trump’s presidency), I love my friends at GW, and I’ve already traveled around Europe before, so this wasn’t a first-time experience. I guess the only answer that popped into my mind was that I wanted to see a culture different from my own and to increase my knowledge of the world.
For those of you that don’t know me super well, I love schedules and to-do lists and being busy. As I was talking to my mom on the phone last night, I realized that one of the things I disliked most about being abroad was the free time. I know that’s crazy, and that I should love having free time, so let me explain. Did you ever read that book about the little girl who has one wish, and her wish is to have Christmas every day? After Christmas happens a few days in a row, she starts to dislike it and not appreciate it as much. She gets a stomach ache from all the candy and doesn’t know what to do with all the presents. Well, that is kind of how I feel about free time. It is great the first few days, but then I just start resenting it. It’s hard to appreciate something when that’s all you know. Much of abroad was free time. I have NEVER had this much time to do whatever I want, and it was overwhelming. Learning how to relax was hard, and also really good for me. Most of my friends here thought it was ridiculous that I didn’t enjoy free time, so that made me feel even more guilty about being miserable. As the semester has gone on, I’ve learned how to make free time busy, which I realize sounds insane. My google schedule now says “ 6:15am: Workout; 8:00am: Bike to class; 11:00am: make lunch; 1:00pm: walk around the block; 3:00pm: Read; 6:00pm: Eat dinner; 10:00pm: Bed.” As you can see, my life is full of exciting turns.
Whenever people ask me what my favorite part about abroad is, I say the classes. The reaction I get is usually a mix between confusion and maybe a little disgust. The University of Amsterdam has given me three of the best classes of my entire life, with three of the best teachers. I look forward to class every day and can’t wait to do the readings. I asked my Language and Politics teacher if she would go teach at GW because I loved her class so much. I felt intellectually stimulated by my classes and learned so much about the EU and the populist movement from a European perspective. If I didn’t know who Geert Wilders was before Amsterdam, I sure know now. I love that the Netherlands is so progressive and generally prioritizes everyone’s needs. Their health care system is truly comprehensive and they definitely understand the importance of compromise in governing. There are many things about the Netherlands that I didn’t love, but their political system and progressive policies impressed me. I now understand that prostitution is a profession and that lax drug laws are actually effective when it comes to safety.
I realize most of this essay has been about my struggles with being abroad, but I definitely need to mention all the highlights. Through my introspection on my time in the Netherlands, I have come to the conclusion that my struggles had little to do with Amsterdam or the Netherlands itself. I think I would have struggled in the same way wherever I would have gone (except maybe I would have lived closer to the city somewhere else). First and foremost, I love the city of Amsterdam. I’m so thankful for the beautiful canals, delicious food (shoutout to dutch pancakes & apple pie), and the biking culture. Biking 30 minutes to school every day was honestly one of my favorite parts. It was so rewarding learning the local biking rules and feeling like a Dutch citizen while navigating trams, tourists, and bikers with headphones. Plus, I have thighs of steel now. I made a list of things I love about the Netherlands as the semester went on, so here is a quick summary:
I’m not going to lie and say it will be extremely hard to leave. I will definitely be sad to leave this beautiful place and say goodbye to some truly great friends I’ve made. Being out of Trump’s America has been an incredible and therapeutic break from reality, but I am ready to come back and resist (well, after my three months in rural Michigan teaching fitness, of course). I sometimes mull over what I am going to say when people ask me how my time abroad was. The classic answer that it was the best four months would be inaccurate. But I feel like telling people how hard it was would be uncomfortable because we are so used to talking about abroad as if it is always incredible and without flaws. Maybe it did change my life in some ways. I think I am much better at being alone, better at relaxing, better at processing my emotions and prioritizing my health and happiness. I think learning how to live in a new culture is an important skill, and I certainly learned a lot more about Europe. Being outside of America for awhile is a good reality check. And I can’t forget to mention the friendships I made. I’m thankful for Maggie biking to school with me every day, participating in almost every one of my workout sessions, and letting me vent about people stealing my Clif bars. Thankful for Steph for being my travel buddy and pushing me to really evaluate and process my feelings on relationships and family. Thankful for Kerri for being the only person I’ve ever met who feels the same way I do about alcohol and going out. And thankful for everyone else who has impacted my time abroad and made it infinitely better.
It’s okay that my time abroad wasn’t perfect or as life-shattering as I was told it would be. And maybe that’s my own fault. Maybe I should have gone out more or stayed up later. Maybe in 20 years I’ll regret not forcing myself to go to dark clubs with American music with mostly American students. I very well could regret not being drunk or high for 90% of this experience. It is hard to look back on my four months and ask if there was anything I could have done to make it a better or more positive experience. But I think the most important thing I’ve learned is how to deal with situations that aren’t ideal. I’m not always going to have an incredibly supportive and loving roommate (hi Sammi) to ask me how my day was. I’m not always going to have healthy food options or an accessible gym. I’m not always going to be in a city that feels natural (aka DC) or that keeps me constantly busy. Life is about dealing with new things that aren’t always what you expect. My mom and dad were the MVP’s of abroad. The time difference (9 hours!!!) was rough, especially because my mom gets off work at 2:30 pm, which is 11:30 pm my time (I’m definitely asleep by then), but they spent hours telling me that what I was feeling was natural. It’s okay not to love an experience but make the most of it and learn from it. When I get on the plane tomorrow, I know I’ll be sad to leave such a beautiful city, and I will certainly cherish the memories. So peace out Sloterpark and the old lady that always flies by me on my long runs around the lake. Peace out Dirk, my grocery store, that has everything but brussels sprouts (my one true love). Peace out to Bike 359, aka the most ratchet and broken bike of all time. Peace out to the Student Hotel, where customer service is definitely not a priority. Peace out to my shared kitchen and the mornings when I come in and the floor is covered in beer and half of my food is gone. Peace out to UvA and the amazing staff and students that made my time in Amsterdam academically amazing. Peace out to Ivy & Bros, aka the cafe that became my home. Peace out Schiphol Airport, where I have spent 90% of my time in the last two months due to traveling 8 (!!!) weekends in a row. Peace out Dam Square, the home of pigeons and high tourists. And finally, peace out Amsterdam, I’ll miss you.

Written by Craig BerryCreative Intern at VBAT
Recently I had 2 friends from the UK come to Amsterdam to visit and I wanted to show them the city I have been living in for the last 5 months and all that is great about it. I could easily have taken them to the bigger tourist attractions such as the Heineken Experience, the Anne Frank House, the Rijksmuseum and so on. But I wanted to share my pieces of local knowledge which I have picked up on so far and also find and explore new places in the city for myself.
Firstly we visited the Stedelijk Museum which although yes, it is one of those big tourist attractions, as one of the world’s best museums with a great collection, the 3 of us as intrepid young designers could not escape its allure. I myself went recently to visit the Willem Sandberg exhibition although this had since finished but in its place was a great exhibition celebrating 100 years of ‘De Stijl’. For those who don’t know, De Stijl was a revolutionary art and design movement in the early 20th century (1917–1931) with artists like Mondrian and van Doesburg at the centre of it producing work that they saw as a reduction of form and colour choosing to mostly use vertical and horizontal shapes only using black, white and primary colours.
The exhibition itself covered these characteristics of the movement by showing these well known names tied to De Stijl — there was Piet Mondrian’s ‘Composition’ pieces and Gerrit Rietveld’s ‘Red and Blue Chair, these people built the aesthetic of the movement with the other pieces on show by artists and designers who have/had been inspired by them. There was Ellsworth Kelly with ‘Red Blue Rocker’ in the shape of a folded geometric circle. Roy Lichtenstein’s huge piece ‘As I Opened Fire’ a painting produced using the same reduced colour palette. Also here was a strong piece by the collective — General Idea called ‘Infe©ted Mondrian’ where they parodied the artist, copying the composition but replacing the yellow colour with a more toxic green to address the AIDS crisis which General Idea focused a lot of their work on and a comment on the dominance of De Stijl. The exhibition is part of a longer project marking 100 years of De Stijl and hopefully I can visit more of it as I see it as one of the great commanding art and design movements which is still prevalent today.
The next day we took the boat over the River IJ to NDSM, described as ‘a rugged shipyard to a creative hotspot’. The ‘creative city’ is a historical remainder of the largest shipyard in the city and has become a haven for all people interested in creativity and art with something for everyone to admire. What stood out to us was the main NDSM building/warehouse, now a hub for studios and restaurants; the outer walls still adorned with the original painted sign. The letters on the 2 sides read “Netherlands Shipbuilding Company’ and ‘Nederlandsche Dok en Scheepsbouw Maatschappij’ with each letter painted on heavily in white, with little consistency in letter styles but following some sort of grid. We were motivated to photograph the letters and digitise them to produce a display font with all of its inconsistency and variety as a homage to the building, as designers it was impossible for us to not look at this and be amazed and inspired.
We also found a great bar in the NDSM area — Pllek, built out of old shipping containers a huge glass window looking out onto the IJ and the cold Dutch winter air. We stayed here for a while, chatting and chilling. Drinking a few beers whilst some live music played. A really cool find and as the Dutch might say, it was ‘gezellig’.
I got the following Monday off work to continue our quest around the city and we ended up at the FOAM photography museum (Fotografiemuseum Amsterdam) to check out the Hiroshi Sugimoto exhibition — Black Box. An overview of the Japanese artist’s work which covered his major series. There was a lot of variety in what was on show but the works which really stood out to me were ‘Lightning Fields’ and ‘Theatres’ because of the processes which were used to make them. ‘Lightning Fields’ are images where there is no camera involved, they are made by channelling electricity over photo paper and exposing it. The marks left behind are incredible and the size of the prints makes for a visually strong image. ‘Theatres’ are a series of images where the artist photographed empty theatre halls, the exposure length of each photograph dictated by the length of a feature film, so each image is brighter or darker than the other. They create these ghostly like images of the room with a solid white image on the theatre screen which is almost sinister like to look into as you are surrounded by these images. The rest of the museum is also great as well as the inside of the building, it is one of the canal houses on the Keizersgracht and inside it is a series of winding rooms and dimly lit hallways: easy to get lost — which we did.
Finally throughout the few days we were walking around I had prepared a map that documents some of the great historical and innovative typographic signs that exist through the city. I was inspired by David Quay’s type tour with us back in the warm summer time in September and using these places as well as my own findings we wandered around as I pointed out these great relics, most of them with some story to tell.
My personal favourite was this piece by Dutch artist Piet Parra on the Tuinstraat. A huge wall mural near a school and kids park which reads: “Ik speel in de stad met alles wat er bestaat” — I play in the city with all that exists. I just love how the letters flow from one to the next and also Parra has a unique style which fits the city perfectly.

Entertaining conspiracy in the land of the one-eyed King.
Three cinema trips ago, and in the second week of October of a year that is ending just hours away from when I pen these brief words of appreciation, I was leaving my local cinema in the company of my beautiful son when I happened upon the above poster for Amsterdam and immediately remarked to all within earshot: this will be a stunner of a film. As is so often proved correct within my own particular one-eyed kingdom, I was indeed right, and director David O Russell’s tenth big screen cinematic affair was a conspiratorial treat. Not as accomplished perhaps as his 1999 epic Three Kings or Silver Linings Playbook over a decade later or my particular favourite in his cinematic cannon, 2013’s American Hustle, but I loved Amsterdam for a multitude of reasons and hopefully for differing and surprising reasons than your own.
Returning for just a moment to that film poster and my proclamation of its coming greatness as a film as my son and I ambled away from Halloween Ends in early October, whilst he was nonplussed by my soothsaying future review the cinema’s “Greeter” wasn’t as she confessed (a) she’d seen and loved an advance copy of the film and (b) she’d already bagged the poster I was referring to as she too liked it and as a perk of the job, she can buy any unreserved film posters for a knockdown price. I was of course envious as I’m a childish film fan at heart and am so often taken in by a good poster and so it was, finally, on 29th December in a year finishing in a mere few hours from now, that I watched Amsterdam expectantly awaiting a gem of a film that didn’t arrive but which was replaced by something wholly surprisingly and unexpectedly different.
Since seeing the film poster in early October I’d seen not a trailer nor a sneak peak or any written reviews whatsoever. I still haven’t. I watched this film without even the most basic of a premise or blurb which, according to The Matrix Movie Bible at www.imdb.com proclaims Amsterdam to be:
“In the 1930s, three friends witness a murder, are framed for it, and uncover one of the most outrageous plots in American history”.
Had I known this before time I would of course have been expecting the obvious real-life conspiracy being laid out before us and with the introduction of Robert De Niro in his notable cameo role, however it was even more pleasing for your humble narrator to call out this conspiracy ahead of cinematic time, way before the introduction of De Niro and way before those closing credits that rather soured the ending to an otherwise brilliantly engaging film.
Go see the credits for yourself. It’s all there for a one eye wishing to see.
But rather remarkably, arguably the greatest untold and unsaid conspiracy of all time is laid out within this gem of a film and should you be unaware of General Smedley Butler, his book “War is a Racket”, the request placed upon him to lead a Fascist revolution in the United States of America exactly a century ago or his multitude of revealing quotes attributed to him later in life, treat yourself to a real conspiracy in a world absent of them according to our Overlords in charge of the all seeing eye.
Five paragraphs in and not one word about the film? Par for my cinematic course. There are never any major spoilers here. Just a human reaction to an artform I revere like no other. But returning to the film poster once again and it’s a veritable who’s who and ensemble collection of character actors and actresses of our generation, all of whom produce intriguing, spirited and fiercely individual performances. In poster order we have Margot Robbie playing arguably a dual character if not definitely a dual personality as she flits from secretive war nurse to artist and much more in league with the love of her life, World War I veteran and now New York lawyer in the guise of John David Washington. Chris Rock is an awkwardly outspoken World War I veteran too and best friends with Washington whilst back in a New York of 1933 and fifteen years since the end of the Great War, we find Anya Taylor-Joy as a rather prissy and controlling wife of Rami Malek whilst Zoe Saldana excels as a medical examiner.
Pleasingly as well as perhaps unfairly, I saw the Mike Myers character of a British spy stepping right out of the Quentin Tarantino character created for him in 2009’s Inglourious Basterds and the screen time he shares with Michael Shannon’s American spy is a bizarre joy. Timothy Olyphant is a hitman. Andrea Riseborough a socially climbing and grasping estranged wife. Taylor Swift hangs up the singing microphone for a small cameo role and Matthias Schoenaerts and Alessandro Nivola complete the poster roll of acting talent as two ridiculously cartoonish bungling New York detectives.
Which just leaves your star of a conspiratorial show:
“Bert Berendsen” (Christian Bale) World War I veteran and now ostensibly a fringe outsider doctor and medical practitioner, Berendsen has seen the devastation of war and the human casualties he now tries in vain to treat. The carnage of human war is writ large on the returning veterans unable to stop shaking from what was termed then as “Shell Shock” but is now flowered and mired in the newspeak language of “Post Traumatic Stress Disorder”, but Berendsen is also somewhat of an expert in the art of facial and body disfigurement having lost and left an eye in France at the very end of the war. Forming a “pact” with the nurse who saved him and nursed him back to health (Margot Robbie as “Valerie Voze”) and his best friend and also recovering veteran (John David Washington as “Harold Woodman”), Berendsen breaks the pact to return to his medical calling in New York and the estranged wife from an estranged family who distrust him enormously.
As ever, Christian Bale is wonderful in a central role arguably only he or Sam Rockwell could truly play and pull off with such aplomb. Often framed with a querying and quizzical head tilt to the side and always with long, lingering shots on a character trying desperately to piece together the puzzle before him, David O Russell deserves enormous credit for writing such a character as well as guiding and directing him into life in league with Bale.
“A lot of this really happened”, so proclaims the very first frame of the film before we journey backward and forward, from 1930’s New York to France in 1918 and back again, as a tapestry is slowly woven around a huge cast of characters embroiled or otherwise in the greatest untold (and dare not spoken about) conspiracy of all time. There’s an arguable hero’s tale component to the story alongside the conspiracy but with heavy emphasis on the returning veterans I’m hoping the deliberately shocking human aftermath of war resonates deeply with everyone.
There’s a “Committee of 5” and “The Great Nation Society” and with a bending of the truth and some plot contrivances combining with a stellar cast, I rather enjoyed Amsterdam and recommend it to you.
Postscript
I first read about this Fascist coup to topple a sitting USA President to install a military dictatorship in the late 1990’s so it’s only taken a quarter of a century since then to arrive on the big cinema screen. I still haven’t seen or read any reviews of the film but I’d wager it gets panned. Big time!
I’d also wager than no-one of any mainstream substance brings up the conspiracy despite it’s centennial anniversary and the implications this may have had for the world at large.
But then again, conspiracies don’t exist, do they?
Silly me.
Thanks for reading. Just for larks as always, and always a human reaction rather than spoilers galore. My three most recently published film articles are linked below or there’s well over 100 blog articles (with 300+ individual film reviews) within my archives from which to choose:

*** Since the time of this writing, the laws around the Working Holiday Visa have changed. On October 1, 2018 the Dutch government decided to start cracking down on the types of work you can do with this visa, limiting it to incidental work (nothing full-time). This means that in order to move here and start working, you will unfortunately have to find a job that will sponsor a highly-skilled migrant visa. ***
A little bit of background
To give this post some context, I want to start with sharing some background on me and my story of moving to the Netherlands on the working holiday visa. My name is Dave, and I’m a 24 year old Canadian (or Canadese, according to my Dutch residency card) who moved from Toronto to Amsterdam in September, 2017 with my girlfriend Madi (also Canadese). Prior to moving, we were both living in Toronto and working in our first post-grad jobs. I was in sales at a software startup, and Madi was working in retail buying at the Hudson’s Bay Company.
Although we were really enjoying our lives in Toronto, we always shared the dream of living and working abroad ‘at some point’. What I started to realise as our time in Toronto progressed was that finding this ‘point’ was inevitably going to become more challenging. When would we both be at the same point in our careers where we would be comfortable with dropping everything and just leaving? Next thing you know, it’s 2, 3, 5 years later and all of your friends are getting married, buying houses etc. and the idea of moving just becomes too daunting. Life happens.
Luckily, the ‘point’ presented itself to Madi and I in spring of 2017. My company had just been acquired by a large tech company based in San Francisco, and many key members of the team were moving down to the US in the process (myself not included…damn Trump). Madi was already in between jobs at the time, so we decided that this was our chance. We decided we were moving. We didn’t know where at that point, but we’re not the type to overthink decisions when they feel right. So despite having little semblance of a plan and strategy, I gave my notice at work the next day.
Why I wanted to write this
During the months leading up to our move we spoke with a handful of fellow Canadians who had moved to Amsterdam in the past, but the conversations were always more focused on living in Amsterdam rather than practical tips for moving. This was because most of the people we spoke with had moved for jobs (aka they were sponsored on a highly skilled visa), so a lot of the immigration admin was taken care of by their respective companies and they were landing in a fairly comfortable position.
We are on the more adventurous/reckless side so we decided to quit our respective jobs in Toronto and take a leap of faith. Maybe we’re just lazy and didn’t do enough digging (actually, highly likely), but we found it disappointing that there was no ‘one stop shop’ post where we could find all of the common pitfalls to avoid. We vowed that once we had made our move and semi-settled we would document all of our mistakes on the world wide web in the hopes of saving someone else a bit of stress or a few bucks.
So, to be clear, this post is intended as a mini survival guide to help folks who are moving to the Netherlands without a job and taking advantage of the working holiday visa (although certain advice will be universal). We are also Canadian, so some of the immigration content is specific to that context.
These are the main mistakes that we made in the process. If you are in a similar situation to us and are planning on moving to Amsterdam, my hope is that you can avoid making the same ones.
TL;DR
Make them well in advance of your move!!! Ideally, do this before you book your flight to come here so that you can hit the ground running. You need two appointments:
Visa — this appointment is with the IND. It can be at any IND office in the Netherlands, so if you are on the phone with someone and they are saying there’s nothing in Amsterdam, ask them to check other cities. We ended up going out to Den Hague for ours (after a week of calling every day to check for cancellations) because we could get in about a month ahead of our scheduled appointment in Amsterdam.
Registration — the Dutch government likes to keep tabs on you, so before you can get a job and earn any money you need to register and get your BSN (of course it stands for Burger Service Number, welcome to Holland). You must schedule your registration appointment with the city that you plan on living in, so for this one you’re limited to a certain number of offices. If you’re moving with a job sponsorship, there’s a special office for you that I’m sure is efficient and lovely. If you’re a pleb like us, you will need to book your appointment at one of the Amsterdam city offices (see the list, here).
What we did….
Rather than dedicating some time and effort to visa research like any rational person would, Madi and I lollygagged around for the summer after quitting our jobs. We knew there were appointments, but we very naively assumed we could book them within two weeks of our flight. Our flight was September 6 and when I called for a registration appointment the earliest they had was October 18…
Get immigration documents organised ASAP
Start the process of legalising your birth certificate right now. For your registration appointment, you need a legalised birth certificate. This means that you have to physically send it to your federal government, they give it a thumbs up and a stamp, then you physically send it to the Dutch Embassy, and they also give it a thumbs up and a stamp. Fun process, right? You might even have to get a new birth certificate before starting the stamping process, but double check that for your case. More about this here.
What I did….
When I finally got around to serious research regarding Dutch immigration (two weeks before our flight), I figured out that we needed to do this. It was one of many, ‘Oh fuck’ moments in my research phase. We ended up having to get special birth certificates issued for this purpose, and express ship them to a service in Ottawa (capital of Canada) that specialised in this kind of thing. They physically took them to these offices in Ottawa for us and got the stamps and express shipped them back. This is who we used. Of course because you are in a tight spot and they know it they absolutely hose you on price, I think with shipping and everything we spent $500+ getting two pieces of paper stamped.
Have a place to stay
When you land in Amsterdam, you’re going to want to have a place to stay set up. The last thing you’re going to want to do after a long-haul flight is carry your bags around from door-to-door. Ideally, you can find a relatively cheap Airbnb or hostel room. Then once you’re here you can explore the city a little bit and hit the Facebook groups hard looking for a longer term room or apartment rental in a good neighborhood.
What I did…..
In this case, we totally lucked out, and it probably saved out entire move from turning into a complete flop. About a month before we moved Madi and I were introduced to a couple at a summer BBQ who had lived in Amsterdam for 25+ years and knew a ton of people here. They then connected us with a couple who happened to have an empty garden house that they offered for us to stay in when we arrived. Looking back, I wonder what we would have done if this intro didn’t surface. It was another one of those really important things that we were taking the ‘ignorance is bliss’ approach to. Oh well, sometimes things just work out!
Start looking for jobs
The Dutch hire slow because it’s way harder to fire people here than in North America. It’s not uncommon to go through 3–5 interviews before receiving an offer, which takes a long time if you’re doing 1 interview per week. So it’s important to start conversations early and set yourself up for success when you move.
Set up a few Amsterdam job alerts for the type of role you will be looking for when you land. If you have a good idea of what you will be looking for, I would try to sort that out and get a focus before moving.
I think the best place to start is LinkedIn, and you could add in Angelist if you’re looking for a role at a startup. Make sure your resume is up to date* and start proactively applying or direct messaging people at companies you find interesting and get a conversation started. You will probably have a hard time getting to a job offer from abroad, but at least you can get some coffee chats lined up for when you arrive.
* Make sure your location is Amsterdam, otherwise people might be confused as to why you’re applying. The Dutch also include their DOB/age in the info section.
Shamelessly ask for connections
Leverage your network to source some connections. We found that when people found out we were making such a radical move they really went the extra mile to introduce us to anyone they knew in Amsterdam. Some of them were super random, but you never know who’s going to know someone who knows someone that has an awesome place they’re renting out for super cheap…
TL;DR
Get a bike
Do this your first or second day in Amsterdam. As you will see, it’s the way people get everywhere here. Once you have a bike, the city totally opens up and no place is more than 15–20 minutes away. Bikes also get stolen like crazy here, so I would advise getting a fairly cheap second hand one to start. You will see a TON of options if you put ‘bike shops’ into Google Maps, or you can try the Waterlooplein flea market (more here). I got mine there and paid 90 euro with two locks included. Swapfiets is another great bike membership service that is totally hassle-free, which Madi joined after her first bike got stolen.
Get a prepaid SIM
Another day one task. Connectivity is super key; you’re going to need plenty of Google Maps to navigate this semi-circle city. Pop into any Vodafone or Tele2 store and grab a prepaid sim card. You can get them pretty cheap, I think we had 3 GB of data and 30 minutes of calling for 20 euro per month.
You’ll need to keep renewing your prepaid for at least 3 months because of a funny rule. To prevent fraud, phone companies here don’t let you set up an auto-renew phone plan until you have had a Dutch bank account for at least 3 months. So that means you need to a) get your BSN, b) open a bank account, and c) wait 3 months from that day to get a real phone plan. Oh, the Dutch and their systems…
Make Chrome your default browser
While we are on the note of phones, I would highly recommend setting Chrome as your default web browser on your computer and mobile. Chrome will auto-translate Dutch sites for you, which is really helpful when you’re exploring and trying to find business hours etc. If it’s not auto-translating, you should be able to toggle that feature on in settings.
Hustle for a job
Once you are boots on the ground it’s time to start networking pretty aggressively. I would recommend dedicating a few hours a day to putting in job applications and continuing to message people and set up conversations.
In addition, you can now start hitting up networking events and making in-person intros. There are quite a few on the Meetup app, which is pretty popular here. You can also check the websites for the coworking spaces* in town to see what they have going on.
*TQ, Impact Hub and WeWork are great places to start looking.
I personally went the more traditional route as I find networking events pretty painful. I focused on applying/messaging on LinkedIn and the intros I had received from friends, former colleagues etc. I ended up getting my current job from a cold email I had sent before moving. It took a while to materialize (about 3 months), but 5 interviews later I got an offer!
Get a bank account (I recommend ING)
A lot of grocery stores and certain checkout lines don’t take cash, so it’s important to set up a bank account quickly for convenience. NOTE: You must have already done your immigration appointments and have your BSN to open up an account.
Dutch service is terrible in general, but I was pretty shocked when we went to set up bank accounts here. We went into three ABN AMRO branches and they all told us we needed to book an appointment for one or two weeks later. They were literally pushing our business away.
The first ING we walked into (located here), we went right up to the counter and opened up two accounts within 15 minutes. Now, that was probably partly because they were experiencing a lull in the day, but I find everything about ING more pleasant. Their website is in Dutch, but they have a great app in English. We haven’t had any trouble with them so far.
We’re creeping up on the 5 month mark in Amsterdam now. Overall, we’re loving the city. There are still moments where I’m biking around and I have to remind myself that we actually live here now. The architecture and people are so unique and quintessentially European that it can feel quite surreal.
We scored an awesome 3-month rental that we found on this Facebook group. January 2018 marks our final month in this current rental, and we are moving into another 3-month rental (a houseboat!!!) that we found on the Facebook marketplace. Facebook is a great place to look for rentals to avoid paying fees, but you really have to be on it and persistent to beat out the competition. After this next rental, we are hoping to settle into a longer-term place in the Oud-West area.
I am 2 months in to my job here at a local startup and really enjoying it, and Madi is in some really promising conversations with a few creative agencies here. She was offered a job around the same time that I got mine, but decided to hold out for something that felt like a better fit.
Now we’ve transitioned into the phase where we’re settling into a routine, trying to make new friends, and planning our next weekend trip around Europe ;)
We’ve just crossed the year mark in the Netherlands, and this post is now the first thing on Google when you search ‘Canadian moving to Amsterdam’. The internet’s pretty cool.
We’re settling in for our second winter here, currently in a long term apartment in the Westerpark area. We’re both working full time in central Amsterdam, and have agreed that we probably have one of the most picturesque commutes in the world. Luckily, my work has sponsored me on the highly skilled visa (and Madi as a registered partner) so we’re in the clear deportation-wise. One thing that has come up a few times from people reaching out about this article is the ability to work for the same company beyond 12 weeks on the working holiday program. In my case, I had no issue with this, but I have heard of a few people running into some trouble. My advice would be to make sure that the companies you’re talking to are cool with bringing you on with that visa and there won’t be any surprises down the line. You should also make sure to discuss the eventual move to the highly skilled visa.
If you have any further questions about moving to the Netherlands (from Canada), or you just want someone to grab a beer with once you’re here, please respond to this article in the comments!

I have never seriously considered the expat life: I’m too fond of deep-fried foods and the convenience of driving to supermarkets that sell everything I need. But after spending four days in Amsterdam, I may have to reconsider my attachment to American soil. Amsterdam is without a doubt the most beautiful city I’ve ever seen — I think it’s even more picturesque than Paris. Almost every street is divided by a canal dotted with houseboats, and the brightly colored buildings with tall windows lean gracefully over the streets and canals. Bridges are sprinkled with flower boxes, and the scent of flowers, food, and other herbs wafts into the streets.
I stayed about 30 minutes outside of the city at Lucky Lake Hostel on Lake Vinkeveen. Lucky Lake is more than just a hostel: it is a community, where travelers from all over the world eat breakfast together in a converted bus, kayak the lake together, or unwind at night together in the lounge. Painted camper trailers, small cabins, tents, and hammocks form a ring around the property, with a block of gender-neutral showers and toilets (those absurdly progressive Dutch!) in the center, campground-style. Staff members or guests cook big dinners every night in the outdoor kitchen, and anyone can chip in for a share of the food. Guests and staff actually hang out in the lounge at night to play cards or the guitar, creating a sense of community that many hostels advertise but very few actually deliver. It was truly the experience of a lifetime.
The lake was a three-minute walk from my camper door. On my first day, I joined a couple of friends I made on the shuttle and rented kayaks for €3/hour to explore the waters. We paddled our way through a maze of canals and tiny houses with tinier boats until we reached the lake. The water was so clear you could almost see the bottom, and we saw more sailboats and kayaks than motorboats.
Later that day, I decided to take the hostel shuttle into the city to walk around and see what I could discover. I found that the Dutch way of life is perhaps the most relaxed in the world: they grow tulips and marijuana, ride bicycles, and eat fresh cheese and chocolate-covered waffles. All the people I met were very laid-back and pleasant, even more so than the Belgians. So that’s why the Dutch are consistently recognized as the happiest people in the world!
Amsterdam is truly a city of bicycles. It has more bicycles than people and more bike lanes than streets. It’s very pleasant to hear the tinkle of thousands of bells and to see so many people cycling their way through the city (it must be the Dutch secret to staying fit despite eating lots of waffles). Pro tip: don’t walk in the bike lanes! I was crossing a bike lane when I saw this really cool Dutch bookstore out of the corner of my eye. I decided midway across the street to check it out and changed direction, only to collide into a passing bicycle. My phone flew out of my hands across the street, and my body scraped its way along the cobblestones until I ended up on my side. The cyclist, who was only a few years older than I am, had fallen off his bike, and he rushed over to help me up. He very kindly checked me for any injuries and even recommended the bookstore when he heard what had distracted me. I guess Dutch amicability knows no bounds.
My friends know that I am somewhat of a crazy cat lady, and Amsterdam definitely provided the feline interaction I’ve missed on my travels. I visited De Poezenboot (“The Catboat”), a floating cat sanctuary on one of Amsterdam’s canals. The lovely houseboat is home to dozens of stray cats who have learned to love living on the water. For someone like me who misses her own cats dearly, it’s positively sublime to visit a place where I can play with friendly cats for as long as I like. Later, I toured KattenKabinet, a museum specializing in artwork featuring cats. They have paintings by artists such as Rembrandt and Manet, as well as sculptures and posters by less famous artists. They even have a couple of real cats hanging around the museum for artistic inspiration!
Normally I would save my culinary experiences for a food post, but I have to rave about the food in Amsterdam. My diet consisted mostly of cheese and waffles: needless to say, I was well-satisfied. There is a cheese shop selling fresh local cheese on almost every corner in Amsterdam, and the best part is that they all offer free samples! I wandered from shop to shop, trying slices of every cheese and every fig spread offered. I literally made a meal out of free cheese samples.
The Dutch are famed for their stroopwafels, which are thin waffles cemented together by caramel syrup. They sound delicious, and I’m a little ashamed to say that I never tried one. My sweet-tooth hopelessly indulged in the perhaps less-authentic but more delectable chocolate-covered waffles.
Oh. My. God. I may never be able to eat at Waffle House again after feasting on these things. I ate one every day: chocolate-covered waffles, white chocolate-covered waffles, caramel-covered waffles. So many waffles, and so much tastebud explosion. They were usually topped with yummy things like marshmallows, butterscotch chips, or Oreos, too.
Whether you like amazing food, beautiful rural countryside, or a charming and vibrant city with flowers everywhere, Amsterdam will take your breath away. It is easily my favorite city so far. We’ll see if it can be surpassed by my next stop — Berlin!

Today is the beginning of my month-long, Amazing Amsterdam Adventure.
I will be on my own this month, and I have decided to pretend I am a tourist who managed to find a beautiful apartment in Amsterdam for a month.
The first day of my fakecation began appropriately with transportation challenges. I helped my daughter and family get to the train station, and it was a bit more challenging than anticipated to get all those bikes and the dog across town to Central station, never mind onto a train.
I left them outside and then got very lost on my way home — at one point, my GPS tried to send me into the canal. Fortunately, I made it to the apartment. Now, after a hard day of traveling, I am beginning this adventure.
I hope you join me.
You can read more about my plans in the piece below.

Amsterdam had been in my dreams for a long, long time. The trip was something I started planning and preparing for months before it actually happened. Last week, I finally visited the city, and it took my breath away.
Getting to Amsterdam from the Schiphol airport (AMS) is fast and effortless: you can ride a bus (€6 and 15 minutes to the Amstelveen bus station) or a train (€4.30 and 20 mins to Amsterdam Centraal), or take an Uber (€20–25 and roughly 15 minutes).
The place I lived at is located not in Amsterdam itself, but in the suburban town of Amstelveen. The moment I got off the bus, I was astonished by the quiet and peaceful neighborhoods of Amstelveen. As I was going to find out later, the whole town is just like that: filled with two- to three-story houses, divided by narrow streets, and with bike lanes on every single street.
I arrived on October 31st, which gave me a chance to see how Amstelveeners celebrate Halloween (if they even do). What I saw gave me a sense of community in Amstelveen: people dress up their houses with fake spider webs, carve pumpkins, and place baskets with candies outside so that anyone (primarily kids) can have them whenever they want.
If goes without saying that local grocery stores had bunch of Halloween food, like these “pumpkin” profiteroles.
Another thing that indicated strong community in Amstelveen was the leisure center (called Randwijck Markt) which doubles as a coworking area in the daytime and a club in the evening, where residents gather to share stories, sing, and discuss town matters. A nice lady who works there invited me to see what’s inside and have a cup of coffee, but I had things to do, so I politely declined the invitation.
Moving on to Amsterdam itself, the first time I saw the city was through the subway train’s window. Train 51 can take you from the suburban town of Amstelveen to Amsterdam Centraal (Central Station) in about 20 minutes. You see, Amsterdam is not a big city, compared to Rome or Paris.
As you approach the downtown, you first travel through business districts with a lot of office buildings that have names of well-known companies sparkling on their roofs. I haven’t been to those districts, so it’s hard to tell what it feels like to work in Amsterdam.
The city core looks and feels just like in the photos I’d seen on the web before the trip.
Amsterdam Centraal is the starting point for many Amsterdam visitors.
Like Venice, Amsterdam is divided by countless canals. Unlike Venice, those canals don’t show up in random places-there’s certain logic: just compare the map of Amsterdam with the one of Venice.
Dull and rainy days are a usual thing for the city.
Amsterdam’s architectural style appeals to me.
The city is absolutely full of bike riders. They’re everywhere, and sometimes it gets pretty dangerous, especially if you’re not used to them sneaking all around.
If I were asked to name a city that offers the best selection of food, I’d undoubtedly name Amsterdam. Compared to all the places I’ve visited over the past couple of years, Amsterdam gives you the biggest choice of different styles and cuisines. From traditional burgers-and-fries fast food to pizza to Turkish doner to spiciest Asian dishes-Amsterdam’s got you covered.
Amsterdam houses many museums and other points of interest: from the Rijksmuseum to the Anne Frank Huis to the Torture Museum to the Museum of Prostitution.
Museumplein (Museum square) is located between three museums: the Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum, and Stedelijk Museum.
Nightlife in Amsterdam is as various as the city’s food. The infamous Red-light district (De Wallen) houses countless bars, clubs, and brothels (although the latter looked like a joke).
Amsterdam’s Vondelpark is one of the largest and best-known parks in the city. It’s a classic public park, as seen in most other cities I’ve been to. And yes, it has bike riders everywhere.
Street art is not rare to see, even in remote neighborhoods.
And in the evening, the city appears in a whole new light (literally).
Amsterdam showed itself to be a comfortable city for living, with plenty of opportunities for leisure and entertainment, and various work options (at least if you work in IT). If I had to choose between living in the city of Amsterdam and the suburbs, I’d probably opt for the latter for its quiet streets (once again, I’m not a fan of big cities).

I decided I’ll write a bit about the two cities I just visited during my French school break, partially because my British friend Matt (shoutout number three if he’s counting!) encouraged me to keep writing about urban planning. So here I am.
Amsterdam is very interesting with its urban planning — some might call it “the Mecca” of urban planning because of how idealized it is by many urbanists. The most popular urbanism YouTube channel is Not Just Bikes, who moved to Amsterdam because of its reputation. But what is it really like?
I would imagine the tourist experience is much different from the habitant experience, even more than other cities. This is because while the prioritization of biking is helpful for locals, it can be difficult for a newbie to get a handle on. As you walk around the city, there can be so much to look out for as a pedestrian. Watch out for the bikes! Watch out for the tram! Watch out for the cars! It’s a complex ecosystem, and if you aren’t paying attention, it can be easily overwhelming.
I did love the trams in Amsterdam’s city center. Metros can go faster underground, but the experience of a tram above ground, where you can simply hop on and look out the window at the city, is delightful. However, I noticed that the trams and metro have a tap-in and tap-out system, which I’m not a fan of. In New York, you use your ticket to get on the subway, but you can get off wherever you want and you do not have to rescan the ticket. This is much easier for riders. My friends and I were sometimes scrambling to take out our ticket again and rescan to exit the train.
I get the sense that in Venice people actually use their canals for transportation, but in Amsterdam this does not seem to be the case. There are tours on the canal, but not a lot of regular folks using the canal to navigate the city. The bikes are everywhere. I don’t know how I underestimated the number of bikes when I knew how bike-crazy Amsterdam is, but I underestimated them.
There are a few things I prefer about Paris, a place I’ve been to many times and am more familiar with. The sidewalks are wider in Paris than in Amsterdam. There are also a lot more terraces/outdoor seating in Paris, which is always welcoming and enjoyable for tourists and locals. Amsterdam’s meager outdoor seating was always just a few tables outside, whereas in Paris there can be huge terraces with many tables for people to simply plop down and order a coffee. Relaxed café culture in France is simply unbeatable. In comparison, with its smaller streets and a lack of outside seating, Amsterdam is always keeping things moving. It’s a faster pace but it’s also exciting and keeps you turning down the next corner.
There are a few key neighborhoods in Amsterdam. The 9 Streets neighborhood is very beautiful with varying architecture and canal views, but much of the ground floor establishments were expensive shops. Again, I would’ve liked an outdoor café to sit and take things in rather than feeling like I couldn’t linger. I found the Jordaan neighborhood to be more residential (I could literally look into rich people’s houses because of their big, open windows) but just as architecturally interesting. The Red Light District felt the most touristy. It’s really just one street, a couple blocks long, with sex workers in the windows and “cinemas.” We walked up and down it once, but there wasn’t much for our group to do there.
Athens has a few popular neighborhoods as well — Plaka and Psyri. I found Plaka to be touristy in some parts and desolate in others. Maybe this is just my experience. I really liked Psyri — I had multiple meals in that area and found something going on down every street. Cars in Athens are interesting — they attempt to go down any street they can fit in. I was sitting outside at a café and a car squeezed through the small street less than two feet away from me. There is a lack of signaled crosswalks in Athens. Most of the time people just cross the street whenever possible through traffic. That is less than ideal.
But I would not say Athens isn’t walkable. I walked all over the city center while I was there and only took the metro a few times to get to faraway locations. When I did take the metro, it was fairly reliable but not the cleanest. One thing I did like about the Athens metro was that they had signs showing which direction the escalators were going so that you could easily navigate where you needed to go to get out. I haven’t seen that in a metro before, but it was helpful.
Athens is the furthest south I’ve been in Europe and the sunshine was welcome after months of rainy winter in France. One thing I noticed is all of the solar panels! Many apartment buildings had multiple solar panels at the top, maybe 6 feet long by 4 feet wide. In contrast, when I took the Eurostar train to Amsterdam, I noticed that Belgium and the Netherlands had a lot of wind turbines. Northern part of Europe, more wind, it makes sense.
This was a great trip with two cities I really wanted to see this year, so I’m proud of myself and feeling very fulfilled.

A City of Surprises and Endless Possibilities.
No city compares to Amsterdam’s diversity. Every time I visit, I discover something new that I never knew existed. It’s like joining an adventure each time, with surprises waiting around every corner.
And I love it.
This year, I’ve had the opportunity to visit Amsterdam two times, and each experience has been unique each time.
The first visit was with my family. We were a large group, which made it challenging to please everyone. So, my daughter and I quickly decided to return on our own. (So we did, a couple of weeks later).
During our first visit to Amsterdam, we decided to play tourists. And what better place is there than to visit The Royal Palace?
This palace is best known for being where the King and Queen of the Netherlands stand and wave to the people on various occasions.

Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, is renowned for its picturesque canals, historical buildings, and vibrant cultural life. With such a rich history, it is a place I have found stunning. However, its urban planning and architecture have evolved significantly over the past century, balancing preserving historical charm and embracing modern sustainability principles. This intricate dance has led to notable successes and challenges in creating thriving communities harmonizing with the city's natural geography and cultural ethos.
Amsterdam’s urban planning has always been influenced by its unique geography. The city’s layout, characterized by concentric canals known as the “Grachtengordel,” was initially designed in the 17th century during the Dutch Golden Age. This historic planning emphasized functionality and aesthetics, creating a beautiful and practical cityscape. However, as the city grew, new challenges emerged, requiring innovative solutions to accommodate a growing population while preserving the area's historical integrity.
In the 20th century, Amsterdam faced significant urban development pressures. The post-war period saw a surge in modernist architecture, focusing on efficiency and functionality. However, this often came at the expense of the city’s historical character. The construction of high-rise buildings and large-scale infrastructure projects sometimes clashed with the traditional low-rise, dense urban fabric that defined Amsterdam.
One of Amsterdam’s significant successes in urban planning has been integrating modern sustainable practices with historical preservation. The city has implemented policies prioritizing the adaptive reuse of old buildings, converting them into modern residential and commercial spaces while maintaining their historical façades. This approach not only preserves the city’s cultural heritage but also reduces the environmental impact of new construction.
Amsterdam’s Eastern Docklands is a shining example of how thoughtful urban planning can transform an industrial area into a vibrant, sustainable community. Once a bustling hub for maritime trade, the docklands fell into disuse by the mid-20th century, leaving vast expanses of derelict land. The redevelopment of this area in the late 20th and early 21st centuries showcases how innovative urban planning can successfully integrate historical elements with modern living requirements.
The Eastern Docklands project began in the 1980s to convert the obsolete industrial space into a mixed-use residential and commercial district. Unlike the high-rise developments in other parts of the world, the Eastern Docklands favored medium-rise buildings, typically between 3 to 7 stories, which complemented the traditional Amsterdam skyline. This approach ensured that new developments did not overshadow the historical city center and preserved the human-scale urban fabric characteristic of Amsterdam.
The planning process was highly inclusive, involving architects, urban planners, and the community. The result was a series of distinct neighborhoods, each with its unique architectural style yet harmoniously integrated into the overall urban landscape. The Borneo-Sporenburg area, for example, features innovative row houses with private gardens and public spaces that encourage social interaction. The Java and KNSM islands blend modern architecture with maritime heritage, creating visually striking and functionally diverse neighborhoods.
One of the critical successes of the Eastern Docklands redevelopment is its emphasis on sustainability and community-oriented design. Green roofs, solar panels, and energy-efficient building practices are standard in the new constructions, significantly reducing the area's environmental footprint. Public spaces, parks, and waterways were carefully integrated into the design, providing residents with ample recreational opportunities and enhancing the area’s aesthetic appeal.
The docklands’ design also prioritizes walkability and cycling, aligning with Amsterdam’s broader commitment to sustainable urban mobility. Extensive cycling paths and pedestrian-friendly streets encourage residents to use bicycles and walk, reducing reliance on cars and contributing to a healthier, more connected community.
Furthermore, the Eastern Docklands redevelopment incorporated a mix of housing types, including affordable housing units, to ensure a diverse population. This inclusivity fosters a vibrant community where people from different socio-economic backgrounds can live, work, and socialize.
The success of the Eastern Docklands redevelopment lies in its holistic approach to urban planning. By respecting the area’s historical context, prioritizing sustainability, and involving the community in the planning process, the project has created a thriving, dynamic district that serves as a model for urban redevelopment worldwide. The docklands have become a sought-after residential area known for its quality of life, architectural innovation, and harmonious integration of the old and new.
The lessons learned from the Eastern Docklands can be applied to other urban redevelopment projects. Emphasizing mixed-use developments, sustainable practices, and community involvement are critical strategies for transforming underutilized areas into vibrant urban spaces. As cities worldwide grapple with sustainability and urban growth issues, the Eastern Docklands is a testament to what can be achieved through thoughtful, inclusive urban planning.
Another success story is the city’s extensive cycling infrastructure, which has been integrated into urban planning to reduce car dependency and promote a healthier lifestyle. Amsterdam’s network of bike paths and cycle-friendly policies have made it one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world, significantly lowering urban pollution and enhancing the quality of life for its residents.
Brandevoort, a neighborhood in the Dutch city of Helmond, is a remarkable example of modern urban planning that successfully integrates traditional architectural styles with contemporary living standards. Designed to resemble a conventional Dutch village, Brandevoort blends the charm and aesthetics of historical townscapes with the functionality and sustainability required for modern urban living. This neighborhood has become a benchmark for new urbanism in the Netherlands, illustrating how thoughtful design can foster a sense of community and enhance the quality of life.
The development of Brandevoort began in the late 1990s with a clear vision: to create a new residential area that respects and reflects the rich architectural heritage of the Netherlands. The planners and architects drew inspiration from historical Dutch towns, incorporating features such as narrow streets, gabled roofs, and picturesque canals. This traditional aesthetic fosters a sense of familiarity and belonging among residents, attracting visitors who appreciate its quaint charm.
However, Brandevoort is not just about replicating the past; it seamlessly integrates modern sustainability practices into its design. The neighborhood includes energy-efficient buildings, green spaces, and robust infrastructure for cycling and walking, reducing reliance on cars. Using sustainable materials and renewable energy sources further underscores the commitment to creating an environmentally friendly community. These efforts not only enhance the quality of life for residents but also contribute to broader environmental goals.
One of the standout features of Brandevoort is its focus on fostering a strong sense of community. The layout of the neighborhood encourages social interaction and community engagement. Central squares, local shops, schools, and recreational facilities are strategically placed within walking distance for most residents, promoting a vibrant regional economy and a close-knit community atmosphere.
Integrating mixed-use buildings allows for a blend of residential, commercial, and recreational spaces, ensuring Brandevoort remains lively throughout the day. This mix of functions supports local businesses and provides residents convenient access to amenities, reducing the need for long commutes and encouraging local engagement.
Moreover, Brandevoort’s urban design includes a variety of housing types to accommodate different demographics, from young families to retirees. This diversity enhances the community's social fabric, making it a dynamic and inclusive place to live.
Brandevoort’s success lies in its ability to harmonize the old with the new, creating a nostalgic and forward-thinking community. The neighborhood’s design principles offer valuable lessons for urban planners and developers. Brandevoort demonstrates that modern urban developments can be functional and beautiful by prioritizing sustainability, community, and aesthetics.

Despite these successes, Amsterdam has faced challenges and failures in its urban planning journey. One of the significant issues has been the tension between development and preservation. The drive for modernization and expansion sometimes led to the demolition of historically substantial buildings, sparking public outcry and resistance. For instance, the construction of the Bijlmermeer, a high-rise housing project in the 1960s, was initially hailed as a modernist triumph but soon became a symbol of urban failure due to poor design and social isolation.
The Bijlmermeer, commonly known as Bijlmer, was conceived in the 1960s as a utopian vision of modern living in Amsterdam. Designed by architect Siegfried Nassuth, Bijlmer was planned as a high-rise residential area to embody modernist architecture and urban planning ideals. Its innovative hexagonal layout and extensive green spaces aim to provide a harmonious, efficient, and socially integrated environment. However, the reality diverged sharply from these aspirations, leading to challenges and failures that ultimately transformed Bijlmer from a symbol of modern utopia to one of urban dystopia.
The design of Bijlmer was heavily influenced by the principles of Le Corbusier and the modernist movement, which emphasized clean lines, functional living spaces, and the separation of different urban functions. The area was planned with a clear distinction between pedestrian and vehicular traffic, vast open spaces, and high-density residential blocks meant to foster a strong sense of community. The high-rise buildings were intended to provide spacious apartments with ample natural light and views of the surrounding greenery.
Despite its innovative design, Bijlmer faced significant challenges from the outset. The timing of its construction coincided with changing housing preferences in the Netherlands. By the time Bijlmer’s first residents moved in during the late 1960s and early 1970s, there was a growing preference for low-rise, single-family homes over high-rise apartments. This shift in housing demand led to difficulties in attracting residents to Bijlmer.
Moreover, the social and economic composition of Bijlmer’s population deviated from the planners’ expectations. Initially intended to attract middle-class families, the area became home to a diverse population, including many immigrants and low-income households. The high concentration of disadvantaged groups, coupled with a lack of adequate social infrastructure and employment opportunities, contributed to social isolation and economic hardship.
Initially praised for its innovation, the architectural design soon revealed several practical flaws. While theoretically ideal for community building, the vast, monotonous concrete structures often felt impersonal and alienating. The separation of pedestrian pathways from road traffic, though meant to enhance safety, resulted in labyrinthine walkways breeding grounds for crime and vandalism. The large open spaces, initially envisioned as communal areas, needed to be more utilized and better maintained, further contributing to a sense of neglect and decay.
Maintenance issues exacerbated these problems. The sheer scale of the high-rise buildings made upkeep expensive and challenging. As the area aged, the lack of proper maintenance led to deteriorating living conditions, with frequent reports of broken elevators, water leaks, and general disrepair. This decline in the physical environment mirrored the social challenges, reinforcing a negative feedback loop that further stigmatized the area.
Bijlmer’s failure can be attributed to a combination of design flaws, changing social dynamics, and inadequate planning for the socioeconomic realities of its residents. The high-rise utopia envisioned by its planners did not account for the human need for more intimate, human-scale environments. The grand, impersonal architecture failed to foster the sense of community it aimed for, leading instead to social isolation and alienation.
Extensive redevelopment efforts were undertaken in the 1990s and 2000s in response to these challenges. Many of the original high-rise buildings were demolished and replaced with low-rise housing, and significant investments were made in improving infrastructure, public spaces, and social services. These efforts aimed to address the underlying issues of social segregation and economic disparity while preserving some elements of the original vision.
The story of Bijlmer offers critical lessons for urban planners and architects. It underscores the importance of flexibility in urban design, the need to adapt to changing social preferences, and the necessity of integrating social and economic planning with architectural innovation. Bijlmer’s experience highlights that successful urban environments must balance visionary design with practical, human-centered considerations. As Amsterdam continues to evolve, the lessons from Bijlmer’s ambitious but flawed experiment serve as a cautionary tale and a guiding framework for future developments.
Social engineering in urban planning, particularly during the mid-20th century, often led to the creation of monolithic housing estates that did not cater to the social and cultural needs of the residents. These projects sometimes resulted in social segregation and failed to create cohesive communities.
Today, Amsterdam’s urban planning is guided by sustainability, inclusivity, and community engagement principles. The city moves from top-down social engineering approaches towards more participatory planning processes. This shift recognizes the importance of working with nature and local communities to optimize urban living.
Modern projects focus on enhancing green spaces, improving public transportation, and creating mixed-use developments that combine residential, commercial, and recreational spaces. For example, the Zuidas district, also known as the “Financial Mile,” is being developed as a mixed-use area with a strong emphasis on green buildings and sustainable infrastructure.
Amsterdam’s urban planning reflects a delicate balance between preserving historical character and embracing modernity. By prioritizing sustainable practices and community-oriented development, the city continues to evolve in a way that respects its rich heritage while addressing contemporary needs. This approach ensures that Amsterdam remains a vibrant, livable city that harmonizes with its natural and cultural environment.

I spent 3 days and 2 nights in Amsterdam.
I really do think anyone can enjoy travelling on a budget without it being extremely restrictive as long as you have a plan in place. In my opinion, Amsterdam is an extremely beautiful city, definitely much more expensive than some other cities in Europe eg Berlin, Prague, and Dublin but it is nonetheless worth a visit.
The iconic buildings, riverbanks and bridges make it truly picturesque. The buildings in some streets remain a protected UNESCO world heritage.
Here is basically what I did and how much I spent:
Flight: Ryan air — €38 (Dublin to Amsterdam). Quite a steal if you ask me.
Breakfast: Breakfast at the airport — €19.25
Train to the city: €5.7 (Amsterdam Schiphol Airport to Amsterdam City Centre which is around a 30 minutes journey)

Earlier this week Bloomberg published an article about a meeting of multiple cities in Amsterdam last month “to forge an alliance in response to Airbnb and Uber.” This headline misses the mark; it is both misleading and glosses over what actually happened. I should know: I was at the meeting.
The Global Sharing Cities Roundtable was conceived by the City of Amsterdam several months ago, as an opportunity for cities who are leading efforts to understand and promote the sharing economy worldwide. Participant cities ranged from Seoul, whose Sharing City initiative dates back to 2012 and includes everything from a city-owned space sharing platform to investment of public funds in more than 50 sharing economy initiatives, to Copenhagen, whose sharing economy strategy is linked to its goals for sustainability and the circular economy. Of course, Amsterdam played a leading role — as Europe’s first self-declared sharing city, home to numerous sharing economy enterprises and a fresh approach to policy reform.
Airbnb and Uber were discussed at the roundtable. But to be clear: the roundtable was not “about” them. The purpose of the roundtable was for cities to meet each other — the overwhelming majority of them had never been in contact before — and to engage in blue-sky thinking about the sharing economy’s potential.
True, Amsterdam’s innovative approach to policy reform for homesharing and short-term rentals was one topic discussed, due to popular demand by other cities. But it was only one topic. Dozens of other topics were also part of the agenda. Ridesharing and ridehailing were another popular topic, though ironically Uber itself barely came up. Rather, more time was spent on brainstorming how the sharing economy can link with waste reduction initiatives, serve to rethink delivery of public services, engage youth and elderly, and potentially help tackle a wide range of other social problems for cities worldwide. The Bloomberg article misses the mark in failing to detail — or even acknowledge — this much broader agenda.
I was honored to be invited as the only non-city employee. (For full disclosure, I have advised several of the cities in attendance.) Bloomberg reached out to interview me but did not follow through in doing so. Meanwhile, none of the people quoted in the interview were at the meeting. With all due respect, this falls short of what I would expect from one of the world’s most esteemed publications.
The sharing economy is about much, much more than Airbnb or Uber. We should know that. It is extremely frustrating to see the media focus disproportionately on what is but one piece of a much larger pie. It is increasingly easy to single out one or two companies, but by doing so, we are missing the forest for the trees — and missing a much bigger opportunity.

Not long ago, I found myself in Amsterdam — one of those “I need a break, but let’s call it inspiration” kind of trips. I was wandering along a canal with a ridiculously good coffee from a tiny cafe that looked like it had been decorated by someone who really loved vintage postcards and didn’t believe in chairs that match. I wasn’t thinking about work. Or at least I told myself I wasn’t.
At some point, I was standing at a crosswalk near Jordaan, watching bicycles zip past — one woman riding no-handed, coffee in one hand, phone in the other, somehow gliding through this chaotic mess of tourists and trams like it was nothing. And I just stood there, kind of stunned by how everything was working. No signs, no instructions, no one directing the flow. Just people navigating it together independently, but weirdly in sync. I don’t know why, but it made me think of AI agents and the way they should work — fluid, reactive, quietly doing their thing without being micromanaged.
If you’ve ever watched Amsterdam cyclists at rush hour, it’s like a ballet — chaotic but balanced. Dozens of people moving independently, but somehow in harmony. There are no detailed instructions, no central planner shouting orders, and yet everyone knows where they’re going and how to get there.
That’s exactly how we should think about AI agents — not as rule-bound bots waiting for step-by-step commands, but as autonomous systems capable of interpreting vague goals and getting things done. Rather than telling them exactly what to do, you provide a clear objective, like “Draft a user-friendly changelog from these commits”, “Find three good flights next Friday that don’t land before 10am” or “Clean up this spreadsheet and flag anything that looks off.” And the agent figures it out. It plans, makes trade-offs, calls tools, revises, and checks back when needed — all without being micromanaged. Just like a cyclist adjusting their route on the fly to avoid a crowd or take a shortcut.
Amsterdam cyclists don’t know every street by heart. But they don’t stop pedalling every time they hit a new neighborhood. They ask. They glance at signs. They check their phones mid-ride. They adjust without missing a beat.
That’s exactly what Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables in AI. Traditional models rely on what they learned during training but that knowledge gets stale. RAG allows agents to “ask” for updates from real-time sources: internal wikis, live documents, recent chats, or APIs. The model doesn’t have to memorize everything; it just needs to know when and how to retrieve what matters.
Imagine asking an assistant, “Can you send the updated vacation policy to the team?” Without RAG, it might make something up or pull in outdated info. But with RAG, it actually retrieves the real policy from your Google Drive and shares the correct details. It’s like giving your AI access to your company’s memory, so it doesn’t just sound confident, it is accurate.
It’s the difference between blindly guessing your route and checking the map mid-ride. Cyclists don’t freeze up when they’re unsure — they adjust. That’s the spirit behind RAG: staying curious, staying responsive, and rolling with the unknown instead of rigidly sticking to a script.
If you have ever ridden a creaky old bicycle through cobblestone streets, you know: even a good system needs upkeep. In Amsterdam, riders are always tweaking something: fixing a squeaky brake, tightening a loose seat. You’ll see tools everywhere like air pumps on the sidewalk, little repair stations on corners. It’s just part of keeping things rolling.
This is the dance of AI-for-code and code-for-AI.
On one side, tools like Copilot, ChatGPT, and Cody are transforming how we write software. They help generate boilerplate, catch bugs, write tests, and even explain complex code. They’re like having a bicycle mechanic riding shotgun, tightening bolts as you move.
But on the flip side, code-for-AI is where the real infrastructure gets built. It’s where you define your agent’s behaviors, their constraints, their tools, their norms. It’s how you make sure your AI doesn’t veer into the wrong lane. You give it a frame, a drivetrain, a set of rules.
What’s exciting is how the two are starting to build on each other: as AI gets better at coding, it becomes easier to create smarter, more dependable agents and those agents, in turn, help us write even better code. But it’s not just about moving fast. It’s about holding up over time. You don’t just want an AI that can sprint — you want one that can go the distance, and patch things up when they break along the way.
The magic of Amsterdam isn’t just the bicycles — it’s the unspoken rhythm everyone seems to follow. People just know when to slow down, where to ride, how to signal. It’s not about strict rules or endless signage. It’s something built into the culture. That shared understanding is what keeps everything flowing, even when the streets get packed.
That’s what Model Context Protocol (MCP) does for AI. MCP defines how agents interact with tools, with other systems, and with users. It gives them structured context about what’s available, what’s off-limits, and how to behave in a given environment. It’s like a silent rulebook that all agents agree to follow. Without MCP, each agent is a rogue cyclist dropped into traffic with no map and no idea what a red light means. With MCP, every agent enters the environment already knowing the rules — not just for itself, but for the broader system it’s riding within.
The future of AI isn’t just about making individual models smarter. It’s about building shared standards and frameworks that let these agents work together smoothly and safely in real-world situations. Think of it this way: training the model is like teaching someone how to ride a bicycle, while MCP is like giving them a map and the rules of the road.
Watching a group of cyclists ride in sync, adjusting speed, spacing, and direction as one is kind of hypnotic. No shouting, no instructions, just quiet coordination. One slows down a bit, another speeds up, and they glide through a tight turn together.
That’s what agent-to-agent collaboration can unlock. You don’t need one giant all-in-one “super-agent” doing everything. Instead, you want a bunch of smaller specialists who each focus on what they do best, communicate clearly, and work together smoothly. One handles the schedule, another puts together a proposal, and someone else makes sure everything’s following the rules. It’s like a group of riders on bicycles — each with their own job, but all moving in sync because they’re paying attention to each other When agents talk to each other i.e. when they can share state, delegate tasks, escalate decisions, and adapt dynamically they stop being tools and start becoming teammates.
Standing at that crosswalk, I wasn’t thinking about AI. But somehow, AI found me anyway.
What really stuck with me about Amsterdam’s bicycle culture wasn’t just how charming or efficient it was — it was the independence. No one was waiting around for instructions. No hesitation. Just people who understood their surroundings, trusted their instincts, and moved with just enough awareness of others to keep things flowing.
That’s the kind of AI worth building — not rigid scripts, not those bloated, do-everything systems that crumble when things get messy. Instead, it’s about small, capable agents designed to think, fetch what they need, follow protocols, and work together. Tools built to handle the unexpected without constant oversight — to move, adjust, and ride.
Because the future of AI isn’t some bullet train locked to a single track moving fast but missing the turns. It’s more like a fleet of bicycles — light, responsive, and always adapting. And if they can keep your coffee from spilling in the middle of the chaos? That’s a win :)

Beautiful Amsterdam / Built on Poles/ Who would pay if it all fell down?
–Old Dutch nursery rhyme translated
Since early times, the houses in Amsterdam have been built on wooden foundation piles[i] that are driven deep into the clay, peat, and water until they reach the first layer of solid sand. Even some of the trees in Vondelpark are supported on wooden piles to keep them from sinking into the marshy ground.
How long can a wooden pile remain in the ground before it has to be replaced?
300 years? 80 years? Until next week? The answer depends on many variables:
Quality of the sand layer
In Amsterdam, the first layer of sand lies approximately 12 meters below the surface. However, the quality of the sand layer is not consistent throughout the city. In some areas, the first sand layer is thinner than normal or missing entirely. As a result, the houses in these areas sink at an abnormal rate, and the foundations have to be replaced faster.
The top of the wooden foundation pile should be below the lowest expected water level. If part of the pile reaches above the water, it will be subject to insect attacks and decay. A problem is that the water level under Amsterdam isn’t always stable. For instance, it can drop during long periods of drought. Or a sewer pipe can develop cracks, allowing the ground water to flow into the pipe and be carried away. As a result, the water level drops.
On the other hand, if the water level rises too high, as sometimes occurs after a heavy rain, the Amsterdam cellars and crawl spaces fill up like bathtubs.
Construction projects can also interfere with the water level. An example is the incident on the Vijzelgracht in 2008 during work on the new metro station. A leak in the dam wall at a depth of 60 meters caused water and sand to stream into the pit. Part of the sand layer that was supporting the wooden foundation piles of the nearby houses washed away, causing extensive damage to the structure of the houses.
Spruce is less vulnerable to damage from bacteria than pine. Since around 1970, piles made from pine are prohibited from use. Concrete and steel piles are often used in present day construction.
The visible signs are slanted floors, cracks in the walls, doors and windows that stick, and broken front steps. The charming crooked roofline of Amsterdam is actually a symptom of unstable foundations.
If a foundation that is in poor condition is not repaired in time, the wooden piles will need to be replaced. No homeowner wants to get this news. A new foundation can easily cost 100,000 euro. Furthermore, the floor may need to be opened up, thereby making the house unlivable for some time.
In recent years, the housing corporations have been replacing the wooden piles under their properties with concrete piles.[ii] For example, Ymere is replacing the decayed pine piles in the Van der Pek neighborhood — a costly investment. However many houses that are at risk are privately owned.
The condition of the old wooden piles will only worsen in the coming years, so the question is: who will pay?
[i] Referred to as poles in the nursery rhyme.
[ii] Palen onder Amsterdam verpulveren

Hi there!
Welcome to a cityscape with unique merchant houses, intersected by numerous canals. Amsterdam is a lively city with a rich cultural scene and 800 years of history.
Forget about the typical tourist traps.
I will tell you the best things you can do for the first time there to feel fabulous.
Stay with me so you don’t miss anything.
Here we go with the Top 10 Must-Do Activities In Amsterdam:
Cycling isn’t just a mode of transportation in Amsterdam.
It’s a way of life!
With over 800,000 bicycles in the city — more than its human population — Amsterdam is often called ‘The Cycling Capital of the World’.This is owed to the city’s flat terrain and extensive network of bike routes.
Experience the city alongside locals on two wheels.
I am sure that you will love Amsterdam’s cycling culture:
www.dutchamsterdam.nl
Grab your saddle and pedal through Amsterdam’s bike-friendly streets.
You will enjoy passing by historic landmarks and picturesque canals.
Try to choose a sunny day or be prepared to cycle in the rain, as is often the case there!
The city of Amsterdam has a unique network of canals stretching to the west and south of the historic old town. The project was initiated during the late 16th and early 17th centuries.
It consists of the reclamation of swampland and the construction of concentric arcs of canals.
The canals, along with radial waterways and streets, showcase the city’s rich history. Now you have a chance to enjoy its beauty and heritage!
Find more information here:
whc.unesco.org
I had the opportunity to step into the evolution of Jordaan.
Once a humble working-class enclave, it has now transformed into Amsterdam’s hippest neighborhood!
Here, you can stroll along streets lined with art galleries, vintage boutiques, and bars.
Amsterdam’s Nine Streets, nestled behind the Royal Palace on Dam Square, attract both locals and tourists alike:
www.iamsterdam.com
Lose yourself along the cobblestone streets and peaceful canals of Amsterdam’s historic district!
Now, get ready for a journey through time. In just 40 minutes, you’ll zip through 400 years of history, starting from a swampy area.
The best part? This museum tells how Amsterdam, a city built on water, came to be:
grachten.museum
The museum itself is housed in a jaw-dropping building on the Herengracht.
Once you’re inside, grab an audio guide and settle in.
Before you know it, the lights dim, and bam! You’re whisked back to 1600, smack dab in the middle of Amsterdam’s golden age.
But wait, there’s more! This museum isn’t just about history.
It’s also about the city’s vibrant life.
The doll’s houses are straight out of the past and snippets from cult classic movies.
Yeah, it’s that cool.
Ever wondered what it’s like to live on a houseboat? Well, now’s your chance to find out!
Step aboard the Woonboot Museum, a cozy floating museum housed in a converted cargo ship from 1914:
houseboatmuseum.nl
You can sip tea and enjoy cake while lounging in retro armchairs.
But that’s not all — Amsterdam’s houseboat scene is a unique way of life. Dive deeper into its story at the Boat Museum of the Canals.
Located on the famous Prinsengracht, this museum offers a glimpse into Amsterdam’s aquatic past and present.
Learn about the evolution of houseboats, canal history, and more.
After all, where else can you get a firsthand look at life on the waterways?
Explore one of Amsterdam’s most powerful historical sites, the Anne Frank House.
Enter the hidden annex where Anne Frank and her family sought refuge during World War II.
Here, you’ll uncover the truths of the Holocaust:
www.annefrank.org
In this museum, you will see Anne’s actual diary and other relics.
I was inspired by the lasting message of courage and hope.
Experience the world of art at the famous Van Gogh Museum.
You will see the largest collection of Vincent van Gogh’s masterpieces!
This museum provides a close look into the life and art of the iconic Dutch painter:
www.vangoghmuseum.nl
Admire his lively paintings, sketches, and personal letters, witnessing the journey of his artistic brilliance.
Dive into centuries of Dutch art and history at the legendary Rijksmuseum:
www.rijksmuseum.nl
Discover masterpieces by Rembrandt, Vermeer, and other masters, highlighting the richness of Dutch culture.
From stunning paintings to decorative arts and more, the Rijksmuseum invites you now.
As soon as I walked into the Heineken Brewery, the delightful aroma of hops surrounded me.
Exploring the brewery’s vats and vintage equipment, I discovered the story of Heineken’s beginnings and their dedication to brewing excellence:
www.heinekenexperience.com
No wonder it’s my favorite beer!
The tasting room was a highlight for me.
With every sip, I savored the essence of Heineken’s craftsmanship. Heineken truly deserves its high regard in the brewing world.
Do you enjoy this beer as much as I do?
As the sun dips below the horizon, Amsterdam ignites with exciting nightlife.
The Red Light District, famous for its legalized prostitution, is a must-see spot and that caught my eye too:
amsterdamtickets.tours
I wandered through lively streets with friends, enjoying its unique vibe.
But there’s more to see in the district than just its reputation. Amongst the buzzing nightlife, you’ll discover a fascinating mix of history, culture, and cutting-edge experiences.
Explore cozy cafes, trendy bars, nightclubs, and live music spots.
Amsterdam offers endless possibilities for nighttime adventures.
Whether you’re into groovy beats or prefer a chill night with locals, the city promises unforgettable experiences until the early hours.

The last time I ventured to Amsterdam was 20 years ago, so I decided that it was perhaps time to make a return visit and see what had changed. When most people think of Amsterdam they automatically and quite rightly think of Anne Frank, the beautiful canals and the tulips (& maybe even the brownies).
However, as is always the case, going slightly further afield can offer other sights and events. Having been there before, I had already visited the Anne Frank house and museum, and so I decided to spend the limited time that I had available on simply exploring areas of the city and visiting a few other select attractions.

Amsterdam by Ian McEwan certainly isn’t the first novel in the history of literature that deals with moral hypocrisy in a corrupted society, nor is it the last. But the way McEwan deals with it, the approach, the focus — it is all so fresh (even now, in 2015) and remarkable. The narrative instance doesn’t criticize and doesn’t even laugh at those characters. Instead, we, the readers, are encouraged to take the protagonists seriously. There is no bare sarcasm, only the finest irony, essential to characterization and plot. McEwan is a master of the free indirect style. We are in the characters’ heads, thinking their thoughts, afraid of their fears. We are worried that Clive will end up just like Molly. And there is Vernon with his feeling of non-existence, which is a postmodernist moment, for he certainly does not exist until someone reads the novel.
The introductory setting is hilarious. Two middle-aged guys are attending an ex-lover’s funeral. The ex-lower was a kind of femme fatale cliché of the XX century. The sound of the name, Molly Lane, somehow recalls Molly Bloom. There is, also, at least, one more ex-lover of hers, and her husband. They are all connected in various ways, but the existence of Molly deepens those connections. The first two guys are friends and, which is more important, they give us the first two points of view. They are the good guys. According to them, the husband is stupid and possessive. The third lover, a politician, is an enemy of the previous three.
The language of the novel is extraordinary. Characterization is delicate and minutious.
So, we have two bad, and two good guys. And then Vernon appears to be quite immoral and without human principles. Nevermind. There is Clive, with his moral superiority. He is the one who really loved Molly, who deeply misses her, and who doesn’t even want Vernon to publicly humiliate the arch-enemy, by publishing his photos in women's clothes, taken by Molly, and provided by her husband. We also read a long and rather pathetic passage about how Clive had always been a so much better friend to Vernon than he was to Clive.
Just a few pages later, this morally superior guy goes hiking, in search of inspiration, and then witnesses an act of violence, perhaps a murder, and just walks away, because, for god’s sake, he has the symphony to write!
After less than half of the novel, there is no good protagonist left for us to feel empathy for. But, instead of becoming boring, the novel’s plot starts to accelerate, preventing you from letting it from your hands before you’ve read the very last page of it.
The main plot triggers are behind us by now. Clive and Vernon have made a pact: if one of them gets ill the way Molly did, the other will arrange euthanasia abroad. After that, they’ve had the first, but crucial, argument in the history of their friendship. It is about embarrassing photographs of Foreign Minister, Julian Garmony, which were about to be published in the magazine that Vernon runs.
Now comes a deus ex machina — and the first spoiler to Vernon’s plan. A new character, the Minister’s wife, gives a press conference, which turns things upside down. On the sudden, it is not the politician’s head urgently needed on a plate, but Vernon’s.
Vernon and Clive are mad at each other, as they both feel betrayed. They start to hate each other and, in the end, mutually arrange a murder in Amsterdam, where the grand premiere of Clive’s symphony is about to be performed.
It is Molly’s husband who, followed by now ex-Foreign Minister, buries them all. The most of his wife’s former lovers are dead, and now he recalls memories of Vernon’s wife, who used to be wild. He is about to call her for a dinner. So, who is laughing now?
We are. At this moment, I can’t recall any other piece of prose in which the death of the main characters produces such a comical effect. It is even not morbid humor; it is just humor, and it is great.
Ian McEwan won the Man Booker Prize for Amsterdam in 1998.

It’s my third year in the Netherlands. Or, as we Highly Skilled Migrants like to say, year 3 out of 5.
When I arrived in 2022, as full of enthusiasm about the future as the whole newly reopened post-Covid world, the border officer asked me how long I was planning on staying. ‘Maybe forever!’ I replied with a broad smile. (Coming from the UK, I was still used to the image of public officials as banterous teddy bears). Then, I marched straight into the Dutch winter.
I was proud to have intentionally chosen a new country to live in and determined to be happy. As it happens, reality proved to be more complex and less controllable, and not just because of the weather. The job was actually worse than my previous job in London. The housing market was broken beyond understanding. The friendships were effortful and shallow. The relationship I started turned long distance.
And that’s okay. That’s how you fall in love with a city, through a journey of joys and disappointments. You will survive, grow and thrive, as long as you have a guiding principle. Mine, as many other expats in Amsterdam, has always been:
At least stay until the end of the ruling. Then you can always leave.
The Dutch government calls it a “facility” or “reimbursement” as if trying to hide its own intentions. But when you fill any legal forms here, the literally translated question they ask you is “Are you enjoying the 30% ruling?”. I surely am, thank you very much. That’s the purpose of it — it’s an incentive. A tax scheme from 1964, according to which Highly Skilled Migrants don’t pay taxes on 30% of their salary, as well as wealth tax for shares, savings and properties they have abroad. The aim is to compensate them for the cost of moving countries.
Much has changed to this program since its introduction 60 years ago. Firstly, the definition of Highly Skilled Migrant has blurred, from someone with a specific expertise needed in the Netherlands, to someone that earns more than roughly €70k per year. Secondly, the duration of the tax advantage shortened from 10 to 8 to 5 years. And finally, just a year ago, the percentage of tax-exempt salary has decreased. Just like Milka has been gradually replacing cocoa with palm oil and Uniqlo has added polyester to their T-shirts, the Dutch government, too, has diluted its concentration of a promised land.
Between 2010 and 2022, the number of expats in the Netherlands nearly tripled, reaching about 70 thousand. The incentive to attract skilled labour has clearly worked. But instead of celebrating this with a champagne and liquorice candy, officials in the Hague have started to scale back the program. So… attracting expats is now a bad thing?
I think the Dutch government finally realised that it’s neither good nor bad, but it’s complicated.
Learning the local opinions from personal anecdotes and discussions, as well as Dutch media and online forums, I can confirm that the policy has more resonance than a simple reimbursement that it claims to be.
One thing I love about the Dutch is how hard it is to annoy them. It takes a group of stoned British lads disregarding the cyclist's path to cross that barrier. Even then, the worst that happens is a Dutchie elbowing the tourist so that they trip, while they could’ve run them over and still win in any Dutch court (since cyclist paths are sacred and bikes always have priority).
Bottom line is, the Dutch are easy-going people, not precious about things. That’s why very often their opinion about the 30% ruling goes along the lines of: “it doesn’t affect me, so why would I care”, “the policy is there to use it, so let expats use it”, or even: “it’s not right to envy someone when I already have a good life”. Besides, apparently expats are polite and their culture doesn’t bother others.
The neutral attitude can trend towards solidarity and even enthusiasm. Some Dutch people say that their country is too small to keep its economic importance without highly skilled migrants. Expats bring knowledge, innovation and jobs: they are the reason that multinational companies are not afraid to have an office in the Netherlands, which in turn creates jobs for the locals. Everybody benefits.
The “everybody benefits” argument is important for Dutch people, who value equality and are proud of it. That’s why to some, it seems unfair that they may earn the same as their expat colleagues, but take less pay home, based just on their origin.
Still, this group is not hostile to the expats. They’re disappointed that the government facilitates unfair pay by effectively subsidising companies. If companies want to attract talent, they should just offer higher pay to everyone, to make up for the high cost of living in Holland. Some people even argue that the ruling allows companies to suppress salaries.
Then there’s the smallest and most extreme camp. Expats overcrowd big cities, don’t learn the language, don’t contribute to the community, and don’t intend to stay. Make them pay back the cash if they leave within 5 years after their ruling ends.
Which leaves some expats confused, because… wasn’t that the plan all along?
Here I can speak in the first person: we know that we are seen as a contingent workforce. A touch of variety to the local fauna & flora, fertilising the economy as we hop from country to country in search of nectar. As long as most of us don’t stay, we’re not an invasive species.
The point of a fixed-term incentive is to get as much out of the workforce as possible in their productive years, without having to provide for them in old age.
Shortening and diluting of the ruling in the last years proves this point. Highly Skilled Migrants are still incentivised to come, they are still needed. But they are also welcome to leave.
Similarly, an argument can be made that it’s fair not to pay full taxes if you haven’t relied on the country before reaching a productive age.
A Highly Skilled Migrant contributes to the economy from day one. No public money has been invested in their healthcare and education.
Contrary to the locals, though, they need to take the cost and risk of relocating, and so it would seem fair that they are compensated for it. They don’t have a home in the new location and their pension takes a hit. This means that applying wealth tax to their foreign properties or savings wouldn’t be fair either.
Among the expats there is also a radical camp. High cost of living, high taxes, expensive health care, crap weather — you shouldn’t even be questioning why I need an incentive to be here, they say.
Like with the hostile locals, this is a small camp. The majority of Highly Skilled Migrants are just happy to receive the ruling and not make a song and dance about it. Just like the Dutch see them: expats are polite and their culture doesn’t bother others.
Some of the Highly Skilled Migrants will grow roots, if they happen to keep a good job, find a flat, meet friends and partners. Others will see how it goes, and if it doesn’t go great, after five years they will have one less reason to stay.
But during those first five years, nobody knows which is which, including the expats themselves. And so, the best plan is to stay put. Invest, but not so much to tie yourself down. Find friends, but maybe just other expats who are easy to connect with. Learn a bit of language. Keep checking out LinkedIn for jobs in other cities.
Do a little taster of how it’s like to live here, so that in five years, when you suddenly earn 1k less per month, you can make an informed decision if it’s worth staying.
In those five years, expats can be accused of making a poor effort at integrating, but the setup doesn’t encourage it, either.
Don’t get me started on the language, since I’ve mentioned it so many times. It’s not pretty or easy to pick up, has little value outside of this small country, and has to be learned in one’s spare time and out of own pocket. Sure, that’s what the tax break is for, but if it’s up to an individual to decide, realistically they will have other priorities in their budget.
The institutions who need and can afford Highly Skilled Migrants are multinational companies. Their employees will work in a group of other expats and their skill will be niche enough to only be relevant to another multinational company. As a result, it’s unrealistic for such a person to think about switching to a Dutch business.
I’ve described at length what it’s like to make friends and date as an expat. The social circle is not just your friends and partners, it’s also the community around you and even wider, the strangers you meet every day. And this wider Dutch community, just like I’ve described, is characterised by the prevalent sentiment of: “I’m not affected, so I don’t mind”. The easy-going character of the locals allows them to ignore the expats, for good and bad. Even if internally they are annoyed by the cash that expats get, they won’t make a big deal out of it, and just get on with their life.
On the plus side, this unbothered attitude promotes a peaceful coexistence. On the downside, it kills any curiosity in the Dutch about the expats and any motivation in the expats to fit with the Dutch.
I hear it in the uninterested, short smalltalk in polite English from any Dutch person I meet. It can be translated to: I get it, you’re one of the passing expats, coming here to have a good life for a few years and contribute to the economy. I’ll leave you be.
I sometimes wish they shouted back at me in their native language, as it would happen in Paris, Barcelona or even Berlin. It would mean: I want you to integrate! If you choose to live here, I need you to be a part of this community!
But no, they don’t need us to integrate, they understand we probably won’t. They assume we probably won’t. They just don’t care if we do or not.
That attitude of indifference in the Dutch, a very indirect and unplanned consequence of the 30% ruling, is the real reason for the transient character of Amsterdam.
It’s a city where everyone assumes that you may just be on a grown-up exchange program, so by absorbing the local atmosphere, you start to believe that yourself.
Eventually, when your ruling runs out, if you decide that it’s worth it to graduate from a nomad to a settler, you will likely settle outside of Amsterdam anyway. Maybe you’ll look for more space, more greenery, maybe you’ll want to hear Dutch on the streets and contribute to the community. Most likely, you’ll just be fed up with Amsterdam property prices, which have gone up a lot in the last few years, similarly to the number of Highly Skilled Migrants.
The Dutch attitude of “the 30% ruling doesn’t affect me, so I don’t have an opinion about it” ends when their house search starts. Without a doubt, they will find it very hard to buy a property, and at the same time, they will meet many foreigners who are to do it. And now they wonder: does the tax break for expats really not affect me? Or if an expat with spare cash didn’t overbid on the house I wanted, maybe it would’ve been mine?
And that’s how the expats, who are apparently polite and whose culture doesn’t bother others, have apparently caused the housing crisis in Amsterdam. But that’s a topic for next time.

Welcome! Happy to see you in the seventh part of my Vuejs Amsterdam Conference 2022 summary series, in which I share a summary of all the talks with you.
You can read my JSWorld Conference 2022 Summary series (in four parts) here, where I summarized all the first day’s talks. You can also find the previous Talks of the Vue Amsterdam conference 2022 in my blog.
After two and a half years, JSWorld and Vue Amsterdam Conference were back in Theater Amsterdam between 1 and 3 June, and I had the chance to attend this conference for the first time. I learned many things, met many wonderful people, spoke with great developers, and had a great time. On the first day the JSWorld Conference was held, and on the second and third days, the Vue Amsterdam.
The conference was full of information with great speakers, each of whom taught me something valuable. They all wanted to share their knowledge and information with other developers. So I thought it would be great if I could continue to share it and help others use it.
At first, I tried to share a few notes or slides, but I felt it was not good enough, at least not as good as what the speaker shared with me. So I decided to re-watch each speech, dive deeper into them, search, take notes and combine them with their slides and even their exact words in their speech and then share it with you so that what I share with you is at least at the same level as what I learned from them.
Everything you read during these few articles is the result of the effort and time of the speaker itself, and I have only tried to learn them so that I can turn them into these articles. Even many of the sentences written in these articles are exactly what they said or what they wrote in Slides. This means if you learn something new, it is because of their efforts.
Last but not least, I may not dig into every technical detail or live codings in some of the speeches. But if you are interested and need more information, let me know and I’ll try to write a more detailed article separately. Also, don’t forget to check out their Twitter/Linkedin.
Here you can find the program of the conference:

Sebastien Chopin — Co-Founder of Nuxt
Our mission at @nuxtlabs is to provide the best Developer Experience to deliver the best User Experience for your end users. We are doing this with Nuxt for six Years now.
Nuxt is a web framework for creating any kind of Vue app. That means you can do:
Since the beginning of Nuxt in October 2016 it has been downloaded about 46M times on npm, has 300k live websites, and 18k GitHub contributors.
This is a hello world bundle size comparison between Nuxt 2 and Nuxt 3:
One of the reasons Nuxt 3 is so much smaller is that it’s tree shakable, like Vue 3. So if you don’t use a feature, it will not be included in the bundle.
The Next equivalent bundle size is around 80kB.
In that Nuxt 3 JS bundle, 25.3kB are from Vue, and the 8.7kB left includes:
Edge Side Rendering — also named JavaScript containers by Ryan Dahl — is the capability of running JavaScript at the CDN nodes somewhere around the world close to the end user.
The advantages:
Some of the Edge computing providers right now:
Nuxt Content is a Nuxt module that reads Markdown, YAML, CSV, and JSON files in the content/ directory to create a powerful data layer for your application and Content V2 is out now with more features.
What’s coming for Nuxt 2.X:
What’s coming for Nuxt 3.0:
I hope you enjoyed this part and it can be as valuable to you as it was to me.
Over the next few days, I’ll share the rest of the talks with you. Stay tuned…

I’m not the author: it’s written on this bicycle basket!
Three words, just as inspiring as the plastic-cleaning initiatives carried out along the river.
This city offers endless sources of inspiration, from biking and boating to street art, nature, shopping, museums, architecture, food, and even cannabis!
For those seeking a thrill, dare to swing into the void at the top of the XXX tower, with its swing above the abyss.
However, cycling in THE bicycle city can be just as exhilarating, having to watch out for fast-moving cyclists and pedestrians.
The key to this city’s success lies in its diverse offerings, ensuring that everyone can find their way around.

This month I am engaged in an experiment. Normally I spend a lot of time with my family, who live only a few doors away from my apartment in Amsterdam. However, they are on a month-long adventure to Great Britain, leaving me on my own. Rather than feeling sorry for myself, I am creating a month’s worth of exciting touristy plans where I am going to pretend to be a tourist in my own city.
I haven’t developed a full itinerary yet. Today, August 1st, I helped my family get to the train station, then came home and relaxed after several days of helping them pack for their own adventure, which consists of biking all over Great Britain and camping for a good portion of that time.
I am also getting started on creating a calendar. I am going to publish the first draft of it, which will consist of a few plans I’ve made in advance by necessity, such as making reservations for the Van Gogh Museum and my oncologist appointment, which was scheduled six months ago. I will add activities as they arise—some of which will be pre-planned, and some will be scheduled the way I most enjoy things: on the fly, depending upon my mood and the weather.
There are a number of things I don’t want to miss, such as going on a canal cruise or visiting some of the less…

Cities and their spaces are designed experiences — we’re just not always aware we’re users. Within these spaces, we encounter countless touchpoints — physical, emotional, and social — all shaping the way we experience them.
With a background in product design and professional experience in UX, I’ve always understood user experience as something holistic, more than digital interactions. But during a recent trip to Amsterdam and Dubai, I noticed something deeper: cities themselves are designed experiences.
Walking through these two very different cities made me reflect on how much urban design and service design overlap. From the ease of getting around to the emotional tone a space creates, I started seeing each city as a living system — one with its own user flows, pain points, and design choices.
In this article, I share some of those observations from my personal experience and the UX lessons I took from them.
My trip began in Amsterdam —a city where user experience extends beyond screens, shaping how people move through their environment every day. One of the first things I noticed was how bikes aren’t treated as a leisure activity or exercise, but as the primary means of getting around. People bike everywhere, even to nightclubs.
Back home in Portugal, cycling is more of a weekend activity — something for fitness or family outings. In Amsterdam, it’s everyday life. That difference struck me, not just because it was unfamiliar, but because it revealed something deeper: how infrastructure shapes behavior, and how behavior, over time, becomes culture. The flat terrain, narrow streets, and widespread bike infrastructure all work together to make biking the most natural choice.
Design made it easy. Culture made it normal.
As I walked alongside the canals, passing locals on their bikes or stepping out of houseboats, I began to understand something about pace and emotional design. The layout of the city encourages slowness. Not in the sense of inefficiency, but in presence. The kind of design that makes you look around more, breathe slower, take things in. Amsterdam moves differently — both physically and emotionally. The environment isn’t just designed for mobility; it’s designed for human connection.
One small detail that caught my eye — and kept coming back to me — was something I might have overlooked if I hadn’t asked about it. I noticed strange hooks jutting out from the top floor facades of the narrow houses. Curious, I brought it up to the friend travelling with me, who had already been to Amsterdam and explained that these are centuries-old fixtures for moving furniture and goods through windows. The buildings are too narrow, the staircases too tight, and so people developed an outside-in system. A centuries-old solution to a simple but real problem:
“How do you get your couch into a house with stairs too small and steep to carry it up?”
It’s a quiet example of design under constraint. Faced with tight architecture (partly shaped by historic tax laws), people innovated through a humble, mechanical workaround. What struck me most is that it’s still used today. It reminded me of a moment in Urbanized, the documentary by Gary Hustwit, where it’s mentioned how the most meaningful urban innovations often come from the bottom up — citizens adapting space to fit real needs.
The second and final part of the trip was spent in Dubai. If Amsterdam felt spontaneous and human-scale, Dubai felt curated — like someone was handling it for me.
Getting around wasn’t just about driving — it was about being moved. From valet parking to full-service fuel stations where we never had to leave the car, every step of the journey felt taken care of.
Across both service and transport, I noticed a pattern: the city was designed to require less from me. Less friction. Less effort. Fewer choices to make. I could compare it to a seamless user journey where each step is thoughtfully designed, with no critical pain points.
In UX, we talk about reducing cognitive load and anticipating needs. In Dubai, it felt like that idea was everywhere. From how you moved to how you were received, the environment kept stepping in for you before you even realised what you needed.
As I settled into Dubai, it became immediately clear that the city was designed with an extraordinary level of attention to detail. In fact, it was so present that I almost didn’t realise it at first.
It wasn’t just that Dubai was clean — it was that someone was always cleaning it. From mall bathrooms to rooftop clubs, I saw staff quietly maintaining the space, constantly resetting it. And that’s when it hit me: it wasn’t just about upkeep; it was an integral part of the user experience.
Most people only notice cleanliness when it’s absent. In Dubai, it was so proactive and seamless that it became a continuous, visible signal of care. There was a sense that the space was always ready for you, that someone had already anticipated your needs. This wasn’t just about hygiene; it was about creating a sense of psychological safety, comfort, even luxury. Cleanliness here didn’t just make the space more pleasant; it made you feel valued. It told you: your experience matters. Everything was designed to make you feel supported, reducing mental load so you could simply exist in the moment without worry.
It reminded me of how digital services work in the background — updating, syncing, backing up — without you having to lift a finger. You don’t see it, but it builds a foundation of trust by keeping everything running smoothly. In Dubai, this same principle applied to the physical environment, where every detail felt carefully planned to keep things effortless.
Behind this seamless experience, of course, is a larger system of labor and structure. Dubai’s focus on high service standards relies on a workforce of trained individuals, which are migrant workers. Their work enables this constant care, and it’s important to acknowledge that the experience of ease and luxury is held up by a whole infrastructure designed to support it.
As a tourist, everything felt designed to be easy, polished, and thoughtful. Not just functionally, but emotionally. It was the kind of design that made you feel cared for, without even realising it.
On a final note, the most striking aspect of my travel experience was how I was addressed. I was consistently greeted with “madam”. It wasn’t just politeness. It was a signal — a small, repeated gesture that carried emotional weight.
You’re seen. You’re respected. You’re valued here.
And what struck me was how consistent it was. Whether I was at a humble restaurant or shopping, the tone didn’t change. The same level of care and attention showed up everywhere. That consistency created something rare: a shared emotional tone across different service levels.
In a way, this mirrored what I’d already been feeling in Dubai: that the city was designed not just to function well, but to make you feel looked after. The details weren’t loud — but they added up. And sometimes, all it takes is a single word to shape the emotional tone of an entire place.
Luxury in Dubai is easily accessible. The views are framed just right, designed to impress and soothe. You got the sense that someone had considered how you might feel at every turn.
Of course, none of this is accidental. Dubai’s focus on aesthetics and hospitality is a cornerstone of its identity. The city markets itself on these experiences. It is curated — carefully and deliberately — to feel seamless. But even knowing that, it still worked. What stayed with me wasn’t the imposing skyline or luxury touches, but the quiet signals of care: a clean space, fuel stops anticipating needs, and a respectful “madam” at every place. It reminded me that thoughtful environments — digital or physical — aren’t just designed for function. They’re designed to shape how we feel.
In Dubai, that feeling was clear: you’re being looked after. It was frictionless, anticipatory, and emotionally consistent. A good experience designed end to end.
Looking back, it’s clear how deeply our environment shapes our experience — often in ways we don’t even realise. Whether through frictionless mobility systems, services that anticipate needs, or subtle cues that build trust and emotional safety, thoughtful design operates on many levels at once.
What surprised me most was that, in a place known for innovation and cutting-edge tech, it wasn’t the digital interfaces that left the strongest impression. It was the experience of navigating the city itself — the people, the spaces, and the seamless care in every interaction.
Great user experience — whether in a product or physical space — isn’t just about usability. It’s about how we feel while interacting with it: confident, cared for, at ease.
This trip reminded me that UX and service design extend far beyond screens. Every touchpoint — human, digital, or physical — shapes the journey. And in the best cases, that journey feels seamless — not because it’s invisible, but because every detail works in harmony to support the user.
A note on context
The perspective in this article comes from my experience visiting Amsterdam and Dubai as a tourist. While my time in Amsterdam was shaped by exploring the city on my own, in Dubai I stayed with people who live there. That experience gave me a different kind of access — more immersive and seamless — which naturally shaped how I experienced and noticed the city.

So, you are visiting The Netherlands? Don’t get stuck in Amsterdam- visit Texel! You will love it, and here is why.
Texel Island can be found in the North Eastern part of The Netherlands and is one of the five Wadden Islands, also known as the West Frisian Islands, where many city dwellers have chosen to escape the busy lifestyle and settle on this thriving yet peaceful island. The word “wadden” refers to the mudflats that appear with the ebb and flow of the tide. You are just there in under two hours from Amsterdam Schiphol airport by car — including the ferry.
Some even call it the “Ibiza of The Netherlands” which underlines the relaxed attitude by the locals and the existence of many beach clubs.
Here it is: my 5 favourite spots!
This area is part of National Park the Dunes of Texel and has an open connection with the North Sea. Wander around and discover the many creeks The Slufter has. Great for hikes, bird watching — over 80 species breed here every year.
The most northern part of the island had a giant stretchy beach with a pretty lighthouse built in 1863. This makes up for long evening sunset strolls. If you are in a sporty mood you can climb the inside of the historic lighthouse by day.
My favorite place for breakfast in the lovely unofficial capital of Texel — Den Burg. They offer free coffee or tea with a paid breakfast if you order before 10.53am — random, ha! Around the open kitchen you will find all types of sourdough bread, wonderful sweet pastries and lightly roasted coffee. Must visit. Location link (Google Maps) | Website
Visiting with kids? They will love Ecomare which educates and shows how they care for seals of all kinds. Don’t miss out on the daily seal feed every morning.
Location link (Google Maps) | Website
When I visit Texel I often go to this place. Get the best strawberries locally grown and picked here! If you are into it, you can wander around in the food gardens and pick your own vegetables and fruits for a small fee. You can also get buy local products here and take it with you before you depart to the ferry.

Yay, this was my very first Medium post! If you love this story, make sure to Subscribe.

After visiting the many great talks of the Voxxed Days I started my journey home to resume my responsibilities as a parent. While leaving the conference location I saw people already entering the Pathé building for the movies that evening. While part of the community was still sharing their thoughts upstairs at the venue I looked back at a great conference. The nine or so hours I stayed flew by and this was all made possible by Codelab, sponsors and volunteers, so thank you for your efforts.
I saw many familiar faces that also decided to do something else than work, meetings or chores that day. The sun was definitely shining outside the sky was blue and people were happy. IT people almost naturally retreated to the dark movie theatre rooms.
The conference started for me with Sander Hoogendoorn talking about AI and what it can bring developers and companies. A massive boost in capabilities, creating bigger things with the same team. In my opinion the use of AI will probably increase the amount of tech debt and developers will be still needed to actually fix problems and write better code. Sander also mentioned that AI must be seen as a tool for developers it would be good to embrace it or you will miss opportunities.
After that Sander Mak told a story about taking risk and not being afraid to fail. Failure is part of learning, true words. At the company Picnic they introduced Calcite for querying over databases, this lead to many changes and some very challenging ones. This change allowed the more technical business users to get data with their own queries without going directly to the separate databases. Calcite provides federated querying and makes queries database independent. I left the room with a positive vibe both keynotes were great.
Many more great talks followed and many of them I was not able to visit. I very much struggled with the fear of missing out. One of the talks I really liked was about Redis 8. Raphael De Lio showed in rapid pace, and with a live demo, some of the new features which include fast vector search. Something that makes Redis very useful for AI applications.
One of the overlying themes of the conference I observed was loose coupling, on every level of a software platform. In the code as the hexagonal architecture and the use of Spring Cloud Functions. The latter is ideal for separating business logic from cloud specific logic Elena van Engelen-Maslova told us. For logging, tracing and metrics the use of Open Telemetry and on the infrastructure side the use of tools like Rancher. Also for testing the need for better integration testing between external interfaces has become possible with the use of a tool like Testcontainers which was mentioned in the talk of Adam Michalik.
It’s nice to get advice which I can apply directly the next day and that was given by Paco van Beckhoven about merge requests (roll eyes, yes Gitlab). A template for a merge request with checklists is useful according to him. Also it always good to provide the reasons for the changes in the merge requests. I think carefully reviewing MR’s will become even more important if more of the code is not written by a person
It was getting late and the final talk would soon start. I did not know what to expect. After 5 minutes it became clear it was like a nightmare story for engineers. Adele Carpenter provided a story about airplane systems and how we as software people can learn from the reasons for planes crashing. Often it was mixture of systems having no useful alerting and redundant systems making it more complex to understand what is going on for the pilot. This hits home because badly communicated redundancy was the reason for a recent production failure of a system I am working on.
While walking back to the metro station I was divided, on one hand I felt comforted because I had seen people doing their utmost to improve and create software, platforms and processes and on the other hand the need was shown for even more secure, green, reliable and well architected software. The world as we know has become more unpredictable and with IT becoming more critical it feels like we need to be better prepared for the unexpected.

Hi, I’m Serhat from OpsGenie. I recently had the chance to go to Atlassian’s Connect Week event. I will try to share my experience at this amazing event.
I arrived in Amsterdam on Saturday afternoon and had the chance to visit lots of great places like the Van Gogh museum, the Rijksmuseum, the Heineken Experience…
On Monday morning, I went to Atlassian’s Amsterdam office at around 9:00 AM. There were many friendly people at the door who greeted me. I introduced myself and got my Atlassian Connect Week event t-shirt; then I went to the meeting area, where we had standup meetings throughout the week.
Luke Kilpatrick from Atlassian welcomed us, and everyone started introducing himself/herself. After the introductions, there were presentations about JIRA, Confluence, JIRA Service Desk, and others. I learned a lot about Atlassian products on Monday. At the end of the day, there was a happy hour event where I met great guys from all over the world. We talked about lots of things, including what our companies do and what our plans were for the week…
I will not go into the implementation details, but during the Connect week, I mainly worked on our HipChat Add-On updates together with Nick Turskyi from HipChat. On Tuesday, I completed one of our prime goals of providing an option to simplify HipChat messages that go into the room. Now, our messages are collapsible and don’t take so much space in the chat room, but they still show all the details when you extend the message or click the message to see all the details in the sidebar. It’s been implemented in a backward compatible way so that current customers who love the way it was can still use it the same way.
Wednesday started with a standup meeting where everyone said what they were working on and shared any problems they encountered. During the day, I scheduled meetings with JIRA, JIRA Service Desk and Confluence teams. There were lots of useful ideas on how to improve our current applications and add new ones to provide a complete workflow using Atlassian tools.
I added an unacknowledge action option to the HipChat sidebar. Now, users can unacknowledge their alerts — in addition to acknowledging and closing them — without leaving the HipChat room.
At the end of the day, Atlassian organized a trip to the Amsterdam Museum. It was a great trip, and we learned a lot about Amsterdam. After the trip, there was another happy hour next to the museum. After all that, we felt a bit hungry and decided to explore Indonesian food at Kantjil.
On Thursday, I had a meeting with a UI/UX team and got feedback on our HipChat Add-On. I implemented action buttons for the alert list view in the chat sidebar that makes executing actions faster. I also worked on implementing an add note action option, using HipChat dialogs. It was nearly done, but it could not be released (because of a bug). Thursday was intensive, because the next day would be our demo day!
Friday was our demo day, and I had the chance to present information about our product and about what I accomplished during the week. Many great companies shared their products and proved the strength of the Atlassian platform.
It was truly a great week in Amsterdam!
I met with developers from all over the world, learned a lot about their products, exchanged ideas, explored Amsterdam, and developed great Atlassian add-ons.
Take a look, below, at some of my other pictures from this wonderful week.
Oh: special thanks to Michael Lauricella from Atlassian, Nick Turskyi from HipChat, Hector Urtubia and Matt Pizzimenti from Olark, Nic from Fugue, and Brandon from PingPilot. This week would not have been as great without you guys!

Two weeks ago I decided Amsterdam would be my place to settle, hoping finally this would be the place for me and even though I had been warned by my peers and colleagues, I did all my homework, studied the market and told myself that it couldn’t be as hard as finding an apartment in China, where everybody just spoke Mandarin to do so.
I was extremely wrong, the market here is insane, maybe because we are in a post-covid season and the city is blooming with tourism, perhaps is the interest younger people have towards trying the so-called “legal drugs”, it might be due to the high season rental as schools and Universities are starting again or simply just a slip from the Dutch government when considering housing options for everybody.
The reality is that thousands of people are competing on a daily basis to find an apartment, a room or at least a long-term stay without paying a kidney and a half for it.
I got an Airbnb type of apartment via Expedia, it was a great deal for one week, only paying 917€ after my Genius 30%…

I’ve been more time as an adult in Amsterdam, than in my home country. In Amsterdam, there are many options for everything. But be careful. It’s so very easy to get lost in Amsterdam. For me Amsterdam is stressful.
Study
In Amsterdam, you will find all sorts of studying careers, and people are very free on choosing. Many Dutch people drop out in the first or second program because “they don’t like it”. And is very normal to try different things. Education is many times in English. However I would say that education can be very stressful because it’s a bit chaotic and challenging at the same time. You have to do everything by yourself, and teachers are more mentors than teachers. It’s like you never can really relax, and you have to think a LOT in every subject, because education here priorities thinking by yourself, they absolutely infinitely 100% hate things “by the book” (typical Dutch). Of course, you meet people from everywhere. Your colleagues are from everywhere. It can be stressful, especially if you come from cultures where “everything is organized”, where you know what you really gonna learn, where grades matter a lot, where everything has a specific linear way of being. In Amsterdam simply things are free.
Informality
Here no one likes any form of formality. Everything must be informal by default. No one absolutely no one cares about formal clothing, and genuinely everyone will hate that. It’s not…

Amsterdam moves. People walk briskly, bikes fly past, trams glide along their rails. Everyone seems to have a place to be, a purpose to fulfill. And yet, despite the chaos — bikes weaving through pedestrians, cars stopping and starting, boats slipping quietly through the canals — there’s a strange kind of order. No honking, no shouting, no visible frustration. Just movement. It feels like watching a symphony with no conductor, a city that somehow just knows how to keep itself in rhythm.
I sit by a restaurant window and watch it all unfold. The rain-speckled glass blurs the edges of passing figures, turning them into something out of a painting. I catch glimpses of them — sharp jawlines, loose scarves, hands tucked into the pockets of long coats. I find myself romanticizing over every woman that walks by, assigning them stories they’ll never know they’ve been given. She’s on her way to meet a friend. She’s heading home after a long day at work. She’s just as lost in thought as I am.
And then there are the couples. The ones who share a cigarette outside a café, the ones who lean into each other on their bikes, the ones who don’t need words to fill the space between them. I am content here, alone, but I can’t help but envy them. Amsterdam is beautiful on its own, but I imagine it would be even better when shared.
The Dutch language wasn’t a necessity — I could’ve gotten by just fine without it — but I’m glad I learned it anyway. Even simple exchanges feel like small victories, a way of stepping further into this place instead of just passing through it. And the food? The beer? It all just sits better. There’s a freshness to it, a simplicity. I don’t leave meals feeling sluggish, just satisfied.
Maybe that’s the feeling I’ll take home with me — not just the admiration, not just the longing, but the quiet contentment of being here. The realization that I don’t have to understand how everything works to appreciate that it does.

Just a place to keep my thoughts. Maybe you can relate to them.

Hoy again! The capital of the Netherlands holds a special place in my heart. Never have I liked a big city as much as Amsterdam. It booms with people from all over the world, the standard of living is exquisite and there are so many bike lanes! Find yourself wandering around Amsterdam, taking in the canals, the houses among them, the marvelous new architecture, and experiencing this small, but beautiful country. Here are 5 more places to go to in Amsterdam:
This one is for street art lovers: The NDSM Werft across the river has some of the best street art I have ever seen. You can find the famous “Let me be myself” banner of Anner Frank here. It is the perfect place for an industrial and colourful photoshoot with vibrant and exquisite street art as your background. Or just look at all the cool art displayed by many…

By Johannes Novy
When COVID hit the Netherlands in 2020, Amsterdam emptied of visitors overnight. Long-term residents, inured to the permanent noise and litter and tourists peeing in the streets, welcomed the newfound tranquillity. The pandemic, they told the Washington Post, was “a blessing in disguise”.
COVID has offered a rare, if not unique chance to address tourism’s enduring problems. From how people reach destinations to how tourism is managed within the cities it floods, not to mention the way its benefits and costs are distributed to local communities, the burden of overtourism has long been a concern.
Amsterdammers aren’t the only city dwellers to perceive the current pause as a much needed relief. From Kyoto to Venice, residents see a return to pre-pandemic tourist numbers as a threat, not a promise.
For years, we’ve been told that tourism needs to be sustainable, without much consensus on what sustainable tourism looks like. COVID, meanwhile, has seen the term “resilience” become a go-to for industry insiders and policymakers. But what exactly is resilient tourism? And can it make our cities any more socially and environmentally responsible? Can it make them any better to live in?
Broadly conceived as the ability to manage adversity, resilience is touted as an essential quality for coping with uncertainty and change, stress and shock. As trends go, resilience isn’t new. It was Time Magazine’s environmental buzzword of the year in 2013. It has since become one of the dominant tropes in contemporary debate on everything from island studies and child psychology to urban disaster risk reduction.
The pandemic has of course brought global tourism to a virtual standstill. In 2020, 1 billion fewer international trips were made to tourist destinations than in 2019. Up to 120 million jobs were threatened. So thinking about how this industry, which previously supported one in ten jobs worldwide, might cope with the stress and shock of COVID is no bad thing.
However, critical geographers and political sociologists alike have warned that the concept of resilience is in danger of becoming as empty a notion as sustainability. It has its roots in ecological and engineering thinking, wherein it refers to the ability to return to normal － to a state of equilibrium — after a period of adversity. Critics argue though that, in the social world, we deal not with equilibrium structures, but constant flux.
In a city, there is no normal state to return to. And those affected by natural hazards — a coastal mega-city prone to flooding, say — were vulnerable to begin with. Returning to an original state is therefore as undesirable as it is impossible. Instead, cities adapt.
More broadly, resilience thinking is deemed inherently conservative. With the emphasis it places on bouncing back, it is underscores reactive and short-term solutions. These distract from the need to address the root causes of major challenges such as climate change.
It is also not as harmless a theory as it may seem. When politicians insist that investing in a more resilient city is plain common sense, they often downplay issues of power and inequality. New Orleans is a case in point. Rebuilding after hurricane Katrina in 2005 came at enormous social cost, when the city privileged economic gain over the needs of marginalised communities.
Resilience is nonetheless an elastic concept, and it is increasingly associated not only with the ability to bounce back after a setback, but also to bounce forward — to a new and better state. The UK government’s slogan “ Build Back Better”, has become the mantra for a myriad post-COVID ambitions, particularly with regard to tourism.
That said, as travel restrictions are lifted and the cruise ships return to Venice’s St Mark’s Square, mere weeks after the Italian government promised they wouldn’t, it looks like this golden opportunity to rethink tourism has been lost.
Governments generally seem more interested in a return to business as usual than in thinking about how much tourism we can actually afford. Calls to come up with a fairer, less exploitative model have, at best, been met with a muted political response. Governments appear loath to discourage business trips, despite climate scientists advocating for less air travel, because they bring in money.
Any attempt to make tourism truly resilient, however, has to go further than short-term economic recovery. It has to address the tourism sector’s carbon footprint and its injustices and ethical quandaries.
In this respect, Amsterdam presents an interesting model. COVID has accelerated the implementation of several measures under consideration well before the pandemic took hold. The city has adopted ordinances that variously prevent souvenir shops from displacing local businesses, developers from turning residential spaces into holiday lets, and new hotels from being built.
Elsewhere, it has hiked up the tax tourists pay for overnight stays and introduced measures to reduce the so-called incivilities (littering, public urination) they unthinkingly leave behind.
More broadly, it has become the first city ever to embrace British economist Kate Raworth’s doughnut economics model for sustainable development. This theory centres on the environment and the basic needs of its citizens as opposed to economic growth. The council has pledged to use it as a guideline for all future policies that govern urban life — from emissions regulations to fixing the city’s housing crisis.
It is still too early to say whether these efforts will pay off. Without a similarly bold rethink, though, more residents will likely rebel against the touristification of their communities. If, on the other hand, more cities follow the Dutch capital’s example (as Copenhagen, Brussels, Dunedin in New Zealand and Nanaimo in Canada are reportedly doing), the idea of a real bounce forward might indeed apply.

By the time we visited Amsterdam, we read enough blog posts and talked to other travelers who raved about Amsterdam and figured we just had to go there. It just didn’t do it for me.
As a person who enjoys the beauty of architecture, it wasn’t as stunning in comparison to the other places I’ve just traveled through in Europe, Brussels and Barcelona. Amsterdam is a place of things to do over a place of things to see. If you really want to enjoy Amsterdam then you should focus on the houses, and museums, as there are few stunning points of interest in the city.
Amsterdam felt like a trip to Brooklyn, N.Y. on steroids, which made sense after I learned Brooklyn and Harlem were designed by the Dutch and New York used to be New Amsterdam.
Being that Amsterdam is a place of things to do, I focused on food, museums and the major attractions.
The major visually pleasing attractions:
Must try foods / snacks:
Must Do Activities:
Note: Only a select few ‘coffeeshops’ sell alcohol at theses establishments
I think 2–3 days in Amsterdam is more than enough to be able to enjoy what it has to offer. I’d schedule the visit for a weekend so you can enjoy the party scene in Amsterdam as well. I can’t say I’ll be back to visit any time soon, but I will say this is a place I could easily live in because there’s plenty to do.
Pro Tips:
Almost everyone in Amsterdam speaks English
The Dutch are very rude, but just be aware of it and accept it , New Yorkers are rude as well
Bicycles have the right of way, get out of the way or they WILL hit you
Look left and right before crossing and beware that you’re not accidentally in the bike lane

My journey to Amsterdam started in Paris, and to be honest, I was desperate for Amsterdam because I compare it to other places all the time:
Sin City vs. the City of Love. But, this is just a preamble.
On the first evening, I met with some speakers from the conference, and we did an excellent night tour. The next day, I went to the fantastic Van Gogh Museum, which encouraged me, with a cultural elixir, to continue my art.
Preparations for the conference were underway at full speed, and organizers were working like bees and doing their best to bring all React lovers around the world to one place. That place was Amsterdam.
After some preparations and checking the area where I would talk, I went to the boat speaker dinner, which was a lot of fun. I met React rock stars, and we officially put the React Amsterdam flag up.
Surfing between bikes and boats,I arrived at the meeting in the early morning full of energy after a fantastic breakfast in the middle of the city.
That was a well-organized event, and I met a lot of curious people who were seeking new knowledge and frontend energy.
It causes me to remember my first conference in Moscow. The community has grown so much since the first React release. Now, React is not a geeky thing; it is the enterprise standard. Now, React is not a question anymore.
The React native session surprised me a lot; I did not expect some prototypical framework that I saw two years ago to become a big thing.
Also, I had recorded a marvelous frontend podcast during the conference to share my knowledge with the Russian speaking frontend community.
My talk was the last one. It took a lot of coffee to be ready to spread my energy and show cool stuff.
Many people said the music was bombastic and that they want me to continue playing on the stage. ;) I’ve decided next time I will do a Full Music of React session. :) Why not?
I want to thank the organizers for this opportunity to speak at the most prominent React conference in the world. See you all at something big next year.

“Your body is not a temple, it’s an amusement park. Enjoy the ride.”
-Bourdain
The ferry dropped us off at the Amsterdam Centraal train station at 2pm, amid the most perfect spring day. It looked like a real-life Truman Show, the way everyone was smiling and laughing without a care. Even the pigeons looked happy, chilling by the canal, generously sharing food.
It made me wonder…
Are people happy because they’re in Amsterdam, or do happy people just gravitate there, making it so? Hard to tell. Sounds like a chicken/egg situation. Speaking of which, I’ve always wondered if people weigh more because of their genes or because their caloric intake is higher, and they work out less. Like, if you took two people who eat and workout the same amount but one’s family has been fat for generations (like mine) and the other skinny, would they end up weighing the same exact amount? I ask because I’ve always felt predisposed to fatness due to my dad’s genes.
Before looking for a hostel, I wanted to get high, so I went in the first “coffee shop” I saw. Now would be a good time to describe the difference between coffee shops in America and coffee shops in Amsterdam. They look the same, except in Amsterdam, some sell weed. Pretty simple.
I ordered a pre-roll and a latte. If cocaine and heroin together is a speed ball, weed and coffee together is more like a curveball. Part of me felt demure, sitting there smoking a joint by myself in a café. The other part though, was high as fuck, and VERY paranoid. The American penal system was so ingrained in me that my Pavlovian response to being high was an intense fear of the police. No matter how much I reassured myself that I wasn’t breaking the law, I couldn’t shake the fear of being arrested. You don’t realize you’re paranoid amidst the paranoia. If you did, you wouldn’t be paranoid.
*
On my walk to find a hostel I couldn’t stop laughing at the ridiculousness of the street names. I wrote some of my favorites down. I also made up some of my own. See if you can guess which are which. I can’t even remember myself.
- Brouwersgracht
- Hosenlendinvein
- Princeneiland
- Amsterveenseweg
- Grunarpeilveg
- Einelpenilhar
- Brouwersgracht
The hostel I chose was a far cry from The Flying Pig, the “it” place I’d read about in my research. The Flying Pig was the most popular hostel for people under 30 (still is) because it has a weed smoking section in the common area where they have pipes and bongs to rent. There was a communal element, one I was not looking for. I don’t like being part of groups and try to avoid it whenever possible. I want to do what I want to do, not what “us” wants to do. “Us” is always some lame compromise. Instead, I went with an off-brand hostel, one that catered to an older, more laid-back crowd. When I booked it online from London, the picture made it look like a nondescript Holiday Inn Express. It was a little off the beaten path, but not too far from the action. It seemed clean, calm, and quiet, exactly what I wanted.
When I checked in, it did seem both clean and calm. But, to my surprise, I heard jackhammering. When I inquired, the manager told me there would be construction every day from 9am-5pm. I thanked him and went up to my room.
That’s how I am, I thank people who inconvenience me. I’ve always been way too accommodating, even to my own detriment. I try to save the world one favor at a time. I could have very easily found another hostel that didn’t have Jackhammering, but that, somehow, in my mind, would have been considered breaking a commitment. The hostel was probably struggling because of the jackhammering, and I wanted to help. I know, that’s crazy.
When I got up to my room, there was, in fact, a man jackhammering five feet from my window. It sounded like the gunfight from Heat. So, I turned right around and got out of there.
On my way down I saw the Manager again.
Manager: Sir, how is your room?
Me: Perfect. Thank you.
I still had an hour to kill before the jackhammering stopped, so I set out to buy weed, enough to last at least a week. After 5 minutes of walking, I stumbled upon a place called Coffee Shop Bob Marley. From the outside, it looked exactly like you’d think it would, Jamaican flag, pictures of Bob, Wailers albums. It was corny, but it would do. Afterall, they had weed for sale.
When I entered, I was greeted by an old budtender who looked exactly like Willie Nelson, all the way down to the bandana. From his voice, I could tell he was an American ex-pat. He handed me a Trapper Keeper-style three ring binder. In it were plastic pages with little slots for what traditionally would have been baseball cards. Instead of cards though, each quadrant contained a nugget of weed, along with a description (e.g. purple haze: mellow, euphoric). It was the first time I’d seen such a professional setup, and it blew me away. I’d smoked weed daily for 5 years but had never dreamt of such a variety. I’d hit the motherload.
After much consideration, I selected 4 indica strains and paid Willie 60 Euros for the 14-gram purchase, an amazing deal anywhere in the world at that time.
Me: May I light up in here?
Willy: Of course. The smoking room is in back.
The smoking room was just a small, curtained off area with a few high-top tables. A Bob Marley music video played on the television hanging on the wall. I put my bag down and removed a grape White Owl cigar that I’d bought before leaving London. At the time I was still smoking blunts and I wanted to “represent” my “culture” while in Europe. Ha. What I didn’t consider, was that I’d barely smoked the previous two weeks in New York. And, though I smoked a few hash spliffs the night before in London, my tolerance was still lower than usual. Regardless, I went ahead and rolled a 2.5-gram monster of Afghan Kush.
There were two other people in the room with me, a couple, who both appeared to be in their 30’s. I couldn’t hear their voices, but I assumed they weren’t from America. I did that with everyone who wasn’t traveling in a group. There’s just something about Americans, we love traveling in guided groups. Very rarely did I see a duo of American travelers, let alone a solo one. When I dumped the guts of the blunt into a garbage bin near the wall, they stared in my direction. They didn’t say anything, but I could tell they were interested in what I was constructing. I was proud of my blunt rolling skills and wanted to put on a show for them, so they could see how we did it in the states. I considered myself an ambassador.
After licking the blunt closed, I sparked my lighter, running the flame along the paper to dry it out. Then, I lit it, taking a deep drag and coughing slightly. The couple, again, glanced my way. I looked back at them, smiling like a cool dude.
About halfway through the blunt, I realized I’d made a huge mistake. I wasn’t cool at all. In fact, I was sweating bullets and overcome with dizziness. I could tell the couple wanted to check on me, they just weren’t sure if it was their place to do so. I mean, I must’ve known what I was doing, right? You don’t just roll a blunt like that if it’s your first time smoking weed.
My equilibrium was totally askew. I gripped the small, circular table like we were Greco Roman wrestling. I had to say something before it was too late.
Me: My name is Sam. I’m from America. If I die, my mom’s name is Audrey —
Then I passed out and fell off my chair.
When I came to, Bob Marley’s I Shot the Sheriff was playing on the tv. The couple was hovering over me, disturbed, their highs obviously ruined. Willie was concerned too, standing over me with a bottle of water. I didn’t even know how long I’d been out.
Willy: We were scared, man. Glad you’re ok. We don’t even allow cigars in here.
Lady: That was so scary. Why would you try smoking that whole blunt?
Me: You know what blunts are?
Guy: Of course. We’re from America too.
*
On my way back to the hostel, I passed what looked to be the strangest food establishment I’d ever seen. It reminded me of a Gray’s Papaya, a New York hot dog chain I loved, in that there was no seating inside. In fact, there was nothing at all inside. It was just an empty room, like an American check cashing place. Yet, it smelled like fast food. It was too weird to not investigate.
When I went in, I thought I was tripping out. I was still extremely high and woozy from the fall, but I was pretty sure I was standing inside a life-sized vending machine. The walls were lined with rows and rows of slots where hot food was kept. There must have been a kitchen in the back where everything was prepared, but I didn’t see one, nor could I hear one. The only sign of human life was the hand of an employee replenishing the stock after a sale. I didn’t love the impersonality of it all, but I had to admit it was ingenious.
My dad would have loved to have access to a place like that, where he could anonymously buy food without the judgement of a cashier. It’s just you and the food, no interaction whatsoever, perfect for an addict.
I was enjoying my burger on a nearby bench, when off in the distance I saw the glow of the Red-Light-District. Until that point, I’d thought the name “Red-Light-District” just referred to the illicit activities that went on there, I didn’t know it was a literal description of the place. It looked like a devilish carnival, the dope dealers being the carnies, and the ladies, the rides. Young adults, mostly backpackers, lined the outskirts, trying to get up the nerve to make the plunge. “How pathetic,” I thought to myself. “I can’t believe I’d wanted to do this.”
*
March 26, 2006
After a wonderful night of stoned sleep, I woke up to my alarm at 8:45am, which left me the perfect amount of time to shower, eat, do laundry, and get to the Smart Shop right when it opened. They call places that sell mushrooms “smart shops” the way they call weed stores “coffee shops”. I’ve always found that to be telling. Those are delicate, non-fear inducing terms. We don’t have “safety stores” in America, we have “Gun and Ammo” shops. Rather crude, if you ask me.
I’d done mushrooms a handful of times before, with experiences ranging from spiritual bliss to utter madness, but I’d always learned something about myself in the process, and that was the most important part. Wait, that’s not totally true. Sometimes, I just spend 4 hours in the bathroom trying to wipe pee that isn’t there off my pants. A psychologist would have a field day with that one.
When I entered the Smartshop, I was greeted by the kind of guy you’d think would be running a psychedelic mushroom store, long hair, flannel shirt, monk vibes.
Clerk: How may I help you?
Me: Can you please advise me on which mushrooms I should take, and the quantity?
Clerk: Of course. That is exactly what I am here for. Have you done psilocybin before?
Me: Yes, maybe 20 times.
Clerk: Ok, let me walk you through what we have.
He took me over to a glass case with about 15 varieties of mushrooms, some wet, some dry, all of them unique in shape and color. He walked me through their different levels of potency and their array of effects.
Me: How about something in the medium-strength level?
Clerk: Sure. Would you like to see visuals?
Me: Yes, please.
Clerk: I suggest 1 to 2 grams of the High Hawaiian variety, dried.
Me: Will they make me laugh?
Clerk: Ooohhh yeah.
I paid him 25 Euros and exited the Smartshop with my mushrooms. Then, I walked over to the canal. There was a light mist, so I found an unoccupied bench and dried a small spot for myself. I took the mushrooms out of my bag, along with a banana I’d saved from breakfast and a bottle of water. Then I said my usual pre-hallucinogen prayer. “Lord, please look after me during this trip. And please, please don’t let me think I peed my pants.”
Once I had the mushrooms down and the nausea passed, I sat back and read my book until the words no longer looked like words, maybe 30 minutes. That’s when the laughing started. EVERYTHING was funny. I spent 10 minutes laughing at my shoes because they looked like chili dogs. Then it was the word “wanker.” I couldn’t stop saying it. “Oy ye wanker”, “Aye wanker, quit ya wanking”, “Bloody, scheming wanker.”
Down the canal a few hundred yards away, I saw a tourist boat slowly approaching. There were about 20 or so passengers, all of them Asian. They looked so happy, with their big visors and smiling faces. I was overcome with the urge to connect with them. I stood up and waved my arms, yelling to them as they passed.
“Helllloooooo!!! Welcome to Amsterdam!!!”
They waved back jubilantly, while I cry-laughed in the rain like a maniac, yelling in their direction as they passed by my bench.
“Enjoy your staaayyyy!!”
I greeted 8 boats-worth of people over a 2-hour period. For nearly my entire trip, I worked as a volunteer civil servant for a city I’d just arrived in. You never know where hallucinogens will take you.
I walked back to the hostel soaked; my feet pruned from the rain. What I needed more than anything was a peaceful place to come down and dry off. When I got to my room, I was delighted to find none of my roommates there, a rare occurrence in a 4-person room. I toweled off and hung my clothes on the edge of the bunk before getting into my bed to reflect and relax. I couldn’t have felt calmer, laying there. My heart was pure, and my thoughts, loving.
Then the jackhammering started up. I’d completely forgotten about it. And this time, because of the mushrooms, it sounded even louder and more menacing than before. My trip was turning dark, and I had to make a move. Either go down and watch the BBC in the lobby, which would inevitably end up in conversation, or spend the next hour showering.
I went with the shower.

March 27, 2006
I came to the next morning, feeling exfoliated, if nothing else. My clothes were dry, finally, so I set out to find an outdoor market where I could buy an extra pair of cheap pants in case I found myself in a similar situation again. In America, we call them swap meets. They’re the same thing, just with a bad name.
When I was on my way out, I saw the manager.
Manager: Sir, how has your stay been?
Me: Perfect. Thank you. Is there an outdoor market where I can buy pants and food?
Manager: The Albert Cuyp Market would be the place.
To his credit, it was the place. Within 10 minutes of being there I bought a pair of cheap sweatpants, an onion and herring sandwich, and a crepe. I am perhaps the only person in history to purchase those 3 exact items at once. I wanted to experience the local delicacies though, and figured I could knock em out in one fail swoop. The meal brought back memories of my Bubbie, who I missed dearly. She loved herring and crepes (separately). Seeing me holding them at the same time would’ve given her a good chuckle. She’d probably ask, “What is it, my birthday?” My father loved crepes too, but the image of him eating 30 crepes is not a pleasant memory to conjure up.
After finishing my meal, I went in my pocket for dessert, 20mg of Adderall. My mom told me my Bubbie took uppers in the 60’s, when they prescribed it to housewives as a weight loss drug. I bet her grandma was a speed freak too, drinking that Coca Cola with actual cocaine in it.
I needed to charge up, and without sleep, Adderall was the best way to do that (even with sleep, for that matter). I was on a mission to find a bar that evening. And not just a bar for that night, but one I could call home in future visits. I still had a month or so left in my trip and knew I’d be back to Amsterdam, so I needed to have a reliable place to hang my hat. Bars are that important to me. I can’t just go any old place to drink willy nilly. I need a home base, somewhere I feel comfortable, where they know my name. Like the Commonwealth.
I had no clue where I was going to find it, but I knew I’d know it when I saw it (the same way pornography was defined by the Supreme Court in 1964). It took some walking, but then I stumbled upon what was undoubtably the place. I was standing at the corner of Nieuwebrugsteeg and Warmoesstraat, right where Warmoesstraat turns into Sint Olofspoort. I’m serious. I looked up and there it was… The perfect bar. The sign under the awning read: “H. Murray’s Bar.” Next to it was a smaller sign that read “Anno 1619.” It looked to be more of a house than a bar. There was even a Golden Retriever in the window, standing with its’ paws on the sill. A bar dog is a surefire sign of a good bar. If it’s good enough for a dog, it’s good enough for me.
I entered like I was returning home.
Me: Hi. I’m Sam.
Neil: Hello, friend. I’m Neil. That’s Lilly (pointing to the dog). And that’s Norman (pointing to the only other man sitting at the bar).
Me: Hello gents. May I…?
Norman: Pull up a seat, Sam.
Me: I’ll have what Norman’s having.
Always drink what the house drinks. It will endear you to the crowd. For me, that only backfires when the house drink is Sambuca. I hate Sambuca. It tastes like Christmas tree water. Or Malort. Don’t even get me started on the Chicago bars that push that lighter fluid on their clientele. Monsters.
We got to talking and time got to flying, the way it does when you’re around good people. Norman told me about his time in Berkley, about how he knew Tim Leary, Tom Wolffe and the Merry Pranksters, people I’d only known from books like The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, and Hunter’s Hells Angels. We shared the same sense of humor too. When he told me his favorite comedian was Steven Wright, I knew we were cut from the same cloth, only a generation apart.
Steven Wright is one of the more obscure, odd comedians; real dry, great word economy. He can make you laugh in less than 20 words.
“A lot of people are afraid of heights. Not me, I’m afraid of widths.”
“I think it’s wrong that only one company makes the game Monopoly”
I told him to look up Mitch Hedberg, but didn’t bother telling him how Mitch’s death contributed to my quitting stand-up, or that I even did stand-up at all. I couldn’t have done that without crying, so I just listened and enjoyed being a guest.
I wish I remembered more of that night, but that’s how it goes sometimes. I’ve always found sacrificing memory for fun to be a fair trade. Not everything has to be remembered and documented with a picture. I can’t recall most of the best times of my life and I’m just fine with that.

March 28, 2006
They started jackhammering bright and early the next day. Still half-drunk, wearing my clothes from the prior night, I darted down to the lobby to get breakfast before it ended. While scarfing down cold eggs and toast, I checked my pockets and counted the money I had. It was the same exact amount I’d gone out with the night before, along with a few grams of unfamiliar loose weed. John Mulaney has a joke about blacking out and coming home with more money than he left with, and that’s exactly what happened to me. Neil didn’t even charge me. He must’ve denied my attempts at tipping too, because every dollar was still in my wallet. I couldn’t recall his kind gesture, but I was sure I hadn’t just skipped out on my tab. I mean, I was pretty sure. When I’m blacked out, I’m more inclined to try and pay twice than I am to skip out on the bill. One time in New Orleans, I paid my tab, then sat there trying to pay my tab again, four more times. The bartender eventually threw me out.
Some hair of the dog seemed in order. “Hair of the dog” means “Alcohol.” They used to rub it on dog wounds. The way it’s colloquially used now is to say, “you can’t get hungover if you stay drunk.” I still had about an hour before the intense hangover would take hold, and figured a large quantity of Adderall and drinks could fend it off.
I found a nearby Irish Pub and ordered a shot and a beer. Realizing I was American, the bartender tested me before serving me.
Bartender: Do you like George Bush?
Me: He’s a cunt.
Bartender: Guinness and Jameson coming right up.
I drank and gobbled pills the whole afternoon and into the early evening, until I could hardly see straight. Bender mode, engage.
Let’s talk about benders for a minute… During 24 hour-plus drinking benders, your brain swells to the point you can barely remember who or where you are. You become erratic, uncontrollable. For no reason at all, you push over garbage cans, rip signs out of the ground, and piss on walls. And you’ll fuck anything with a pulse. You become possessed. And the choice remains… Give up and succumb to the impending hangover or continue on with disregard for all human decency. Either way, you’re fucked.
I marched on. After leaving the bar, I bought a 20oz Heineken and brown bagged it on my walk to nowhere. At least I thought I was going nowhere. My subconscious had a different idea though. I didn’t realize it at first, but I was retracing my steps from the previous day. My boozed soaked brain was leading me to the very place my sober brain found disgusting. I didn’t even realize where I was going until I saw the glowing red lights.
*
I walked the entire length of the Red-Light District multiple times, prowling amongst my fellow creeps, trying to find the perfect lady. I have always been a very discerning shopper, that time being no different. I didn’t just want any random lady; I wanted one who showed interest in me. God, that’s pathetic.
The women all had their own room where they sat, positioned toward the outer sidewalk. The ones who were “busy working” had their large window covered with a red curtain. The others, who were “waiting for work,” had their curtains drawn, allowing you to see the entire layout of the room. They were all similar; a bed in the corner, a small nightstand, presumably for keys or other knickknacks that may interfere with the coitus, and a few mirrors. Everything was red, the lights, the bed, the carpet… Like white is the safest car color, I think red makes for the most fucking.
All the women were objectively gorgeous, much more gorgeous than the sex workers I patronized in Tijuana the prior summer. They were hideous. And they robbed me. I don’t want to talk about that though. These ladies weren’t beaten down, figuratively speaking. They looked confident, even proud, like hard working small-business owners. Some of them weren’t even dressed scantily and gave off a “take it or leave it” vibe, which I dug. There were no pimps in sight either. Just the ladies and their red rooms.
With each trip down the corridor, I narrowed my selection, like I was hosting my own March Madness tournament, pitting lady against lady, with the winner advancing to the next round.
The eventual winner was white, with long, dark brown hair, and weighed about 150 pounds. She curled her index finger and invited me in, licking it between curls with the effort of a champion.
Inside, I met the pimp. He may not have been a pimp technically, but he held the money like a pimp does. And probably for the best. I gave him 50 Euros and he gave me a single condom. He didn’t say a word. Then, he opened the door to the red room.
Tonya: I’m Tonya. What’s your name?
Me: I’m Sam.
I forgot I could lie.
Her bubbliness left. Now she was working. She’d already caught her fish; the rest was just fileting.
Tonya: Bed or standing?
Me: Uhhh, standing.
I feared I might pass out if I lied down
She turned around and faced the dresser, gripping the top of it with her hand. Pulling down her black, lace panties, she began to prepare herself with one hand, the other braced on the dresser. I took my pants down, following her lead.
Lady: Ok, ready.
I tore open the condom and put it on. Then, I inserted myself.
When she moaned, I gained confidence. I started to go faster, and she moaned more, my confidence growing stronger yet. I took my left hand and slapped her ass cheek.
That’s when the pimp came bursting in.
Pimp: NO, NO, NO! NONE OF THAT!
He was pissed. I looked over at him to apologize for my lapse in judgment, and while doing so, ejaculated into the condom I was wearing. I knew I was jizzing. He knew I was jizzing. I knew he knew I was jizzing.
We both jumped back.
Pimp: Ok, that’s it you’re done.
Me: But I didn’t even cum.
He pointed to my shriveling dick.
Pimp: Yes, you did.
I had no recourse. There was jizz in the condom and I couldn’t remove it in his presence, causing a smoking gun, “gotcha!” type of situation. So, I waited until he left the room, then I got dressed, alongside Tonya.
Me: So, Tonya. Thank you very much.
Tonya: (doing a crossword puzzle) Yeah, whatever.
Me: Have a good rest of your evening.
*
March 29, 2006
I woke up the next morning wreaking of vomit. I’d gone to a bar to cement my blackout after having sex with Tonya, but unfortunately, I wasn’t able to drink enough to forget I came while looking into another man’s eyes. I guess that’s the type of memory no amount of alcohol can erase. To this day, I still see his face . I like to think he still sees mine too and were forever cosmically connected through semen.
I knew I’d be back, but I had to get the hell out of Amsterdam, pronto. I needed a reset. I couldn’t fall deeper into depravity so early in the trip. I had to pace myself if I wanted to survive another 2 weeks on the road.
After showering (I know, I’m disgusting for not having showered the night before. Get off me), I headed to the train station and looked at the big board to see what my options were. Paris was appealing but I wasn’t mentally prepared to take an 8-hour train ride. That would have left far too much time to reflect on the previous night. So, when I noticed the option to take a 4-hour bullet train, I jumped at the chance and made a reservation for the 11am departure.

I heard the conductor’s announcement as we approached Rotterdam train station — “Watch out for pickpockets!” We had nothing valuable in our pockets, I thought. The thieves would be disappointed if they picked OUR pockets.
We had barely arrived in Amsterdam two days prior, but we jumped right into action. There was too little time and too much to see. Our American employers weren’t sympathetic to our desire to see the world, and our European or Aussie friends weren’t helping when they flaunted their five-day stay at a place and uncertain departure. We heard that all of Europe shut down in August. What?! What if I got appendicitis?
Jet lag is for wusses and we are biased for action. We have to be. We got our bearings during the first evening in Amsterdam so upon our return from Belgium, we would have an optimized route to tackle our must-see list. The day before, we wandered through Delft and Leiden while keeping an eye on the watch. Thank goodness for the Netherlands’ robust train system and the manageable size of the country. Those little towns were charming even in the rain and vendors in the open market didn’t complain, so why would we?

As a fanatic football fan, it is a dream to watch European Championship knockout match in the stadium. The championship was cancelled in the year 2020 due to pandemic. In 2021 it started with empty stadium and eventually with minimal capacity. Budapest is the only city which got permission to hold international matches with 100% capacity. Thanks to the circumstances that I got a ticket to one of the knockout matches. It was a ticket for Netherlands Vs Czech Republic for round of 16 Euro 2021 match, hosted in Budapest. Without any second thought, I booked tickets. Now during the COVID situation it is hard to travel via Aeroplane. So, that option had been discarded. I’m personally very passionate about drive. Often and regularly whenever I get chance, I go for long drive with my family. Why not in Car ?
As Google says, the distance between Amsterdam and Budapest is around 1400 KM. So, a round trip will be around 2800 KM and we need to complete the same within 72 hours. Challenging ? Isn’t it ? I called my friend, Supratik, another fellow MDM expert, and tell about the plan. He was too very excited and was ready to hit the road.
I have a Tesla Model 3 Long Range AWD Model. As claimed by Tesla, with 100% full charge, it can go upto 580 KM. Off course, I’m not planning to challenge the claim. Even I can complete with scheduled Supercharging facility, I’m good. The plan is to start by Friday evening and end by Monday afternoon.
2800 KM in 72 hours. Fascinating journey. Route plan has been automatically created by GoAnywhere Tool available with Tesla. We are supposed to stop in the designated points. There are total 5 super charger points decided by Tesla Tool and I decided to abide by completely without trusting my own ability of making prediction for charging.
As I’ve approached towards the date, I prepared a mini bucket list to carry. 1. Toothbrush 2. Half Pant (1 extra) 3. T-Shirts (1 extra) 4. Netherlands Flag with Team jersey 5. My wife prepared a flux full of strong coffee and two plates of Noodles prepared in Indian style for the night 6. My laptop, phone and chargers 7. Credit card (For emergency). And 8. Passport and PCR Test result.
I called my Insurance company to check about the Travel Insurance. In order to travel in Germany, Austria and Hungary, three different autobahnvignet was required which I purchased two days before the travel date. PCR Test was mandatory, so we did the same and was expecting the result by 10 PM on the travel date. We decided that once we get the result, we should start.
25th June, 2021 Friday 10:00 PM : just received the PCR Test result for COVID-19 and it was negative. I was good to go. Finally the time came to say BYE to my wife and two daughters for the awaited travel. I started from Almere, Netherlands. Supratik, who was accompanying me, was waiting in Amersfoort. I took him and then started for Budapest.
1:00 AM in the morning. It was 26th June Saturday then when we reached our first destination. The first stop was at Westerwaldpark 4, 56587 Oberhonnefeld-Gierend, Germany. The distance we covered was 308 KM and it took me nearly 3 hours. The sky was clear and Full-Moon was visible like burned Indian Roti. The last time I saw this kind of moon was in my village when I was 7 years. Looking at the moon just reminded me those days. We were tempted to take some the pictures of Moon while the Tesla was getting charged. Supratik was carrying SLR Camera, he took some good photo of the red moon. I had my half portion of meal (prepared by my wife). It was a short break of around 20 minutes and the car was ready for another destination.
3:20 AM I stopped at Hauptstraße 231, 63879 Weibersbrunn, Germany. The distance travelled so far was around 500 KM. I found myself little fatigue and took a break of 30 minutes with the strong Indian Coffee. Sipping the home-made coffee in the middle of the road was enjoyable. I feel loved.
7:00 AM stopped at Junkersstraße 3, 93055 Regensburg, Germany. The distance covered 870 KM so far. Took a break for 30 minutes. It was morning with super Sun shine. I really needed a coffee. Oh yeah !! before I forgot to mention, my fellow friend was sleeping from start, as I imagined he was actually dreaming with his seat belts on. I was so certain because, he had not even moved while I stopped, had a coffee and completed the charging.
10:00 AM Rasthausstraße 3, 4300 St. Valentin, Austria. We crossed the Austrian border around 8:00 AM in the mornging. The distance travelled so far was 1050 KM. Took 30 mins break here.
2:00 PM Győrújbarát M1 autópálya, 119. kmsz, 9081 Hungary. The distance travelled so far 1300 KM. Unfortunately, I detour at Viena. The usual road shows the route bypassing the city of Viena. I took the road though the city. It was around 12–00 noon, the traffic was medium. That increased the travel time by 30 mins. At around 1:00 PM, I crossed border of Hungary and Austria. Once I reached the pre-defined Supercharger location, took 30 mins break. I was feeling Hungry. I had bread with Goulash soup.
3:30 PM Budapest. The distance travelled so far was 1400 KM. Total time of travel is approximately 17 hrs 30 minutes. It was hot outside around 35 degrees sunny. Dog tired.
Tesla is incredible. My highest speed was about 220 KM per hour in the Germany autobahn. There are plenty super charging facility available. So, you don’t need to worry about it. GoAnywhere tool automatically determines the best available route for your journey. Return journey was around the same. We started from Budapest at 11–00 PM on Sunday 27th June. I returned Home (Almere, NL) at 5–00 PM Monday 28th June. It took me 16 hours to return. Faster though !!

My sons were profiled by a racist predictive policing system — the AI Act must prohibit these systems,https://medium.com/@FairTrials/my-sons-were-profiled-by-a-racist-predictive-policing-system-the-ai-act-must-prohibit-these-b2ea66a9a763,"Sign up

By Diana Sardjoe
When I found out my sons were placed on lists called the ‘Top 600’ and the ‘Top 400’ by the local Amsterdam council, I thought I was finally getting help.
The council says the purpose of these lists, created by predictive and profiling systems, is to identify and give young people who have been in contact with the police “extra attention from the council and organisations such as the police, local public health service and youth protection,” to prevent them from coming into contact with police again. [1]
This could not have been further from the truth.
These predictive systems assess and profile young people in Amsterdam to determine who is likely to commit crimes in the future; the ‘Top 600’ profiles children over the age of 16, the ‘Top 400’ profiles children under 16.
As a result of my sons being profiled by these systems, they were continually monitored and harassed by police. One was repeatedly accused of criminal activity along with other young boys he hung out with. Another time, I had to deal with police coming into my home. My son was arrested and I had to go and pick him up from the detention centre late at night. Other mothers I know were threatened with having their children taken away.
We had to deal with a system based on prejudice, with the weight of the authorities behind it. I was completely alone in this struggle, and there was nothing I could do. During this time, my sons withdrew further and further. I felt like a prisoner, watched and monitored at every turn, and I broke down mentally and physically, ending up on cardiac monitoring.
These events were an eye-opener for me, and it made me look for answers. How did my sons end up on these lists? What information do they use to decide this? How is it that it is always young, minoritised ethnic boys on these lists? How do the authorities have so much information on me and my family, and how is that justified? When does the monitoring start — and when does it end? I started a group for other mothers called The Mother is the Key, to share our stories, and start questioning and challenging the authorities.
So let me tell you the problems with these profiling systems.
First of all, the information they had about me and my family was inaccurate and prejudiced. The authorities’ data collection on young people often starts in school, the Top400 system uses this information to profile children. [2] Maybe the child missed some days of school. Maybe they had to go to a different school. All this information is registered, and it is used by the Top400 system to profile a child as a future criminal.
Once these authorities make a negative report about you, and it’s filed away in their system, you’ll never get rid of it. This is the consequence of our database society: you no longer have control over your life. Every time you interact with an authority or agency, you notice that they are suspicious of you, that they hold some prejudice against you. Your data and these profiles and predictions are shared amongst different public authorities, and held against you forever.
Another piece of information the police use to profile young boys on these lists is ‘contact’ they have had with the police. [3] This contact is often purely the result of ethnic profiling. I once saw my son, aged thirteen, being stopped by police and asked for ID while he was walking home down the street. That was enough for him to be registered on the police database as having had ‘contact’ with them. In this way, racist policing becomes hard-wired in the police data, and young men from racialised backgrounds are of course unfairly over-represented within that data. The information that goes into these systems is the same as the information that comes out. If prejudice goes in, prejudice will come out.
These predictive and profiling systems used by police and criminal justice authorities always use this same racist data and produce the same outputs. They are based on the idea of what a ‘criminal’ is, what their background and profile is, something that in western countries is often tied to ethnic minorities. Anyone who fits this mould is considered a ‘risk’ and criminalised. The majority of young people profiled by the Top400 and Top600 are minoritised ethnic people, including people with Moroccan or Surinamese heritage, or from neighbourhoods and districts where there are many residents with migrant backgrounds.
I do not agree with the use of these predictive and profiling systems, and I think they should be banned. They are inaccurate and racist, and they label people as criminal, including children, before they have done anything wrong, often just based on their background. This is completely unjust, and we must act before it is too late.
Many groups in Europe have investigated and challenged the use of these harmful data-driven technologies. In the US, where many of these technologies were first implemented, community groups have advocated for and legislated to prohibit predictive policing systems and other invasive surveillance technologies, like facial recognition. We must prohibit them in Europe too.
The AI Act, a law which aims to regulate these types of systems, is currently being considered by the European Parliament. But this proposed law does not go far enough — yet. It should ban law enforcement and criminal justice authorities from using these predictive and profiling systems completely, to protect people like my sons from racism and injustice.
Tell you MEP to ban predictive systems in policing and criminal justice here. It takes less than one minute.

After spending a great weekend in Amsterdam and an even better Monday in picturesque towns of Volendam, Zaanse Schans, and Haarlem, on Tuesday I attended the Firebase Summit held at the magnificent concert hall named Muziekgebouw aan ‘t IJ.
At the entrance I was greeted by the Firebase team with a free 👕. Afterwards, together with other Firebasers™, I had delicious breakfast 🥐🧀🍪 and some pitch-black ☕ (there was no milk 😞). While mingling with other people and strolling through the crowd, I was amazed by diversity of this year’s Firebase Summit. There were people from all over Europe, with all kinds of backgrounds, and all kinds of problems that Firebase was helping them to solve.
A bit later, doors of the mesmerizing Auditorium opened and the keynote began.
What we could expect from this year’s summit was presented to us by Sam Ramji, Francis Ma, and Kristen Johnson. There were a lot of new things that we were going to hear more about that day; Firebase Prediction, Firebase Crashlytics, Redesign of the console, new A/B testing framework, and much more.
The day was filled with great sessions, interesting ideas, and general positiveness 🙌. In my opinion, the highlight of the summit was the session “Actionable insights with Firebase Predictions” held by Jumana Al Hashal and Subir Jhanb. I had a great time being a lab 🐁 and choosing between 🇩🇰, 🇩🇲, 🇩🇴, 🐑, 🐘, 🦅.
Firebase Predictions was by far the biggest announcement of the summit. This talk just scratched the surface of this topic and excited one’s imagination when it comes to all the new and undiscovered things that can be done using this powerful tool.
There were some great things to do between the sessions. You could go to the #AskFirebase lounge and speak with people who were behind all this Firebase magic. There, I had the opportunity to speak with Kat Fang and Jon Mensing about problems and new features of Firebase Android SDK as well as about the future of Firebase in general. Another way to kill the time between the sessions was to play AppShip3000.
Of course, you could go crazy in the photo booth.
After the closing notes, there was a crazy party that I had to miss in order to catch my bus 😭. I hope that the next Firebase Summit will be at least as good as this one, and I also hope that I would be able to stay for the party next year.
If you are interested to see in detail what happened at the Firebase Summit 2017, recordings of all the sessions can be found in this playlist.

I landed in Amsterdam pretty late, and then immediately took the wrong train from the airport. I doubled back and got on the right one, and then when I switched to the aboveground at Lelylaan station, I got on that going the wrong direction too. Thanks to GPS I realized this after just one stop, but once I got on the tram going opposite, my phone died.
I tried to pronounce the name of the stop to the conductor — Tramhalte Bilderdijkstraat (De Clercqstraat), and he laughed. He understood vaguely what I was saying, and let me know when we arrived, so I found a shop and they happily let me plug my phone in. They also helped me interpret my upside down google maps and told me where to walk.
Just as I left, a woman walked past me and when I looked at her, she SMILED AT ME.
I’ve been traveling for two weeks and I admire hundreds of people every day, I really can’t get enough of the diverse beauty and style over here. Whenever someone notices me looking, I give them a big, genuine smile, because I appreciate them! Guess how many people have smiled back? I was absolutely overjoyed when this Dutch stranger grinned at me, and so even though my 15 minute trip from the airport took me over an hour, Amsterdam felt like the place to be already :]
Wendy was house-sitting for her friends who are on honeymoon. She told me to find the apartment by the pink flamingo in the window. Beautiful!
I think the first thing Wendy said to me was “so ehm, vodka?” I fucking love you Wendy! We had pizza and then her friend Sonja took us to to a special nightclub, MADAM. MADAM is a brand new venue at the top of A’DAM tower, a 360 degree observation deck, over 100 meters high in a city with an average building height of 30 meters. The view is astonishing. It’s the former Shell Oil tower, and I remember thinking, what a nice triumph of man’s sheer will over good sense and modesty — my my, it’s beautiful.
ADAM stands for Amsterdam Dance and Music, and we danced all night on the beautiful rooftop deck. The DJ put on Mike Dunn, Barbara Tucker, Adonis, all on 7″ vinyl which blew me away. There’s an observation hole in the middle of the dancefloor, so you can look down and see the ground 100 meters below. Scary!
To get to the tower, we had just followed Sonja by bike, it’s about a 30 minute ride to anywhere from anywhere in Amsterdam and the bike paths are amazingly well maintained. Everyone in Amsterdam rides a bike EVERYWHERE, it’s perfect. Wendy has a super dutch yellow beach cruiser, and it has bars in back and front for passengers.
Wendy was wearing some amazing linen pants which really showed off her perfect bum, her jetpack pants she called them, and a very pretty little Dutch woman in all white told Wendy “you are the most beautiful woman alive, I want to marry you!” The rest of the night, the woman kept telling Wendy how horny she made her, and Wendy went, guess I’m a lesbian tonight!
There’s no bridge to ADAM tower, you have to take a ferry, which is full of bikes and scooters. After we danced till about 3am, we left and took the ferry back over for AIR nightclub. It’s an amazing techno club and has hosted some incredible acts judging by the posters on the walls, but this night was a hip-hop pre-party and after hearing tons of the best house music on earth, you don’t really wanna hear Sean Paul. Wendy’s lover woman came too, and continued to let Wendy know how sexy she is, which I thought was nice of her.
I do love old, sexy hip hop, but I also avoid hip hop clubs because in my admittedly narrow experience people there are aggressive, unfriendly, don’t give too much of a fuck about the music anyway, and are there primarily to get laid.
It’s okay to want to get laid, but when that is everyone’s primary motivation for being somewhere, it makes the party shit for everything else. New hip hop also seems to celebrate ridiculous materialism and encourages people to treat others poorly, especially women.
House music celebrates love, inner beauty, helping each other and valuing diversity, and the people who love to go dance house music are amazing because they really seem to embody these attitudes.
We left AIR after about an hour for a gay club called NYX that’s meant to be incredible, but it was nearly closed when we got there so we went home.
SATURDAY
NOMADS IS THE BOMB!!!! The way it’s been described to me, during Awakenings everyone and their mom comes from all over NL and the world to be one of fifty thousand people in a pitch black tent listening to Richie Hawtin whine, but the lovely people who actually live in Amsterdam get the heck out of the city and get to Nomads.
NOMADS
Wendy and I biked there, it rained lightly on us and took about twenty minutes. We arrived at 4pm and lots of people were chaining up their bikes, but once we got in, there was plenty of beautiful space to dance.
Festival mania is everywhere though, and within an hour the place was fucking PACKED, in the rain!
Robert Owens was jammin, and got on the mic and told us ‘ain’t nothin but house party baby, you’re in the house with Robert!” Embarrassingly enough, I actually didn’t recognize his face at first, and Joppe laughed when I asked who he was. I hate FILAS but Owens had on some pretty nice designer inspired sneakers I’d never seen before (No Rick).
The festival gave limited edition “Nomads” slipmats to all the performers, with their names and some lovely artwork.
Moomin was straight Moomin, I love the guy. We spent a lot of time at his stage dancing, all the stages used d&b audiotechnik line arrays with massive infrabass stacks and the sound was INCREDIBLE. If you’re putting together a club soundsystem, remember, sub harmonics are essential!
I bumped in to my old boy Dieuwer, and Vincent and Joyce from the Midnight City crew who I met exactly a year ago when they hosted thatmanmonkz. If you’re in Amsterdam, look up Midnight City and pray they are doing something while you are around cause their parties are so good!! It’s very nice to see old friends :]
I also made lots of new friends, as wonderful Dutch people would come up to me up just to dance and talk and they told me about Dutch music, dance culture, fashion, designer drugs, festivals, love, drugs again, etc.
The Lumberjacks in Hell stage was non-stop fury. Marcel Vogel, Mr. Mendel, Rahaan, and Red Greg served up endless, impeccable disco. While Red Greg was playing, Rahaan was standing behind him and going wild at every mix, he couldn’t contain his excitement, and the crowd absolutely fed off of it, everything was perfect.
After Moomin, Nick V, Titia, and Carlos Valdes went back to back. Everyone was wonderful, but every time Carlos came on he was simply next level. It’s a really interesting thing, DJing, because these guys are playing other people’s music, they’re mostly selectors, but there are intangible qualities which make these guys immediately distinguishable from each other. It’s like, texture, presence, loudness, and MAGNETISM.
Mike Huckaby did a double take and started laughing when he saw me. I’d just caught him in Detroit and joked about how I’ve showed up in the weirdest places on Earth, ever since he took a video after his gig in Barcelona two years ago and I was in the front row getting loose. He was playing in Sicily the next weekend and I would have loved to have made it, but I had to get to Croatia!
SUNDAY
For Awakenings, you get to Amsterdam central station, and then there’s a shuttle for ten euros (bus #999, gasp!) which takes you fifteen minutes out to an industrial park in the middle of nowhere with some wind turbines. You get off, and then you have to walk about thirty minutes through the wilderness along a path to the festival entrance.
A kid got kicked off the shuttle right when we were about to leave the station, cause he snuck on without a ticket. The security guard took his drink, and then spilled it all over himself trying to throw it away.
I meant to get something to eat at Amsterdam central, but one ATM was broken so the line for the other was like twenty minutes, and by then I didn’t want to waste any more time.
When I got to the entrance and gave my name for the guestlist, they told me I was actually on a paid list, and it would be fifty euro. I said single day tickets are fourty-five euro, what? The other lady behind the counter chimed in and said yeah, but with fees and everything.. I said so what’s the point of the list? They laughed, and then I paid the fifty euro. I waltzed in and immediately got a “premium hot dog”, and then caught some of Damian Lazarus.
The festival grounds are HUGE, and the installations are pretty incredible, but after such a sexy, intimate experience at Nomads where everyone is chatting up everyone, where it feels like family, being lost in anonymity at Awakenings made me feel a bit lonely. Even by yourself at Nomads, the stages are small and you can climb up next to the DJ booth, so you feel like you’re part of something and you’re enjoying the music from the “inside.”
At Awakenings, the stages are twenty feet off the ground, so it’s just a bunch of DJ shows, you squint to see who is playing in most of the tents. There are some nice outdoor stages, I stayed and danced for most of Paco Osuna’s set, and every time there was a big build or something, they shot fire and smoke from the stage.
I bumped in to the lady in all white who asked Wendy to marry her, and she told me that she was still horny. She was with her friends, all laughing hysterically, and she asked me if I like women or men and I said women, so she said let’s hang out, and I said cool, but I had to go get something to eat though, and then we never bumped in to each other again.
I met a friend from Nomads the night before, and she took me with her friends in to the middle of the tent Maceo Plex was playing at. You couldn’t see much, pitch black, techno I didn’t really enjoy, and you just stood in your space and danced. I knew it was a shit question, but I asked a few people if they had ever come SOBER to stand in the middle of this crowd, and just listened to techno and dance silently. Everyone said “I’ve never thought about that,” which was strange.
After the festival I walked back, through the fields, to the bus, to the tram. Wendy was at Bram’s, and she sent me a photo with directions from her place. We had a drink and I found this place De Skool on Resident Advisor. The headlining DJ had a mix online which was just African drumming.
We got there, and some kids outside told us it was like trippy electro. I asked two guys who were leaving how the party was, and they said “it’s shit, mate. they found pills on us and kicked us out. i’d forgot I even had them.
De Skool is amazing. It’s an old primary school I guess, it has this campy front entrance like where you’d imagine kids would have sat at recess, enormous long empty corridors, a beautiful park in the middle where vines and trees have overgrown the jungle gym, and when you take the stairs down to the dancefloor, the fun really starts. The basement is the size of the entire building, and it’s completely filled with fog, so you can only see a few feet in front of you, but you can tell that off in the distance there’s music and movement. You walk through the fog like you’re in outer space or something, and then eventually you come upon this insane, sweaty mob of Dutch kids, who happened to be going nuts dancing to acid house. I’ve never been a huge fan of acid before, and in this context, it was PERFECT, it sounded amazing and Wendy and I had a blast.
love ya Wendy, thanks Sonja, till the next time Amsterdam!

I’m starting my 4-weekish adventure today and I’m still not quite sure if I’m a excited about it. The thing is: I’ve been looking forward to this trip for a while now, yet my knees have been acting up lately and I’m very worried that they might deter me from completing this adventure. But, I’m just going to give it a try.
Here’s a quick overview of my current status and what I’m planning to do: I arrived in Germany on the evening of Saturday, August 3rd. I spent the next day packing my bags and in the evening I’d invited friends and family to celebrate my 45th birthday. It was a mild summer evening and there were about 20 of us. (I’m really lucky to have friends who just make time for me at the spur of the moment as I’d only announced this little gathering few days before.) For the next few weeks, the plan is to cycle from Amsterdam to Budapest (from point A to point B) via Hamburg, Berlin, Dresden, Prague, Vienna and Bratislava. I’ll be returning via the night train from Vienna.
Today, Monday August 5th, I got up early and headed to the train station bright and early. Another worry, on top of the worry about my knee, had planted itself in my head: while I’d bought a train ticket to Amsterdam, I didn’t purchase the ticket for my bike. Shit! And my friends last night mentioned that recently they’ve had a really hard time to get reservations for their bikes. Shit! It’s so like me to forget essential things like this and it reminds me of what my mom used to tell me: “If your head wasn’t attached to your body…” (Speaking of my mom: 5 years ago, when I was starting my bike pilgrimage to Puglia, my mom still bid me goodbye in the morning. It’s now over two years that she’s gone and this morning I got a little sentimental about that.) Yet, as much as my head isn’t always working properly, luck usually tends to be on my side and I ended up being able to book a separate bike ticket. Phew!
I know a lot of people dislike the Deutsche Bahn (German Rail) because of severe delays and cancellations , ( newsflash to my non-German friends: German trains are no longer in sync with stereotypes about my people) but today everything went super smooth! I even arrived in Amsterdam five minutes early and the conductor apologized for this “inconvenience” over the intercom. (Amsterdam is obviously not in Germany but the German Intercity train, originating in Berlin, brought me there.)
From the train station I headed straight to the hotel in a neighborhood called Weesperzijde. The hotel is very trendy: a mixture of hotel, co-working space, café/bar and community hub. I feel way too old but the price was right. What surprised me a lot is that the hotel doesn’t have a dedicated bike parking space. I mean: Amsterdam is such a bicycle-friendly city, yet I have to park my bike on the busy street outside the hotel.
After I’d freshened up, I ventured into the city center with my bike and let myself float through the narrow streets filled with tourists. Turns out it was Pride weekend just yesterday and it was quite a joy seeing the streets and shops still adorned with rainbow flags. This inspired me to mingle with the gays and I looked up where the next gay bar was: I was ready for a refreshing beer. I ended up at a pub called “The Queen’s Head”, which was refreshingly retro/vintage and not busy at all. I ended up sitting by the window with a view of the canal. Here, I caught up on messages and started writing this blog.
After a couple pints, I was sufficiently tipsy which led to the terrible decision to have McDonald’s for dinner. After that, I went back to Weesperzijde, where I sat by the canal and watched the sun set over the typical Amsterdam brick houses.
When I got back to the hotel, I turned into a bitch. I become one of those guests that I hated when I was working in hotels. Here’s the thing: I was still quite annoyed with the fact that the hotel didn’t have any secure bike parking. As I was about to get into the elevator, I saw a sign “bike parking” and my Sherlock Holmes instincts kicked in. I followed the signs and eventually emerged in a huge bike parking garage. I “stormed” to the front desk and asked the clerk if I could park my bike there. “No”, he said, “ that’s employee bike parking and we park our rental bikes there.” I want to spare you the details of how I blew up, but suffice to say the clerk made an exception for me and allowed me to park my bike in the garage.

Disneyland If You Love Dutch Cheese; Hell If You’re Lactose Intolerant
At least once a year I’m in Amsterdam on business, and for the last couple years have stayed at a hotel in the Centrum that is dangerously close to a brilliant cheese shop. In fact, it might be my favorite cheese shop in the world. To be clear, I did not pick the hotel due to its proximity to the cheese shop, that was just serendipitous. But it would also not be out of the realm of possibilities for me to do something like that either.
De Mannen Van Kass (which translated from Dutch is “The Men of Cheese”) — Dutch Delicacy is not like the other touristy cheese shops across Amsterdam. It’s a tiny little two-story shop in the southwestern part of the Centrum along Spuistraat that runs parallel to and overlooks the Singel canal. It’s not overly advertised with giant signs. It’s not so packed with customers that you can’t walk around and explore. It’s quaint, it’s cozy, it’s intimate, it’s all things cheese. It’s Disneyland if you love Dutch cheese; Hell if you’re lactose intolerant.
The upstairs features three distinct areas: the cheese shop, the deli, and in the very back, a cheese bar. The downstairs is primarily a shop for cheese tools accessories.
The cheese shop itself focuses on local Dutch cheeses and has a large variety for you to sample. Everything from cow to sheep to goat milk is here, both fresh and aged, pure and flavored, hard and soft. There are cheeses that have been made with honey, others with olive, one that was aged in a WWII bunker, one that was aged in a salt mine, one made with coffee, a few with truffles in them, one soft cheese with cumin, and one simply called “The Special One”…there’s so much variety here that it makes each visit both a challenge and a joy. Each cheese is sitting on a shelf with a little bowl of cheese pieces chopped up inside, and a stack of toothpicks you can use to sample them.
The last couple years I’ve gone, the same lovely older woman has been there to personally guide you through the tastings. She’s very sweet and passionate about the cheeses and I’ve walked out a couple times after she’s snuck a little gift into my bad as well, this last time a little Dutch wooden shoe magnet. Her enthusiasm for showcasing the cheeses is infectious and she will sometimes join in trying a sample of what you’re having just to relive the magic through the eyes of the customer. And yes, the samples seem to be unlimited. Or more to the point, I haven’t been escorted from the premises. Yet.
The second part of the upstairs is the deli immediately to the right as you walk in. From here they have many breads and pastries and can make cheese sandwiches for you. I’ve never eaten anything from here yet but there is usually a line. I’m too busy to gobbling up delicious samples. Next time I will definately go for a cheese sandwich becuase this seems like the kind of place that would do an amazing job with such a simple request.
The third part of the upstairs is my favorite spot: the cheese bar. My God, I might have to write a directive on my will that states to spread some of my ashes here becuase I love this place so much. Saddle on up to one of the stools at the bar or my favorite, grab a pillowed seat in the window overlooking the Singel canal, and tell the cheesemonger to give you a nice sampling of their favorite cheeses. Give them a few minutes becuase they’ll run around the store to grab stuff that isn’t in the bar case. When they return, you’re going to have a huge platter of cheese for about €25 ($27 USD) with jams, mustard, pickles, and bread. Perfect for sharing with friends, or consuming by oneself without an ounce of shame. Oh, and there’s free Wi-Fi in case you want to work from here for the day.
The downstairs is reserved for toys for cheese lovers: knives, cheese boards, fondue sets, slicers, Raclette grills, etc. They have quite a bit of accessories from Boska, a Dutch company. I have to admit, I kinda got lost here in all of the varieties of cheese knives alone. However, pro-tip if you’re traveling light: you can find most of this on Amazon, and it’ll save you having to check in knives on the plane.
While this isn’t a restaurant as would typically be featured on this site, it does stand out as one of my favorite food destinations when I travel to Amsterdam. The shop would be perfect if they could serve wine (they do not have a liquor license), but you can make do by going in to grab a bunch of cheeses, then go down the street to the nearest bar or liquor store, grab a glass or bottle, and then just enjoy the cheese with some wine along a canal.
The only way this could be a better moment would be if you added some stroopwafles (which they also sell) and a hot cup of coffee after. There’s actually two very nice bookstores just across the street (one Dutch, and one American) which would also make for a very nice little afternoon of perusing books, drinking wine and eating cheese.
Next time you find yourself in Amsterdam, please stop here and enjoy the wide variety of cheeses. If you are unable to visit Amsterdam in the near future, consider ordering some of their cheeses online and having them shipped.

Exactly two years ago, I met my oldest ever friend to date. The name and details of this star have been changed for privacy purposes. However, the memory is deeply etched in my mind forever.
I remember how I felt as I first walked to the bus stop and later as I waited, sat next to her. She reached for my gloves when they fell and handed them to me, a cute smile etched on her wrinkled face. It was early February, the coldest month of the year. The beautifully trimmed lawn glistened with frost, and the air was crisp and cold -3 degrees. I was shivering, feeling super chilly. I noticed she was in a long gray jacket, not wearing any gloves. I was amazed to see her all by herself, timid in some ways, but stronger and mightier with age. Clearly, the latter is just a number.
“It’s koud,” she smiled and laughed heartily at me as I gloved up and tried to brace my body against the harsh wind.
“Wat is jouw naam?”
“Astrid. Mijn naam is Astrid,” she said adorably.
“Mijn naam is Apurva.” I showed her my travel card to help her better.
“Apurfaa?” she said, her wrinkles stretching with her voice. The skin around her lips moved as she read my name with ease and smiled. A kind one.
“How old are you?” I asked in amazement. I normally don’t intrude so much, but I couldn’t help it.
“I am 92. I am old and wise,” she said, laughing cheerfully. “Very wise.”
“Oh wow! I am 29.”
“Oh, prima!”
I observed her face closely, the wrinkled lips smudged with red lipgloss that opened to a smile encasing a false tooth set. Her thick hair was fashionably groomed and trimmed into a short bob that covered her head uniformly. The smile was really infectious.
“You look happy. What is the secret to your happiness?”
“I am healthy. I am alive. I have money. I have friends. I have a family. I don’t look happy. I am happy,” she said in a kind but bold voice. Her English was perfect.
“So happy to see you. You really made my day today.”
“So I did something good?” she inquired kindly.
“You have no idea.”
After a moment of silence, I added, “I am coming from my therapist.”
She looked at me intently, a knowing look on her face. She said nothing, but I could swear I saw a small nod of understanding.
“Are you working?”
Bam! She asked me an innocent, totally harmless question. But it was a trigger. Please, no. I will be truthful but answer safely without telling the whole story that I hadn’t accepted myself back then.
“I used to. Now I am studying here.”
“Do you live alone?”
“I am married. I live with my husband.”
Some more smiling. Looking around for the bus which was the reason we were here, we continued to talk.
“What is your lievelingseten (favorite food)?” I had translated the phrase using Google Translate and showed her my phone, because mijn Nederlands is niet zo goed back then.
“I eat everything. But I never skip salads. I eat salads every single day,” she said matter-of-factly.
“Have you always lived here?”
“I have lived here all my life. For 92 years. In Zilver Windstraat.”
“I live in Zilver Windstraat too.”
“What’s the huis number?”
“I live in 118.”
“We are in 20!”
“Wow. We are buren (neighbours).” She looked really happy now.
“Everyone is taking their own car these days. Only one person in each car,” she said, pointing at the vehicles passing by as we waited patiently for our bus, grimacing and shaking her head in disagreement.
“Do you live alone?” Once again, my curiosity got the better of me.
“My second husband died five years ago…” She spoke for a second into the distance, then looked at me briefly, smiling. “It happens, you know…” with a shrug and half-smile.
“I am going to visit a friend who is ill,” she continued. She was clutching her cover filled with clinking glasses. She proudly showed me her glass jar collection, filled with onion plants growing at various heights. She mentioned she couldn’t move her left arm much, though that wouldn’t stop her from being strong and getting things done. A trait I admire so much in the native Dutch. They are not made of sugar.
Each time a pair of headlights appeared around the corner, she got excited in the hope of finally getting into the bus. Then, in a matter of nanoseconds, she said, “Nee…” as the lights extended into a delivery van or, worse, a truck.
She laughed at a small Canta car waiting timidly by the road, its indicator on.
“Klein? (small)”
“Klein…”
“Ik spreek een beetje Nederlands.”
I showed her the Dutch lessons on my phone. She read a few of them and said, “Heel goed!” She had excellent eyesight and could read from my poorly backlit, almost-dying iPhone.
“Why don’t you drive a car yourself? You can get around anywhere so easily!”
“Nee, my children will not allow it.”
She kept murmuring bits of Dutch here and there, and I, like a small child pretending to understand, responded with a confident, typical, and lazy… “Jaaaaa…”
The bus was late as usual. Typical Dutch public transportation.
“I will start walking,” I signalled to her that I might leave now, half-heartedly.
“I will wait for the bus,” she said hopefully, glancing left every time to the corner of the road.
My patience was not the same. “I will call a taxi for us and ask the driver to drop you on the way.”
“Oh, that is not fair. You will pay for it. Oh no…!”
“Nee, geen probleem! It is totally fine. Where do you want to go?”
“Ziekenhuis Amstelland.” Then, after a pause, she added, “You should come home for a coffee one day.”
“I would have visited anyway. I don’t need any favor returned.” I added, kindly.
She probably only heard the word visited. That registered as a yes, and she beamed happily.
I called an Uber. Hafez would arrive in two minutes. That was quick.
In no time, we scrambled into the old KIA. The driver greeted us in Dutch. Astrid took charge and converses fluently with Hafez, a kind man from South Africa. He proceeded to drive us toward her stop, barely 5 minutes away.
By mistake, Astrid poked her finger into the glass screen separating the driver from the passengers. It was so invisibly clean that she hadn’t noticed it. She chuckled to herself for a while. The glass now bore a small fingerprint mark.
“Nooo…” Ans wailed, looking lost and a bit down when Hafez took a wrong turn at the roundabout.
“No, it’s okay… You can tell him where you want to go. He will drop you there.”
Hafez quickly corrected his route and dropped Astrid off exactly where she wanted to go.
As she was getting out of the car, she looked at me and said, “Dank je wel. Coffee is waiting for you,” with a wink and a twinkle in her eyes. She turned and walked away.
Hafez continued driving toward my destination.
“Is she your family?” he asked, peering through the rearview mirror.
“No, I just met her at the bus stop half an hour ago.”
“You did a really kind thing there.”
I rushed to the nearest café after finishing my errand. I had to jot down this incident before it faded from my ever-busy, memory-laden mind.
Coffee is waiting for you…
She didn’t look old — not one bit. So precious. She still had the fire of youth burning inside her, fighting within her. She made me feel hopeful.
As she wakes up every morning to another beautiful day in her life, I wondered what kept her going so positively.
Does she see each day as a blessing or another hurdle to pass?She probably knows her loved ones are waiting for her. That she will meet them when her time comes.But until then, she must go on…
I couldn’t stop the flow of words as I furiously scribbled into my Remarkable, all while holding and pushing my almost-filled bladder to a dangerous extent.
While the incident replayed itself on a loop in my mind, one question bothered me the most.
Was her hair brown or blonde?
I couldn’t recall anymore.
PS: I wanted to simply meet her again after a few months. And I did. This time, with my husband and some flowers. We rang the bell downstairs, hoping against hope that she would remember me. She answered, took the lift, and promptly came down to meet us, her face lighting up when she saw me. Dressed smartly, she took the flowers and went back up, inviting us over another time.
That was a year and a half ago. I tried multiple times to ring her bell again, but there was no answer. We really hope she is still happy and cheerful, wherever she is.

In a few hours, I will no longer be an Amsterdammer. I will take a plane that will carry me away of this city where I landed almost three years ago, knowing no one. At that time, I could not imagine that the city that felt so cold and flat, will feel so warm and containing, will feel so much like home.
Wherever I go, being an Amsterdammer would subject me to bursts of envy: too much sexual freedom, too much legal weed, people would say. The truth is that Amsterdam is much more than its red light district and its coffee shops. Amsterdam is a place where culture, charm, coziness, openness and nonchalance merge together in a beautiful bond. If I were to compare Amsterdam to a woman, this woman would be easygoing, busy enjoying everything that life brings her way, so much in peace with herself and her imperfections, a woman who is too good to be true.
Few months after settling in in Amsterdam, the Amsterdam vibe started to get into me. I started to shift from someone who is over-thinking and over-planning to someone who enjoys the present and lets life flow, trusting that everything will fall into place. I started to overcome my shyness and introvert character and to open myself to new experiences and relationships. I started to think beyond myself and my 9 to 5 job, and to share with Amsterdammers their sheer interest in topics like sustainability, environment and social inclusion. Last but not least, Amsterdam taught me to take care of myself, of my emotional and physical well-being, and to always seek balance and harmony.
I owe to Amsterdam a lot of the small and big changes that happened to me during the past years: Practicing yoga, relying on a bike for movement, sharing my home with strangers, reflecting on my passion and life mission, engaging in impact-driven initiatives and communities, saying what I think even when it is in contrast with what people expect, embracing failure and turning it into fuel, feeling confident talking about my failures and vulnerabilities… I owe to Amsterdam the person I became today, someone who is much happier and looking forward to life than the person I was three years ago.
Thank you Amsterdam for everything! I will miss the times when a bike ride through your canals was enough to erase any sadness and to clear my thoughts. You were so kind to a stranger like me. You were the coziest home I ever had far away from home.

In the mornings, there was still a slight chill in the air despite it being late June. In Amsterdam, the sun came up too early and went back down too late, and I was struggling to adjust to this new sleep schedule. By the time the sun went down completely at ten or eleven at night, it would be hours until I felt tired enough to actually sleep, and still would be up too early for comfort. This routine heavily affected my circadian rhythm.
Despite being the world’s sleepiest girl in Amsterdam, I could enjoy the slow living that the Dutch are accustomed to. I took long walks in the mornings around the canals, listened to Dutch language lessons while wandering residential neighborhoods, and got to explore the history of the quiet, bustling town I would definitely visit again.
For travelers obsessed with history like I am, Amsterdam is a place steeped in stories and lives you will love to learn from. Here’s some of my favorite places in Amsterdam to experience the legacy of “Venice of the North.”

Our luggage and other heavy things have all been stashed in an L-size locker at Amsterdam Centraal. Sweet! Aww, my inner child jolted as soon as we exited Amsterdam Centraal. At the same time, my eyes caught a lady skipping happily toward someone who seemed to be waiting for her. A display of simple human happiness. I thought momentarily, ‘Wow, there are so many people here!’ It seems the weekend atmosphere had contributed to the crowd. And that crowd! This sight quickly reminded me how ‘international’ this city — or country — is.
Stepping out of the square, the tram rails are lined right up next to the road. The way they weave together looks a bit messy on the asphalt. I’ve seen similar setups in other places, but I still find it a bit tricky to wrap my head around all these different modes of transportation crammed together. I prefer things to be a little plainer.
To cross the road, I found myself a bit disoriented at first; I wasn’t sure if there was a designated area for crossing. Later that day, Bu Jeannie used the phrase ‘Indonesian way.’ Sekar and I, after observing the traffic situation, also mentioned it and joked about doing it the ‘Indo way.’
We’ve got Google Maps in hand. We try to be wise with our batteries. We want to use Sekar’s phone for navigation and my phone for taking pictures. The direction is facing the city: heading…

I idly watched tiny droplets of moisture licking at the plane’s wings as cotton wool clouds and sparkling sunbeams made way for a sea of green and grey, followed by a seemingly-endless taxi along the runway. Almost as soon as I’d left the UK, I was in Amsterdam for a springtime mini break. The grey skies above did nothing to dull my spirit as I muddled through the train system and took a final, deep breath of city air. That’s right. After a pretty hefty hiatus from Medium, I’m back — and accompanied by tales from a small European country known as The Netherlands in April 2025.
As I left the station, I was hit instantly with the lingering aroma of marijuana, coupled with street music and a relentless stream of bicycles. Weaving through tiny streets, the constant bang bang bang of my suitcase wheels on the cobbles grew more comforting than annoying. Finally, after a few wrong turns, I could see the sign for my hostel just up ahead.
I had a little time to kill and so resolved to head out on foot. I ended up down a major shopping street, but resisted the urge to pop into the large Primark. Scattered…

I first visited Amsterdam in March for less than a week and absolutely loved it! I connected with new family members, made friends, and saw all of the incredible attractions of the city. The city is gorgeous, with endless canals and narrow streets. Everyone bikes, and people put a lot of effort into keeping the city beautiful and full of flowers. It’s also a diverse, young city, which creates a great community for newcomers. Plus, the everyday fashion in Amsterdam is incredible. Everyone always looks put together, especially in the city center. Unsurprisingly, the clothing stores are beautiful and curated to classic European style. If you’re visiting Amsterdam, dress to impress!
There is so much to love about Amsterdam, which is why I decided to rent a house for about five weeks in Linjden, Amsterdam. Linjden is southwest from the city center, suburban, quiet, and I always felt safe! Just two minutes away from my house was a cute goat farm, and two minutes away from that one was another (smaller) goat farm. The more I explored the area, the more goats I found! My house was on Hoofdweg, which was the perfect neighborhood to go for long walks in. The only downside is that it typically takes an hour to get into the city (30 minute tram ride), and it is a 30 minute walk to the nearest grocery store. Of course, you can always rent a bike.
I spent most of my time enjoying the suburbs of Amsterdam, but I was able to explore a significant part of the city as well. In March, I already visited most of the tourist attractions, so I was able to relax and revisit my favorites. Below, I have listed some of my top places and recommendations that can help you when visiting Amsterdam!
Sightseeing & Experiences:
Food:
Desserts:
Museums:
Queer bars:
Thrift/Vintage Stores:
I hope that this list of recommendations is helpful if you visit Amsterdam!
During my five weeks here, several friends from home visited me. My three friends from the US visited during my first week, which was mostly a disaster. Traveling with groups can be difficult, but I’m still glad that they visited me! I would happily travel with any of them again. Then later in my trip, my friend from college, Danicia, and her girlfriend stayed with me for a few nights. I have not seen Danicia since my freshman year of college at UConn and now she is living in Germany!
A couple of months ago in Dublin, I met Ariane and she was planning on coming to Amsterdam with a friend. When that plan didn’t work out, I offered her a place to stay at my house in Linjden. We went to MOCO, ate sushi, took a canal tour, and had a drink at Black & Blue on Reguliersdwarsstraat. The next day, we visited the Anne Frank House, ate pancakes, and walked to the Royal Palace. We also went to Cafe Saarein for some beers and a couple games of pool, and then had a stroopwafel at Van Wonderen. Later in the evening in the Red Light District, we had dinner at an Argentinean restaurant and drinks at Cafe’t Mandje. It was a busy, amazing couple of days!
Throughout my trip, I was able to visit some family members that I first met in March. I grabbed lunch with my cousin, Gosia, and my younger cousin, Indra, visited for a day. From TripBff (a travel app), I also met Diena and her friends, who were all solo travelers. During the second half of my time in Amsterdam, I hung out with a new friend, Isa, a few times and we explored some great restaurants together. I am so glad that I was able to meet some new and old friends here!
Amsterdam is a great city that I highly recommend visiting. As always, please reach out if you want solo travel tips or other recommendations!

Have you ever imagined immersing yourself in one of the world’s most dynamic and thrilling cities, all while advancing your career? This is the story of my remarkable journey.
As a young software engineer employed at a reputable multinational company in India, the opportunity to embark on a two-month onsite assignment in Amsterdam was nothing short of a dream come true. The mere thought of exploring Europe had always danced at the periphery of my aspirations, yet, as someone from India, such an adventure often felt distant and financially out of reach.
But I persevered, putting in the hard work and dedication necessary to secure this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Finally, the moment had arrived when I could set foot in Amsterdam, and I was filled with boundless gratitude for having reached this significant milestone. Now, let me share with you the captivating journey that unfolded, as I discovered the city’s perfect blend of work and play, and why it has become a place I’ll cherish forever.
One electrifying week before the grand adventure, I embarked on a whirlwind of preparations. With a fresh haircut and meticulous grooming, I was ready to step into the unknown. The day of departure finally dawned, and my parents joined me for a heartwarming farewell at the airport. The excitement in the air was palpable as I embarked on a journey I had been eagerly awaiting.
The flight seemed to stretch on, but the moment we touched down at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, I was immediately captivated by the city’s breathtaking beauty. The sight was a feast for the senses, a stunning welcome to this new chapter in my life. My heart raced with anticipation as I hopped into a sleek Tesla taxi. The streets were teeming with high-end cars, and the buzz around Tesla was infectious. Riding in one was nothing short of a thrilling adventure, marking the exhilarating start of my Amsterdam odyssey.
I arrived at my home around 5 p.m., and it was already dark outside. I had never experienced this in India, where the sun sets much later. My friend and I were so excited to be in Amsterdam that we decided to make dinner and go to bed early so that we could wake up early the next morning and start exploring.
I was nervous on my first day at the office in Amsterdam. I had never been to the city before. But as soon as I walked in, I was greeted by warm smiles from my new colleagues and clients.
My Indian colleagues introduced me to everyone, including my Dutch clients. I was immediately struck by how friendly and welcoming everyone was. My client even asked me about my journey to Amsterdam and how I was settling in.
At lunchtime, I went out with my senior colleagues, we had a delicious meal together. We talked about everything from what we needed to settle in, to the Dutch culture, and some places to travel. I felt so comfortable and at ease.
By the end of the day, I had made a lot of new friends in the office and learned a lot about the company and the city. I was so grateful for the warm welcome I had received.
Through the days, I effortlessly adapted to the Amsterdam culture and people, and I also explored the city’s many attractions. I was captivated by Amsterdam’s distinctive beauty. My personal experience revealed five compelling reasons why Amsterdam stands out as an exceptional destination for both work and leisure:
Canals that Captivate: Amsterdam’s intricate network of canals is a sight to behold, earning it the nickname “Venice of the North.” The reflection of gabled houses in the still waters, along with charming bridges and tree-lined streets, creates a picturesque scene that is reminiscent of a fairytale. For example, the Prinsengracht Canal is home to many beautiful 17th-century houses, while the Keizersgracht Canal is known for its elegant mansions. The canals are also a great place to spot boats and people-watch.
Historical Charm: Amsterdam’s well-preserved architecture stands as a testament to its rich history. As you stroll through the city, you’ll encounter stunning 17th-century buildings, each with its own unique character and story, offering a glimpse into the city’s past. For example, the Anne Frank House is a poignant reminder of the city’s role in World War II, while the Royal Palace is a magnificent example of Dutch Baroque architecture. The city’s canals are also lined with historic buildings, such as the gabled houses of the Jordaan neighborhood.
Cultural Diversity: The city is a melting pot of cultures, and this diversity is reflected in its art, food, and people. From world-class museums like the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum to vibrant neighborhoods like De Pijp, there’s a cultural richness that adds to the city’s allure.
Laid-back atmosphere: Amsterdam has a relaxed and easy-going atmosphere. I appreciated the friendly demeanor of the locals, as it was quite common for strangers to exchange warm greetings with smiles. In all my travels to various countries, I had never witnessed such a welcoming attitude towards strangers.
Diverse workforce: Amsterdam has a diverse workforce, with people from all over the world living and working in the city. This diversity makes for a vibrant and exciting work environment.
Bicycle-Friendly Bliss: Amsterdam’s flat terrain and extensive network of cycling lanes make it a cyclist’s paradise. The sight of countless bicycles whizzing past historic sites, parks, and picturesque canals is not only beautiful, but it is also an embodiment of the city’s eco-friendly ethos. Conveniently, there are bicycle pumps attached to some bicycle areas for filling tires.
Amsterdam is a foodie’s paradise, with a wide variety of restaurants and dishes to choose from, whether you’re looking for a quick bite or a leisurely meal. I sampled some of the city’s most famous dishes, including:
Poffertjes: Small pancakes often served with powdered sugar, fruit, or syrup.Stroopwafels: Thin waffles filled with sweet syrup.Stamppot: Traditional Dutch mashed potatoes with vegetablesErwtensoep: Popular Dutch pea soup, also available in vegetarian versions.
My love for the delicious waffles was only surpassed by my visit to Zaanse Schans, Amsterdam’s old town, where I sampled a variety of delectable cheeseses. I promise you, they were incredibly tasty!
My two months in Amsterdam were an unforgettable experience. I had the opportunity to work on a challenging project, meet new people from all over the world, and explore a beautiful and vibrant city. I also had the chance to travel to other parts of Europe, which was a dream come true.
I’m so grateful for the opportunity I had to live and work in Amsterdam. It was an experience that has changed me for the better. I made lifelong friends, learned new things, and created memories that will last a lifetime.
When it was time to leave, I was sad to say goodbye to my new friends and the city I had come to love. But I know that I will return one day. Amsterdam has a special place in my heart, and I can’t wait to go back and explore more.
Vincent van Gogh once said, ‘Amsterdam is a city of dreams, and I am a dreamer.’
I couldn’t agree more. Amsterdam is a city that inspires creativity and imagination. It’s a city where anything is possible. If you’re looking for a city that will challenge and inspire you, Amsterdam is the place for you.
I hope that this blog post has given you a glimpse into my experience in Amsterdam. If you’re ever thinking about visiting this amazing city, I highly recommend it!

happy, unique, goofy
1 week (or forever if you can)
Wow! I honestly love Amsterdam so much! The people seem so at ease with life and It is a very liberal spiritual place. Everyone is very open minded and accepting of anyone.
Amsterdam is mainly Dutch people so a lot of the people are very tall and blond. Another thing to consider is prostitution, weed, and psychedelics such as truffles are legal despite this everyone seems incredibly responsible and people seem to keep a good balance of life in Amsterdam. It really is the happiest and most open minded place I’ve been to so far and that’s why it is my favorite place so far.
Right from Amsterdam Central you can take a free ferry that will take you to NDSM and it takes about 5–10 mins to get there and the Ferry comes constantly I honestly felt like I never had to wait for one. NDSM is a hip urban area with lots of cool graffiti and hip restaurants to check out. Not to mention the interesting places you can stay at like the Crane hotel oh and you can also bungee jump from it, if you decide to. The area also has lots of special events such a music festivals, flea markets, and movie nights. Its a great place to check out and Its not too crowded so it’s nice getting away from all the people in the main area.
This may be one of my favorite museum trips that I have gone on so far. I really liked that it focused on one artist throughout, and I felt like I really got to see Van Gogh’s life and how it affected his art. I have to say I am a HUGE Van Gogh fan, I really love his brush strokes and his bright use of color. I felt like I got pulled into every single painting diving into each brush stroke and seeing the lines up close then pulling back to see the full picture that he created. I don’t know how he did it but he made each scene look so serene and stylized.
I need to also mention the sensory room where each room you get the senses that Van Gogh was feeling throughout his life. I thought it was so creative because I truly felt like I was living and seeing the things that Van Gogh felt.
I mean you honestly can’t go to Amsterdam without going to the Red Light District at least once. Walking through the red light district you can’t take any photos. You basically see women in windows with red lights above them in their underwear standing or sitting, and they kind of look bored or like their busy looking at their phone. It was an interesting experience but one to definitely check out and experience once.
One of the most unforgettable experiences I have had so far, A’dam lookout is where you go on the top of one of the buildings and there are these 2 electric swings that basically swing you back and fourth for about 2 mins. It was seriously such a magical feeling I honestly felt like I was on top of the world and flying for a second. I will admit it was really scary because you are so high up and you look down and don’t see anything right under you but it is one of the things that you can’t really forget because you just feel so much.
The canal tour is so worth it, you basically just go down the canals throughout the city, it is so fun to see all the little boat houses right on the canals.
I personally really liked the Mocco museum because it had more urban graffiti artists such Banksy, icy & slot, Koons and Warhol. They also had a 3D installation room where you walk into a room in the style of Lichtenstein (which is the bright comic book style with bold colors and lines throughout). The museum is not that big but I kind of like that, your not overwhelmed by all of the art and you can engage in each and every one. Each piece had a strong statement about freedom and freedom of expression.
I checked out multiple psychedelic shops (there were many) and these 2 stood out the most to me.
Kokopelli was very informal and the staff really knew their stuff and loved to talk about it, they sold lots of other interesting things such as Brazilian herbs to help with lucid dreaming. Or seeds that you can grow and eat for different types of needs. They even had an area where you can sit and take your shrooms if you decide to buy it from them.
Alien Visitors s a fun small raver type of shop, with techno music playing and neon fluorescent items throughout the store. I ended up buying a really cute black shirt with some green neon print designs down the middle. It wasn’t too crazy with the designs like how some raver shirts can get a little tacky when its overplayed and I really love the pattern on it.

My goal is to share my journey, experiences and designs with you. I try to bring in a unique perspective into everything I see.

1980 ~ Amsterdam, the Netherlands
Our expectations were not high when we finally entered the Eighties. The economic recession was underway; nine percent of the Dutch workforce was unemployed — including most of my friends. The Cold War raged over our heads, principally between the United States and the Soviet Union, and we assumed our territory would end up being the eventual nuclear battlefield. It looked like the somber adage of the Punk movement- No Future — would become a reality.
In the lesbian anarchist artsy milieu of hippies, squatters, punkers, musicians, and thieves, which was my habitat, our feeling was: ‘Let’s make it to 1984 first.’
Our life as lesbians is interwoven with a hippie background, anarchist Emma Goldman’s adage ‘If I can’t dance to it, it’s not my revolution’, and the motto of another radical, Jill Johnston, ‘All women are lesbians except those who don’t know it yet’. The energy of the punk movement is in our hairstyles, the fashion of New Wave in our jackets and shoes, and the political consciousness of the women’s movement in the spaces we claim give those threatening times a dynamic twist.
Right after our old Queen Juliana announced her abdication, the slogan: Geen woning geen kroning, No Housing No Crowning — is scrawled all over the city’s walls. This ominous message comes from the squatting movement. The die has been cast. We don’t love her daughter Beatrice yet, who will be crowned Queen on April 30 at a party for nobility, royalty, and other rich folks. Amsterdam has changed from a free port to an impenetrable fortress where you need a pass to walk through the streets, and the noise of helicopters hovering over the city for days drives us crazy. I don’t live in a squat; I’m not precisely adventurous that way. I pay proper rent and work as a cook in the Melkweg. But I do support the causes of the squatters: It seems criminal to leave buildings vacant. Speculation with scarce space means that buildings are left empty for years. Amsterdam looks like a rotting set of teeth because of the holes.
On Leap Day of the year 1980, I am sitting in the women’s cafe Saarein with a lezzy from Bologna, Italy, whom I met (through the informal International Lesbian Network. We toast our friendship and the International Lesbian Solidarity with espresso and Genever when the door is pushed open. A group of ruggedly dressed when women enter the café. Their eyes are shining with excitement. ‘We won’, they sing. A woman with a red-yellow Mohawk holds a transistor radio at her ear, tuned to Radio Stad, a local radio station. A large group of squatters chased off three platoons of Riot Police; in the Vondelstraat, ‘The hillbillies couldn’t handle it anymore,’ a triumphant voice shouts, Police officers are summoned from all over the country, to stop the squatters. Within ten minutes, they‘re chased out. The gals order beer and keep repeating the story of the inglorious retreat of the policemen under a shower of rocks.
A line has begun to form for the bathroom. Women enter in groups and come out with a wild look in their eyes, snorting. On the flush tank lies a cleanly wiped pocket mirror. The downstairs group has gathered to go and support the squatters. They want the café to close and all of us to join them. After fierce deliberation, the café stays open and promises to refer new women to the place of action. We decline the invitation. We have something else to do. We are going to an opening.We are going to an opening. Our friend Karen Kverneness from Seattle sells confection art in her shop, Art Something, on Herengracht. The art is stacked on shelves and a few large display tables like in a regular store.
Tonight, a new series from New York has arrived. Karen sells leather files with a safety pin stuck through them for twelve guilders and thirty cents apiece.’Betty goes punk,’ it says, cut-out newspaper letters. A straight-looking girl has photographed herself with punk bands from New York City.
The cream of the lesbian crop and other art freaks are feasting on American onion soup yogurt dip, flown-in bagels with cream cheese, root beer, and Four Roses bourbon. A blond, short-shaved nightingale in a men’s suit stands behind a black box with a keyboard. Touching only one key, she plays a rhythmic chord. It sounds cheerful and fresh. Her voice is like a gift from heaven, and we listen breathlessly.
At KK’s party, people sympathize with the squatters, but no one else wants to go and look, so the Bolognesi and I walk together through a bleak and empty Vondelpark to the Vondelstraat.
The atmosphere on Constantijn Huygensstraat is surreal. The bridge is full of loose paving stones, and barricades are on the corner of Roemer Visscherstraat. There is no triumphant frenzy here — more like a terse tension. From the front of the squatted house hangs a police cap as a trophy.
A group of boys talk persistently to a drunken friend who hangs back, babbling. But most of the dialog is inaudible to us. A group of intertwined figures sits beside an oil lamp, listening to a small transistor radio. A boy who wears heavy winter clothes and a black helmet stops us. ‘What are you here for?’ ‘To look, I answer. “We have no place for busybodies.’ He turns around to indicate that he is done talking. From the group of people, one figure detaches. I recognize Tilt, a woman I know from the women café. She climbs over the barricade and walks with us for a while.” They’re excited, the men. The testosterone is racing through their veins. They expect the riot police, and they want to fight. Boys will be boys.”She jabs me in the side.” I understand them. My testosterone is licking me, too,’ she continues, “and tickling me as well. I want to have sex. We only let people in we’re sure of. If you want to fight with us, you are welcome, but you — you, old hippie you — violence is not your thing.”She is right. My heart is hippy. We shake hands, Tilt slaps us on our shoulders, and we hear her crooked laugh as she walks away.

Our luggage and other heavy things have all been stashed in an L-size locker at Amsterdam Centraal. Sweet! Aww, my inner child jolted as soon as we exited Amsterdam Centraal. At the same time, my eyes caught a lady skipping happily toward someone who seemed to be waiting for her. A display of simple human happiness. I thought momentarily, ‘Wow, there are so many people here!’ It seems the weekend atmosphere had contributed to the crowd. And that crowd! This sight quickly reminded me how ‘international’ this city — or country — is.
Stepping out of the square, the tram rails are lined right up next to the road. The way they weave together looks a bit messy on the asphalt. I’ve seen similar setups in other places, but I still find it a bit tricky to wrap my head around all these different modes of transportation crammed together. I prefer things to be a little plainer.

Amsterdam is often known as the bicycle capital of the world. If you are an advocate of active transportation, there are some YouTubers and bloggers praising Amsterdam for their bike friendliness. BicycleDutch and NotJustBikes come to mind. However, if you are visiting Amsterdam and wanting to ride a bike but haven’t since childhood, I can imagine it can be intimidating. I don’t blame people from North America traveling to Amsterdam and being fearful of riding a bike. If you normally don’t ride, it’s a difficult adjustment. My guess is if you are visiting Amsterdam from North America, you MIGHT hop on a bike for an afternoon as a novelty, but then go back to what you are comfortable with. Most people from North America drive. And most people from other parts of the world probably do not have the bicycling culture like the Dutch or Danish. It’s like if you’re not used to taking public transit in your home country, you might shy away from taking public transit when you travel. You’ll opt for the Hop On Hop Off buses, using ride share or joining a tour group. All are fine, but I would say you are missing out on a uniquely Dutch experience by not taking a bike to get you around town…and riding it as often as possible.
So what is it like riding a bike in Amsterdam? Here are some tips from my experience for visiting Amsterdam and riding a bike if you haven’t ridden since childhood. If you are used to riding consistently as an adult, especially if your bike is your transportation, then you shouldn’t have a problem riding in Amsterdam. The learning curve shouldn’t be too steep.
Otherwise, you will probably be “that” tourist that doesn’t know the rules of riding. There’s plenty of websites that go more into detail on the rules of riding. I’m not going to get that detailed. Instead, I will touch on some basics of what it must feel like riding if you haven’t ridden a bike since forever.
If you are “that” tourist and want to get on a bike, then here are some of my suggestions for “people who normally don’t ride a bike but want to in Amsterdam”.
First, get away from the city center, especially if you are visiting during the summer months where tourism is at its peak. It can get packed with people on bikes, on foot, cars and tour buses. The center of the city also seems to have less separated bike paths, so you’re riding close to other drivers. There’s also vans parked in the bike lanes, so you’ll need to navigate around them by safely moving around other riders and drivers. Plus, you’ll want to be careful crossing the tram tracks as bicycle tires can get caught in it and you will fall.
Find a hotel, hostel, Airbnb, etc outside of the city center that also rents bikes. You don’t have to go too far out but just far enough for you to practice. When I went there, I stayed near Vondel Park. My place rented bikes which was convenient and Vondel Park is a great place to practice riding around.
In the US (and I assume it’s similar in other countries), I notice beginner riders tend to weave around a lot and often ride really slow. There’s nothing wrong with that, but if you want to ride on the bike paths in Amsterdam, you’ll need to practice not weaving around so much and to ride faster. Basically, if you wouldn’t drive your car weaving from lane to lane, then you shouldn’t do that on a bike. Anyways, Vondel Park would be a good place to reintroduce yourself to the bike. Lots of people ride through here to get to their destination so you’ll see lots of riders. But the paths are wide enough for the locals to go around you as you’re starting off.
My biggest advice to those wanting to hop on a bike for the first time is don’t just randomly stop in middle of a bike path because you saw this cool cafe or bar or some interesting mural. Please pull off to the side of the bike path so you don’t block anybody or cause a crash. There is a 100% chance someone is riding right behind you. And just like driving, you don’t just stop in the middle of the road because you saw something cool off to the side. So don’t do that on a bike either.
My next advice is to use hand signals and turn your head to make sure it’s clear before you decide to turn, stop or slow down. Watch how the locals use hand signals. But all you need to do is slightly bend your right arm outwards to show you are turning right and slightly bend your left arm outwards to show you are turning left.
There’s no need to extend your entire arm out when you need to turn. By doing that, you’ll most likely smack someone riding next to you. This of course goes back to turning your head so you know who is around you.
Once you get comfortable riding around in the park, you can move onto neighborhood streets and separated bike paths outside of the city center.
Amsterdam has lots of bicycle signals, so make sure you pay attention to the signals.
Intersections can also be tricky because you’ll need to know when to yield and when not to yield. Pay attention to the “shark teeth” symbols on the ground.
The good thing about being on a bike is even if you are uncertain on what to do, everybody can still move around each other and usually not cause a crash. People can usually read your body language on a bike and you’ll be able to do the same the more your ride.
It’s not like being in a car, where you are unable to see the person driving. In a car, you can’t predict what the people next to you will do. But it’s easier on a bike because you can see the entire person.
One thing I also noticed is that drivers and cyclists will look for any open space to squeeze in (which to me is a bit reminiscent of NYC). There were a couple of drivers that came rather close to me in the city center. I noticed two types of license plates in Amsterdam. The yellow and the blue plates. I had a close pass with a blue license plate driver. I later overheard those are the taxi and delivery drivers? So I guess it makes sense they are more aggressive (even though they shouldn’t be)?
And you know that saying “practice makes perfect”? The more you ride, the more you’ll get the hang of how things are done. And riding a bike in Amsterdam is absolutely amazing! It’s just not something you can experience in the US. Bikes really provide the freedom that cars do not (despite car ads from the last 100 years proclaiming driving is freedom). You don’t need a helmet when riding, so you truly can feel the “wind in your hair”.
And one final tips. Remember where you parked your bike. Take a photo or video of where you parked and the surrounding area. A lot of bikes look similar and they are often jammed together.
And once you get the hang of this, you can ride to grab coffee or a beer. Ride to a park or museum. You’ll soon discover how easy it is to navigate the city by bike. And how many more places you can see without having to pay for the tram, Uber or follow a guided tour. With a bike, you can have the freedom to explore local neighborhoods, cafes and restaurants that might not be in a guide book.
I can’t wait to go back and ride again and I hope if you’re reading this and planning a trip there, you will want to ride as much as possible while you are there.

I idly watched tiny droplets of moisture licking at the plane’s wings as cotton wool clouds and sparkling sunbeams made way for a sea of green and grey, followed by a seemingly-endless taxi along the runway. Almost as soon as I’d left the UK, I was in Amsterdam for a springtime mini break. The grey skies above did nothing to dull my spirit as I muddled through the train system and took a final, deep breath of city air. That’s right. After a pretty hefty hiatus from Medium, I’m back — and accompanied by tales from a small European country known as The Netherlands in April 2025.
As I left the station, I was hit instantly with the lingering aroma of marijuana, coupled with street music and a relentless stream of bicycles. Weaving through tiny streets, the constant bang bang bang of my suitcase wheels on the cobbles grew more comforting than annoying. Finally, after a few wrong turns, I could see the sign for my hostel just up ahead.
I had a little time to kill and so resolved to head out on foot. I ended up down a major shopping street, but resisted the urge to pop into the large Primark. Scattered…

I first visited Amsterdam in March for less than a week and absolutely loved it! I connected with new family members, made friends, and saw all of the incredible attractions of the city. The city is gorgeous, with endless canals and narrow streets. Everyone bikes, and people put a lot of effort into keeping the city beautiful and full of flowers. It’s also a diverse, young city, which creates a great community for newcomers. Plus, the everyday fashion in Amsterdam is incredible. Everyone always looks put together, especially in the city center. Unsurprisingly, the clothing stores are beautiful and curated to classic European style. If you’re visiting Amsterdam, dress to impress!
There is so much to love about Amsterdam, which is why I decided to rent a house for about five weeks in Linjden, Amsterdam. Linjden is southwest from the city center, suburban, quiet, and I always felt safe! Just two minutes away from my house was a cute goat farm, and two minutes away from that one was another (smaller) goat farm. The more I explored the area, the more goats I found! My house was on Hoofdweg, which was the perfect neighborhood to go for long walks in. The only downside is that it typically takes an hour to get into the city (30 minute tram ride), and it is a 30 minute walk to the nearest grocery store. Of course, you can always rent a bike.
I spent most of my time enjoying the suburbs of Amsterdam, but I was able to explore a significant part of the city as well. In March, I already visited most of the tourist attractions, so I was able to relax and revisit my favorites. Below, I have listed some of my top places and recommendations that can help you when visiting Amsterdam!
Sightseeing & Experiences:
Food:
Desserts:
Museums:
Queer bars:
Thrift/Vintage Stores:
I hope that this list of recommendations is helpful if you visit Amsterdam!
During my five weeks here, several friends from home visited me. My three friends from the US visited during my first week, which was mostly a disaster. Traveling with groups can be difficult, but I’m still glad that they visited me! I would happily travel with any of them again. Then later in my trip, my friend from college, Danicia, and her girlfriend stayed with me for a few nights. I have not seen Danicia since my freshman year of college at UConn and now she is living in Germany!
A couple of months ago in Dublin, I met Ariane and she was planning on coming to Amsterdam with a friend. When that plan didn’t work out, I offered her a place to stay at my house in Linjden. We went to MOCO, ate sushi, took a canal tour, and had a drink at Black & Blue on Reguliersdwarsstraat. The next day, we visited the Anne Frank House, ate pancakes, and walked to the Royal Palace. We also went to Cafe Saarein for some beers and a couple games of pool, and then had a stroopwafel at Van Wonderen. Later in the evening in the Red Light District, we had dinner at an Argentinean restaurant and drinks at Cafe’t Mandje. It was a busy, amazing couple of days!
Throughout my trip, I was able to visit some family members that I first met in March. I grabbed lunch with my cousin, Gosia, and my younger cousin, Indra, visited for a day. From TripBff (a travel app), I also met Diena and her friends, who were all solo travelers. During the second half of my time in Amsterdam, I hung out with a new friend, Isa, a few times and we explored some great restaurants together. I am so glad that I was able to meet some new and old friends here!
Amsterdam is a great city that I highly recommend visiting. As always, please reach out if you want solo travel tips or other recommendations!

Have you ever imagined immersing yourself in one of the world’s most dynamic and thrilling cities, all while advancing your career? This is the story of my remarkable journey.
As a young software engineer employed at a reputable multinational company in India, the opportunity to embark on a two-month onsite assignment in Amsterdam was nothing short of a dream come true. The mere thought of exploring Europe had always danced at the periphery of my aspirations, yet, as someone from India, such an adventure often felt distant and financially out of reach.
But I persevered, putting in the hard work and dedication necessary to secure this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Finally, the moment had arrived when I could set foot in Amsterdam, and I was filled with boundless gratitude for having reached this significant milestone. Now, let me share with you the captivating journey that unfolded, as I discovered the city’s perfect blend of work and play, and why it has become a place I’ll cherish forever.
One electrifying week before the grand adventure, I embarked on a whirlwind of preparations. With a fresh haircut and meticulous grooming, I was ready to step into the unknown. The day of departure finally dawned, and my parents joined me for a heartwarming farewell at the airport. The excitement in the air was palpable as I embarked on a journey I had been eagerly awaiting.
The flight seemed to stretch on, but the moment we touched down at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, I was immediately captivated by the city’s breathtaking beauty. The sight was a feast for the senses, a stunning welcome to this new chapter in my life. My heart raced with anticipation as I hopped into a sleek Tesla taxi. The streets were teeming with high-end cars, and the buzz around Tesla was infectious. Riding in one was nothing short of a thrilling adventure, marking the exhilarating start of my Amsterdam odyssey.
I arrived at my home around 5 p.m., and it was already dark outside. I had never experienced this in India, where the sun sets much later. My friend and I were so excited to be in Amsterdam that we decided to make dinner and go to bed early so that we could wake up early the next morning and start exploring.
I was nervous on my first day at the office in Amsterdam. I had never been to the city before. But as soon as I walked in, I was greeted by warm smiles from my new colleagues and clients.
My Indian colleagues introduced me to everyone, including my Dutch clients. I was immediately struck by how friendly and welcoming everyone was. My client even asked me about my journey to Amsterdam and how I was settling in.
At lunchtime, I went out with my senior colleagues, we had a delicious meal together. We talked about everything from what we needed to settle in, to the Dutch culture, and some places to travel. I felt so comfortable and at ease.
By the end of the day, I had made a lot of new friends in the office and learned a lot about the company and the city. I was so grateful for the warm welcome I had received.
Through the days, I effortlessly adapted to the Amsterdam culture and people, and I also explored the city’s many attractions. I was captivated by Amsterdam’s distinctive beauty. My personal experience revealed five compelling reasons why Amsterdam stands out as an exceptional destination for both work and leisure:
Canals that Captivate: Amsterdam’s intricate network of canals is a sight to behold, earning it the nickname “Venice of the North.” The reflection of gabled houses in the still waters, along with charming bridges and tree-lined streets, creates a picturesque scene that is reminiscent of a fairytale. For example, the Prinsengracht Canal is home to many beautiful 17th-century houses, while the Keizersgracht Canal is known for its elegant mansions. The canals are also a great place to spot boats and people-watch.
Historical Charm: Amsterdam’s well-preserved architecture stands as a testament to its rich history. As you stroll through the city, you’ll encounter stunning 17th-century buildings, each with its own unique character and story, offering a glimpse into the city’s past. For example, the Anne Frank House is a poignant reminder of the city’s role in World War II, while the Royal Palace is a magnificent example of Dutch Baroque architecture. The city’s canals are also lined with historic buildings, such as the gabled houses of the Jordaan neighborhood.
Cultural Diversity: The city is a melting pot of cultures, and this diversity is reflected in its art, food, and people. From world-class museums like the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum to vibrant neighborhoods like De Pijp, there’s a cultural richness that adds to the city’s allure.
Laid-back atmosphere: Amsterdam has a relaxed and easy-going atmosphere. I appreciated the friendly demeanor of the locals, as it was quite common for strangers to exchange warm greetings with smiles. In all my travels to various countries, I had never witnessed such a welcoming attitude towards strangers.
Diverse workforce: Amsterdam has a diverse workforce, with people from all over the world living and working in the city. This diversity makes for a vibrant and exciting work environment.
Bicycle-Friendly Bliss: Amsterdam’s flat terrain and extensive network of cycling lanes make it a cyclist’s paradise. The sight of countless bicycles whizzing past historic sites, parks, and picturesque canals is not only beautiful, but it is also an embodiment of the city’s eco-friendly ethos. Conveniently, there are bicycle pumps attached to some bicycle areas for filling tires.
Amsterdam is a foodie’s paradise, with a wide variety of restaurants and dishes to choose from, whether you’re looking for a quick bite or a leisurely meal. I sampled some of the city’s most famous dishes, including:
Poffertjes: Small pancakes often served with powdered sugar, fruit, or syrup.Stroopwafels: Thin waffles filled with sweet syrup.Stamppot: Traditional Dutch mashed potatoes with vegetablesErwtensoep: Popular Dutch pea soup, also available in vegetarian versions.
My love for the delicious waffles was only surpassed by my visit to Zaanse Schans, Amsterdam’s old town, where I sampled a variety of delectable cheeseses. I promise you, they were incredibly tasty!
My two months in Amsterdam were an unforgettable experience. I had the opportunity to work on a challenging project, meet new people from all over the world, and explore a beautiful and vibrant city. I also had the chance to travel to other parts of Europe, which was a dream come true.
I’m so grateful for the opportunity I had to live and work in Amsterdam. It was an experience that has changed me for the better. I made lifelong friends, learned new things, and created memories that will last a lifetime.
When it was time to leave, I was sad to say goodbye to my new friends and the city I had come to love. But I know that I will return one day. Amsterdam has a special place in my heart, and I can’t wait to go back and explore more.
Vincent van Gogh once said, ‘Amsterdam is a city of dreams, and I am a dreamer.’
I couldn’t agree more. Amsterdam is a city that inspires creativity and imagination. It’s a city where anything is possible. If you’re looking for a city that will challenge and inspire you, Amsterdam is the place for you.
I hope that this blog post has given you a glimpse into my experience in Amsterdam. If you’re ever thinking about visiting this amazing city, I highly recommend it!

happy, unique, goofy
1 week (or forever if you can)
Wow! I honestly love Amsterdam so much! The people seem so at ease with life and It is a very liberal spiritual place. Everyone is very open minded and accepting of anyone.
Amsterdam is mainly Dutch people so a lot of the people are very tall and blond. Another thing to consider is prostitution, weed, and psychedelics such as truffles are legal despite this everyone seems incredibly responsible and people seem to keep a good balance of life in Amsterdam. It really is the happiest and most open minded place I’ve been to so far and that’s why it is my favorite place so far.
Right from Amsterdam Central you can take a free ferry that will take you to NDSM and it takes about 5–10 mins to get there and the Ferry comes constantly I honestly felt like I never had to wait for one. NDSM is a hip urban area with lots of cool graffiti and hip restaurants to check out. Not to mention the interesting places you can stay at like the Crane hotel oh and you can also bungee jump from it, if you decide to. The area also has lots of special events such a music festivals, flea markets, and movie nights. Its a great place to check out and Its not too crowded so it’s nice getting away from all the people in the main area.
This may be one of my favorite museum trips that I have gone on so far. I really liked that it focused on one artist throughout, and I felt like I really got to see Van Gogh’s life and how it affected his art. I have to say I am a HUGE Van Gogh fan, I really love his brush strokes and his bright use of color. I felt like I got pulled into every single painting diving into each brush stroke and seeing the lines up close then pulling back to see the full picture that he created. I don’t know how he did it but he made each scene look so serene and stylized.
I need to also mention the sensory room where each room you get the senses that Van Gogh was feeling throughout his life. I thought it was so creative because I truly felt like I was living and seeing the things that Van Gogh felt.
I mean you honestly can’t go to Amsterdam without going to the Red Light District at least once. Walking through the red light district you can’t take any photos. You basically see women in windows with red lights above them in their underwear standing or sitting, and they kind of look bored or like their busy looking at their phone. It was an interesting experience but one to definitely check out and experience once.
One of the most unforgettable experiences I have had so far, A’dam lookout is where you go on the top of one of the buildings and there are these 2 electric swings that basically swing you back and fourth for about 2 mins. It was seriously such a magical feeling I honestly felt like I was on top of the world and flying for a second. I will admit it was really scary because you are so high up and you look down and don’t see anything right under you but it is one of the things that you can’t really forget because you just feel so much.
The canal tour is so worth it, you basically just go down the canals throughout the city, it is so fun to see all the little boat houses right on the canals.
I personally really liked the Mocco museum because it had more urban graffiti artists such Banksy, icy & slot, Koons and Warhol. They also had a 3D installation room where you walk into a room in the style of Lichtenstein (which is the bright comic book style with bold colors and lines throughout). The museum is not that big but I kind of like that, your not overwhelmed by all of the art and you can engage in each and every one. Each piece had a strong statement about freedom and freedom of expression.
I checked out multiple psychedelic shops (there were many) and these 2 stood out the most to me.
Kokopelli was very informal and the staff really knew their stuff and loved to talk about it, they sold lots of other interesting things such as Brazilian herbs to help with lucid dreaming. Or seeds that you can grow and eat for different types of needs. They even had an area where you can sit and take your shrooms if you decide to buy it from them.
Alien Visitors s a fun small raver type of shop, with techno music playing and neon fluorescent items throughout the store. I ended up buying a really cute black shirt with some green neon print designs down the middle. It wasn’t too crazy with the designs like how some raver shirts can get a little tacky when its overplayed and I really love the pattern on it.

Today marks five years since I moved from my country to Europe, gradually settling into the vibrant life of Amsterdam. This year is my second year in the Netherlands and five years in Europe overall. This milestone feels like the right moment to reflect on the journey so far. I’m grateful for the personal and professional growth along the way — it’s been quite a journey. I first landed in Berlin, but soon after, COVID hit, and finding a job was a real challenge during that time. After gaining experience living in Berlin, I wanted to see if there was a better place before fully committing to Germany, so I decided to look for opportunities outside of Berlin. Eventually, I found a job in Amsterdam. As things slowly started to recover, the war began, adding another layer to the experience.
My connection with Berlin runs deep. I’ve had a long relationship with the city since my early 20s, when a few of my friends moved there from St. Petersburg and helped me explore Berlin from within. The city quickly became a familiar and vibrant part of my life, with friends and unforgettable experiences. I met my boyfriend just before moving there myself (now my husband) which made the transition even more meaningful. Berlin was more than just a place to live! :) It felt like a second home. Being there was a dream come true in a natural and seamless way.
Our move to Amsterdam was driven by curiosity and a sense of uncertainty about our future in Germany. It takes a lot of effort to fully integrate there and to acknowledge the challenges of living in Germany. Here in the Netherlands, I’ve found a country that values directness, innovation, out-of-the-box thinking, and problem-solving — a motivating environment that has enabled me to grow both professionally and personally.
Sometimes, I feel like a character in Atlas Shrugged, navigating a landscape that mirrors Germany today — a system entangled in endless layers of rules, bureaucracy, reluctance to change, and a fear of moving forward that places increasing demands on companies. Germany feels like a perfect analogy to the world described in the book, where innovation is stifled by rigid structures and a lack of forward thinking. In contrast, the Netherlands represents a refreshing example of how things should operate, with efficiency, innovation, and a practical approach to problem-solving that brings real results.
Having spent years in the digital industry, focusing on process optimization, self-service, and enhancing customer experience, I’ve developed a unique perspective on understanding challenges and identifying opportunities. The Dutch approach to digital transformation, with its emphasis on innovation and efficient governance, aligns closely with my values in creating effective systems and customer-centric solutions. This kind of forward-thinking approach isn’t something I found at a national level in Germany. I know many entrepreneurial people working hard to drive change, but Germany requires significant structural shifts to address the crises ahead. Neglecting change and innovation will make it increasingly difficult to overcome these challenges.
My journey began in Berlin, where I experienced Germany’s intense focus on rules, processes, and seemingly endless layers of bureaucracy. In Amsterdam, I discovered a dynamic, flexible mindset, where people think outside the box — and, most importantly, where people, companies, and even bureaucracies focus on solving problems, not creating more. Both countries have their strengths, yet the Netherlands’ agility and commitment to achieving real outcomes — not just outputs — have made me fall in love with the country and see hope for Europe’s future.
As I look back on these five years, I’m excited about what lies ahead. Amsterdam has become more than just a place to live! It’s a community that drives my curiosity and keeps me moving forward. I look forward to continuing this journey, bringing fresh perspectives to the digital industry, and helping to solve the challenges that await us all in Europe.

Our luggage and other heavy things have all been stashed in an L-size locker at Amsterdam Centraal. Sweet! Aww, my inner child jolted as soon as we exited Amsterdam Centraal. At the same time, my eyes caught a lady skipping happily toward someone who seemed to be waiting for her. A display of simple human happiness. I thought momentarily, ‘Wow, there are so many people here!’ It seems the weekend atmosphere had contributed to the crowd. And that crowd! This sight quickly reminded me how ‘international’ this city — or country — is.
Stepping out of the square, the tram rails are lined right up next to the road. The way they weave together looks a bit messy on the asphalt. I’ve seen similar setups in other places, but I still find it a bit tricky to wrap my head around all these different modes of transportation crammed together. I prefer things to be a little plainer.
To cross the road, I found myself a bit disoriented at first; I wasn’t sure if there was a designated area for crossing. Later that day, Bu Jeannie used the phrase ‘Indonesian way.’ Sekar and I, after observing the traffic situation, also mentioned it and joked about doing it the ‘Indo way.’
We’ve got Google Maps in hand. We try to be wise with our batteries. We want to use Sekar’s phone for navigation and my phone for taking pictures. The direction is facing the city: heading…

Amsterdam is often known as the bicycle capital of the world. If you are an advocate of active transportation, there are some YouTubers and bloggers praising Amsterdam for their bike friendliness. BicycleDutch and NotJustBikes come to mind. However, if you are visiting Amsterdam and wanting to ride a bike but haven’t since childhood, I can imagine it can be intimidating. I don’t blame people from North America traveling to Amsterdam and being fearful of riding a bike. If you normally don’t ride, it’s a difficult adjustment. My guess is if you are visiting Amsterdam from North America, you MIGHT hop on a bike for an afternoon as a novelty, but then go back to what you are comfortable with. Most people from North America drive. And most people from other parts of the world probably do not have the bicycling culture like the Dutch or Danish. It’s like if you’re not used to taking public transit in your home country, you might shy away from taking public transit when you travel. You’ll opt for the Hop On Hop Off buses, using ride share or joining a tour group. All are fine, but I would say you are missing out on a uniquely Dutch experience by not taking a bike to get you around town…and riding it as often as possible.
So what is it like riding a bike in Amsterdam? Here are some tips from my experience for visiting Amsterdam and riding a bike if you haven’t ridden since childhood. If you are used to riding consistently as an adult, especially if your bike is your transportation, then you shouldn’t have a problem riding in Amsterdam. The learning curve shouldn’t be too steep.
Otherwise, you will probably be “that” tourist that doesn’t know the rules of riding. There’s plenty of websites that go more into detail on the rules of riding. I’m not going to get that detailed. Instead, I will touch on some basics of what it must feel like riding if you haven’t ridden a bike since forever.
If you are “that” tourist and want to get on a bike, then here are some of my suggestions for “people who normally don’t ride a bike but want to in Amsterdam”.
First, get away from the city center, especially if you are visiting during the summer months where tourism is at its peak. It can get packed with people on bikes, on foot, cars and tour buses. The center of the city also seems to have less separated bike paths, so you’re riding close to other drivers. There’s also vans parked in the bike lanes, so you’ll need to navigate around them by safely moving around other riders and drivers. Plus, you’ll want to be careful crossing the tram tracks as bicycle tires can get caught in it and you will fall.
Find a hotel, hostel, Airbnb, etc outside of the city center that also rents bikes. You don’t have to go too far out but just far enough for you to practice. When I went there, I stayed near Vondel Park. My place rented bikes which was convenient and Vondel Park is a great place to practice riding around.
In the US (and I assume it’s similar in other countries), I notice beginner riders tend to weave around a lot and often ride really slow. There’s nothing wrong with that, but if you want to ride on the bike paths in Amsterdam, you’ll need to practice not weaving around so much and to ride faster. Basically, if you wouldn’t drive your car weaving from lane to lane, then you shouldn’t do that on a bike. Anyways, Vondel Park would be a good place to reintroduce yourself to the bike. Lots of people ride through here to get to their destination so you’ll see lots of riders. But the paths are wide enough for the locals to go around you as you’re starting off.
My biggest advice to those wanting to hop on a bike for the first time is don’t just randomly stop in middle of a bike path because you saw this cool cafe or bar or some interesting mural. Please pull off to the side of the bike path so you don’t block anybody or cause a crash. There is a 100% chance someone is riding right behind you. And just like driving, you don’t just stop in the middle of the road because you saw something cool off to the side. So don’t do that on a bike either.
My next advice is to use hand signals and turn your head to make sure it’s clear before you decide to turn, stop or slow down. Watch how the locals use hand signals. But all you need to do is slightly bend your right arm outwards to show you are turning right and slightly bend your left arm outwards to show you are turning left.
There’s no need to extend your entire arm out when you need to turn. By doing that, you’ll most likely smack someone riding next to you. This of course goes back to turning your head so you know who is around you.
Once you get comfortable riding around in the park, you can move onto neighborhood streets and separated bike paths outside of the city center.
Amsterdam has lots of bicycle signals, so make sure you pay attention to the signals.
Intersections can also be tricky because you’ll need to know when to yield and when not to yield. Pay attention to the “shark teeth” symbols on the ground.
The good thing about being on a bike is even if you are uncertain on what to do, everybody can still move around each other and usually not cause a crash. People can usually read your body language on a bike and you’ll be able to do the same the more your ride.
It’s not like being in a car, where you are unable to see the person driving. In a car, you can’t predict what the people next to you will do. But it’s easier on a bike because you can see the entire person.
One thing I also noticed is that drivers and cyclists will look for any open space to squeeze in (which to me is a bit reminiscent of NYC). There were a couple of drivers that came rather close to me in the city center. I noticed two types of license plates in Amsterdam. The yellow and the blue plates. I had a close pass with a blue license plate driver. I later overheard those are the taxi and delivery drivers? So I guess it makes sense they are more aggressive (even though they shouldn’t be)?
And you know that saying “practice makes perfect”? The more you ride, the more you’ll get the hang of how things are done. And riding a bike in Amsterdam is absolutely amazing! It’s just not something you can experience in the US. Bikes really provide the freedom that cars do not (despite car ads from the last 100 years proclaiming driving is freedom). You don’t need a helmet when riding, so you truly can feel the “wind in your hair”.
And one final tips. Remember where you parked your bike. Take a photo or video of where you parked and the surrounding area. A lot of bikes look similar and they are often jammed together.
And once you get the hang of this, you can ride to grab coffee or a beer. Ride to a park or museum. You’ll soon discover how easy it is to navigate the city by bike. And how many more places you can see without having to pay for the tram, Uber or follow a guided tour. With a bike, you can have the freedom to explore local neighborhoods, cafes and restaurants that might not be in a guide book.
I can’t wait to go back and ride again and I hope if you’re reading this and planning a trip there, you will want to ride as much as possible while you are there.

I idly watched tiny droplets of moisture licking at the plane’s wings as cotton wool clouds and sparkling sunbeams made way for a sea of green and grey, followed by a seemingly-endless taxi along the runway. Almost as soon as I’d left the UK, I was in Amsterdam for a springtime mini break. The grey skies above did nothing to dull my spirit as I muddled through the train system and took a final, deep breath of city air. That’s right. After a pretty hefty hiatus from Medium, I’m back — and accompanied by tales from a small European country known as The Netherlands in April 2025.
As I left the station, I was hit instantly with the lingering aroma of marijuana, coupled with street music and a relentless stream of bicycles. Weaving through tiny streets, the constant bang bang bang of my suitcase wheels on the cobbles grew more comforting than annoying. Finally, after a few wrong turns, I could see the sign for my hostel just up ahead.
I had a little time to kill and so resolved to head out on foot. I ended up down a major shopping street, but resisted the urge to pop into the large Primark. Scattered…

Have you ever imagined immersing yourself in one of the world’s most dynamic and thrilling cities, all while advancing your career? This is the story of my remarkable journey.
As a young software engineer employed at a reputable multinational company in India, the opportunity to embark on a two-month onsite assignment in Amsterdam was nothing short of a dream come true. The mere thought of exploring Europe had always danced at the periphery of my aspirations, yet, as someone from India, such an adventure often felt distant and financially out of reach.
But I persevered, putting in the hard work and dedication necessary to secure this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Finally, the moment had arrived when I could set foot in Amsterdam, and I was filled with boundless gratitude for having reached this significant milestone. Now, let me share with you the captivating journey that unfolded, as I discovered the city’s perfect blend of work and play, and why it has become a place I’ll cherish forever.
One electrifying week before the grand adventure, I embarked on a whirlwind of preparations. With a fresh haircut and meticulous grooming, I was ready to step into the unknown. The day of departure finally dawned, and my parents joined me for a heartwarming farewell at the airport. The excitement in the air was palpable as I embarked on a journey I had been eagerly awaiting.
The flight seemed to stretch on, but the moment we touched down at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, I was immediately captivated by the city’s breathtaking beauty. The sight was a feast for the senses, a stunning welcome to this new chapter in my life. My heart raced with anticipation as I hopped into a sleek Tesla taxi. The streets were teeming with high-end cars, and the buzz around Tesla was infectious. Riding in one was nothing short of a thrilling adventure, marking the exhilarating start of my Amsterdam odyssey.
I arrived at my home around 5 p.m., and it was already dark outside. I had never experienced this in India, where the sun sets much later. My friend and I were so excited to be in Amsterdam that we decided to make dinner and go to bed early so that we could wake up early the next morning and start exploring.
I was nervous on my first day at the office in Amsterdam. I had never been to the city before. But as soon as I walked in, I was greeted by warm smiles from my new colleagues and clients.
My Indian colleagues introduced me to everyone, including my Dutch clients. I was immediately struck by how friendly and welcoming everyone was. My client even asked me about my journey to Amsterdam and how I was settling in.
At lunchtime, I went out with my senior colleagues, we had a delicious meal together. We talked about everything from what we needed to settle in, to the Dutch culture, and some places to travel. I felt so comfortable and at ease.
By the end of the day, I had made a lot of new friends in the office and learned a lot about the company and the city. I was so grateful for the warm welcome I had received.
Through the days, I effortlessly adapted to the Amsterdam culture and people, and I also explored the city’s many attractions. I was captivated by Amsterdam’s distinctive beauty. My personal experience revealed five compelling reasons why Amsterdam stands out as an exceptional destination for both work and leisure:
Canals that Captivate: Amsterdam’s intricate network of canals is a sight to behold, earning it the nickname “Venice of the North.” The reflection of gabled houses in the still waters, along with charming bridges and tree-lined streets, creates a picturesque scene that is reminiscent of a fairytale. For example, the Prinsengracht Canal is home to many beautiful 17th-century houses, while the Keizersgracht Canal is known for its elegant mansions. The canals are also a great place to spot boats and people-watch.
Historical Charm: Amsterdam’s well-preserved architecture stands as a testament to its rich history. As you stroll through the city, you’ll encounter stunning 17th-century buildings, each with its own unique character and story, offering a glimpse into the city’s past. For example, the Anne Frank House is a poignant reminder of the city’s role in World War II, while the Royal Palace is a magnificent example of Dutch Baroque architecture. The city’s canals are also lined with historic buildings, such as the gabled houses of the Jordaan neighborhood.
Cultural Diversity: The city is a melting pot of cultures, and this diversity is reflected in its art, food, and people. From world-class museums like the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum to vibrant neighborhoods like De Pijp, there’s a cultural richness that adds to the city’s allure.
Laid-back atmosphere: Amsterdam has a relaxed and easy-going atmosphere. I appreciated the friendly demeanor of the locals, as it was quite common for strangers to exchange warm greetings with smiles. In all my travels to various countries, I had never witnessed such a welcoming attitude towards strangers.
Diverse workforce: Amsterdam has a diverse workforce, with people from all over the world living and working in the city. This diversity makes for a vibrant and exciting work environment.
Bicycle-Friendly Bliss: Amsterdam’s flat terrain and extensive network of cycling lanes make it a cyclist’s paradise. The sight of countless bicycles whizzing past historic sites, parks, and picturesque canals is not only beautiful, but it is also an embodiment of the city’s eco-friendly ethos. Conveniently, there are bicycle pumps attached to some bicycle areas for filling tires.
Amsterdam is a foodie’s paradise, with a wide variety of restaurants and dishes to choose from, whether you’re looking for a quick bite or a leisurely meal. I sampled some of the city’s most famous dishes, including:
Poffertjes: Small pancakes often served with powdered sugar, fruit, or syrup.Stroopwafels: Thin waffles filled with sweet syrup.Stamppot: Traditional Dutch mashed potatoes with vegetablesErwtensoep: Popular Dutch pea soup, also available in vegetarian versions.
My love for the delicious waffles was only surpassed by my visit to Zaanse Schans, Amsterdam’s old town, where I sampled a variety of delectable cheeseses. I promise you, they were incredibly tasty!
My two months in Amsterdam were an unforgettable experience. I had the opportunity to work on a challenging project, meet new people from all over the world, and explore a beautiful and vibrant city. I also had the chance to travel to other parts of Europe, which was a dream come true.
I’m so grateful for the opportunity I had to live and work in Amsterdam. It was an experience that has changed me for the better. I made lifelong friends, learned new things, and created memories that will last a lifetime.
When it was time to leave, I was sad to say goodbye to my new friends and the city I had come to love. But I know that I will return one day. Amsterdam has a special place in my heart, and I can’t wait to go back and explore more.
Vincent van Gogh once said, ‘Amsterdam is a city of dreams, and I am a dreamer.’
I couldn’t agree more. Amsterdam is a city that inspires creativity and imagination. It’s a city where anything is possible. If you’re looking for a city that will challenge and inspire you, Amsterdam is the place for you.
I hope that this blog post has given you a glimpse into my experience in Amsterdam. If you’re ever thinking about visiting this amazing city, I highly recommend it!

The Dutch have the philosophy, ‘If what you are doing is not harming anyone but you, then what is the problem?’
We got to Amsterdam on Thursday and checked into Clink Hostels, and right away it felt like we were walking onto a college campus. The lobby was live — people from all around the world were playing games, talking, listening to live music, and getting us ready for the weekend. We put down our bags and headed into town. Like other college students, our first stop was the Red Light District. As we walked along the canals, we were amazed at what we witnessed. We were not used to this in the United States. Having taken it all in, we stopped for some fries at a local diner and headed home for the night.
Friday morning, we ferried over the water for breakfast and sampled a stroopwafel — a famous thin waffle with caramel in the middle. They were so good we ended up buying the whole pack to take back home to the US. We strolled the streets a little more and got ready for our next adventure, a canal tour.
Imagine 24 of us crammed on a boat with an open bar — it was fun, to say the least. The vibe was great, we rode down the canal in great company. The music was loud, so we traded the risk of seasickness for dancing. It was worth it. The city itself became a background of ancient buildings and bridges, but the thing that defined the moment was the music. The way I see it is in this culture, you kind of just go with the flow. You never know what to expect, just like the music.
We grabbed dinner after the tour at Ciao Bella, a local pizza place that was ideal for the night ahead of us. We headed to Escape, one of the largest clubs in the city, and abruptly, we were immersed in Amsterdam’s nightlife. We stood up front row to the DJ and took it all in. It was normal music that you would hear at a club, but something was different. The crowd was a lot more into it, and everybody was feeling the music. The DJ stood there leading the crowd, feeding off the crazy energy coming from them. I could finally see why Amsterdam was renowned as such a party city. Somewhere along the early morning, we ended up at a McDonald’s. And I have to say — Amsterdam’s McDonald’s? Better than Barcelona’s. It did the trick before we finally crashed for the night.
Saturday, we woke up and discovered we had the day to ourselves. We walked around and ended up in Amsterdam’s center. We took pictures of the national monument and learned about its history. After a few more hours of touring, we found a bar that caught our eye. The bartenders weren’t regular bartenders — they were entertainers. They were singing along to every song at the top of their lungs. The first song that came on that I will never forget was “Getting Away with It” by James. And for some reason, it felt completely appropriate. Amsterdam is a city of challenging norms, living in the moment, and doing the unexpected. Inside this bar was the perfect atmosphere to witness the city in person.
The day turned into another night, and we were back in the district at the Red Light Bar, a staple hangout where we played pool and watched some Premier League soccer. People continued to pile in until finally, it was too packed. We bar-toured up the strip, each with its own interpretation of Amsterdam’s style. Some blasted classic rock, while others played house music, but each one of them told a story.
By the end of the trip, we were ready to go. We realized that a weekend in Amsterdam was just right — no longer. The city was crazy and awesome at the same time. From the sound of a club to the ring of a bar song, to the energy on the canal, every sound in this city served a purpose. Overall, Amsterdam exceeded our expectations and gave us a weekend to remember.
If you enjoyed this adventure, make sure to follow me for more! I’ll be sharing another exciting destination next week, so stay tuned — you won’t want to miss it. Thanks for reading, and see you in the next blog!

happy, unique, goofy
1 week (or forever if you can)
Wow! I honestly love Amsterdam so much! The people seem so at ease with life and It is a very liberal spiritual place. Everyone is very open minded and accepting of anyone.
Amsterdam is mainly Dutch people so a lot of the people are very tall and blond. Another thing to consider is prostitution, weed, and psychedelics such as truffles are legal despite this everyone seems incredibly responsible and people seem to keep a good balance of life in Amsterdam. It really is the happiest and most open minded place I’ve been to so far and that’s why it is my favorite place so far.
Right from Amsterdam Central you can take a free ferry that will take you to NDSM and it takes about 5–10 mins to get there and the Ferry comes constantly I honestly felt like I never had to wait for one. NDSM is a hip urban area with lots of cool graffiti and hip restaurants to check out. Not to mention the interesting places you can stay at like the Crane hotel oh and you can also bungee jump from it, if you decide to. The area also has lots of special events such a music festivals, flea markets, and movie nights. Its a great place to check out and Its not too crowded so it’s nice getting away from all the people in the main area.
This may be one of my favorite museum trips that I have gone on so far. I really liked that it focused on one artist throughout, and I felt like I really got to see Van Gogh’s life and how it affected his art. I have to say I am a HUGE Van Gogh fan, I really love his brush strokes and his bright use of color. I felt like I got pulled into every single painting diving into each brush stroke and seeing the lines up close then pulling back to see the full picture that he created. I don’t know how he did it but he made each scene look so serene and stylized.
I need to also mention the sensory room where each room you get the senses that Van Gogh was feeling throughout his life. I thought it was so creative because I truly felt like I was living and seeing the things that Van Gogh felt.
I mean you honestly can’t go to Amsterdam without going to the Red Light District at least once. Walking through the red light district you can’t take any photos. You basically see women in windows with red lights above them in their underwear standing or sitting, and they kind of look bored or like their busy looking at their phone. It was an interesting experience but one to definitely check out and experience once.
One of the most unforgettable experiences I have had so far, A’dam lookout is where you go on the top of one of the buildings and there are these 2 electric swings that basically swing you back and fourth for about 2 mins. It was seriously such a magical feeling I honestly felt like I was on top of the world and flying for a second. I will admit it was really scary because you are so high up and you look down and don’t see anything right under you but it is one of the things that you can’t really forget because you just feel so much.
The canal tour is so worth it, you basically just go down the canals throughout the city, it is so fun to see all the little boat houses right on the canals.
I personally really liked the Mocco museum because it had more urban graffiti artists such Banksy, icy & slot, Koons and Warhol. They also had a 3D installation room where you walk into a room in the style of Lichtenstein (which is the bright comic book style with bold colors and lines throughout). The museum is not that big but I kind of like that, your not overwhelmed by all of the art and you can engage in each and every one. Each piece had a strong statement about freedom and freedom of expression.
I checked out multiple psychedelic shops (there were many) and these 2 stood out the most to me.
Kokopelli was very informal and the staff really knew their stuff and loved to talk about it, they sold lots of other interesting things such as Brazilian herbs to help with lucid dreaming. Or seeds that you can grow and eat for different types of needs. They even had an area where you can sit and take your shrooms if you decide to buy it from them.
Alien Visitors s a fun small raver type of shop, with techno music playing and neon fluorescent items throughout the store. I ended up buying a really cute black shirt with some green neon print designs down the middle. It wasn’t too crazy with the designs like how some raver shirts can get a little tacky when its overplayed and I really love the pattern on it.

Today marks five years since I moved from my country to Europe, gradually settling into the vibrant life of Amsterdam. This year is my second year in the Netherlands and five years in Europe overall. This milestone feels like the right moment to reflect on the journey so far. I’m grateful for the personal and professional growth along the way — it’s been quite a journey. I first landed in Berlin, but soon after, COVID hit, and finding a job was a real challenge during that time. After gaining experience living in Berlin, I wanted to see if there was a better place before fully committing to Germany, so I decided to look for opportunities outside of Berlin. Eventually, I found a job in Amsterdam. As things slowly started to recover, the war began, adding another layer to the experience.
My connection with Berlin runs deep. I’ve had a long relationship with the city since my early 20s, when a few of my friends moved there from St. Petersburg and helped me explore Berlin from within. The city quickly became a familiar and vibrant part of my life, with friends and unforgettable experiences. I met my boyfriend just before moving there myself (now my husband) which made the transition even more meaningful. Berlin was more than just a place to live! :) It felt like a second home. Being there was a dream come true in a natural and seamless way.
Our move to Amsterdam was driven by curiosity and a sense of uncertainty about our future in Germany. It takes a lot of effort to fully integrate there and to acknowledge the challenges of living in Germany. Here in the Netherlands, I’ve found a country that values directness, innovation, out-of-the-box thinking, and problem-solving — a motivating environment that has enabled me to grow both professionally and personally.
Sometimes, I feel like a character in Atlas Shrugged, navigating a landscape that mirrors Germany today — a system entangled in endless layers of rules, bureaucracy, reluctance to change, and a fear of moving forward that places increasing demands on companies. Germany feels like a perfect analogy to the world described in the book, where innovation is stifled by rigid structures and a lack of forward thinking. In contrast, the Netherlands represents a refreshing example of how things should operate, with efficiency, innovation, and a practical approach to problem-solving that brings real results.
Having spent years in the digital industry, focusing on process optimization, self-service, and enhancing customer experience, I’ve developed a unique perspective on understanding challenges and identifying opportunities. The Dutch approach to digital transformation, with its emphasis on innovation and efficient governance, aligns closely with my values in creating effective systems and customer-centric solutions. This kind of forward-thinking approach isn’t something I found at a national level in Germany. I know many entrepreneurial people working hard to drive change, but Germany requires significant structural shifts to address the crises ahead. Neglecting change and innovation will make it increasingly difficult to overcome these challenges.
My journey began in Berlin, where I experienced Germany’s intense focus on rules, processes, and seemingly endless layers of bureaucracy. In Amsterdam, I discovered a dynamic, flexible mindset, where people think outside the box — and, most importantly, where people, companies, and even bureaucracies focus on solving problems, not creating more. Both countries have their strengths, yet the Netherlands’ agility and commitment to achieving real outcomes — not just outputs — have made me fall in love with the country and see hope for Europe’s future.
As I look back on these five years, I’m excited about what lies ahead. Amsterdam has become more than just a place to live! It’s a community that drives my curiosity and keeps me moving forward. I look forward to continuing this journey, bringing fresh perspectives to the digital industry, and helping to solve the challenges that await us all in Europe.

Hi there! Maeghan & Oli here - we're taking a break to travel the world and hope you'll join us for the ride. 🌏✈️ 👫 www.alittledetour.ca

We were talking the other day about how untypical it has been to revisit a country you’ve had the chance to travel before. I mean, there are a few exceptions (for work Maeghan would travel to certain cities each year for conferences) but to visit a city you went to when you were in your 20s and then revisit 7 years later is a pretty cool experience.
Maeghan came to the Netherlands during college and has family scattered across the small country. She remembers having little money and being nervous to travel on her own without some sort of direction. But this time around, we’ve been lucky to make friends while traveling, had the time to mature as travellers and that makes visiting the same places in a totally different mindset is pretty awesome.
After some time in Amersfoort, we visited Utrecht and Amsterdam and got to indulge in some super fun stuff.
Oh, we also learned a lot about the Netherlands. 1) Maeghan was brought up calling it Holland. Turns out, there is an interesting reason why (Watch the CPG grey video to explain) 2) This country is tiny and so easy to get around in comparison to most of the other places we’ve visited 3) Everything and everyone is awesome here. So you should visit ❤
See more on our website www.alittledetour.ca🌏✈️👫
We celebrated Maeghan’s birthday in Amersfoort and she was totally spoiled. After the early gift of Balloon rides in Cappadocia, we got to tour around where her grandparents lived and grew up and had a awesome dinner at a jazz pub near by with family.
So these are house boats. People buy the spot on the water and build a house that is anchored there. We were kind of mind blown, some of these house boats are super modern!
We had a jam-pack planned Saturday in Amsterdam. It started with Maeghan trying to be cool like all the young kids and get her ear pierced (she felt very hardcore), then strolling through some markets and craft beer stores as it was Zwanze Day (A special beer event from one of Oli’s favorite breweries) until we reached our final destination at a concert, The Pineapple Thief, that Oli had been looking forward to for weeks!
We made some Canadian friends from Newfoundland dat the bar and talked all about living and traveling abroad, and how crazy of a place Amsterdam can be!
The demographic of attendees was older, so there was no pushing, no garbage on the floor, lots of space and really nice people all around! What a way to enjoy a concert! :P
The next day, Banksy had one of his famous pieces auctioned off and to everyone’s surprise, he had it self- shred upon purchase. So Oli felt very relevant after learning all about Banksy.

Hoy! The capital of the Netherlands holds a special place in my heart. Never have I liked a big city as much as Amsterdam. It booms with people from all over the world, the standard of living is exquisite, and there are so many bike lanes! Find yourself wandering around Amsterdam, taking in the canals, the houses among them, the marvelous new architecture, and experiencing this small but beautiful country.
Get yourself the real deal: A fresh Stroopwafel on a market. This is so good; I cannot even describe it. Stroopwafels are a traditional dutch pastry; a doughball with spices and cinnamon gets baked into the Wafel. The thought of the smell when it comes out waters my mouth! It then gets cut open, and a thick sirup, the Stroop, is put onto it, and tadaa, you have yourself a heavenly tasting dessert. Or…

I have never seriously considered the expat life: I’m too fond of deep-fried foods and the convenience of driving to supermarkets that sell everything I need. But after spending four days in Amsterdam, I may have to reconsider my attachment to American soil. Amsterdam is without a doubt the most beautiful city I’ve ever seen — I think it’s even more picturesque than Paris. Almost every street is divided by a canal dotted with houseboats, and the brightly colored buildings with tall windows lean gracefully over the streets and canals. Bridges are sprinkled with flower boxes, and the scent of flowers, food, and other herbs wafts into the streets.
I stayed about 30 minutes outside of the city at Lucky Lake Hostel on Lake Vinkeveen. Lucky Lake is more than just a hostel: it is a community, where travelers from all over the world eat breakfast together in a converted bus, kayak the lake together, or unwind at night together in the lounge. Painted camper trailers, small cabins, tents, and hammocks form a ring around the property, with a block of gender-neutral showers and toilets (those absurdly progressive Dutch!) in the center, campground-style. Staff members or guests cook big dinners every night in the outdoor kitchen, and anyone can chip in for a share of the food. Guests and staff actually hang out in the lounge at night to play cards or the guitar, creating a sense of community that many hostels advertise but very few actually deliver. It was truly the experience of a lifetime.
The lake was a three-minute walk from my camper door. On my first day, I joined a couple of friends I made on the shuttle and rented kayaks for €3/hour to explore the waters. We paddled our way through a maze of canals and tiny houses with tinier boats until we reached the lake. The water was so clear you could almost see the bottom, and we saw more sailboats and kayaks than motorboats.
Later that day, I decided to take the hostel shuttle into the city to walk around and see what I could discover. I found that the Dutch way of life is perhaps the most relaxed in the world: they grow tulips and marijuana, ride bicycles, and eat fresh cheese and chocolate-covered waffles. All the people I met were very laid-back and pleasant, even more so than the Belgians. So that’s why the Dutch are consistently recognized as the happiest people in the world!
Amsterdam is truly a city of bicycles. It has more bicycles than people and more bike lanes than streets. It’s very pleasant to hear the tinkle of thousands of bells and to see so many people cycling their way through the city (it must be the Dutch secret to staying fit despite eating lots of waffles). Pro tip: don’t walk in the bike lanes! I was crossing a bike lane when I saw this really cool Dutch bookstore out of the corner of my eye. I decided midway across the street to check it out and changed direction, only to collide into a passing bicycle. My phone flew out of my hands across the street, and my body scraped its way along the cobblestones until I ended up on my side. The cyclist, who was only a few years older than I am, had fallen off his bike, and he rushed over to help me up. He very kindly checked me for any injuries and even recommended the bookstore when he heard what had distracted me. I guess Dutch amicability knows no bounds.
My friends know that I am somewhat of a crazy cat lady, and Amsterdam definitely provided the feline interaction I’ve missed on my travels. I visited De Poezenboot (“The Catboat”), a floating cat sanctuary on one of Amsterdam’s canals. The lovely houseboat is home to dozens of stray cats who have learned to love living on the water. For someone like me who misses her own cats dearly, it’s positively sublime to visit a place where I can play with friendly cats for as long as I like. Later, I toured KattenKabinet, a museum specializing in artwork featuring cats. They have paintings by artists such as Rembrandt and Manet, as well as sculptures and posters by less famous artists. They even have a couple of real cats hanging around the museum for artistic inspiration!
Normally I would save my culinary experiences for a food post, but I have to rave about the food in Amsterdam. My diet consisted mostly of cheese and waffles: needless to say, I was well-satisfied. There is a cheese shop selling fresh local cheese on almost every corner in Amsterdam, and the best part is that they all offer free samples! I wandered from shop to shop, trying slices of every cheese and every fig spread offered. I literally made a meal out of free cheese samples.
The Dutch are famed for their stroopwafels, which are thin waffles cemented together by caramel syrup. They sound delicious, and I’m a little ashamed to say that I never tried one. My sweet-tooth hopelessly indulged in the perhaps less-authentic but more delectable chocolate-covered waffles.
Oh. My. God. I may never be able to eat at Waffle House again after feasting on these things. I ate one every day: chocolate-covered waffles, white chocolate-covered waffles, caramel-covered waffles. So many waffles, and so much tastebud explosion. They were usually topped with yummy things like marshmallows, butterscotch chips, or Oreos, too.
Whether you like amazing food, beautiful rural countryside, or a charming and vibrant city with flowers everywhere, Amsterdam will take your breath away. It is easily my favorite city so far. We’ll see if it can be surpassed by my next stop — Berlin!

Today is the beginning of my month-long, Amazing Amsterdam Adventure.
I will be on my own this month, and I have decided to pretend I am a tourist who managed to find a beautiful apartment in Amsterdam for a month.
The first day of my fakecation began appropriately with transportation challenges. I helped my daughter and family get to the train station, and it was a bit more challenging than anticipated to get all those bikes and the dog across town to Central station, never mind onto a train.
I left them outside and then got very lost on my way home — at one point, my GPS tried to send me into the canal. Fortunately, I made it to the apartment. Now, after a hard day of traveling, I am beginning this adventure.
I hope you join me.

I decided I’ll write a bit about the two cities I just visited during my French school break, partially because my British friend Matt (shoutout number three if he’s counting!) encouraged me to keep writing about urban planning. So here I am.
Amsterdam is very interesting with its urban planning — some might call it “the Mecca” of urban planning because of how idealized it is by many urbanists. The most popular urbanism YouTube channel is Not Just Bikes, who moved to Amsterdam because of its reputation. But what is it really like?
I would imagine the tourist experience is much different from the habitant experience, even more than other cities. This is because while the prioritization of biking is helpful for locals, it can be difficult for a newbie to get a handle on. As you walk around the city, there can be so much to look out for as a pedestrian. Watch out for the bikes! Watch out for the tram! Watch out for the cars! It’s a complex ecosystem, and if you aren’t paying attention, it can be easily overwhelming.
I did love the trams in Amsterdam’s city center. Metros can go faster underground, but the experience of a tram above ground, where you can simply hop on and look out the window at the city, is delightful. However, I noticed that the trams and metro have a tap-in and tap-out system, which I’m not a fan of. In New York, you use your ticket to get on the subway, but you can get off wherever you want and you do not have to rescan the ticket. This is much easier for riders. My friends and I were sometimes scrambling to take out our ticket again and rescan to exit the train.
I get the sense that in Venice people actually use their canals for transportation, but in Amsterdam this does not seem to be the case. There are tours on the canal, but not a lot of regular folks using the canal to navigate the city. The bikes are everywhere. I don’t know how I underestimated the number of bikes when I knew how bike-crazy Amsterdam is, but I underestimated them.
There are a few things I prefer about Paris, a place I’ve been to many times and am more familiar with. The sidewalks are wider in Paris than in Amsterdam. There are also a lot more terraces/outdoor seating in Paris, which is always welcoming and enjoyable for tourists and locals. Amsterdam’s meager outdoor seating was always just a few tables outside, whereas in Paris there can be huge terraces with many tables for people to simply plop down and order a coffee. Relaxed café culture in France is simply unbeatable. In comparison, with its smaller streets and a lack of outside seating, Amsterdam is always keeping things moving. It’s a faster pace but it’s also exciting and keeps you turning down the next corner.
There are a few key neighborhoods in Amsterdam. The 9 Streets neighborhood is very beautiful with varying architecture and canal views, but much of the ground floor establishments were expensive shops. Again, I would’ve liked an outdoor café to sit and take things in rather than feeling like I couldn’t linger. I found the Jordaan neighborhood to be more residential (I could literally look into rich people’s houses because of their big, open windows) but just as architecturally interesting. The Red Light District felt the most touristy. It’s really just one street, a couple blocks long, with sex workers in the windows and “cinemas.” We walked up and down it once, but there wasn’t much for our group to do there.
Athens has a few popular neighborhoods as well — Plaka and Psyri. I found Plaka to be touristy in some parts and desolate in others. Maybe this is just my experience. I really liked Psyri — I had multiple meals in that area and found something going on down every street. Cars in Athens are interesting — they attempt to go down any street they can fit in. I was sitting outside at a café and a car squeezed through the small street less than two feet away from me. There is a lack of signaled crosswalks in Athens. Most of the time people just cross the street whenever possible through traffic. That is less than ideal.
But I would not say Athens isn’t walkable. I walked all over the city center while I was there and only took the metro a few times to get to faraway locations. When I did take the metro, it was fairly reliable but not the cleanest. One thing I did like about the Athens metro was that they had signs showing which direction the escalators were going so that you could easily navigate where you needed to go to get out. I haven’t seen that in a metro before, but it was helpful.
Athens is the furthest south I’ve been in Europe and the sunshine was welcome after months of rainy winter in France. One thing I noticed is all of the solar panels! Many apartment buildings had multiple solar panels at the top, maybe 6 feet long by 4 feet wide. In contrast, when I took the Eurostar train to Amsterdam, I noticed that Belgium and the Netherlands had a lot of wind turbines. Northern part of Europe, more wind, it makes sense.
This was a great trip with two cities I really wanted to see this year, so I’m proud of myself and feeling very fulfilled.

Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, is renowned for its picturesque canals, historical buildings, and vibrant cultural life. With such a rich history, it is a place I have found stunning. However, its urban planning and architecture have evolved significantly over the past century, balancing preserving historical charm and embracing modern sustainability principles. This intricate dance has led to notable successes and challenges in creating thriving communities harmonizing with the city's natural geography and cultural ethos.
Amsterdam’s urban planning has always been influenced by its unique geography. The city’s layout, characterized by concentric canals known as the “Grachtengordel,” was initially designed in the 17th century during the Dutch Golden Age. This historic planning emphasized functionality and aesthetics, creating a beautiful and practical cityscape. However, as the city grew, new challenges emerged, requiring innovative solutions to accommodate a growing population while preserving the area's historical integrity.
In the 20th century, Amsterdam faced significant urban development pressures. The post-war period saw a surge in modernist architecture, focusing on efficiency and functionality. However, this often came at the expense of the city’s historical character. The construction of high-rise buildings and large-scale infrastructure projects sometimes clashed with the traditional low-rise, dense urban fabric that defined Amsterdam.
One of Amsterdam’s significant successes in urban planning has been integrating modern sustainable practices with historical preservation. The city has implemented policies prioritizing the adaptive reuse of old buildings, converting them into modern residential and commercial spaces while maintaining their historical façades. This approach not only preserves the city’s cultural heritage but also reduces the environmental impact of new construction.
Amsterdam’s Eastern Docklands is a shining example of how thoughtful urban planning can transform an industrial area into a vibrant, sustainable community. Once a bustling hub for maritime trade, the docklands fell into disuse by the mid-20th century, leaving vast expanses of derelict land. The redevelopment of this area in the late 20th and early 21st centuries showcases how innovative urban planning can successfully integrate historical elements with modern living requirements.
The Eastern Docklands project began in the 1980s to convert the obsolete industrial space into a mixed-use residential and commercial district. Unlike the high-rise developments in other parts of the world, the Eastern Docklands favored medium-rise buildings, typically between 3 to 7 stories, which complemented the traditional Amsterdam skyline. This approach ensured that new developments did not overshadow the historical city center and preserved the human-scale urban fabric characteristic of Amsterdam.
The planning process was highly inclusive, involving architects, urban planners, and the community. The result was a series of distinct neighborhoods, each with its unique architectural style yet harmoniously integrated into the overall urban landscape. The Borneo-Sporenburg area, for example, features innovative row houses with private gardens and public spaces that encourage social interaction. The Java and KNSM islands blend modern architecture with maritime heritage, creating visually striking and functionally diverse neighborhoods.
One of the critical successes of the Eastern Docklands redevelopment is its emphasis on sustainability and community-oriented design. Green roofs, solar panels, and energy-efficient building practices are standard in the new constructions, significantly reducing the area's environmental footprint. Public spaces, parks, and waterways were carefully integrated into the design, providing residents with ample recreational opportunities and enhancing the area’s aesthetic appeal.
The docklands’ design also prioritizes walkability and cycling, aligning with Amsterdam’s broader commitment to sustainable urban mobility. Extensive cycling paths and pedestrian-friendly streets encourage residents to use bicycles and walk, reducing reliance on cars and contributing to a healthier, more connected community.
Furthermore, the Eastern Docklands redevelopment incorporated a mix of housing types, including affordable housing units, to ensure a diverse population. This inclusivity fosters a vibrant community where people from different socio-economic backgrounds can live, work, and socialize.
The success of the Eastern Docklands redevelopment lies in its holistic approach to urban planning. By respecting the area’s historical context, prioritizing sustainability, and involving the community in the planning process, the project has created a thriving, dynamic district that serves as a model for urban redevelopment worldwide. The docklands have become a sought-after residential area known for its quality of life, architectural innovation, and harmonious integration of the old and new.
The lessons learned from the Eastern Docklands can be applied to other urban redevelopment projects. Emphasizing mixed-use developments, sustainable practices, and community involvement are critical strategies for transforming underutilized areas into vibrant urban spaces. As cities worldwide grapple with sustainability and urban growth issues, the Eastern Docklands is a testament to what can be achieved through thoughtful, inclusive urban planning.
Another success story is the city’s extensive cycling infrastructure, which has been integrated into urban planning to reduce car dependency and promote a healthier lifestyle. Amsterdam’s network of bike paths and cycle-friendly policies have made it one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world, significantly lowering urban pollution and enhancing the quality of life for its residents.
Brandevoort, a neighborhood in the Dutch city of Helmond, is a remarkable example of modern urban planning that successfully integrates traditional architectural styles with contemporary living standards. Designed to resemble a conventional Dutch village, Brandevoort blends the charm and aesthetics of historical townscapes with the functionality and sustainability required for modern urban living. This neighborhood has become a benchmark for new urbanism in the Netherlands, illustrating how thoughtful design can foster a sense of community and enhance the quality of life.
The development of Brandevoort began in the late 1990s with a clear vision: to create a new residential area that respects and reflects the rich architectural heritage of the Netherlands. The planners and architects drew inspiration from historical Dutch towns, incorporating features such as narrow streets, gabled roofs, and picturesque canals. This traditional aesthetic fosters a sense of familiarity and belonging among residents, attracting visitors who appreciate its quaint charm.
However, Brandevoort is not just about replicating the past; it seamlessly integrates modern sustainability practices into its design. The neighborhood includes energy-efficient buildings, green spaces, and robust infrastructure for cycling and walking, reducing reliance on cars. Using sustainable materials and renewable energy sources further underscores the commitment to creating an environmentally friendly community. These efforts not only enhance the quality of life for residents but also contribute to broader environmental goals.
One of the standout features of Brandevoort is its focus on fostering a strong sense of community. The layout of the neighborhood encourages social interaction and community engagement. Central squares, local shops, schools, and recreational facilities are strategically placed within walking distance for most residents, promoting a vibrant regional economy and a close-knit community atmosphere.
Integrating mixed-use buildings allows for a blend of residential, commercial, and recreational spaces, ensuring Brandevoort remains lively throughout the day. This mix of functions supports local businesses and provides residents convenient access to amenities, reducing the need for long commutes and encouraging local engagement.
Moreover, Brandevoort’s urban design includes a variety of housing types to accommodate different demographics, from young families to retirees. This diversity enhances the community's social fabric, making it a dynamic and inclusive place to live.
Brandevoort’s success lies in its ability to harmonize the old with the new, creating a nostalgic and forward-thinking community. The neighborhood’s design principles offer valuable lessons for urban planners and developers. Brandevoort demonstrates that modern urban developments can be functional and beautiful by prioritizing sustainability, community, and aesthetics.

Despite these successes, Amsterdam has faced challenges and failures in its urban planning journey. One of the significant issues has been the tension between development and preservation. The drive for modernization and expansion sometimes led to the demolition of historically substantial buildings, sparking public outcry and resistance. For instance, the construction of the Bijlmermeer, a high-rise housing project in the 1960s, was initially hailed as a modernist triumph but soon became a symbol of urban failure due to poor design and social isolation.
The Bijlmermeer, commonly known as Bijlmer, was conceived in the 1960s as a utopian vision of modern living in Amsterdam. Designed by architect Siegfried Nassuth, Bijlmer was planned as a high-rise residential area to embody modernist architecture and urban planning ideals. Its innovative hexagonal layout and extensive green spaces aim to provide a harmonious, efficient, and socially integrated environment. However, the reality diverged sharply from these aspirations, leading to challenges and failures that ultimately transformed Bijlmer from a symbol of modern utopia to one of urban dystopia.
The design of Bijlmer was heavily influenced by the principles of Le Corbusier and the modernist movement, which emphasized clean lines, functional living spaces, and the separation of different urban functions. The area was planned with a clear distinction between pedestrian and vehicular traffic, vast open spaces, and high-density residential blocks meant to foster a strong sense of community. The high-rise buildings were intended to provide spacious apartments with ample natural light and views of the surrounding greenery.
Despite its innovative design, Bijlmer faced significant challenges from the outset. The timing of its construction coincided with changing housing preferences in the Netherlands. By the time Bijlmer’s first residents moved in during the late 1960s and early 1970s, there was a growing preference for low-rise, single-family homes over high-rise apartments. This shift in housing demand led to difficulties in attracting residents to Bijlmer.
Moreover, the social and economic composition of Bijlmer’s population deviated from the planners’ expectations. Initially intended to attract middle-class families, the area became home to a diverse population, including many immigrants and low-income households. The high concentration of disadvantaged groups, coupled with a lack of adequate social infrastructure and employment opportunities, contributed to social isolation and economic hardship.
Initially praised for its innovation, the architectural design soon revealed several practical flaws. While theoretically ideal for community building, the vast, monotonous concrete structures often felt impersonal and alienating. The separation of pedestrian pathways from road traffic, though meant to enhance safety, resulted in labyrinthine walkways breeding grounds for crime and vandalism. The large open spaces, initially envisioned as communal areas, needed to be more utilized and better maintained, further contributing to a sense of neglect and decay.
Maintenance issues exacerbated these problems. The sheer scale of the high-rise buildings made upkeep expensive and challenging. As the area aged, the lack of proper maintenance led to deteriorating living conditions, with frequent reports of broken elevators, water leaks, and general disrepair. This decline in the physical environment mirrored the social challenges, reinforcing a negative feedback loop that further stigmatized the area.
Bijlmer’s failure can be attributed to a combination of design flaws, changing social dynamics, and inadequate planning for the socioeconomic realities of its residents. The high-rise utopia envisioned by its planners did not account for the human need for more intimate, human-scale environments. The grand, impersonal architecture failed to foster the sense of community it aimed for, leading instead to social isolation and alienation.
Extensive redevelopment efforts were undertaken in the 1990s and 2000s in response to these challenges. Many of the original high-rise buildings were demolished and replaced with low-rise housing, and significant investments were made in improving infrastructure, public spaces, and social services. These efforts aimed to address the underlying issues of social segregation and economic disparity while preserving some elements of the original vision.
The story of Bijlmer offers critical lessons for urban planners and architects. It underscores the importance of flexibility in urban design, the need to adapt to changing social preferences, and the necessity of integrating social and economic planning with architectural innovation. Bijlmer’s experience highlights that successful urban environments must balance visionary design with practical, human-centered considerations. As Amsterdam continues to evolve, the lessons from Bijlmer’s ambitious but flawed experiment serve as a cautionary tale and a guiding framework for future developments.
Social engineering in urban planning, particularly during the mid-20th century, often led to the creation of monolithic housing estates that did not cater to the social and cultural needs of the residents. These projects sometimes resulted in social segregation and failed to create cohesive communities.
Today, Amsterdam’s urban planning is guided by sustainability, inclusivity, and community engagement principles. The city moves from top-down social engineering approaches towards more participatory planning processes. This shift recognizes the importance of working with nature and local communities to optimize urban living.
Modern projects focus on enhancing green spaces, improving public transportation, and creating mixed-use developments that combine residential, commercial, and recreational spaces. For example, the Zuidas district, also known as the “Financial Mile,” is being developed as a mixed-use area with a strong emphasis on green buildings and sustainable infrastructure.
Amsterdam’s urban planning reflects a delicate balance between preserving historical character and embracing modernity. By prioritizing sustainable practices and community-oriented development, the city continues to evolve in a way that respects its rich heritage while addressing contemporary needs. This approach ensures that Amsterdam remains a vibrant, livable city that harmonizes with its natural and cultural environment.

I spent 3 days and 2 nights in Amsterdam.
I really do think anyone can enjoy travelling on a budget without it being extremely restrictive as long as you have a plan in place. In my opinion, Amsterdam is an extremely beautiful city, definitely much more expensive than some other cities in Europe eg Berlin, Prague, and Dublin but it is nonetheless worth a visit.
The iconic buildings, riverbanks and bridges make it truly picturesque. The buildings in some streets remain a protected UNESCO world heritage.
Here is basically what I did and how much I spent:
Flight: Ryan air — €38 (Dublin to Amsterdam). Quite a steal if you ask me.
Breakfast: Breakfast at the airport — €19.25
Train to the city: €5.7 (Amsterdam Schiphol Airport to Amsterdam City Centre which is around a 30 minutes journey)

Earlier this week Bloomberg published an article about a meeting of multiple cities in Amsterdam last month “to forge an alliance in response to Airbnb and Uber.” This headline misses the mark; it is both misleading and glosses over what actually happened. I should know: I was at the meeting.
The Global Sharing Cities Roundtable was conceived by the City of Amsterdam several months ago, as an opportunity for cities who are leading efforts to understand and promote the sharing economy worldwide. Participant cities ranged from Seoul, whose Sharing City initiative dates back to 2012 and includes everything from a city-owned space sharing platform to investment of public funds in more than 50 sharing economy initiatives, to Copenhagen, whose sharing economy strategy is linked to its goals for sustainability and the circular economy. Of course, Amsterdam played a leading role — as Europe’s first self-declared sharing city, home to numerous sharing economy enterprises and a fresh approach to policy reform.
Airbnb and Uber were discussed at the roundtable. But to be clear: the roundtable was not “about” them. The purpose of the roundtable was for cities to meet each other — the overwhelming majority of them had never been in contact before — and to engage in blue-sky thinking about the sharing economy’s potential.
True, Amsterdam’s innovative approach to policy reform for homesharing and short-term rentals was one topic discussed, due to popular demand by other cities. But it was only one topic. Dozens of other topics were also part of the agenda. Ridesharing and ridehailing were another popular topic, though ironically Uber itself barely came up. Rather, more time was spent on brainstorming how the sharing economy can link with waste reduction initiatives, serve to rethink delivery of public services, engage youth and elderly, and potentially help tackle a wide range of other social problems for cities worldwide. The Bloomberg article misses the mark in failing to detail — or even acknowledge — this much broader agenda.
I was honored to be invited as the only non-city employee. (For full disclosure, I have advised several of the cities in attendance.) Bloomberg reached out to interview me but did not follow through in doing so. Meanwhile, none of the people quoted in the interview were at the meeting. With all due respect, this falls short of what I would expect from one of the world’s most esteemed publications.
The sharing economy is about much, much more than Airbnb or Uber. We should know that. It is extremely frustrating to see the media focus disproportionately on what is but one piece of a much larger pie. It is increasingly easy to single out one or two companies, but by doing so, we are missing the forest for the trees — and missing a much bigger opportunity.

I have lived in the Netherlands for nearly four years now, the past two in Amsterdam. Because I moved here during the pandemic and then was sick quite a bit for the last year, I haven’t done as many of the touristy things as I might have liked.
Starting August 1st, things are about to change.
My family lives on the same block as I do, but they are going away this year for August. That means I will be on my own in my beautiful apartment.
I have decided to pretend that I am in a beautiful vacation apartment in a city I don’t know well and act like a tourist. I will visit museums and gardens, take a canal tour, and do anything that seems fun. I will probably even take some of my own advice:
medium.com
And, of course, I will regularly write about it, so stay tuned!

Beautiful Amsterdam / Built on Poles/ Who would pay if it all fell down?
–Old Dutch nursery rhyme translated
Since early times, the houses in Amsterdam have been built on wooden foundation piles[i] that are driven deep into the clay, peat, and water until they reach the first layer of solid sand. Even some of the trees in Vondelpark are supported on wooden piles to keep them from sinking into the marshy ground.
How long can a wooden pile remain in the ground before it has to be replaced?
300 years? 80 years? Until next week? The answer depends on many variables:
Quality of the sand layer
In Amsterdam, the first layer of sand lies approximately 12 meters below the surface. However, the quality of the sand layer is not consistent throughout the city. In some areas, the first sand layer is thinner than normal or missing entirely. As a result, the houses in these areas sink at an abnormal rate, and the foundations have to be replaced faster.
The top of the wooden foundation pile should be below the lowest expected water level. If part of the pile reaches above the water, it will be subject to insect attacks and decay. A problem is that the water level under Amsterdam isn’t always stable. For instance, it can drop during long periods of drought. Or a sewer pipe can develop cracks, allowing the ground water to flow into the pipe and be carried away. As a result, the water level drops.
On the other hand, if the water level rises too high, as sometimes occurs after a heavy rain, the Amsterdam cellars and crawl spaces fill up like bathtubs.
Construction projects can also interfere with the water level. An example is the incident on the Vijzelgracht in 2008 during work on the new metro station. A leak in the dam wall at a depth of 60 meters caused water and sand to stream into the pit. Part of the sand layer that was supporting the wooden foundation piles of the nearby houses washed away, causing extensive damage to the structure of the houses.
Spruce is less vulnerable to damage from bacteria than pine. Since around 1970, piles made from pine are prohibited from use. Concrete and steel piles are often used in present day construction.
The visible signs are slanted floors, cracks in the walls, doors and windows that stick, and broken front steps. The charming crooked roofline of Amsterdam is actually a symptom of unstable foundations.
If a foundation that is in poor condition is not repaired in time, the wooden piles will need to be replaced. No homeowner wants to get this news. A new foundation can easily cost 100,000 euro. Furthermore, the floor may need to be opened up, thereby making the house unlivable for some time.
In recent years, the housing corporations have been replacing the wooden piles under their properties with concrete piles.[ii] For example, Ymere is replacing the decayed pine piles in the Van der Pek neighborhood — a costly investment. However many houses that are at risk are privately owned.
The condition of the old wooden piles will only worsen in the coming years, so the question is: who will pay?
[i] Referred to as poles in the nursery rhyme.

Sangam and I visited a place called A’dam Lookout in Amsterdam. It’s a high platform where you can see an amazing view of the city. You’ll see the old part of the city, the busy port, and the special Dutch landscape with its canals, which are recognized as important by UNESCO. They also have a cool exhibition and a free audio tour that tells you about Amsterdam’s past and culture. A’dam Lookout is on the top of the A’dam Tower in Amsterdam North.
We got tickets for A’dam Lookout and hopped on the elevator. We were really excited to see the city view from the tower. As the elevator went up, the colors changed constantly, and it looked absolutely amazing.
When we reached the top of the tower, the city view was incredible. Even though it was windy and a bit chilly, we still had a great time enjoying the view.

The last time I ventured to Amsterdam was 20 years ago, so I decided that it was perhaps time to make a return visit and see what had changed. When most people think of Amsterdam they automatically and quite rightly think of Anne Frank, the beautiful canals and the tulips (& maybe even the brownies).
However, as is always the case, going slightly further afield can offer other sights and events. Having been there before, I had already visited the Anne Frank house and museum, and so I decided to spend the limited time that I had available on simply exploring areas of the city and visiting a few other select attractions.

Today is the 7th day of my August Amsterdam Adventure, and I went to the Rijksmuseum, the National Museum of the Netherlands. I had the opportunity to see the famous painting “The Night Watch,” which is undergoing restoration, a process being documented every step of the way. The Museum has published extensive information about it online.
I spent two hours looking at only a fraction of the work on exhibit and am looking forward to doing more of a deep dive this month into the art available to residents and tourists in the Netherlands. Today’s visit included works by Rembrandt, Vermeer, and Van Gogh, among many others.
I will be visiting the Van Gogh Museum later this month, as well as the Fabrique des Lumières exhibit of the Dutch Masters, and I will write a lot more about them. I will be keeping a travel log about my adventures here:

It’s my third year in the Netherlands. Or, as we Highly Skilled Migrants like to say, year 3 out of 5.
When I arrived in 2022, as full of enthusiasm about the future as the whole newly reopened post-Covid world, the border officer asked me how long I was planning on staying. ‘Maybe forever!’ I replied with a broad smile. (Coming from the UK, I was still used to the image of public officials as banterous teddy bears). Then, I marched straight into the Dutch winter.
I was proud to have intentionally chosen a new country to live in and determined to be happy. As it happens, reality proved to be more complex and less controllable, and not just because of the weather. The job was actually worse than my previous job in London. The housing market was broken beyond understanding. The friendships were effortful and shallow. The relationship I started turned long distance.
And that’s okay. That’s how you fall in love with a city, through a journey of joys and disappointments. You will survive, grow and thrive, as long as you have a guiding principle. Mine, as many other expats in Amsterdam, has always been:
At least stay until the end of the ruling. Then you can always leave.
The Dutch government calls it a “facility” or “reimbursement” as if trying to hide its own intentions. But when you fill any legal forms here, the literally translated question they ask you is “Are you enjoying the 30% ruling?”. I surely am, thank you very much. That’s the purpose of it — it’s an incentive. A tax scheme from 1964, according to which Highly Skilled Migrants don’t pay taxes on 30% of their salary, as well as wealth tax for shares, savings and properties they have abroad. The aim is to compensate them for the cost of moving countries.
Much has changed to this program since its introduction 60 years ago. Firstly, the definition of Highly Skilled Migrant has blurred, from someone with a specific expertise needed in the Netherlands, to someone that earns more than roughly €70k per year. Secondly, the duration of the tax advantage shortened from 10 to 8 to 5 years. And finally, just a year ago, the percentage of tax-exempt salary has decreased. Just like Milka has been gradually replacing cocoa with palm oil and Uniqlo has added polyester to their T-shirts, the Dutch government, too, has diluted its concentration of a promised land.
Between 2010 and 2022, the number of expats in the Netherlands nearly tripled, reaching about 70 thousand. The incentive to attract skilled labour has clearly worked. But instead of celebrating this with a champagne and liquorice candy, officials in the Hague have started to scale back the program. So… attracting expats is now a bad thing?
I think the Dutch government finally realised that it’s neither good nor bad, but it’s complicated.
Learning the local opinions from personal anecdotes and discussions, as well as Dutch media and online forums, I can confirm that the policy has more resonance than a simple reimbursement that it claims to be.
One thing I love about the Dutch is how hard it is to annoy them. It takes a group of stoned British lads disregarding the cyclist's path to cross that barrier. Even then, the worst that happens is a Dutchie elbowing the tourist so that they trip, while they could’ve run them over and still win in any Dutch court (since cyclist paths are sacred and bikes always have priority).
Bottom line is, the Dutch are easy-going people, not precious about things. That’s why very often their opinion about the 30% ruling goes along the lines of: “it doesn’t affect me, so why would I care”, “the policy is there to use it, so let expats use it”, or even: “it’s not right to envy someone when I already have a good life”. Besides, apparently expats are polite and their culture doesn’t bother others.
The neutral attitude can trend towards solidarity and even enthusiasm. Some Dutch people say that their country is too small to keep its economic importance without highly skilled migrants. Expats bring knowledge, innovation and jobs: they are the reason that multinational companies are not afraid to have an office in the Netherlands, which in turn creates jobs for the locals. Everybody benefits.
The “everybody benefits” argument is important for Dutch people, who value equality and are proud of it. That’s why to some, it seems unfair that they may earn the same as their expat colleagues, but take less pay home, based just on their origin.
Still, this group is not hostile to the expats. They’re disappointed that the government facilitates unfair pay by effectively subsidising companies. If companies want to attract talent, they should just offer higher pay to everyone, to make up for the high cost of living in Holland. Some people even argue that the ruling allows companies to suppress salaries.
Then there’s the smallest and most extreme camp. Expats overcrowd big cities, don’t learn the language, don’t contribute to the community, and don’t intend to stay. Make them pay back the cash if they leave within 5 years after their ruling ends.
Which leaves some expats confused, because… wasn’t that the plan all along?
Here I can speak in the first person: we know that we are seen as a contingent workforce. A touch of variety to the local fauna & flora, fertilising the economy as we hop from country to country in search of nectar. As long as most of us don’t stay, we’re not an invasive species.
The point of a fixed-term incentive is to get as much out of the workforce as possible in their productive years, without having to provide for them in old age.
Shortening and diluting of the ruling in the last years proves this point. Highly Skilled Migrants are still incentivised to come, they are still needed. But they are also welcome to leave.
Similarly, an argument can be made that it’s fair not to pay full taxes if you haven’t relied on the country before reaching a productive age.
A Highly Skilled Migrant contributes to the economy from day one. No public money has been invested in their healthcare and education.
Contrary to the locals, though, they need to take the cost and risk of relocating, and so it would seem fair that they are compensated for it. They don’t have a home in the new location and their pension takes a hit. This means that applying wealth tax to their foreign properties or savings wouldn’t be fair either.
Among the expats there is also a radical camp. High cost of living, high taxes, expensive health care, crap weather — you shouldn’t even be questioning why I need an incentive to be here, they say.
Like with the hostile locals, this is a small camp. The majority of Highly Skilled Migrants are just happy to receive the ruling and not make a song and dance about it. Just like the Dutch see them: expats are polite and their culture doesn’t bother others.
Some of the Highly Skilled Migrants will grow roots, if they happen to keep a good job, find a flat, meet friends and partners. Others will see how it goes, and if it doesn’t go great, after five years they will have one less reason to stay.
But during those first five years, nobody knows which is which, including the expats themselves. And so, the best plan is to stay put. Invest, but not so much to tie yourself down. Find friends, but maybe just other expats who are easy to connect with. Learn a bit of language. Keep checking out LinkedIn for jobs in other cities.
Do a little taster of how it’s like to live here, so that in five years, when you suddenly earn 1k less per month, you can make an informed decision if it’s worth staying.
In those five years, expats can be accused of making a poor effort at integrating, but the setup doesn’t encourage it, either.
Don’t get me started on the language, since I’ve mentioned it so many times. It’s not pretty or easy to pick up, has little value outside of this small country, and has to be learned in one’s spare time and out of own pocket. Sure, that’s what the tax break is for, but if it’s up to an individual to decide, realistically they will have other priorities in their budget.
The institutions who need and can afford Highly Skilled Migrants are multinational companies. Their employees will work in a group of other expats and their skill will be niche enough to only be relevant to another multinational company. As a result, it’s unrealistic for such a person to think about switching to a Dutch business.
I’ve described at length what it’s like to make friends and date as an expat. The social circle is not just your friends and partners, it’s also the community around you and even wider, the strangers you meet every day. And this wider Dutch community, just like I’ve described, is characterised by the prevalent sentiment of: “I’m not affected, so I don’t mind”. The easy-going character of the locals allows them to ignore the expats, for good and bad. Even if internally they are annoyed by the cash that expats get, they won’t make a big deal out of it, and just get on with their life.
On the plus side, this unbothered attitude promotes a peaceful coexistence. On the downside, it kills any curiosity in the Dutch about the expats and any motivation in the expats to fit with the Dutch.
I hear it in the uninterested, short smalltalk in polite English from any Dutch person I meet. It can be translated to: I get it, you’re one of the passing expats, coming here to have a good life for a few years and contribute to the economy. I’ll leave you be.
I sometimes wish they shouted back at me in their native language, as it would happen in Paris, Barcelona or even Berlin. It would mean: I want you to integrate! If you choose to live here, I need you to be a part of this community!
But no, they don’t need us to integrate, they understand we probably won’t. They assume we probably won’t. They just don’t care if we do or not.
That attitude of indifference in the Dutch, a very indirect and unplanned consequence of the 30% ruling, is the real reason for the transient character of Amsterdam.
It’s a city where everyone assumes that you may just be on a grown-up exchange program, so by absorbing the local atmosphere, you start to believe that yourself.
Eventually, when your ruling runs out, if you decide that it’s worth it to graduate from a nomad to a settler, you will likely settle outside of Amsterdam anyway. Maybe you’ll look for more space, more greenery, maybe you’ll want to hear Dutch on the streets and contribute to the community. Most likely, you’ll just be fed up with Amsterdam property prices, which have gone up a lot in the last few years, similarly to the number of Highly Skilled Migrants.
The Dutch attitude of “the 30% ruling doesn’t affect me, so I don’t have an opinion about it” ends when their house search starts. Without a doubt, they will find it very hard to buy a property, and at the same time, they will meet many foreigners who are to do it. And now they wonder: does the tax break for expats really not affect me? Or if an expat with spare cash didn’t overbid on the house I wanted, maybe it would’ve been mine?
And that’s how the expats, who are apparently polite and whose culture doesn’t bother others, have apparently caused the housing crisis in Amsterdam. But that’s a topic for next time.

Welcome! Happy to see you in the seventh part of my Vuejs Amsterdam Conference 2022 summary series, in which I share a summary of all the talks with you.
You can read my JSWorld Conference 2022 Summary series (in four parts) here, where I summarized all the first day’s talks. You can also find the previous Talks of the Vue Amsterdam conference 2022 in my blog.
After two and a half years, JSWorld and Vue Amsterdam Conference were back in Theater Amsterdam between 1 and 3 June, and I had the chance to attend this conference for the first time. I learned many things, met many wonderful people, spoke with great developers, and had a great time. On the first day the JSWorld Conference was held, and on the second and third days, the Vue Amsterdam.
The conference was full of information with great speakers, each of whom taught me something valuable. They all wanted to share their knowledge and information with other developers. So I thought it would be great if I could continue to share it and help others use it.
At first, I tried to share a few notes or slides, but I felt it was not good enough, at least not as good as what the speaker shared with me. So I decided to re-watch each speech, dive deeper into them, search, take notes and combine them with their slides and even their exact words in their speech and then share it with you so that what I share with you is at least at the same level as what I learned from them.
Everything you read during these few articles is the result of the effort and time of the speaker itself, and I have only tried to learn them so that I can turn them into these articles. Even many of the sentences written in these articles are exactly what they said or what they wrote in Slides. This means if you learn something new, it is because of their efforts.
Last but not least, I may not dig into every technical detail or live codings in some of the speeches. But if you are interested and need more information, let me know and I’ll try to write a more detailed article separately. Also, don’t forget to check out their Twitter/Linkedin.
Here you can find the program of the conference:

Sebastien Chopin — Co-Founder of Nuxt
Our mission at @nuxtlabs is to provide the best Developer Experience to deliver the best User Experience for your end users. We are doing this with Nuxt for six Years now.
Nuxt is a web framework for creating any kind of Vue app. That means you can do:
Since the beginning of Nuxt in October 2016 it has been downloaded about 46M times on npm, has 300k live websites, and 18k GitHub contributors.
This is a hello world bundle size comparison between Nuxt 2 and Nuxt 3:
One of the reasons Nuxt 3 is so much smaller is that it’s tree shakable, like Vue 3. So if you don’t use a feature, it will not be included in the bundle.
The Next equivalent bundle size is around 80kB.
In that Nuxt 3 JS bundle, 25.3kB are from Vue, and the 8.7kB left includes:
Edge Side Rendering — also named JavaScript containers by Ryan Dahl — is the capability of running JavaScript at the CDN nodes somewhere around the world close to the end user.
The advantages:
Some of the Edge computing providers right now:
Nuxt Content is a Nuxt module that reads Markdown, YAML, CSV, and JSON files in the content/ directory to create a powerful data layer for your application and Content V2 is out now with more features.
What’s coming for Nuxt 2.X:
What’s coming for Nuxt 3.0:
I hope you enjoyed this part and it can be as valuable to you as it was to me.
Over the next few days, I’ll share the rest of the talks with you. Stay tuned…

This month I am engaged in an experiment. Normally I spend a lot of time with my family, who live only a few doors away from my apartment in Amsterdam. However, they are on a month-long adventure to Great Britain, leaving me on my own. Rather than feeling sorry for myself, I am creating a month’s worth of exciting touristy plans where I am going to pretend to be a tourist in my own city.
I haven’t developed a full itinerary yet. Today, August 1st, I helped my family get to the train station, then came home and relaxed after several days of helping them pack for their own adventure, which consists of biking all over Great Britain and camping for a good portion of that time.
I am also getting started on creating a calendar. I am going to publish the first draft of it, which will consist of a few plans I’ve made in advance by necessity, such as making reservations for the Van Gogh Museum and my oncologist appointment, which was scheduled six months ago. I will add activities as they arise—some of which will be pre-planned, and some will be scheduled the way I most enjoy things: on the fly, depending upon my mood and the weather.
There are a number of things I don’t want to miss, such as going on a canal cruise or visiting some of the less…

Amsterdam is one of the most mysterious cities I have ever visited. Each time you believe you’ve witnessed everything, a mere stroll around the corner reveals that you’ve scarcely glimpsed its true essence.
Its history is marked by episodes of violence, stardom, and war. That can be seen in the buildings in the city. The old buildings bring stories from the past, while the new buildings show the path to the future.
I’ve frequented Amsterdam on several occasions, mainly for shopping. The shops in my hometown pale in diversity compared to the offerings in Amsterdam.
In 2022, I journeyed to Amsterdam with dual objectives: to experience my first boat ride and explore (as I’d heard) the largest Rituals store in Europe.
Navigating the canals was a first for me. Would it mirror the majesty portrayed in films? When the opportunity arose, I eagerly seized it!
Spoiler Alert: The experience fell short of the cinematic majesty.
Nonetheless, it proved to be a beautiful and enjoyable tour. Our guide shared historical insights, and I captured a series of photographs:

Cities and their spaces are designed experiences — we’re just not always aware we’re users. Within these spaces, we encounter countless touchpoints — physical, emotional, and social — all shaping the way we experience them.
With a background in product design and professional experience in UX, I’ve always understood user experience as something holistic, more than digital interactions. But during a recent trip to Amsterdam and Dubai, I noticed something deeper: cities themselves are designed experiences.
Walking through these two very different cities made me reflect on how much urban design and service design overlap. From the ease of getting around to the emotional tone a space creates, I started seeing each city as a living system — one with its own user flows, pain points, and design choices.
In this article, I share some of those observations from my personal experience and the UX lessons I took from them.
My trip began in Amsterdam —a city where user experience extends beyond screens, shaping how people move through their environment every day. One of the first things I noticed was how bikes aren’t treated as a leisure activity or exercise, but as the primary means of getting around. People bike everywhere, even to nightclubs.
Back home in Portugal, cycling is more of a weekend activity — something for fitness or family outings. In Amsterdam, it’s everyday life. That difference struck me, not just because it was unfamiliar, but because it revealed something deeper: how infrastructure shapes behavior, and how behavior, over time, becomes culture. The flat terrain, narrow streets, and widespread bike infrastructure all work together to make biking the most natural choice.
Design made it easy. Culture made it normal.
As I walked alongside the canals, passing locals on their bikes or stepping out of houseboats, I began to understand something about pace and emotional design. The layout of the city encourages slowness. Not in the sense of inefficiency, but in presence. The kind of design that makes you look around more, breathe slower, take things in. Amsterdam moves differently — both physically and emotionally. The environment isn’t just designed for mobility; it’s designed for human connection.
One small detail that caught my eye — and kept coming back to me — was something I might have overlooked if I hadn’t asked about it. I noticed strange hooks jutting out from the top floor facades of the narrow houses. Curious, I brought it up to the friend travelling with me, who had already been to Amsterdam and explained that these are centuries-old fixtures for moving furniture and goods through windows. The buildings are too narrow, the staircases too tight, and so people developed an outside-in system. A centuries-old solution to a simple but real problem:
“How do you get your couch into a house with stairs too small and steep to carry it up?”
It’s a quiet example of design under constraint. Faced with tight architecture (partly shaped by historic tax laws), people innovated through a humble, mechanical workaround. What struck me most is that it’s still used today. It reminded me of a moment in Urbanized, the documentary by Gary Hustwit, where it’s mentioned how the most meaningful urban innovations often come from the bottom up — citizens adapting space to fit real needs.
The second and final part of the trip was spent in Dubai. If Amsterdam felt spontaneous and human-scale, Dubai felt curated — like someone was handling it for me.
Getting around wasn’t just about driving — it was about being moved. From valet parking to full-service fuel stations where we never had to leave the car, every step of the journey felt taken care of.
Across both service and transport, I noticed a pattern: the city was designed to require less from me. Less friction. Less effort. Fewer choices to make. I could compare it to a seamless user journey where each step is thoughtfully designed, with no critical pain points.
In UX, we talk about reducing cognitive load and anticipating needs. In Dubai, it felt like that idea was everywhere. From how you moved to how you were received, the environment kept stepping in for you before you even realised what you needed.
As I settled into Dubai, it became immediately clear that the city was designed with an extraordinary level of attention to detail. In fact, it was so present that I almost didn’t realise it at first.
It wasn’t just that Dubai was clean — it was that someone was always cleaning it. From mall bathrooms to rooftop clubs, I saw staff quietly maintaining the space, constantly resetting it. And that’s when it hit me: it wasn’t just about upkeep; it was an integral part of the user experience.
Most people only notice cleanliness when it’s absent. In Dubai, it was so proactive and seamless that it became a continuous, visible signal of care. There was a sense that the space was always ready for you, that someone had already anticipated your needs. This wasn’t just about hygiene; it was about creating a sense of psychological safety, comfort, even luxury. Cleanliness here didn’t just make the space more pleasant; it made you feel valued. It told you: your experience matters. Everything was designed to make you feel supported, reducing mental load so you could simply exist in the moment without worry.
It reminded me of how digital services work in the background — updating, syncing, backing up — without you having to lift a finger. You don’t see it, but it builds a foundation of trust by keeping everything running smoothly. In Dubai, this same principle applied to the physical environment, where every detail felt carefully planned to keep things effortless.
Behind this seamless experience, of course, is a larger system of labor and structure. Dubai’s focus on high service standards relies on a workforce of trained individuals, which are migrant workers. Their work enables this constant care, and it’s important to acknowledge that the experience of ease and luxury is held up by a whole infrastructure designed to support it.
As a tourist, everything felt designed to be easy, polished, and thoughtful. Not just functionally, but emotionally. It was the kind of design that made you feel cared for, without even realising it.
On a final note, the most striking aspect of my travel experience was how I was addressed. I was consistently greeted with “madam”. It wasn’t just politeness. It was a signal — a small, repeated gesture that carried emotional weight.
You’re seen. You’re respected. You’re valued here.
And what struck me was how consistent it was. Whether I was at a humble restaurant or shopping, the tone didn’t change. The same level of care and attention showed up everywhere. That consistency created something rare: a shared emotional tone across different service levels.
In a way, this mirrored what I’d already been feeling in Dubai: that the city was designed not just to function well, but to make you feel looked after. The details weren’t loud — but they added up. And sometimes, all it takes is a single word to shape the emotional tone of an entire place.
Luxury in Dubai is easily accessible. The views are framed just right, designed to impress and soothe. You got the sense that someone had considered how you might feel at every turn.
Of course, none of this is accidental. Dubai’s focus on aesthetics and hospitality is a cornerstone of its identity. The city markets itself on these experiences. It is curated — carefully and deliberately — to feel seamless. But even knowing that, it still worked. What stayed with me wasn’t the imposing skyline or luxury touches, but the quiet signals of care: a clean space, fuel stops anticipating needs, and a respectful “madam” at every place. It reminded me that thoughtful environments — digital or physical — aren’t just designed for function. They’re designed to shape how we feel.
In Dubai, that feeling was clear: you’re being looked after. It was frictionless, anticipatory, and emotionally consistent. A good experience designed end to end.
Looking back, it’s clear how deeply our environment shapes our experience — often in ways we don’t even realise. Whether through frictionless mobility systems, services that anticipate needs, or subtle cues that build trust and emotional safety, thoughtful design operates on many levels at once.
What surprised me most was that, in a place known for innovation and cutting-edge tech, it wasn’t the digital interfaces that left the strongest impression. It was the experience of navigating the city itself — the people, the spaces, and the seamless care in every interaction.
Great user experience — whether in a product or physical space — isn’t just about usability. It’s about how we feel while interacting with it: confident, cared for, at ease.
This trip reminded me that UX and service design extend far beyond screens. Every touchpoint — human, digital, or physical — shapes the journey. And in the best cases, that journey feels seamless — not because it’s invisible, but because every detail works in harmony to support the user.
A note on context
The perspective in this article comes from my experience visiting Amsterdam and Dubai as a tourist. While my time in Amsterdam was shaped by exploring the city on my own, in Dubai I stayed with people who live there. That experience gave me a different kind of access — more immersive and seamless — which naturally shaped how I experienced and noticed the city.

When I woke up the next day I knew I was cooked. I’d wanted to go to Italy, but that wasn’t realistic anymore. My engine was puttering. Plus, I was almost out of Adderall. I only had 4 pills left, enough for one more day and a plane flight. So, by that math, I had one more night left.
Using the hostel computer, I booked a one-way ticket from Amsterdam to O’hare for the following day at 5pm (17:00). I also booked new lodging for my final night. It was an outdoor campy-type place about 20-minutes away from the city center. On their website, it looked more like a trailer park than a hostel. There were no amenities other than the communal grills, firepits, and bathrooms. It was definitely weird, but I didn’t mind weird, so I rolled the dice, hoping for a day of peace and quiet. I had a lot of notes to go through and memories to piece together, and that seemed like the perfect place to do it, away from the world, on mushrooms, in a trailer. That’s what Hunter Thompson would have done to make sense of a romp of that magnitude, and Hunter was my North Star.
After checking out of the hostel and saying goodbye to Karim, I went to take care of one last errand. What do you do when you’re completely exhausted and need a little extra pep that speed can’t give you? You buy shoes, of course. The right pair of shoes can give you super powers. Throw in a haircut, and you can defeat an army.
Before passing out at the concert, I remembered noting that Raekwon had on a snazzy pair of blue and red Nike Dunks. That’s probably what planted the seed. Plus, my brown low-top Converse were mangled and nearly unwearable. So, I set out on a mission to find the perfect pair of life-saving shoes to propel me through the rest of the trip.
After an hour of searching, I was just about to give up, when I saw them in the window of a skate shop. I immediately knew they were the ones. I stood staring at them like Wayne from Wayne’s World did with his dream guitar. They looked like beautiful chocolate covered bananas, immaculate, and completely in line with my style, other than the 130 Euro price tag. They were emergency medical shoes though, so cost be damned. (Insurance should really cover fly shoes).
I paid the guy right after lacing them up and gave him my old Converse to toss. I felt like a new man. I was ready for whatever the next 24 hours had to throw at me.
After buying some mushrooms (I still had a ton of weed left), I checked out of my hostel, called a taxi, and headed to the trailer park. Saying goodbye to Amsterdam wasn’t easy, which made the ride a little emotional for me. Throughout my hectic 6-week trip, Amsterdam had been my home base, a place where I always felt comfortable. For some reason I just fit in there. The city opened their arms for me — Willy Nelson, Karim, the bouncer at the Melkveg, Neil, even the pseudo-pimp who chose to spare my life— they all looked out for me at a time when I needed it most. I felt so grateful to all of them.
I saw hippies before I even got out of the taxi, which made me uneasy. (For someone who doesn’t like jamband music, I find myself around people who do quite often.)
“Don’t worry about the hippies,” I told myself, “ you’re motherfucking John McEnroe.”
I wanted to get into the mushrooms before the sun went down, so as soon as I familiarized myself with the trailer and the surrounding area, I got right to it. I’d purchased the same style of mushrooms I had before. I’m that way with everything. If I like something, I will continue with it until it burns me, be it restaurants, people, or socks. I always get out when the gettin ceases to be good.
I took them around 5pm and wandered around in my flip flops, waiting for them to kick in. When they did, they kicked in hard, like a mule or the DEA. I took the same amount as the last time, but for some reason I was 10 times as high. When I went back into my trailer to gather myself, the exact opposite happened. I completely freaked out. My vision wasn’t right. I had no clue what was going on. I grabbed a pen and wrote, “EVERYTHING IS RED”. There was a mirror in the trailer, and I made the mistake of staring into it. DO NOT make that mistake during a bad trip. During a good trip, maybe, but never during a bad one.
The mirror was firey red and my face was peeling off. Blood was dripping from my chin, it was a horrifying scene. There was also this awful sound, like the kind you hear when someone presses the red emergency button at a nuclear power plant. My brain was in crisis.
I splashed water on my face in an attempt to tamp down the flames, but it didn’t work, so I started removing my clothes. They had bad juju all over them, and they needed to go.
As I was taking my pants off I looked down. That’s when it hit me.
“I’m not wearing my shoes! What the fuck was I thinking!?”
As soon as I put them on, my vision went back to normal, and the blaring alarm in my head stopped. To make sure I wasn’t losing my mind (I was absolutely losing my mind), I took them off again. Everything turned red. I put them on once more. No red.
Then, I heard a knock at the door.
“OH SHIT,” I whispered, tossing on a new shirt.
If you’ve ever taken hallucinogens, you know a knock at the door is the last thing you want to hear. The sound itself is paralyzing. Anything can be behind that door, and I mean ANYTHING. There are no limitations to what the brain can conjure.
Then, there was a second knock.
They weren’t going to give up, I could feel it in my bones. I had to open the door and face my fears. Most trips, in some way or another, are about facing your fears.
I walked over to the door and placed my hand on it to see if I could feel any weird vibrations. Nothing.
Then I grabbed the knob and turned it slowly, hoping the person had already left. When I opened the door I was greeted by a smiling, shirtless hippie with dreadlocks.
“Hey, sorry if I scared you, man. I’m Liam. I wanted to invite you to join the group. We’ve got a fire going and we’re just jamming out. It’s pretty chill.”
While I tried to comprehend the words he was saying, he began staring down at my feet intently.
“Those shoes. They’re amazing,” He said, slowly.
“Trust me, I know. I’m really high on mushrooms and they just saved my life,” I told him, just as slowly.
“Ha, sounds intense. I’m on mushrooms too. We all are.”
Before I could tell him I didn’t do well in groups, Liam walked me over and started introducing me.
“This is Sam. He’s really high. Be nice to him.”
“Sweet shoes,” one of them said. “They look like chocolate covered bananas.”
“They do, don’t they?” I said, enjoying my inside joke.
We hung out for a few hours. They played their guitars while I just stared into the fire. We didn’t talk much, but it was nice. No one felt the need to fill the air with bullshit. We just utilized the good vibrations to enjoy our own thoughts. The red was a long lost memory, and the fire didn’t scare me one bit.
When the drugs started wearing off I thanked the guys for their company and made the walk back to my trailer to call it a night. To be safe, I kept my shoes on inside. I wasn’t going to make the same mistake twice. Lying in bed, I grabbed my notebook and a pen.
A+ in group setting
Was Johnny Mac a hippie?
AM I A HIPPIE?!
I stayed in bed until noon the next day, relaxing in silence and smoking joint after joint. I felt terrible about wasting weed and I still had a quarter ounce left that I didn’t want to just leave in my trailer. If I’d seen anyone on the property other than the manager I would have given it to them, but I didn’t. When the cab driver picked me up, I could tell he wasn’t an option either, so I just stuffed the remainder into my pants pocket, assuming I’d be able to give it away at the airport.
After the cab dropped me off, I stood right in front of the exit, next to the “No Weed Past This Line” sign, and held the baggie in my open hands. “Free weed, get your free weed. Take as much as you want. Free weed here,” I yelled like a peanut vendor. People just walked right past me though, one after the other. I was in disbelief. No one wanted free weed. Every 20-something that I stopped declined. Some said they had their own, while others declined based on strain preference.
“These snobby bastards,” I thought.
I stayed as long as I could, smoking cigs, and advertising my goods. After an hour of embarrassment I gave up and threw it in the garbage (just like the stand-up comedy fliers I used to pass out in exchange for stage time). I was pissed off for the first time since I’d been in Amsterdam. It wasn’t the weed thing, I was just irritable. I didn’t want to go home. Home was where the problems were, where that awful basement was and all those terrible memories. I had no place else to go though. It was my mom’s or nothing, at least for a little while.
And just like that, my trip was over. I felt trapped again.
The flight home was anxiety filled. Instead of reading or writing I just sat there and stewed. I’d quit comedy, graduated college, left to find myself, and returned to the same exact spot, completely clueless about what to do next. The only thing I knew was that stopping to mourn and take care of myself was not an option. I had to keep running, no matter the cost.

After visiting the many great talks of the Voxxed Days I started my journey home to resume my responsibilities as a parent. While leaving the conference location I saw people already entering the Pathé building for the movies that evening. While part of the community was still sharing their thoughts upstairs at the venue I looked back at a great conference. The nine or so hours I stayed flew by and this was all made possible by Codelab, sponsors and volunteers, so thank you for your efforts.
I saw many familiar faces that also decided to do something else than work, meetings or chores that day. The sun was definitely shining outside the sky was blue and people were happy. IT people almost naturally retreated to the dark movie theatre rooms.
The conference started for me with Sander Hoogendoorn talking about AI and what it can bring developers and companies. A massive boost in capabilities, creating bigger things with the same team. In my opinion the use of AI will probably increase the amount of tech debt and developers will be still needed to actually fix problems and write better code. Sander also mentioned that AI must be seen as a tool for developers it would be good to embrace it or you will miss opportunities.
After that Sander Mak told a story about taking risk and not being afraid to fail. Failure is part of learning, true words. At the company Picnic they introduced Calcite for querying over databases, this lead to many changes and some very challenging ones. This change allowed the more technical business users to get data with their own queries without going directly to the separate databases. Calcite provides federated querying and makes queries database independent. I left the room with a positive vibe both keynotes were great.
Many more great talks followed and many of them I was not able to visit. I very much struggled with the fear of missing out. One of the talks I really liked was about Redis 8. Raphael De Lio showed in rapid pace, and with a live demo, some of the new features which include fast vector search. Something that makes Redis very useful for AI applications.
One of the overlying themes of the conference I observed was loose coupling, on every level of a software platform. In the code as the hexagonal architecture and the use of Spring Cloud Functions. The latter is ideal for separating business logic from cloud specific logic Elena van Engelen-Maslova told us. For logging, tracing and metrics the use of Open Telemetry and on the infrastructure side the use of tools like Rancher. Also for testing the need for better integration testing between external interfaces has become possible with the use of a tool like Testcontainers which was mentioned in the talk of Adam Michalik.
It’s nice to get advice which I can apply directly the next day and that was given by Paco van Beckhoven about merge requests (roll eyes, yes Gitlab). A template for a merge request with checklists is useful according to him. Also it always good to provide the reasons for the changes in the merge requests. I think carefully reviewing MR’s will become even more important if more of the code is not written by a person
It was getting late and the final talk would soon start. I did not know what to expect. After 5 minutes it became clear it was like a nightmare story for engineers. Adele Carpenter provided a story about airplane systems and how we as software people can learn from the reasons for planes crashing. Often it was mixture of systems having no useful alerting and redundant systems making it more complex to understand what is going on for the pilot. This hits home because badly communicated redundancy was the reason for a recent production failure of a system I am working on.
While walking back to the metro station I was divided, on one hand I felt comforted because I had seen people doing their utmost to improve and create software, platforms and processes and on the other hand the need was shown for even more secure, green, reliable and well architected software. The world as we know has become more unpredictable and with IT becoming more critical it feels like we need to be better prepared for the unexpected.

I used to think flowers were a sign of weakness, a delicate fragility that I couldn’t afford to indulge in. Femininity seemed like a luxury, something I couldn’t permit myself to embrace. I hid my love for it, buried deep where no one could ever find it.
But she did.
I was walking down the street when I saw a bunch of blooming flowers, I photographed it then a smile formed on my face, feeling giddy with all the colourful blossoms in front of me.
She had a way of unravelling me, peeling back the layers I had so carefully constructed. She learned my language, deciphered the unspoken truths I kept locked away. She discovered my secret affection for spring, their vibrant petals whispering of beauty and life.
Someday,
she would say, her eyes twinkling with dreams,
we’ll go to Amsterdam together and walk through fields of tulips.
I never believed her. Not really. Our lives were a constant dance of reality and dreams, with reality often winning. But she was different; she believed in the power of dreams.
The rain drizzled gently against the cobblestone streets, each droplet a whisper of sorrow from the grey sky above. A lone figure stood by the edge, cloaked in a heavy coat that did little to shield against the biting chill of late autumn.
We never made it to Amsterdam together. Life intervened, pulling us apart in ways we couldn’t mend. Two years passed since the last time she learned my language, each day stretching the distance between us. I thought time would dull the ache, but some wounds only deepened.
Then, I received the call. The words were cold and final:
She’s gone.
She had gone to Amsterdam alone. She had gone to find solace among the field of tulips, but now, she lay beneath them, the place of our unfulfilled dreams.
I booked a flight without thinking. The journey felt like a cruel joke, a pilgrimage to the land of what-ifs.
As the plane descended, I remembered her voice, her promise of tulips, and my heart shattered once again.
I made my way to her grave, a simple plot marked with her name. Tulips surrounded it, their colours mocking my pain. They were the flowers I had secretly loved, the ones she had promised to show me. And there she is, in the middle of it all.
I let the tears fall, unchecked and raw. The tulips swayed gently in the breeze, their petals brushing against my skin. They felt like her touch, a reminder of what I had lost. She had been my only refuge, now, she was gone, and all I had left were these cursed flowers.
Standing up, I whispered to the wind,
Meet me in Amsterdam.
but there was no one left to hear. The tulips nodded as if in understanding, their vibrant colours a silent testament to a love that could never be.
From now on, I would walk through life crying for flowers, for the tulips, for a dream that died too soon, I buried my heart among the petals and turned away, forever changed.

Two weeks ago I decided Amsterdam would be my place to settle, hoping finally this would be the place for me and even though I had been warned by my peers and colleagues, I did all my homework, studied the market and told myself that it couldn’t be as hard as finding an apartment in China, where everybody just spoke Mandarin to do so.
I was extremely wrong, the market here is insane, maybe because we are in a post-covid season and the city is blooming with tourism, perhaps is the interest younger people have towards trying the so-called “legal drugs”, it might be due to the high season rental as schools and Universities are starting again or simply just a slip from the Dutch government when considering housing options for everybody.
The reality is that thousands of people are competing on a daily basis to find an apartment, a room or at least a long-term stay without paying a kidney and a half for it.
I got an Airbnb type of apartment via Expedia, it was a great deal for one week, only paying 917€ after my Genius 30%…

I’ve been more time as an adult in Amsterdam, than in my home country. In Amsterdam, there are many options for everything. But be careful. It’s so very easy to get lost in Amsterdam. For me Amsterdam is stressful.
Study
In Amsterdam, you will find all sorts of studying careers, and people are very free on choosing. Many Dutch people drop out in the first or second program because “they don’t like it”. And is very normal to try different things. Education is many times in English. However I would say that education can be very stressful because it’s a bit chaotic and challenging at the same time. You have to do everything by yourself, and teachers are more mentors than teachers. It’s like you never can really relax, and you have to think a LOT in every subject, because education here priorities thinking by yourself, they absolutely infinitely 100% hate things “by the book” (typical Dutch). Of course, you meet people from everywhere. Your colleagues are from everywhere. It can be stressful, especially if you come from cultures where “everything is organized”, where you know what you really gonna learn, where grades matter a lot, where everything has a specific linear way of being. In Amsterdam simply things are free.
Informality
Here no one likes any form of formality. Everything must be informal by default. No one absolutely no one cares about formal clothing, and genuinely everyone will hate that. It’s not…

Amsterdam moves. People walk briskly, bikes fly past, trams glide along their rails. Everyone seems to have a place to be, a purpose to fulfill. And yet, despite the chaos — bikes weaving through pedestrians, cars stopping and starting, boats slipping quietly through the canals — there’s a strange kind of order. No honking, no shouting, no visible frustration. Just movement. It feels like watching a symphony with no conductor, a city that somehow just knows how to keep itself in rhythm.
I sit by a restaurant window and watch it all unfold. The rain-speckled glass blurs the edges of passing figures, turning them into something out of a painting. I catch glimpses of them — sharp jawlines, loose scarves, hands tucked into the pockets of long coats. I find myself romanticizing over every woman that walks by, assigning them stories they’ll never know they’ve been given. She’s on her way to meet a friend. She’s heading home after a long day at work. She’s just as lost in thought as I am.
And then there are the couples. The ones who share a cigarette outside a café, the ones who lean into each other on their bikes, the ones who don’t need words to fill the space between them. I am content here, alone, but I can’t help but envy them. Amsterdam is beautiful on its own, but I imagine it would be even better when shared.
The Dutch language wasn’t a necessity — I could’ve gotten by just fine without it — but I’m glad I learned it anyway. Even simple exchanges feel like small victories, a way of stepping further into this place instead of just passing through it. And the food? The beer? It all just sits better. There’s a freshness to it, a simplicity. I don’t leave meals feeling sluggish, just satisfied.
Maybe that’s the feeling I’ll take home with me — not just the admiration, not just the longing, but the quiet contentment of being here. The realization that I don’t have to understand how everything works to appreciate that it does.

By Johannes Novy
When COVID hit the Netherlands in 2020, Amsterdam emptied of visitors overnight. Long-term residents, inured to the permanent noise and litter and tourists peeing in the streets, welcomed the newfound tranquillity. The pandemic, they told the Washington Post, was “a blessing in disguise”.
COVID has offered a rare, if not unique chance to address tourism’s enduring problems. From how people reach destinations to how tourism is managed within the cities it floods, not to mention the way its benefits and costs are distributed to local communities, the burden of overtourism has long been a concern.
Amsterdammers aren’t the only city dwellers to perceive the current pause as a much needed relief. From Kyoto to Venice, residents see a return to pre-pandemic tourist numbers as a threat, not a promise.
For years, we’ve been told that tourism needs to be sustainable, without much consensus on what sustainable tourism looks like. COVID, meanwhile, has seen the term “resilience” become a go-to for industry insiders and policymakers. But what exactly is resilient tourism? And can it make our cities any more socially and environmentally responsible? Can it make them any better to live in?
Broadly conceived as the ability to manage adversity, resilience is touted as an essential quality for coping with uncertainty and change, stress and shock. As trends go, resilience isn’t new. It was Time Magazine’s environmental buzzword of the year in 2013. It has since become one of the dominant tropes in contemporary debate on everything from island studies and child psychology to urban disaster risk reduction.
The pandemic has of course brought global tourism to a virtual standstill. In 2020, 1 billion fewer international trips were made to tourist destinations than in 2019. Up to 120 million jobs were threatened. So thinking about how this industry, which previously supported one in ten jobs worldwide, might cope with the stress and shock of COVID is no bad thing.
However, critical geographers and political sociologists alike have warned that the concept of resilience is in danger of becoming as empty a notion as sustainability. It has its roots in ecological and engineering thinking, wherein it refers to the ability to return to normal － to a state of equilibrium — after a period of adversity. Critics argue though that, in the social world, we deal not with equilibrium structures, but constant flux.
In a city, there is no normal state to return to. And those affected by natural hazards — a coastal mega-city prone to flooding, say — were vulnerable to begin with. Returning to an original state is therefore as undesirable as it is impossible. Instead, cities adapt.
More broadly, resilience thinking is deemed inherently conservative. With the emphasis it places on bouncing back, it is underscores reactive and short-term solutions. These distract from the need to address the root causes of major challenges such as climate change.
It is also not as harmless a theory as it may seem. When politicians insist that investing in a more resilient city is plain common sense, they often downplay issues of power and inequality. New Orleans is a case in point. Rebuilding after hurricane Katrina in 2005 came at enormous social cost, when the city privileged economic gain over the needs of marginalised communities.
Resilience is nonetheless an elastic concept, and it is increasingly associated not only with the ability to bounce back after a setback, but also to bounce forward — to a new and better state. The UK government’s slogan “ Build Back Better”, has become the mantra for a myriad post-COVID ambitions, particularly with regard to tourism.
That said, as travel restrictions are lifted and the cruise ships return to Venice’s St Mark’s Square, mere weeks after the Italian government promised they wouldn’t, it looks like this golden opportunity to rethink tourism has been lost.
Governments generally seem more interested in a return to business as usual than in thinking about how much tourism we can actually afford. Calls to come up with a fairer, less exploitative model have, at best, been met with a muted political response. Governments appear loath to discourage business trips, despite climate scientists advocating for less air travel, because they bring in money.
Any attempt to make tourism truly resilient, however, has to go further than short-term economic recovery. It has to address the tourism sector’s carbon footprint and its injustices and ethical quandaries.
In this respect, Amsterdam presents an interesting model. COVID has accelerated the implementation of several measures under consideration well before the pandemic took hold. The city has adopted ordinances that variously prevent souvenir shops from displacing local businesses, developers from turning residential spaces into holiday lets, and new hotels from being built.
Elsewhere, it has hiked up the tax tourists pay for overnight stays and introduced measures to reduce the so-called incivilities (littering, public urination) they unthinkingly leave behind.
More broadly, it has become the first city ever to embrace British economist Kate Raworth’s doughnut economics model for sustainable development. This theory centres on the environment and the basic needs of its citizens as opposed to economic growth. The council has pledged to use it as a guideline for all future policies that govern urban life — from emissions regulations to fixing the city’s housing crisis.
It is still too early to say whether these efforts will pay off. Without a similarly bold rethink, though, more residents will likely rebel against the touristification of their communities. If, on the other hand, more cities follow the Dutch capital’s example (as Copenhagen, Brussels, Dunedin in New Zealand and Nanaimo in Canada are reportedly doing), the idea of a real bounce forward might indeed apply.

Within minutes of having waved each other goodbye we received a call from the friend. He seemed worried, having received some information about the train schedules, and wanted to make sure we had not been affected.
It happened to be the final episode of what had been a forgettable trip to what is otherwise among the most preferred travel destinations for my partner and I.
There are lots of things about the Netherlands that we simply adore, and it is precisely these aspects that make us head to that country over and over again.
The Netherlands is by far the country that we have visited the most, so much so that every time we head there, we have to look for places that we are yet to visit. It is also a fact that, while we have been to a lot of places in the Netherlands, there are still quite a few that we are yet to visit.
Having said that, there is also a flip side to everything, and this narrative is about a trip to the Netherlands when nothing seemed to work for us.
Amsterdam is the largest city in the Netherlands, and definitely the most beautiful. During my early visits to this country, it was palpably the first…

By the time we visited Amsterdam, we read enough blog posts and talked to other travelers who raved about Amsterdam and figured we just had to go there. It just didn’t do it for me.
As a person who enjoys the beauty of architecture, it wasn’t as stunning in comparison to the other places I’ve just traveled through in Europe, Brussels and Barcelona. Amsterdam is a place of things to do over a place of things to see. If you really want to enjoy Amsterdam then you should focus on the houses, and museums, as there are few stunning points of interest in the city.
Amsterdam felt like a trip to Brooklyn, N.Y. on steroids, which made sense after I learned Brooklyn and Harlem were designed by the Dutch and New York used to be New Amsterdam.
Being that Amsterdam is a place of things to do, I focused on food, museums and the major attractions.
The major visually pleasing attractions:
Must try foods / snacks:
Must Do Activities:
Note: Only a select few ‘coffeeshops’ sell alcohol at theses establishments
I think 2–3 days in Amsterdam is more than enough to be able to enjoy what it has to offer. I’d schedule the visit for a weekend so you can enjoy the party scene in Amsterdam as well. I can’t say I’ll be back to visit any time soon, but I will say this is a place I could easily live in because there’s plenty to do.
Pro Tips:
Almost everyone in Amsterdam speaks English
The Dutch are very rude, but just be aware of it and accept it , New Yorkers are rude as well
Bicycles have the right of way, get out of the way or they WILL hit you
Look left and right before crossing and beware that you’re not accidentally in the bike lane

My journey to Amsterdam started in Paris, and to be honest, I was desperate for Amsterdam because I compare it to other places all the time:
Sin City vs. the City of Love. But, this is just a preamble.
On the first evening, I met with some speakers from the conference, and we did an excellent night tour. The next day, I went to the fantastic Van Gogh Museum, which encouraged me, with a cultural elixir, to continue my art.
Preparations for the conference were underway at full speed, and organizers were working like bees and doing their best to bring all React lovers around the world to one place. That place was Amsterdam.
After some preparations and checking the area where I would talk, I went to the boat speaker dinner, which was a lot of fun. I met React rock stars, and we officially put the React Amsterdam flag up.
Surfing between bikes and boats,I arrived at the meeting in the early morning full of energy after a fantastic breakfast in the middle of the city.
That was a well-organized event, and I met a lot of curious people who were seeking new knowledge and frontend energy.
It causes me to remember my first conference in Moscow. The community has grown so much since the first React release. Now, React is not a geeky thing; it is the enterprise standard. Now, React is not a question anymore.
The React native session surprised me a lot; I did not expect some prototypical framework that I saw two years ago to become a big thing.
Also, I had recorded a marvelous frontend podcast during the conference to share my knowledge with the Russian speaking frontend community.
My talk was the last one. It took a lot of coffee to be ready to spread my energy and show cool stuff.
Many people said the music was bombastic and that they want me to continue playing on the stage. ;) I’ve decided next time I will do a Full Music of React session. :) Why not?
I want to thank the organizers for this opportunity to speak at the most prominent React conference in the world. See you all at something big next year.

“Your body is not a temple, it’s an amusement park. Enjoy the ride.”
-Bourdain
The ferry dropped us off at the Amsterdam Centraal train station at 2pm, amid the most perfect spring day. It looked like a real-life Truman Show, the way everyone was smiling and laughing without a care. Even the pigeons looked happy, chilling by the canal, generously sharing food.
It made me wonder…
Are people happy because they’re in Amsterdam, or do happy people just gravitate there, making it so? Hard to tell. Sounds like a chicken/egg situation. Speaking of which, I’ve always wondered if people weigh more because of their genes or because their caloric intake is higher, and they work out less. Like, if you took two people who eat and workout the same amount but one’s family has been fat for generations (like mine) and the other skinny, would they end up weighing the same exact amount? I ask because I’ve always felt predisposed to fatness due to my dad’s genes.
Before looking for a hostel, I wanted to get high, so I went in the first “coffee shop” I saw. Now would be a good time to describe the difference between coffee shops in America and coffee shops in Amsterdam. They look the same, except in Amsterdam, some sell weed. Pretty simple.
I ordered a pre-roll and a latte. If cocaine and heroin together is a speed ball, weed and coffee together is more like a curveball. Part of me felt demure, sitting there smoking a joint by myself in a café. The other part though, was high as fuck, and VERY paranoid. The American penal system was so ingrained in me that my Pavlovian response to being high was an intense fear of the police. No matter how much I reassured myself that I wasn’t breaking the law, I couldn’t shake the fear of being arrested. You don’t realize you’re paranoid amidst the paranoia. If you did, you wouldn’t be paranoid.
*
On my walk to find a hostel I couldn’t stop laughing at the ridiculousness of the street names. I wrote some of my favorites down. I also made up some of my own. See if you can guess which are which. I can’t even remember myself.
- Brouwersgracht
- Hosenlendinvein
- Princeneiland
- Amsterveenseweg
- Grunarpeilveg
- Einelpenilhar
- Brouwersgracht
The hostel I chose was a far cry from The Flying Pig, the “it” place I’d read about in my research. The Flying Pig was the most popular hostel for people under 30 (still is) because it has a weed smoking section in the common area where they have pipes and bongs to rent. There was a communal element, one I was not looking for. I don’t like being part of groups and try to avoid it whenever possible. I want to do what I want to do, not what “us” wants to do. “Us” is always some lame compromise. Instead, I went with an off-brand hostel, one that catered to an older, more laid-back crowd. When I booked it online from London, the picture made it look like a nondescript Holiday Inn Express. It was a little off the beaten path, but not too far from the action. It seemed clean, calm, and quiet, exactly what I wanted.
When I checked in, it did seem both clean and calm. But, to my surprise, I heard jackhammering. When I inquired, the manager told me there would be construction every day from 9am-5pm. I thanked him and went up to my room.
That’s how I am, I thank people who inconvenience me. I’ve always been way too accommodating, even to my own detriment. I try to save the world one favor at a time. I could have very easily found another hostel that didn’t have Jackhammering, but that, somehow, in my mind, would have been considered breaking a commitment. The hostel was probably struggling because of the jackhammering, and I wanted to help. I know, that’s crazy.
When I got up to my room, there was, in fact, a man jackhammering five feet from my window. It sounded like the gunfight from Heat. So, I turned right around and got out of there.
On my way down I saw the Manager again.
Manager: Sir, how is your room?
Me: Perfect. Thank you.
I still had an hour to kill before the jackhammering stopped, so I set out to buy weed, enough to last at least a week. After 5 minutes of walking, I stumbled upon a place called Coffee Shop Bob Marley. From the outside, it looked exactly like you’d think it would, Jamaican flag, pictures of Bob, Wailers albums. It was corny, but it would do. Afterall, they had weed for sale.
When I entered, I was greeted by an old budtender who looked exactly like Willie Nelson, all the way down to the bandana. From his voice, I could tell he was an American ex-pat. He handed me a Trapper Keeper-style three ring binder. In it were plastic pages with little slots for what traditionally would have been baseball cards. Instead of cards though, each quadrant contained a nugget of weed, along with a description (e.g. purple haze: mellow, euphoric). It was the first time I’d seen such a professional setup, and it blew me away. I’d smoked weed daily for 5 years but had never dreamt of such a variety. I’d hit the motherload.
After much consideration, I selected 4 indica strains and paid Willie 60 Euros for the 14-gram purchase, an amazing deal anywhere in the world at that time.
Me: May I light up in here?
Willy: Of course. The smoking room is in back.
The smoking room was just a small, curtained off area with a few high-top tables. A Bob Marley music video played on the television hanging on the wall. I put my bag down and removed a grape White Owl cigar that I’d bought before leaving London. At the time I was still smoking blunts and I wanted to “represent” my “culture” while in Europe. Ha. What I didn’t consider, was that I’d barely smoked the previous two weeks in New York. And, though I smoked a few hash spliffs the night before in London, my tolerance was still lower than usual. Regardless, I went ahead and rolled a 2.5-gram monster of Afghan Kush.
There were two other people in the room with me, a couple, who both appeared to be in their 30’s. I couldn’t hear their voices, but I assumed they weren’t from America. I did that with everyone who wasn’t traveling in a group. There’s just something about Americans, we love traveling in guided groups. Very rarely did I see a duo of American travelers, let alone a solo one. When I dumped the guts of the blunt into a garbage bin near the wall, they stared in my direction. They didn’t say anything, but I could tell they were interested in what I was constructing. I was proud of my blunt rolling skills and wanted to put on a show for them, so they could see how we did it in the states. I considered myself an ambassador.
After licking the blunt closed, I sparked my lighter, running the flame along the paper to dry it out. Then, I lit it, taking a deep drag and coughing slightly. The couple, again, glanced my way. I looked back at them, smiling like a cool dude.
About halfway through the blunt, I realized I’d made a huge mistake. I wasn’t cool at all. In fact, I was sweating bullets and overcome with dizziness. I could tell the couple wanted to check on me, they just weren’t sure if it was their place to do so. I mean, I must’ve known what I was doing, right? You don’t just roll a blunt like that if it’s your first time smoking weed.
My equilibrium was totally askew. I gripped the small, circular table like we were Greco Roman wrestling. I had to say something before it was too late.
Me: My name is Sam. I’m from America. If I die, my mom’s name is Audrey —
Then I passed out and fell off my chair.
When I came to, Bob Marley’s I Shot the Sheriff was playing on the tv. The couple was hovering over me, disturbed, their highs obviously ruined. Willie was concerned too, standing over me with a bottle of water. I didn’t even know how long I’d been out.
Willy: We were scared, man. Glad you’re ok. We don’t even allow cigars in here.
Lady: That was so scary. Why would you try smoking that whole blunt?
Me: You know what blunts are?
Guy: Of course. We’re from America too.
*
On my way back to the hostel, I passed what looked to be the strangest food establishment I’d ever seen. It reminded me of a Gray’s Papaya, a New York hot dog chain I loved, in that there was no seating inside. In fact, there was nothing at all inside. It was just an empty room, like an American check cashing place. Yet, it smelled like fast food. It was too weird to not investigate.
When I went in, I thought I was tripping out. I was still extremely high and woozy from the fall, but I was pretty sure I was standing inside a life-sized vending machine. The walls were lined with rows and rows of slots where hot food was kept. There must have been a kitchen in the back where everything was prepared, but I didn’t see one, nor could I hear one. The only sign of human life was the hand of an employee replenishing the stock after a sale. I didn’t love the impersonality of it all, but I had to admit it was ingenious.
My dad would have loved to have access to a place like that, where he could anonymously buy food without the judgement of a cashier. It’s just you and the food, no interaction whatsoever, perfect for an addict.
I was enjoying my burger on a nearby bench, when off in the distance I saw the glow of the Red-Light-District. Until that point, I’d thought the name “Red-Light-District” just referred to the illicit activities that went on there, I didn’t know it was a literal description of the place. It looked like a devilish carnival, the dope dealers being the carnies, and the ladies, the rides. Young adults, mostly backpackers, lined the outskirts, trying to get up the nerve to make the plunge. “How pathetic,” I thought to myself. “I can’t believe I’d wanted to do this.”
*
March 26, 2006
After a wonderful night of stoned sleep, I woke up to my alarm at 8:45am, which left me the perfect amount of time to shower, eat, do laundry, and get to the Smart Shop right when it opened. They call places that sell mushrooms “smart shops” the way they call weed stores “coffee shops”. I’ve always found that to be telling. Those are delicate, non-fear inducing terms. We don’t have “safety stores” in America, we have “Gun and Ammo” shops. Rather crude, if you ask me.
I’d done mushrooms a handful of times before, with experiences ranging from spiritual bliss to utter madness, but I’d always learned something about myself in the process, and that was the most important part. Wait, that’s not totally true. Sometimes, I just spend 4 hours in the bathroom trying to wipe pee that isn’t there off my pants. A psychologist would have a field day with that one.
When I entered the Smartshop, I was greeted by the kind of guy you’d think would be running a psychedelic mushroom store, long hair, flannel shirt, monk vibes.
Clerk: How may I help you?
Me: Can you please advise me on which mushrooms I should take, and the quantity?
Clerk: Of course. That is exactly what I am here for. Have you done psilocybin before?
Me: Yes, maybe 20 times.
Clerk: Ok, let me walk you through what we have.
He took me over to a glass case with about 15 varieties of mushrooms, some wet, some dry, all of them unique in shape and color. He walked me through their different levels of potency and their array of effects.
Me: How about something in the medium-strength level?
Clerk: Sure. Would you like to see visuals?
Me: Yes, please.
Clerk: I suggest 1 to 2 grams of the High Hawaiian variety, dried.
Me: Will they make me laugh?
Clerk: Ooohhh yeah.
I paid him 25 Euros and exited the Smartshop with my mushrooms. Then, I walked over to the canal. There was a light mist, so I found an unoccupied bench and dried a small spot for myself. I took the mushrooms out of my bag, along with a banana I’d saved from breakfast and a bottle of water. Then I said my usual pre-hallucinogen prayer. “Lord, please look after me during this trip. And please, please don’t let me think I peed my pants.”
Once I had the mushrooms down and the nausea passed, I sat back and read my book until the words no longer looked like words, maybe 30 minutes. That’s when the laughing started. EVERYTHING was funny. I spent 10 minutes laughing at my shoes because they looked like chili dogs. Then it was the word “wanker.” I couldn’t stop saying it. “Oy ye wanker”, “Aye wanker, quit ya wanking”, “Bloody, scheming wanker.”
Down the canal a few hundred yards away, I saw a tourist boat slowly approaching. There were about 20 or so passengers, all of them Asian. They looked so happy, with their big visors and smiling faces. I was overcome with the urge to connect with them. I stood up and waved my arms, yelling to them as they passed.
“Helllloooooo!!! Welcome to Amsterdam!!!”
They waved back jubilantly, while I cry-laughed in the rain like a maniac, yelling in their direction as they passed by my bench.
“Enjoy your staaayyyy!!”
I greeted 8 boats-worth of people over a 2-hour period. For nearly my entire trip, I worked as a volunteer civil servant for a city I’d just arrived in. You never know where hallucinogens will take you.
I walked back to the hostel soaked; my feet pruned from the rain. What I needed more than anything was a peaceful place to come down and dry off. When I got to my room, I was delighted to find none of my roommates there, a rare occurrence in a 4-person room. I toweled off and hung my clothes on the edge of the bunk before getting into my bed to reflect and relax. I couldn’t have felt calmer, laying there. My heart was pure, and my thoughts, loving.
Then the jackhammering started up. I’d completely forgotten about it. And this time, because of the mushrooms, it sounded even louder and more menacing than before. My trip was turning dark, and I had to make a move. Either go down and watch the BBC in the lobby, which would inevitably end up in conversation, or spend the next hour showering.
I went with the shower.
*
March 27, 2006
I came to the next morning, feeling exfoliated, if nothing else. My clothes were dry, finally, so I set out to find an outdoor market where I could buy an extra pair of cheap pants in case I found myself in a similar situation again. In America, we call them swap meets. They’re the same thing, just with a bad name.
When I was on my way out, I saw the manager.
Manager: Sir, how has your stay been?
Me: Perfect. Thank you. Is there an outdoor market where I can buy pants and food?
Manager: The Albert Cuyp Market would be the place.
To his credit, it was the place. Within 10 minutes of being there I bought a pair of cheap sweatpants, an onion and herring sandwich, and a crepe. I am perhaps the only person in history to purchase those 3 exact items at once. I wanted to experience the local delicacies though, and figured I could knock em out in one fail swoop. The meal brought back memories of my Bubbie, who I missed dearly. She loved herring and crepes (separately). Seeing me holding them at the same time would’ve given her a good chuckle. She’d probably ask, “What is it, my birthday?” My father loved crepes too, but the image of him eating 30 crepes is not a pleasant memory to conjure up.
After finishing my meal, I went in my pocket for dessert, 20mg of Adderall. My mom told me my Bubbie took uppers in the 60’s, when they prescribed it to housewives as a weight loss drug. I bet her grandma was a speed freak too, drinking that Coca Cola with actual cocaine in it.
I needed to charge up, and without sleep, Adderall was the best way to do that (even with sleep, for that matter). I was on a mission to find a bar that evening. And not just a bar for that night, but one I could call home in future visits. I still had a month or so left in my trip and knew I’d be back to Amsterdam, so I needed to have a reliable place to hang my hat. Bars are that important to me. I can’t just go any old place to drink willy nilly. I need a home base, somewhere I feel comfortable, where they know my name. Like the Commonwealth.
I had no clue where I was going to find it, but I knew I’d know it when I saw it (the same way pornography was defined by the Supreme Court in 1964). It took some walking, but then I stumbled upon what was undoubtably the place. I was standing at the corner of Nieuwebrugsteeg and Warmoesstraat, right where Warmoesstraat turns into Sint Olofspoort. I’m serious. I looked up and there it was… The perfect bar. The sign under the awning read: “H. Murray’s Bar.” Next to it was a smaller sign that read “Anno 1619.” It looked to be more of a house than a bar. There was even a Golden Retriever in the window, standing with its’ paws on the sill. A bar dog is a surefire sign of a good bar. If it’s good enough for a dog, it’s good enough for me.
I entered like I was returning home.
Me: Hi. I’m Sam.
Neil: Hello, friend. I’m Neil. That’s Lilly (pointing to the dog). And that’s Norman (pointing to the only other man sitting at the bar).
Me: Hello gents. May I…?
Norman: Pull up a seat, Sam.
Me: I’ll have what Norman’s having.
Always drink what the house drinks. It will endear you to the crowd. For me, that only backfires when the house drink is Sambuca. I hate Sambuca. It tastes like Christmas tree water. Or Malort. Don’t even get me started on the Chicago bars that push that lighter fluid on their clientele. Monsters.
We got to talking and time got to flying, the way it does when you’re around good people. Norman told me about his time in Berkley, about how he knew Tim Leary, Tom Wolffe and the Merry Pranksters, people I’d only known from books like The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, and Hunter’s Hells Angels. We shared the same sense of humor too. When he told me his favorite comedian was Steven Wright, I knew we were cut from the same cloth, only a generation apart.
Steven Wright is one of the more obscure, odd comedians; real dry, great word economy. He can make you laugh in less than 20 words.
“A lot of people are afraid of heights. Not me, I’m afraid of widths.”
“I think it’s wrong that only one company makes the game Monopoly”
I told him to look up Mitch Hedberg, but didn’t bother telling him how Mitch’s death contributed to my quitting stand-up, or that I even did stand-up at all. I couldn’t have done that without crying, so I just listened and enjoyed being a guest.
I wish I remembered more of that night, but that’s how it goes sometimes. I’ve always found sacrificing memory for fun to be a fair trade. Not everything has to be remembered and documented with a picture. I can’t recall most of the best times of my life and I’m just fine with that.

March 28, 2006
They started jackhammering bright and early the next day. Still half-drunk, wearing my clothes from the prior night, I darted down to the lobby to get breakfast before it ended. While scarfing down cold eggs and toast, I checked my pockets and counted the money I had. It was the same exact amount I’d gone out with the night before, along with a few grams of unfamiliar loose weed. John Mulaney has a joke about blacking out and coming home with more money than he left with, and that’s exactly what happened to me. Neil didn’t even charge me. He must’ve denied my attempts at tipping too, because every dollar was still in my wallet. I couldn’t recall his kind gesture, but I was sure I hadn’t just skipped out on my tab. I mean, I was pretty sure. When I’m blacked out, I’m more inclined to try and pay twice than I am to skip out on the bill. One time in New Orleans, I paid my tab, then sat there trying to pay my tab again, four more times. The bartender eventually threw me out.
Some hair of the dog seemed in order. “Hair of the dog” means “Alcohol.” They used to rub it on dog wounds. The way it’s colloquially used now is to say, “you can’t get hungover if you stay drunk.” I still had about an hour before the intense hangover would take hold, and figured a large quantity of Adderall and drinks could fend it off.
I found a nearby Irish Pub and ordered a shot and a beer. Realizing I was American, the bartender tested me before serving me.
Bartender: Do you like George Bush?
Me: He’s a cunt.
Bartender: Guinness and Jameson coming right up.
I drank and gobbled pills the whole afternoon and into the early evening, until I could hardly see straight. Bender mode, engage.
Let’s talk about benders for a minute… During 24 hour-plus drinking benders, your brain swells to the point you can barely remember who or where you are. You become erratic, uncontrollable. For no reason at all, you push over garbage cans, rip signs out of the ground, and piss on walls. And you’ll fuck anything with a pulse. You become possessed. And the choice remains… Give up and succumb to the impending hangover or continue on with disregard for all human decency. Either way, you’re fucked.
I marched on. After leaving the bar, I bought a 20oz Heineken and brown bagged it on my walk to nowhere. At least I thought I was going nowhere. My subconscious had a different idea though. I didn’t realize it at first, but I was retracing my steps from the previous day. My boozed soaked brain was leading me to the very place my sober brain found disgusting. I didn’t even realize where I was going until I saw the glowing red lights.
*
I walked the entire length of the Red-Light District multiple times, prowling amongst my fellow creeps, trying to find the perfect lady. I have always been a very discerning shopper, that time being no different. I didn’t just want any random lady; I wanted one who showed interest in me. God, that’s pathetic.
The women all had their own room where they sat, positioned toward the outer sidewalk. The ones who were “busy working” had their large window covered with a red curtain. The others, who were “waiting for work,” had their curtains drawn, allowing you to see the entire layout of the room. They were all similar; a bed in the corner, a small nightstand, presumably for keys or other knickknacks that may interfere with the coitus, and a few mirrors. Everything was red, the lights, the bed, the carpet… Like white is the safest car color, I think red makes for the most fucking.
All the women were objectively gorgeous, much more gorgeous than the sex workers I patronized in Tijuana the prior summer. They were hideous. And they robbed me. I don’t want to talk about that though. These ladies weren’t beaten down, figuratively speaking. They looked confident, even proud, like hard working small-business owners. Some of them weren’t even dressed scantily and gave off a “take it or leave it” vibe, which I dug. There were no pimps in sight either. Just the ladies and their red rooms.
With each trip down the corridor, I narrowed my selection, like I was hosting my own March Madness tournament, pitting lady against lady, with the winner advancing to the next round.
The eventual winner was white, with long, dark brown hair, and weighed about 150 pounds. She curled her index finger and invited me in, licking it between curls with the effort of a champion.
Inside, I met the pimp. He may not have been a pimp technically, but he held the money like a pimp does. And probably for the best. I gave him 50 Euros and he gave me a single condom. He didn’t say a word. Then, he opened the door to the red room.
Tonya: I’m Tonya. What’s your name?
Me: I’m Sam.
I forgot I could lie.
Her bubbliness left. Now she was working. She’d already caught her fish; the rest was just fileting.
Tonya: Bed or standing?
Me: Uhhh, standing.
I feared I might pass out if I lied down
She turned around and faced the dresser, gripping the top of it with her hand. Pulling down her black, lace panties, she began to prepare herself with one hand, the other braced on the dresser. I took my pants down, following her lead.
Lady: Ok, ready.
I tore open the condom and put it on. Then, I inserted myself.
When she moaned, I gained confidence. I started to go faster, and she moaned more, my confidence growing stronger yet. I took my left hand and slapped her ass cheek.
That’s when the pimp came bursting in.
Pimp: NO, NO, NO! NONE OF THAT!
He was pissed. I looked over at him to apologize for my lapse in judgment, and while doing so, ejaculated into the condom I was wearing. I knew I was jizzing. He knew I was jizzing. I knew he knew I was jizzing.
We both jumped back.
Pimp: Ok, that’s it you’re done.
Me: But I didn’t even cum.
He pointed to my shriveling dick.
Pimp: Yes, you did.
I had no recourse. There was jizz in the condom and I couldn’t remove it in his presence, causing a smoking gun, “gotcha!” type of situation. So, I waited until he left the room, then I got dressed, alongside Tonya.
Me: So, Tonya. Thank you very much.
Tonya: (doing a crossword puzzle) Yeah, whatever.
Me: Have a good rest of your evening.
*
March 29, 2006
I woke up the next morning wreaking of vomit. I’d gone to a bar to cement my blackout after having sex with Tonya, but unfortunately, I wasn’t able to drink enough to forget I came while looking into another man’s eyes. I guess that’s the type of memory no amount of alcohol can erase. To this day, I still see his face . I like to think he still sees mine too and were forever cosmically connected through semen.
I knew I’d be back, but I had to get the hell out of Amsterdam, pronto. I needed a reset. I couldn’t fall deeper into depravity so early in the trip. I had to pace myself if I wanted to survive another 2 weeks on the road.
After showering (I know, I’m disgusting for not having showered the night before. Get off me), I headed to the train station and looked at the big board to see what my options were. Paris was appealing but I wasn’t mentally prepared to take an 8-hour train ride. That would have left far too much time to reflect on the previous night. So, when I noticed the option to take a 4-hour bullet train, I jumped at the chance and made a reservation for the 11am departure.

I heard the conductor’s announcement as we approached Rotterdam train station — “Watch out for pickpockets!” We had nothing valuable in our pockets, I thought. The thieves would be disappointed if they picked OUR pockets.
We had barely arrived in Amsterdam two days prior, but we jumped right into action. There was too little time and too much to see. Our American employers weren’t sympathetic to our desire to see the world, and our European or Aussie friends weren’t helping when they flaunted their five-day stay at a place and uncertain departure. We heard that all of Europe shut down in August. What?! What if I got appendicitis?
Jet lag is for wusses and we are biased for action. We have to be. We got our bearings during the first evening in Amsterdam so upon our return from Belgium, we would have an optimized route to tackle our must-see list. The day before, we wandered through Delft and Leiden while keeping an eye on the watch. Thank goodness for the Netherlands’ robust train system and the manageable size of the country. Those little towns were charming even in the rain and vendors in the open market didn’t complain, so why would we?

Back in July of 2023, I flew into Amsterdam to start my new life. Amsterdam was going to be it for me. The magical canals, the tulips, the summer sun.
It was the place to be.
I understood there was a lot of weed in Amsterdam, I’m not a user but I’ve never been bothered by other peoples choices as long as there’s no pressure for me to partake.
I was excited — I’d heard so many good things about the Dutch culture, they’re friendly and community minded, they love flowers, and are some of the happiest people on earth.
I was convinced that I would step into Amsterdam and say, “this is my home,” and live here happily for the rest of my life.
I know, I set very realistic expectations for myself.
I did not own a jacket. The wind whipped you like a smoothie, what more can I say, I’d just arrived from Spain and I was cold.
I ate a sausage roll and felt like I was back at home, then I was annoyed because right next door was a salad bar I hadn’t noticed. I walked out the door, caught a taxi and asked them to drive me to my hostel.
They said, “This is not a good area.”
I’ve heard that so many times. It’s a tradition of mine to book a dodgy hostel the first night in a new country — never on purpose.
I hopped out of the taxi, payed the million bucks, and headed on in. The reviews had been good; they provided all meals if you wanted them too (and can pay for it), the common area was social with table tennis and pool and a bar.
All of this was true, and the staff were lovely. The only problem was everyone was buzzed. Is that the right slang?
Everyone checking in was out of it. Not like they’d taken a few puffs at a concert — they were not there at all. Had I walked into a hostel or a hospital?
The only problem was everyone was buzzed.
I checked in and was treated like I was also very out of it. I went to my hostel room, dumped my bag and decided to go exploring.
I enjoyed a walk through a lovely park, I was stopped by a guy who tried to get a lot of personal information from me and I assertively said, “I’m going to leave now.” Which I was quite proud of myself for doing.
I found another lovely park but it was filled with homeless people, and people on drugs. I left pretty quick.
I sat down at a restaurant and tried to get some food in me, and a cool drink. It wasn’t hot but sometimes you have to fake it till you make it.
Pro Tip: If you’re ever alone and feel less than 100%, you need to eat. Even if you’re not hungry, just pick at something.
So I ordered with a grumpy waitress, and tried not to cry as I thought about how all my dreams had been crushed in just a few hours. I was alone in a scary city. I had walked for about three hours and hadn’t made it to the Anne Frank House like I wanted, instead I was tired, scared, and the most alone I’d ever felt.
While sitting at this café fighting back tears I remembered I was in complete control of my life, choices, and actions. So I looked up hostels elsewhere. I had been told to go outside of Amsterdam and explore little towns, so I thought I’d do that.
I looked on booking.com and picked the cheapest hostel with at least an 8/10 rating. The place was advertised to be quiet, along a canal, and within walking distance to a conference centre. The complete opposite to my vibe but I was tired and I thought it’d be worth a shot.
I caught a taxi back to my hostel, contacted home, and went to bed with a very early alarm set for the morning.
The next day was the start of my overseas adventure, I just didn’t know it yet.
Have you ever been in a situation where you felt uncomfortable?
Have you ever felt unsafe in a new city?

As a fanatic football fan, it is a dream to watch European Championship knockout match in the stadium. The championship was cancelled in the year 2020 due to pandemic. In 2021 it started with empty stadium and eventually with minimal capacity. Budapest is the only city which got permission to hold international matches with 100% capacity. Thanks to the circumstances that I got a ticket to one of the knockout matches. It was a ticket for Netherlands Vs Czech Republic for round of 16 Euro 2021 match, hosted in Budapest. Without any second thought, I booked tickets. Now during the COVID situation it is hard to travel via Aeroplane. So, that option had been discarded. I’m personally very passionate about drive. Often and regularly whenever I get chance, I go for long drive with my family. Why not in Car ?
As Google says, the distance between Amsterdam and Budapest is around 1400 KM. So, a round trip will be around 2800 KM and we need to complete the same within 72 hours. Challenging ? Isn’t it ? I called my friend, Supratik, another fellow MDM expert, and tell about the plan. He was too very excited and was ready to hit the road.
I have a Tesla Model 3 Long Range AWD Model. As claimed by Tesla, with 100% full charge, it can go upto 580 KM. Off course, I’m not planning to challenge the claim. Even I can complete with scheduled Supercharging facility, I’m good. The plan is to start by Friday evening and end by Monday afternoon.
2800 KM in 72 hours. Fascinating journey. Route plan has been automatically created by GoAnywhere Tool available with Tesla. We are supposed to stop in the designated points. There are total 5 super charger points decided by Tesla Tool and I decided to abide by completely without trusting my own ability of making prediction for charging.
As I’ve approached towards the date, I prepared a mini bucket list to carry. 1. Toothbrush 2. Half Pant (1 extra) 3. T-Shirts (1 extra) 4. Netherlands Flag with Team jersey 5. My wife prepared a flux full of strong coffee and two plates of Noodles prepared in Indian style for the night 6. My laptop, phone and chargers 7. Credit card (For emergency). And 8. Passport and PCR Test result.
I called my Insurance company to check about the Travel Insurance. In order to travel in Germany, Austria and Hungary, three different autobahnvignet was required which I purchased two days before the travel date. PCR Test was mandatory, so we did the same and was expecting the result by 10 PM on the travel date. We decided that once we get the result, we should start.
25th June, 2021 Friday 10:00 PM : just received the PCR Test result for COVID-19 and it was negative. I was good to go. Finally the time came to say BYE to my wife and two daughters for the awaited travel. I started from Almere, Netherlands. Supratik, who was accompanying me, was waiting in Amersfoort. I took him and then started for Budapest.
1:00 AM in the morning. It was 26th June Saturday then when we reached our first destination. The first stop was at Westerwaldpark 4, 56587 Oberhonnefeld-Gierend, Germany. The distance we covered was 308 KM and it took me nearly 3 hours. The sky was clear and Full-Moon was visible like burned Indian Roti. The last time I saw this kind of moon was in my village when I was 7 years. Looking at the moon just reminded me those days. We were tempted to take some the pictures of Moon while the Tesla was getting charged. Supratik was carrying SLR Camera, he took some good photo of the red moon. I had my half portion of meal (prepared by my wife). It was a short break of around 20 minutes and the car was ready for another destination.
3:20 AM I stopped at Hauptstraße 231, 63879 Weibersbrunn, Germany. The distance travelled so far was around 500 KM. I found myself little fatigue and took a break of 30 minutes with the strong Indian Coffee. Sipping the home-made coffee in the middle of the road was enjoyable. I feel loved.
7:00 AM stopped at Junkersstraße 3, 93055 Regensburg, Germany. The distance covered 870 KM so far. Took a break for 30 minutes. It was morning with super Sun shine. I really needed a coffee. Oh yeah !! before I forgot to mention, my fellow friend was sleeping from start, as I imagined he was actually dreaming with his seat belts on. I was so certain because, he had not even moved while I stopped, had a coffee and completed the charging.
10:00 AM Rasthausstraße 3, 4300 St. Valentin, Austria. We crossed the Austrian border around 8:00 AM in the mornging. The distance travelled so far was 1050 KM. Took 30 mins break here.
2:00 PM Győrújbarát M1 autópálya, 119. kmsz, 9081 Hungary. The distance travelled so far 1300 KM. Unfortunately, I detour at Viena. The usual road shows the route bypassing the city of Viena. I took the road though the city. It was around 12–00 noon, the traffic was medium. That increased the travel time by 30 mins. At around 1:00 PM, I crossed border of Hungary and Austria. Once I reached the pre-defined Supercharger location, took 30 mins break. I was feeling Hungry. I had bread with Goulash soup.
3:30 PM Budapest. The distance travelled so far was 1400 KM. Total time of travel is approximately 17 hrs 30 minutes. It was hot outside around 35 degrees sunny. Dog tired.
Tesla is incredible. My highest speed was about 220 KM per hour in the Germany autobahn. There are plenty super charging facility available. So, you don’t need to worry about it. GoAnywhere tool automatically determines the best available route for your journey. Return journey was around the same. We started from Budapest at 11–00 PM on Sunday 27th June. I returned Home (Almere, NL) at 5–00 PM Monday 28th June. It took me 16 hours to return. Faster though !!

If it’s both terrifying and amazing then you should definitely pursue it — Erada
I didn’t wake up one day saying, okay I am going to work abroad. I started looking for a new job about two months after my current company at the time, Aereo, lost their case at the Supreme Court. I was perusing the job boards and kept coming across the job post UX Designer at Booking.com.
Since I have started working, two years ago, I have been anti-corporation / anti-big team. The first job that I had after college was at a company called Pingg, a start up with a team of 10 people. I absolutely loved my time and the people at Pingg. Pingg was bought by a big corporation and many things that I loved about the start up life changed. After a couple of months, I moved on to Aereo. I knew taking the job was risky because they were involved in legal battles, but I thought it was worth the risk. I believed in the company’s mission, liked the team, and was happy to be back in the start up world. Unfortunately 3 months into my new job, we were shut down by the Supreme Court.
I stayed at Aereo for 5 months after we were shut down. There were some glimmers of hope here and there, but nothing concrete. After a while, I felt like I was wasting my time. I wanted to be learning and working, not just sitting on my hands.
So after doing some interviews, I finally manned up and applied for the UX Designer job at Booking.com. Even though it was a large corporation, there was one paragraph in the job post that really stood out to me:
Our guiding principle is that by helping our users we help our business. As a designer in our Front End team you’ll be a key part of the idea generation process, working in a small startup-like group which takes full ownership of their part of our platform. You’ll work with developers, product owners, copywriters and user researchers to conceive, analyse, hand code & test your ideas.
This is exactly what I like to do. I love starting with an idea and following that idea from creation to production. On the first phone interview, I made sure to ask if this was really the way that they worked. After the first interview, I already started to have anxiety. Am I really doing this? Am I really applying to a job in a different country? Well after another phone interview, and an in-person interview in Amsterdam, I am really doing this.
So did Amsterdam have anything to do with the job? Yes of course, but not until after I decided I actually liked the job itself. I have always liked the idea of taking a couple of years and living and working abroad but never thought that I would actually do it. Originally I thought that if I lived abroad it would be in London. I studied abroad in London and absolutely loved it. But, London is a lot like New York: major city, cabs, native language of English, a lot of the same stores and food.
In Amsterdam, I am hoping to get a very different cultural experience. Hopefully I will learn a new language, experience a different culture, try new food, get around on a bike, and travel throughout Europe. I am young and have nothing keeping me here in New York right now. I am definitely sad about leaving New York / America and I will obviously miss my family and friends, but it is the perfect time to take this opportunity. If I had this opportunity and did not take it, I know that in 10 years, or even in a month, I would look back at this missed opportunity and kick myself.

I landed in Amsterdam pretty late, and then immediately took the wrong train from the airport. I doubled back and got on the right one, and then when I switched to the aboveground at Lelylaan station, I got on that going the wrong direction too. Thanks to GPS I realized this after just one stop, but once I got on the tram going opposite, my phone died.
I tried to pronounce the name of the stop to the conductor — Tramhalte Bilderdijkstraat (De Clercqstraat), and he laughed. He understood vaguely what I was saying, and let me know when we arrived, so I found a shop and they happily let me plug my phone in. They also helped me interpret my upside down google maps and told me where to walk.
Just as I left, a woman walked past me and when I looked at her, she SMILED AT ME.
I’ve been traveling for two weeks and I admire hundreds of people every day, I really can’t get enough of the diverse beauty and style over here. Whenever someone notices me looking, I give them a big, genuine smile, because I appreciate them! Guess how many people have smiled back? I was absolutely overjoyed when this Dutch stranger grinned at me, and so even though my 15 minute trip from the airport took me over an hour, Amsterdam felt like the place to be already :]
Wendy was house-sitting for her friends who are on honeymoon. She told me to find the apartment by the pink flamingo in the window. Beautiful!
I think the first thing Wendy said to me was “so ehm, vodka?” I fucking love you Wendy! We had pizza and then her friend Sonja took us to to a special nightclub, MADAM. MADAM is a brand new venue at the top of A’DAM tower, a 360 degree observation deck, over 100 meters high in a city with an average building height of 30 meters. The view is astonishing. It’s the former Shell Oil tower, and I remember thinking, what a nice triumph of man’s sheer will over good sense and modesty — my my, it’s beautiful.
ADAM stands for Amsterdam Dance and Music, and we danced all night on the beautiful rooftop deck. The DJ put on Mike Dunn, Barbara Tucker, Adonis, all on 7″ vinyl which blew me away. There’s an observation hole in the middle of the dancefloor, so you can look down and see the ground 100 meters below. Scary!
To get to the tower, we had just followed Sonja by bike, it’s about a 30 minute ride to anywhere from anywhere in Amsterdam and the bike paths are amazingly well maintained. Everyone in Amsterdam rides a bike EVERYWHERE, it’s perfect. Wendy has a super dutch yellow beach cruiser, and it has bars in back and front for passengers.
Wendy was wearing some amazing linen pants which really showed off her perfect bum, her jetpack pants she called them, and a very pretty little Dutch woman in all white told Wendy “you are the most beautiful woman alive, I want to marry you!” The rest of the night, the woman kept telling Wendy how horny she made her, and Wendy went, guess I’m a lesbian tonight!
There’s no bridge to ADAM tower, you have to take a ferry, which is full of bikes and scooters. After we danced till about 3am, we left and took the ferry back over for AIR nightclub. It’s an amazing techno club and has hosted some incredible acts judging by the posters on the walls, but this night was a hip-hop pre-party and after hearing tons of the best house music on earth, you don’t really wanna hear Sean Paul. Wendy’s lover woman came too, and continued to let Wendy know how sexy she is, which I thought was nice of her.
I do love old, sexy hip hop, but I also avoid hip hop clubs because in my admittedly narrow experience people there are aggressive, unfriendly, don’t give too much of a fuck about the music anyway, and are there primarily to get laid.
It’s okay to want to get laid, but when that is everyone’s primary motivation for being somewhere, it makes the party shit for everything else. New hip hop also seems to celebrate ridiculous materialism and encourages people to treat others poorly, especially women.
House music celebrates love, inner beauty, helping each other and valuing diversity, and the people who love to go dance house music are amazing because they really seem to embody these attitudes.
We left AIR after about an hour for a gay club called NYX that’s meant to be incredible, but it was nearly closed when we got there so we went home.

NOMADS IS THE BOMB!!!! The way it’s been described to me, during Awakenings everyone and their mom comes from all over NL and the world to be one of fifty thousand people in a pitch black tent listening to Richie Hawtin whine, but the lovely people who actually live in Amsterdam get the heck out of the city and get to Nomads.
NOMADS
Wendy and I biked there, it rained lightly on us and took about twenty minutes. We arrived at 4pm and lots of people were chaining up their bikes, but once we got in, there was plenty of beautiful space to dance.
Festival mania is everywhere though, and within an hour the place was fucking PACKED, in the rain!
Robert Owens was jammin, and got on the mic and told us ‘ain’t nothin but house party baby, you’re in the house with Robert!” Embarrassingly enough, I actually didn’t recognize his face at first, and Joppe laughed when I asked who he was. I hate FILAS but Owens had on some pretty nice designer inspired sneakers I’d never seen before (No Rick).
The festival gave limited edition “Nomads” slipmats to all the performers, with their names and some lovely artwork.
Moomin was straight Moomin, I love the guy. We spent a lot of time at his stage dancing, all the stages used d&b audiotechnik line arrays with massive infrabass stacks and the sound was INCREDIBLE. If you’re putting together a club soundsystem, remember, sub harmonics are essential!
I bumped in to my old boy Dieuwer, and Vincent and Joyce from the Midnight City crew who I met exactly a year ago when they hosted thatmanmonkz. If you’re in Amsterdam, look up Midnight City and pray they are doing something while you are around cause their parties are so good!! It’s very nice to see old friends :]
I also made lots of new friends, as wonderful Dutch people would come up to me up just to dance and talk and they told me about Dutch music, dance culture, fashion, designer drugs, festivals, love, drugs again, etc.
The Lumberjacks in Hell stage was non-stop fury. Marcel Vogel, Mr. Mendel, Rahaan, and Red Greg served up endless, impeccable disco. While Red Greg was playing, Rahaan was standing behind him and going wild at every mix, he couldn’t contain his excitement, and the crowd absolutely fed off of it, everything was perfect.
After Moomin, Nick V, Titia, and Carlos Valdes went back to back. Everyone was wonderful, but every time Carlos came on he was simply next level. It’s a really interesting thing, DJing, because these guys are playing other people’s music, they’re mostly selectors, but there are intangible qualities which make these guys immediately distinguishable from each other. It’s like, texture, presence, loudness, and MAGNETISM.
Mike Huckaby did a double take and started laughing when he saw me. I’d just caught him in Detroit and joked about how I’ve showed up in the weirdest places on Earth, ever since he took a video after his gig in Barcelona two years ago and I was in the front row getting loose. He was playing in Sicily the next weekend and I would have loved to have made it, but I had to get to Croatia!
SUNDAY
For Awakenings, you get to Amsterdam central station, and then there’s a shuttle for ten euros (bus #999, gasp!) which takes you fifteen minutes out to an industrial park in the middle of nowhere with some wind turbines. You get off, and then you have to walk about thirty minutes through the wilderness along a path to the festival entrance.
A kid got kicked off the shuttle right when we were about to leave the station, cause he snuck on without a ticket. The security guard took his drink, and then spilled it all over himself trying to throw it away.
I meant to get something to eat at Amsterdam central, but one ATM was broken so the line for the other was like twenty minutes, and by then I didn’t want to waste any more time.
When I got to the entrance and gave my name for the guestlist, they told me I was actually on a paid list, and it would be fifty euro. I said single day tickets are fourty-five euro, what? The other lady behind the counter chimed in and said yeah, but with fees and everything.. I said so what’s the point of the list? They laughed, and then I paid the fifty euro. I waltzed in and immediately got a “premium hot dog”, and then caught some of Damian Lazarus.
The festival grounds are HUGE, and the installations are pretty incredible, but after such a sexy, intimate experience at Nomads where everyone is chatting up everyone, where it feels like family, being lost in anonymity at Awakenings made me feel a bit lonely. Even by yourself at Nomads, the stages are small and you can climb up next to the DJ booth, so you feel like you’re part of something and you’re enjoying the music from the “inside.”
At Awakenings, the stages are twenty feet off the ground, so it’s just a bunch of DJ shows, you squint to see who is playing in most of the tents. There are some nice outdoor stages, I stayed and danced for most of Paco Osuna’s set, and every time there was a big build or something, they shot fire and smoke from the stage.
I bumped in to the lady in all white who asked Wendy to marry her, and she told me that she was still horny. She was with her friends, all laughing hysterically, and she asked me if I like women or men and I said women, so she said let’s hang out, and I said cool, but I had to go get something to eat though, and then we never bumped in to each other again.
I met a friend from Nomads the night before, and she took me with her friends in to the middle of the tent Maceo Plex was playing at. You couldn’t see much, pitch black, techno I didn’t really enjoy, and you just stood in your space and danced. I knew it was a shit question, but I asked a few people if they had ever come SOBER to stand in the middle of this crowd, and just listened to techno and dance silently. Everyone said “I’ve never thought about that,” which was strange.
After the festival I walked back, through the fields, to the bus, to the tram. Wendy was at Bram’s, and she sent me a photo with directions from her place. We had a drink and I found this place De Skool on Resident Advisor. The headlining DJ had a mix online which was just African drumming.
We got there, and some kids outside told us it was like trippy electro. I asked two guys who were leaving how the party was, and they said “it’s shit, mate. they found pills on us and kicked us out. i’d forgot I even had them.
De Skool is amazing. It’s an old primary school I guess, it has this campy front entrance like where you’d imagine kids would have sat at recess, enormous long empty corridors, a beautiful park in the middle where vines and trees have overgrown the jungle gym, and when you take the stairs down to the dancefloor, the fun really starts. The basement is the size of the entire building, and it’s completely filled with fog, so you can only see a few feet in front of you, but you can tell that off in the distance there’s music and movement. You walk through the fog like you’re in outer space or something, and then eventually you come upon this insane, sweaty mob of Dutch kids, who happened to be going nuts dancing to acid house. I’ve never been a huge fan of acid before, and in this context, it was PERFECT, it sounded amazing and Wendy and I had a blast.
love ya Wendy, thanks Sonja, till the next time Amsterdam!

By Rita SilvestreCreative Intern at VBAT
Olá! Hello!
I’m Rita Silvestre, I’m from Porto, Portugal and I’m a new intern at VBAT. I’m really passionate about art, design and travelling! The name Rita, derived from Margherita, and Silvestre which means wild, like forest fruits or wild plants.
Two months ago, I graduated in Communication Design at the Fine Arts Faculty in Oporto University (FBAUP). Porto is the city where I was raised and lived until one month ago. Even though I’ve spent all my life living in Porto, I don’t think I’ll ever get tired of it. From the river side to the beach side, from the little traditional corners of the city centre to the coast, Porto is a heart-warming, welcoming and cosy place. If I were you, I would probably book a flight right now to go there!
Many people ask why I decided to come to the Netherlands and leave such a beautiful country. Portugal is great for sure but not so much when it comes to work opportunities, salaries… design and arts aren’t so much recognized as an important work as here (now it’s starting to get better…I hope…) but yes, our weather and food are amazing.
During my degree, I took part in the Erasmus+ Program and I went to Salford University in Manchester, an amazing experience where I acquired lots of knowledge and experienced a different culture and way of living. During my degree I was involved in many things, highlighting FBAUP Design Inc., a junior company created by students in my university. In this company I could be in touch with the real market, working with clients and developing real projects. I joined this company in my first year and stayed until my fourth year of university. I got the president position and I managed to juggle everything during my Erasmus+ semester in Manchester. Besides that, I was Secretary and Student Representative at Board of Regents in FBAUP, where we could discuss our position as students, our university/infrastructures conditions and what we could change for a better future in FBAUP. I think Porto University gave me the basic design tools but then it didn’t prepare me so well for the outside world. However I am glad I worked at FBAUP Design Inc. and this helped with experience that the university didn’t provide me with, I felt more ready to go out and tackle the world!
Before this internship at VBAT, I did a Summer Internship and a University Internship. I worked for SonaeMC in Porto where I developed all Continente Supermarket’s plastic bags. It was a really good experience being in a huge company, working with different departments and not just within design.
The other internship was in Studio Eduardo Aires, a design studio in Porto that works primarily with editorial, branding and packaging. The studio has a particular design style, really clean, responsive and with a huge importance on detail. I worked in multiple projects, but my main project was developing brochures for the studio, presenting all the projects developed by them, including wine companies like Quinta das Murças, Porto City Identity, Bolhão Market and so on. These brochures functioned as an individual project portfolio to show to their clients.
I always believed design to improve society and following this I have since always tried to develop projects that can have a message that carries forth into the future. All the projects that I choose to show you are the ones that I felt took me out of my comfort zone. The design field that I feel more comfortable to work in is editorial and typographic but the subject that I enjoy developing is illustration. In high school I specialised in textiles and since that time, I’m really passionate about textiles and everything surrounding the subject.
In illustration I found my own personal therapy. When I’m stressed I draw a lot in my sketchbook, mostly people or my routine for example.
Now I’m really interested to improve my skills in motion graphics and illustration. From this experience at VBAT, I want to learn everything possible, try different disciplines of design like packaging design or animation.
As a textile lover, I try sometimes to step away from the computer and work in traditional and analogue methods. This project is born from a reflection that I wrote about society and the way that people are living, with all the standards that often make us lose our personality and our paths. The main goal was to create images from words. These are three images of the whole project. I used colour and monochrome images that represent a bridge between our reality and our dreams/feelings, sewn to connect them. Even if you try to take the thread out, it will be always marked.
I have always been fascinated with Illustration, but I never invested a lot of time because I didn’t have a lot of self-confidence. These illustrations were my first connection with the subject. I developed a zine about how the world could be, when humans were characters of the animal world. How would be our position and how would we interact with them if our worlds were inverted.
The next is a recent illustration, about the universe but in a way in which a person is recognized as a universe, and a unique individual.
This special work was dedicated for all cerebral palsy people in Porto City with the intention of demonstrating the capacity they have to choose and decide everything themselves. Porto doesn’t have a lot of accessibility or acceptation and there is little incentive to make progress to change this, many people don’t wish to dwell on the subject. With two types of software “GRID3” and “PCEYE”, I tracked the eye movements of two cerebral palsy persons during making some decisions on their computer. The movement has been drawn in a lower layout of the software from which I created the sketches and developed them into posters advocating the cause. As an answer to this problem, this posters illustration shows the product of their decisions, proving that it is something they can do.
Slightly closer to my comfort zone, I designed Sunny Sushi. An editorial project design answering to a proposal to make a cookbook according to a design style. I chose Japanese Design and my main goal was to show how sushi can be easy to make, in the same way it’s easy to set an IKEA chair.
Now that you know a little more of me, I present to you Nando, my little desk cactus. He is super kind and gives really good advice. Feel free to say hello to the both of us anytime! Just drop a comment below…
Best, Rita

I’m starting my 4-weekish adventure today and I’m still not quite sure if I’m a excited about it. The thing is: I’ve been looking forward to this trip for a while now, yet my knees have been acting up lately and I’m very worried that they might deter me from completing this adventure. But, I’m just going to give it a try.
Here’s a quick overview of my current status and what I’m planning to do: I arrived in Germany on the evening of Saturday, August 3rd. I spent the next day packing my bags and in the evening I’d invited friends and family to celebrate my 45th birthday. It was a mild summer evening and there were about 20 of us. (I’m really lucky to have friends who just make time for me at the spur of the moment as I’d only announced this little gathering few days before.) For the next few weeks, the plan is to cycle from Amsterdam to Budapest (from point A to point B) via Hamburg, Berlin, Dresden, Prague, Vienna and Bratislava. I’ll be returning via the night train from Vienna.
Today, Monday August 5th, I got up early and headed to the train station bright and early. Another worry, on top of the worry about my knee, had planted itself in my head: while I’d bought a train ticket to Amsterdam, I didn’t purchase the ticket for my bike. Shit! And my friends last night mentioned that recently they’ve had a really hard time to get reservations for their bikes. Shit! It’s so like me to forget essential things like this and it reminds me of what my mom used to tell me: “If your head wasn’t attached to your body…” (Speaking of my mom: 5 years ago, when I was starting my bike pilgrimage to Puglia, my mom still bid me goodbye in the morning. It’s now over two years that she’s gone and this morning I got a little sentimental about that.) Yet, as much as my head isn’t always working properly, luck usually tends to be on my side and I ended up being able to book a separate bike ticket. Phew!
I know a lot of people dislike the Deutsche Bahn (German Rail) because of severe delays and cancellations , ( newsflash to my non-German friends: German trains are no longer in sync with stereotypes about my people) but today everything went super smooth! I even arrived in Amsterdam five minutes early and the conductor apologized for this “inconvenience” over the intercom. (Amsterdam is obviously not in Germany but the German Intercity train, originating in Berlin, brought me there.)
From the train station I headed straight to the hotel in a neighborhood called Weesperzijde. The hotel is very trendy: a mixture of hotel, co-working space, café/bar and community hub. I feel way too old but the price was right. What surprised me a lot is that the hotel doesn’t have a dedicated bike parking space. I mean: Amsterdam is such a bicycle-friendly city, yet I have to park my bike on the busy street outside the hotel.
After I’d freshened up, I ventured into the city center with my bike and let myself float through the narrow streets filled with tourists. Turns out it was Pride weekend just yesterday and it was quite a joy seeing the streets and shops still adorned with rainbow flags. This inspired me to mingle with the gays and I looked up where the next gay bar was: I was ready for a refreshing beer. I ended up at a pub called “The Queen’s Head”, which was refreshingly retro/vintage and not busy at all. I ended up sitting by the window with a view of the canal. Here, I caught up on messages and started writing this blog.
After a couple pints, I was sufficiently tipsy which led to the terrible decision to have McDonald’s for dinner. After that, I went back to Weesperzijde, where I sat by the canal and watched the sun set over the typical Amsterdam brick houses.
When I got back to the hotel, I turned into a bitch. I become one of those guests that I hated when I was working in hotels. Here’s the thing: I was still quite annoyed with the fact that the hotel didn’t have any secure bike parking. As I was about to get into the elevator, I saw a sign “bike parking” and my Sherlock Holmes instincts kicked in. I followed the signs and eventually emerged in a huge bike parking garage. I “stormed” to the front desk and asked the clerk if I could park my bike there. “No”, he said, “ that’s employee bike parking and we park our rental bikes there.” I want to spare you the details of how I blew up, but suffice to say the clerk made an exception for me and allowed me to park my bike in the garage.

Disneyland If You Love Dutch Cheese; Hell If You’re Lactose Intolerant
At least once a year I’m in Amsterdam on business, and for the last couple years have stayed at a hotel in the Centrum that is dangerously close to a brilliant cheese shop. In fact, it might be my favorite cheese shop in the world. To be clear, I did not pick the hotel due to its proximity to the cheese shop, that was just serendipitous. But it would also not be out of the realm of possibilities for me to do something like that either.
De Mannen Van Kass (which translated from Dutch is “The Men of Cheese”) — Dutch Delicacy is not like the other touristy cheese shops across Amsterdam. It’s a tiny little two-story shop in the southwestern part of the Centrum along Spuistraat that runs parallel to and overlooks the Singel canal. It’s not overly advertised with giant signs. It’s not so packed with customers that you can’t walk around and explore. It’s quaint, it’s cozy, it’s intimate, it’s all things cheese. It’s Disneyland if you love Dutch cheese; Hell if you’re lactose intolerant.
The upstairs features three distinct areas: the cheese shop, the deli, and in the very back, a cheese bar. The downstairs is primarily a shop for cheese tools accessories.
The cheese shop itself focuses on local Dutch cheeses and has a large variety for you to sample. Everything from cow to sheep to goat milk is here, both fresh and aged, pure and flavored, hard and soft. There are cheeses that have been made with honey, others with olive, one that was aged in a WWII bunker, one that was aged in a salt mine, one made with coffee, a few with truffles in them, one soft cheese with cumin, and one simply called “The Special One”…there’s so much variety here that it makes each visit both a challenge and a joy. Each cheese is sitting on a shelf with a little bowl of cheese pieces chopped up inside, and a stack of toothpicks you can use to sample them.
The last couple years I’ve gone, the same lovely older woman has been there to personally guide you through the tastings. She’s very sweet and passionate about the cheeses and I’ve walked out a couple times after she’s snuck a little gift into my bad as well, this last time a little Dutch wooden shoe magnet. Her enthusiasm for showcasing the cheeses is infectious and she will sometimes join in trying a sample of what you’re having just to relive the magic through the eyes of the customer. And yes, the samples seem to be unlimited. Or more to the point, I haven’t been escorted from the premises. Yet.
The second part of the upstairs is the deli immediately to the right as you walk in. From here they have many breads and pastries and can make cheese sandwiches for you. I’ve never eaten anything from here yet but there is usually a line. I’m too busy to gobbling up delicious samples. Next time I will definately go for a cheese sandwich becuase this seems like the kind of place that would do an amazing job with such a simple request.
The third part of the upstairs is my favorite spot: the cheese bar. My God, I might have to write a directive on my will that states to spread some of my ashes here becuase I love this place so much. Saddle on up to one of the stools at the bar or my favorite, grab a pillowed seat in the window overlooking the Singel canal, and tell the cheesemonger to give you a nice sampling of their favorite cheeses. Give them a few minutes becuase they’ll run around the store to grab stuff that isn’t in the bar case. When they return, you’re going to have a huge platter of cheese for about €25 ($27 USD) with jams, mustard, pickles, and bread. Perfect for sharing with friends, or consuming by oneself without an ounce of shame. Oh, and there’s free Wi-Fi in case you want to work from here for the day.
The downstairs is reserved for toys for cheese lovers: knives, cheese boards, fondue sets, slicers, Raclette grills, etc. They have quite a bit of accessories from Boska, a Dutch company. I have to admit, I kinda got lost here in all of the varieties of cheese knives alone. However, pro-tip if you’re traveling light: you can find most of this on Amazon, and it’ll save you having to check in knives on the plane.
While this isn’t a restaurant as would typically be featured on this site, it does stand out as one of my favorite food destinations when I travel to Amsterdam. The shop would be perfect if they could serve wine (they do not have a liquor license), but you can make do by going in to grab a bunch of cheeses, then go down the street to the nearest bar or liquor store, grab a glass or bottle, and then just enjoy the cheese with some wine along a canal.
The only way this could be a better moment would be if you added some stroopwafles (which they also sell) and a hot cup of coffee after. There’s actually two very nice bookstores just across the street (one Dutch, and one American) which would also make for a very nice little afternoon of perusing books, drinking wine and eating cheese.
Next time you find yourself in Amsterdam, please stop here and enjoy the wide variety of cheeses. If you are unable to visit Amsterdam in the near future, consider ordering some of their cheeses online and having them shipped.

Exactly two years ago, I met my oldest ever friend to date. The name and details of this star have been changed for privacy purposes. However, the memory is deeply etched in my mind forever.
I remember how I felt as I first walked to the bus stop and later as I waited, sat next to her. She reached for my gloves when they fell and handed them to me, a cute smile etched on her wrinkled face. It was early February, the coldest month of the year. The beautifully trimmed lawn glistened with frost, and the air was crisp and cold -3 degrees. I was shivering, feeling super chilly. I noticed she was in a long gray jacket, not wearing any gloves. I was amazed to see her all by herself, timid in some ways, but stronger and mightier with age. Clearly, the latter is just a number.
“It’s koud,” she smiled and laughed heartily at me as I gloved up and tried to brace my body against the harsh wind.
“Wat is jouw naam?”
“Astrid. Mijn naam is Astrid,” she said adorably.
“Mijn naam is Apurva.” I showed her my travel card to help her better.
“Apurfaa?” she said, her wrinkles stretching with her voice. The skin around her lips moved as she read my name with ease and smiled. A kind one.
“How old are you?” I asked in amazement. I normally don’t intrude so much, but I couldn’t help it.
“I am 92. I am old and wise,” she said, laughing cheerfully. “Very wise.”
“Oh wow! I am 29.”
“Oh, prima!”
I observed her face closely, the wrinkled lips smudged with red lipgloss that opened to a smile encasing a false tooth set. Her thick hair was fashionably groomed and trimmed into a short bob that covered her head uniformly. The smile was really infectious.
“You look happy. What is the secret to your happiness?”
“I am healthy. I am alive. I have money. I have friends. I have a family. I don’t look happy. I am happy,” she said in a kind but bold voice. Her English was perfect.
“So happy to see you. You really made my day today.”
“So I did something good?” she inquired kindly.
“You have no idea.”
After a moment of silence, I added, “I am coming from my therapist.”
She looked at me intently, a knowing look on her face. She said nothing, but I could swear I saw a small nod of understanding.
“Are you working?”
Bam! She asked me an innocent, totally harmless question. But it was a trigger. Please, no. I will be truthful but answer safely without telling the whole story that I hadn’t accepted myself back then.
“I used to. Now I am studying here.”
“Do you live alone?”
“I am married. I live with my husband.”
Some more smiling. Looking around for the bus which was the reason we were here, we continued to talk.
“What is your lievelingseten (favorite food)?” I had translated the phrase using Google Translate and showed her my phone, because mijn Nederlands is niet zo goed back then.
“I eat everything. But I never skip salads. I eat salads every single day,” she said matter-of-factly.
“Have you always lived here?”
“I have lived here all my life. For 92 years. In Zilver Windstraat.”
“I live in Zilver Windstraat too.”
“What’s the huis number?”
“I live in 118.”
“We are in 20!”
“Wow. We are buren (neighbours).” She looked really happy now.
“Everyone is taking their own car these days. Only one person in each car,” she said, pointing at the vehicles passing by as we waited patiently for our bus, grimacing and shaking her head in disagreement.
“Do you live alone?” Once again, my curiosity got the better of me.
“My second husband died five years ago…” She spoke for a second into the distance, then looked at me briefly, smiling. “It happens, you know…” with a shrug and half-smile.
“I am going to visit a friend who is ill,” she continued. She was clutching her cover filled with clinking glasses. She proudly showed me her glass jar collection, filled with onion plants growing at various heights. She mentioned she couldn’t move her left arm much, though that wouldn’t stop her from being strong and getting things done. A trait I admire so much in the native Dutch. They are not made of sugar.
Each time a pair of headlights appeared around the corner, she got excited in the hope of finally getting into the bus. Then, in a matter of nanoseconds, she said, “Nee…” as the lights extended into a delivery van or, worse, a truck.
She laughed at a small Canta car waiting timidly by the road, its indicator on.
“Klein? (small)”
“Klein…”
“Ik spreek een beetje Nederlands.”
I showed her the Dutch lessons on my phone. She read a few of them and said, “Heel goed!” She had excellent eyesight and could read from my poorly backlit, almost-dying iPhone.
“Why don’t you drive a car yourself? You can get around anywhere so easily!”
“Nee, my children will not allow it.”
She kept murmuring bits of Dutch here and there, and I, like a small child pretending to understand, responded with a confident, typical, and lazy… “Jaaaaa…”
The bus was late as usual. Typical Dutch public transportation.
“I will start walking,” I signalled to her that I might leave now, half-heartedly.
“I will wait for the bus,” she said hopefully, glancing left every time to the corner of the road.
My patience was not the same. “I will call a taxi for us and ask the driver to drop you on the way.”
“Oh, that is not fair. You will pay for it. Oh no…!”
“Nee, geen probleem! It is totally fine. Where do you want to go?”
“Ziekenhuis Amstelland.” Then, after a pause, she added, “You should come home for a coffee one day.”
“I would have visited anyway. I don’t need any favor returned.” I added, kindly.
She probably only heard the word visited. That registered as a yes, and she beamed happily.
I called an Uber. Hafez would arrive in two minutes. That was quick.
In no time, we scrambled into the old KIA. The driver greeted us in Dutch. Astrid took charge and converses fluently with Hafez, a kind man from South Africa. He proceeded to drive us toward her stop, barely 5 minutes away.
By mistake, Astrid poked her finger into the glass screen separating the driver from the passengers. It was so invisibly clean that she hadn’t noticed it. She chuckled to herself for a while. The glass now bore a small fingerprint mark.
“Nooo…” Ans wailed, looking lost and a bit down when Hafez took a wrong turn at the roundabout.
“No, it’s okay… You can tell him where you want to go. He will drop you there.”
Hafez quickly corrected his route and dropped Astrid off exactly where she wanted to go.
As she was getting out of the car, she looked at me and said, “Dank je wel. Coffee is waiting for you,” with a wink and a twinkle in her eyes. She turned and walked away.
Hafez continued driving toward my destination.
“Is she your family?” he asked, peering through the rearview mirror.
“No, I just met her at the bus stop half an hour ago.”
“You did a really kind thing there.”
I rushed to the nearest café after finishing my errand. I had to jot down this incident before it faded from my ever-busy, memory-laden mind.
Coffee is waiting for you…
She didn’t look old — not one bit. So precious. She still had the fire of youth burning inside her, fighting within her. She made me feel hopeful.
As she wakes up every morning to another beautiful day in her life, I wondered what kept her going so positively.
Does she see each day as a blessing or another hurdle to pass?She probably knows her loved ones are waiting for her. That she will meet them when her time comes.But until then, she must go on…
I couldn’t stop the flow of words as I furiously scribbled into my Remarkable, all while holding and pushing my almost-filled bladder to a dangerous extent.
While the incident replayed itself on a loop in my mind, one question bothered me the most.
Was her hair brown or blonde?
I couldn’t recall anymore.
PS: I wanted to simply meet her again after a few months. And I did. This time, with my husband and some flowers. We rang the bell downstairs, hoping against hope that she would remember me. She answered, took the lift, and promptly came down to meet us, her face lighting up when she saw me. Dressed smartly, she took the flowers and went back up, inviting us over another time.
That was a year and a half ago. I tried multiple times to ring her bell again, but there was no answer. We really hope she is still happy and cheerful, wherever she is.

In a few hours, I will no longer be an Amsterdammer. I will take a plane that will carry me away of this city where I landed almost three years ago, knowing no one. At that time, I could not imagine that the city that felt so cold and flat, will feel so warm and containing, will feel so much like home.
Wherever I go, being an Amsterdammer would subject me to bursts of envy: too much sexual freedom, too much legal weed, people would say. The truth is that Amsterdam is much more than its red light district and its coffee shops. Amsterdam is a place where culture, charm, coziness, openness and nonchalance merge together in a beautiful bond. If I were to compare Amsterdam to a woman, this woman would be easygoing, busy enjoying everything that life brings her way, so much in peace with herself and her imperfections, a woman who is too good to be true.
Few months after settling in in Amsterdam, the Amsterdam vibe started to get into me. I started to shift from someone who is over-thinking and over-planning to someone who enjoys the present and lets life flow, trusting that everything will fall into place. I started to overcome my shyness and introvert character and to open myself to new experiences and relationships. I started to think beyond myself and my 9 to 5 job, and to share with Amsterdammers their sheer interest in topics like sustainability, environment and social inclusion. Last but not least, Amsterdam taught me to take care of myself, of my emotional and physical well-being, and to always seek balance and harmony.
I owe to Amsterdam a lot of the small and big changes that happened to me during the past years: Practicing yoga, relying on a bike for movement, sharing my home with strangers, reflecting on my passion and life mission, engaging in impact-driven initiatives and communities, saying what I think even when it is in contrast with what people expect, embracing failure and turning it into fuel, feeling confident talking about my failures and vulnerabilities… I owe to Amsterdam the person I became today, someone who is much happier and looking forward to life than the person I was three years ago.
Thank you Amsterdam for everything! I will miss the times when a bike ride through your canals was enough to erase any sadness and to clear my thoughts. You were so kind to a stranger like me. You were the coziest home I ever had far away from home.

In the mornings, there was still a slight chill in the air despite it being late June. In Amsterdam, the sun came up too early and went back down too late, and I was struggling to adjust to this new sleep schedule. By the time the sun went down completely at ten or eleven at night, it would be hours until I felt tired enough to actually sleep, and still would be up too early for comfort. This routine heavily affected my circadian rhythm.
Despite being the world’s sleepiest girl in Amsterdam, I could enjoy the slow living that the Dutch are accustomed to. I took long walks in the mornings around the canals, listened to Dutch language lessons while wandering residential neighborhoods, and got to explore the history of the quiet, bustling town I would definitely visit again.
For travelers obsessed with history like I am, Amsterdam is a place steeped in stories and lives you will love to learn from. Here’s some of my favorite places in Amsterdam to experience the legacy of “Venice of the North.”

In between Amsterdam’s Olympic stadium and a former correctional facility lays the Havenstraat terrain, one of the last rough patches within the city’s ring-way. Barely subjected to Amsterdam’s fast-paced gentrification, the Havenstraat terrain is an odd collection of barracks, shacks and old tram depots which house businesses, workshops and a tram museum. As the city council has plans to build an apartment complex on the costly ground, chances are this genuine piece of Amsterdam will disappear soon. Dutch photographer Michael Floor decided to capture this eclectic mix of structures, businesses and people before the city has replaced them with something more profitable.
“One guy told me that in the old days, he’d shove the camera in my face, but that there are just too many photographers around the terrain nowadays”
Michael, who lives in the neighbourhood, mostly used the Havenstraat terrain as an alternative to a walk in the park. “The terrain used to be even more secluded, before a bicycle path went through it” Michael explains. The bicycle path, which doesn’t seem to fit any city planning standards, cuts right through the terrain, in between barracks, through a parking lot and over loads of unused rails.
To say that the Havenstraat is an odd sight is an understatement. Hundreds of people bike through it on a daily basis, yet few people seem to know what’s going on behind the barrack doors.
The Havenstraat owns it’s characteristic architecture to a time where the barracks functioned as coal depot for the trains. As this specific station disappeared when the tracks didn’t got modernised to use electricity, the depots became the ideal place for workshops and businesses who profit from the low rent.
The terrain doesn’t come across as the most hospitable of area’s and a lot of the business owners, if they’re present at all, keep to themselves while Michael takes me on a stroll through the terrain. “This must be the only lady who wouldn’t mind if this terrain would be lost, she’s 70 and ready for retirement” Michael says, pointing to a second hand ‘stuff’ store at the beginning of the terrain, which I never noticed before. Another thing I never really noticed; the odd, out of place looking, three story high tower structure next to the store. Michael explains to me that it’s an old station watchtower, left to retire at the Havenstraat.
The terrain is full of odd sights and stuff that ‘American Pickers’ would go crazy over. During our walk, Michael spots several new frames he tries out with his phone as he uses an analogue Mamiya RZ 67 Pro 2 camera for the final pictures. “I might have to come back with my actual camera later on”.
People tend to keep to themselves around here, which makes portraying the terrain and its people a demanding task. Michael: “It’s not a place where you just walk around and snap pictures of everyone. The people here like their privacy and you need to talk to them to get their interest. Some people were fine with me photographing them right away, others had to see me more often before they realized I was doing more than just taking a few quick snaps. One guy told me that in the old days, he’d shove the camera in my face, but that there were just too many photographers around nowadays. He seems to come around though, now he’s seen me more often! I bet I can get a picture of him in the end.”
We continue to walk into a big depot housing a bazaar with an inventory as eclectic as the terrain itself. Michael has an agreement with the owner so that he can come in and photograph the place every once in a while. When the owner walks by, no big pleasantries are exchanged, just a small nod of acknowledgement as he continues his business.
It’s quite easy to romanticise a terrain like this, but some of the businesses here are doing more than well. “This store is doing really good and actually has another branch not too far from here (Beethovenstraat / Appololaan)” Michael tells me while taking mental frames of the light coming in through the roof.
Usually there are quite a few military vehicles scattered around the terrain, which are owned and maintained by classic military vehicle renovator ‘Keep them rollin’. A big yellow bus which is characteristic to the Havenstraat terrain, is used as a riding garage.
Continuing our stroll, Michael explains what more interesting businesses house behind the often closed doors; including a renowned harpsichord builder, a special effects studio for movies, a student moving company, a bicycle repairman and multiple garages.
A bit further on we run into the depots that house the Tram museum, including classic trams. The classic trams are still in use and run on a line between the terrain and Amstelveen, mostly for excursionists.
The trams and depots are also used by a theater group, giving small shows that make use of the trams as moving decors.
Following the tram line is a bit of a hidden surprise: City gardens. Hailing from the days of real crisis, where people were giving a peace of land to grow food on, the gardens now offer a place of relaxation for the owners.
Around them, gentrification has slowly started with brand new apartment buildings at one side of the tracks, and a meticulously planned city park at the other side.
It’s obvious that the city has already been gnawing away at the rough edges of this charmingly authentic terrain. With all the plans for apartment buildings it’s not unthinkable this place will eventually vanish. For now however, business continues as usual.
Michael will continue his series of this terrain and its people, with plans to exhibit them at one point.
When I ask Michael if he thinks it’s a pity this terrain might disappear he answers: “A pity, maybe, yes. But seeing the location, it might be inescapable as well”

Amsterdam, the Venice of the North. Risen from reclaimed marshland. The city of Rembrandt. The city with the harbor and the cruise ships. The port where the crowds buzz like a beehive. The city where dormant changes can suddenly rear their heads. The city with once the beating Jewish heart. Where once Jewish life flourished and vibrated. The heart brought to a halt by betrayal and murder.
I am sitting on a quiet terrace opposite the Museum Square, right next to Museum Square the Concertgebouw. The sun slowly begins to draw melancholy shadows from people and buildings. The birds of the city migrate over to find a safe roost in one of the surrounding parks. The cars, streetcars and cyclists roll silently by. The rush to be home is marked on the faces.
Amsterdam pulls up to the dinner table. People passing by carry with them a variety of food. Above them the hungry faces. The restlessness of the end of the workday is almost palpable. People and the city are getting ready for the coming evening and night. The poverty of the city is also visible in the form of vagrants, begging and trying to scrape together some money to get something to eat.
The terrace where I am sitting is not full. I like watching people. An sich, man is an evolutionary marvel. The Museum Square I am looking at is lined with museums: the Stedelijk, the Van Gogh, the Moco and a little further…

Once you start buying beans from a speciality coffee roaster, there is no turning back. For some people the taste of speciality coffee is not like coffee and more like some aromatic tea. Some might not enjoy with this. Because the big coffee chains(hint: Starbucks) and supermarkets coded that burned taste into our tongues. They do this because they cannot sell as fresh as local roasters do and they have to sell the same consistent taste which is the burned coffee taste in this case.
(Originally posted on https://uludagcan.com/2023/01/13/speciality-coffee-in-amsterdam/)
But coffee can have multiple different flavors. There could be multiple factors that affects flavor of the beans such as where the bean grown, other plants around the coffee farm, drying methods and roasting processes. That’s why you can see different tasting notes on the packaging of a speciality coffee product. Which is something great. Losing all these with over roasting is a huge shame.
It’s not cheap. We should admit that. Coffee is an expensive commodity and getting expensive each year. Due to that we can see the reflection on the prices. If you compare a cup of filter coffee or latte price at a speciality coffee house with the big coffee chain, you can see it’s much more expensive at coffee roasters. Or if you compare 500g bag of coffee bean at a supermarket with the bag at roasters, again you can see the price differences. That comes from the quality and the effort that put into quality grown coffee. Those roasters cannot access coffee with cheap prices like big chains. Because of that they have to reflect it into prices. And the coffee farmers are the ones that suffer the most and earn the least in this equation. According to Moyee Coffee, 90% of the total coffee value disappears into the pockets of a handful of large multinationals, which we call Big Coffee. This means that the coffee farmers are left with only 10% of the value. It’s even worse, because there is nothing is added to this value– only 2% of that amount is actual profit. So if you consider all, it’s actually not that expensive.
Netherlands ruined the word “coffeeshop” for me. It is used to be one of my favorite word. “Going to coffeeshop”, “working from coffeeshop”, “getting a takeaway latte from a coffeeshop”. I was using the word excessively. But “coffeeshop” means “drug store” in the Netherlands. If you ask anyone on the road for the nearest coffeeshop, they will show you the place where you can smoke some weed and get high. So now it’s “coffee house”. Or with a bit more hipster way, “coffee roaster”. I’m getting used to it. If you are visiting Netherlands, especially Amsterdam and if your intention is not the drugs, keep that it in mind 😉
Amsterdam has a really good coffee scene. There are many good quality coffee roasters and coffee houses around. I think it’s one of the two best speciality coffee cities in Europe. The other one is definitely Berlin. During my last two years in the Netherlands I created a list of my favorite coffee houses and roasters. Of course these are not all of them. It’s impossible to list all but these are mostly the ones that I visited and bought coffee. The ones that I enjoy and suggest with wholeheartedly.
I’m a bit biased with Bocca to be honest. It’s my first coffee roaster that I met in Amsterdam and the first one that I buy coffee beans. Even before moving to the Netherlands I bought beans from them. But objectively, they are one of the top coffee roasters in Amsterdam. Coffee is great and their store has a great atmosphere in the heart of the Netherlands. They also have great workshops for people who wants to dive into coffee brewing or making latte art. I took one of them and it was a great experience. Bocca is also selling many coffee making equipments. Even some unique tools like GINA Smart Brewer.Location: https://goo.gl/maps/tuQaThyreSvg8scU8
Even though I haven’t sit and drunk coffee that much at the store, Lot61 is the roaster that I buy most of my beans for home brewing alongside with Bocca. I like the taste of roasting profile and also I found it the best value for money. Their regular blend coffee beans are perfect match for my daily filter coffee machine routine and espresso beans have rich, and bold taste.Location: https://goo.gl/maps/zSjNP1L5kDxkAgqd7
I cannot stress enough how much I like this place. They don’t have their own roasted beans as far as I know. Last time I checked beans were coming from Berlin. But this cafe has small, cozy and warm vibe. Located very close to my favorite street Haarlemmerdijk. With good coffee, nice desserts, foods and hipster people profile, it’s a lovely place. If you are around, definitely stop by Toki.Location: https://goo.gl/maps/8yfFc2qDWeH8vbWf7
Shining star of Bos en Lommerweg. This cafe was one minute walking distance away from my old house in Amsterdam. It was a great location for me to go and takeaway a coffee then walk in Westerpark. I always loved the vibe of FUKU. Nice cafe, good latte and tasty bites. And I know the name sounds like the F@$! word.Location: https://goo.gl/maps/EjcU18pEVL4hZ56V8
Another place where you can find good coffee at west. In between two beautiful parks of Amsterdam, Erasmus and Rembrandt park. I haven’t bought coffee online from them for a while but I was happy with the coffee when I do. What I also like is the cozy interior space.Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Xt7CKBn6xQZPiF1CA
I’ve been into the store where located in Weteringstraat. Although I don’t have strong opinions about the coffee at Back to Black, I liked the interior. Nice place to hang with friends. Take a cup of latte, eat a croissant, read your book and give some love to the cat that sleeps on the chair.Location: https://goo.gl/maps/a1LoUeBMcAknSyam7
Usually I search on maps before finding a new coffee roaster. But sometimes I just come across a cafe while walking on the streets of Amsterdam. Rum Baba is one of them. I was so happy when I find this roaster. Their colorful interior and delicious beans makes this place a great coffee house. There was not enough space to sit but since it’s located on beautiful Elandsgracht, it’s even better to take a cup coffee from there and walk in Amsterdam. I also recently learned that they have walk-in workshops. Keep following for new ones.Location: https://goo.gl/maps/B92xfJ3PSAYDQ81HA
Do you want Fika in Amsterdam? Then Scandinavian Embassy can be a right place for you. It has spacious and cozy interior. As you might imagine delicious Swedish desserts like cinnamon rolls and cakes. Combine it with coffee and relax. Location is also great. Near Sarphatipark and close to Albert Cuypmarkt.Location: https://goo.gl/maps/WmLKS5T6ZvTEWxvg8
This is another coffee house that I discovered randomly while riding my bike on the crazy traffic of bike lanes. Immediately loved the place. During my visit I enjoyed reading one of the Standart magazine on the shelf and drank my coffee. I remember that I liked the “pastel de nata” tart that they serve. Good coffee companion.Location: https://goo.gl/maps/G6zpFncywpMj8RWU9
Almost every month, there is a transaction on my bank account for coffee beans. It’s one of my fixed costs. Since it’s an expensive purchase, I look for the best value for my money. Along with coffee quality, the smooth online shop experience is also important for me. After trying multiple online stores, I decided on these four roasters for now. Bocca Coffee, Lot61, Wakuli, Manhattan Coffee Roasters. All have good online stores and delivery options. In terms of coffee, I can’t say one is way better than the other but if you want me to pick two favorites, Bocca Coffee and Manhattan Coffee Roasters are the best. But also the most expensive ones. So not every month I can buy from them. I usually distribute my purchases amongst all four of these stores. By the way, I need to mention that Manhattan Coffee Roasters is not from Amsterdam. They are based in Rotterdam. Even though this guide is about Amsterdam, I have to mentioned their excellent quality beans. They are only online store and no cafe to visit so it suits my online buying section. I strongly advise to try.
Among those four, Wakuli is a bit different. They have the best subscription model and best price to be honest. You can easily start your subscription based on your preferred frequency. Weekly, bi-weekly or monthly it’s up to you. If you have too much coffee at home, just skip next delivery. Or suddenly you ran out of coffee, then request for an emergency batch. And if you want to pause your delivery for a while, it’s very easy and convenient to do that. Beautiful online shop, smooth experience. And it combined with good coffee. I highly suggest if you are looking for a coffee subscription service that you can manage based on your budget and schedule.
Of course there are more coffee houses and roasters in Amsterdam. Also in other cities like Utrecht, Rotterdam or Den Haag in the Netherlands. But these are just the ones I experienced and suggest without any hesitation. Please let me know if you know other coffee roasters in the Netherlands. Maybe we can update the guide next year.

My journey as a human being.

“Are you driven by fear, or passion?”
August marks the first year since I moved to Amsterdam to begin a new chapter in both my life and career. Reflecting on this journey has brought a flood of complex emotions. Everything seemed to happen in a flash — what began as chaos has gradually settled into a rhythm. Now, having gone through the full cycle of ups and downs, I finally know what to expect, both in life and at work.
“Everything happens for a reason.”
I feel fortunate that, in June, a friend shared her experience with spiritual response therapy. After trying it myself, I noticed a significant shift in my energy, and more positive things began to flow into my life.
One of the first changes I noticed was at work, where I became more proactive and positive by making small adjustments in my approach.
While the typical practices — like meditation, reading, working out, and cold showers — have proven their value to many, myself included, I’ve found it essential to switch things up from time to time to keep things fresh and inspiring. So, here’s my updated morning routine
Beyond adjusting my routine, I’ve experienced a mental shift in how I approach work.
Work will never be done, but people and events come and go.
Inspired by one of my colleagues, I’ve started making an effort not to skip fun events when they appear on my calendar. Attending these has brought some wonderful moments, like being part of the biggest social event at my company.
“What are you afraid of? Don’t let your fear hold you back.”- one of my fav leaders said to me.
I now wanted to cry hahahah as I feel so lucky that I’ve met lots of incredible people that show me care and warmth and support.
Outside of work, I’ve also learned valuable lessons from personal relationships:
Hey, so, are you driven by fear or passion now?
Alrighty, a quick reflection.
If you are reading, applauses and comments can encourage me to share more my personal journey! :)

random stories of my life

I moved to Amsterdam two months ago. In the first weeks, I asked on twitter what meetup groups I should know in Amsterdam. I was mainly interested in tech, infrastructure, SRE, DevOps related topics. It got quite a few responses from the people in the area. I thought “why not collecting them in a blog post?”
Thanks to all who helped me to compose this list by responding to my tweet. Hope to meet you sometime in the future at one of the events!
This is a list in no particular order. It is basically in the order of the responses I got. I am sure you will find the ones you like. :)
Software Circus
There are ~4K people in the group. Only for Feb; I see three evenings planned already! From their about page:
We are a motley crew of dreamers who are unhealthily obsessed with consuming information and changing ourselves and those around us. We love software, tech and anything (from any discipline) that is going to change the world. Apart from our wider focus, we believe that meetups should be a lot of fun where laughing out loud and meeting new people is built in, not an opt-in extra.
Docker Randstad
A lot of people in the group again!
Learn, Collaborate & Dockerize! Meet other developers and ops engineers in your community that are using and learning about Docker. Docker is an open platform that helps you build, ship and run applications anytime and anywhere. Developers use Docker to modify code and to streamline application development, while operations gain support to quickly and flexibly respond to their changing needs. Docker ensures agility, portability and control for all your distributed apps.
Meetin’up at Picnic
Picnic is the company I work for. 🤓 It is an online supermarket who delivers groceries to your door in a sustainable way. Picnic has a meetup group that holds regular meetups in their office.
Interested in the latest technologies, sharing your passion for code, 👨‍💻👩‍💻 or just looking for some drinks, 🍺 food, 🍕 and good company? You’ve come to the right place! We host regular talks on all things programming with in-house speakers, in our offices, with our very own bar tap and kitchen. What else could you be asking for? 😉
Continuous Delivery Amsterdam
Looks like Amsterdam’s meetup groups are huge!
This Group will bring software people together to share ideas and experience in the domain of Continuous Delivery. Continuous Delivery addresses the entire software delivery pipeline — from CI to testing to deployment to release — and addresses technology, process and organization. Anything within that domain will be in scope for our Group.
DevOps Amsterdam
Of course, there is one DevOps meetup group in Amsterdam. Surely, I will join them soon!
Bringing together developers and operations people united in a common goal: destroy silos and remove obstacle to deploy and maintain awesome software and reliable infrastructures. Monitoring, continuous integration, packaging and automated deployment will all be covered. It’s going to be fun too!

Getting back to Amsterdam was not going to be easy. I had two options, A: spring for a $200 plane ticket or B: spend $0 on a 24-hour train ride. Amsterdam was to be my last hurrah, and I was going to have a proper blowout. I had about $1200 left, which may seem like a lot, but after doing the math, I was going to need every penny:
Hostel (4 nights): $80
Drugs (1/4 ounce Weed & edibles, 3 grams mushrooms): $120
Drinks (pay old tab?): $150-$200
Concert: $50
Plane Ticket: $300-$400
Food (Doner kebabs/Vending machine burgers): $50
80+120+200+50+400+50=900
1200–900=300
*No prostitutes
*No cocaine
120mg Adderall
- 4/10 (10mg upon arrival +10mg after dinner)
- 4/11 (10 @ 10am + 15 after dinner)
- 4/12 (10 @ 10am + 20 before concert)
- 4/13 (15 @ 10am + 15 after)
- 4/14 (20mg pre-plane)
I wasn’t snorting yet, but if I had been, the math would have been much more confusing.
If my calculations were correct, I was left with a $300 cushion. Blowing most of it on a plane ticket was out of the question so I braced myself for the inevitable and headed to the Madrid Puerta de Atocha Almundena Grandes Train Station. Honestly, what really mattered was I still had enough Adderall. Sure, I couldn’t take any on the train, but sometimes sacrifices must be made. Not exactly Sofie’s Choice, but I couldn’t remember the last time I had a full day of sobriety. It was not going to be easy.
The train began boarding just after 10am. I headed to my cabin and crashed immediately. By the time I woke up it was past midnight. I tried going back to sleep with the help of Tylenol PM, but it was too late. My body and mind had finally gotten too much rest. All I could do was lay there and wrestle with withdrawal in between bouts of relieving myself to shit water and vomit in the nearby bathroom. My stomach was demolished. Living on alcohol and speed for 5 weeks will do that to you. It wasn’t as bad as in Paris, but it was close.
I had far too much time to think, and that’s never good because all roads of thought lead me back to my dad. When you hate someone that much it’s hard not to think of them. After some angry sulking, I picked up a pen and wrote him a letter.
Dad,
If there’s a hell, I know you’re in it. I doubt there is though. Odds are you’re just rotting in your XL coffin, 6 feet below the ground, shrinking down to bone as you’re eaten by worms and maggots. That gives me comfort. If reincarnation is real, you will no doubt come back as a rat, or a shit-eating pig. The god I believe in wouldn’t allow you to treat a child the way you treated me and still prosper. I don’t care how shitty your parents were, or how bad your youth was, there’s no excuse.
I didn’t cry when you died. All my tears were used up. When people asked if I was sad, I told them the truth, that I was relieved. You lived much longer than you should have, much longer than I wanted you to. I anticipated your death for so many years that it was an emotional letdown when you died. I felt nothing.
I don’t believe anything you ever told me, not a single word. You left me with no wisdom, only anger, along with the bad habits required to suppress it. You gave me nothing besides the ability to spot sadness and pain in others. I can pick an abused person out of a lineup because of you. Some people may see it as a gift. They can have it. I don’t want it anymore.
I’m reminded of you every time I see someone stuffing their face, every time I smell pee on the street. I’m reminded of you when I look in the mirror, and when I write my last name. I want you out of my mind, out of my dreams, out of my DNA for good.
You know I quit comedy because of how fucked up I was? I was scared to be on the road because I feared what I’d do to myself. My two idols, Mitch Hedberg and Hunter Thompson, both died shortly after you. Hunter took his own life, and Mitch OD’d. I would have met a similar fate if I didn’t quit. I know it, and you should too. I’m a full-time drug addict/alcoholic bordering on an eating disorder. It’s hard to be with a woman or make friends because I don’t trust anyone. It’s even hard to masturbate because you’ve made me associate the act with such depravity. This is your legacy. I know someday I’ll be better, but it won’t be thanks to you. I’ll find my own strength. You can stop looking over me now.
Here’s one last tidbit before I sign off… The only thing I kept of yours was your death certificate. There are no pictures, no keepsakes, only proof that you’re finally fucking dead.
Your Son,
Sam
You’d think writing a letter like that would have given me solace, but it didn’t. I still felt like shit. As the sun was rising, I closed the window curtain to avoid the light. My roommates protested, and after I lost a vote 3–1, I had no choice. The curtain was staying open. So, I laid with a pillow over my face, cursing the world and feeling sorry for myself.
Near Rotterdam, about 4 hours from Amsterdam, my bunkmate shook my leg. I looked up, ready to kill him.
Me: What the fuck man?
Bunkmate: You should see this.
Me: I don’t want to.
Bunkmate: You need to.
Outside our cabin window were tulips, seemingly millions of them, more than the average person will see in a lifetime. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. The fields went for miles, like a never-ending rainbow had emerged from the soil, a colorful flipbook the likes of which I couldn’t have imagined. It was spectacular.
Was it, in fact, a message from God? That’s how I interpreted it. God was telling me to look up and get out of my head; to allow myself to enjoy the world’s vibrant colors. He was telling me that everything wasn’t black and white, no matter how hard I tried to make it so. There was happiness out there for me, I just needed to keep my head up and my senses open. The past may have been dark, but the future need not be. It was up to me.
I walked out of the train station with a “honey, I’m home” posture. It felt so good to be back in Amsterdam. The canals, the bikes, the smiles… Nothing had changed. The answer to the chicken/egg question from earlier, I learned, is… Amsterdam makes people better. Usually, it’s the people who make the city. In Amsterdam it’s the other way around. Being there is like drinking a joy serum. No matter the emotional state you arrive in, it will improve the moment you enter the city. If you enter as a 4, you’ll tick up to a 7. If you’re a 7, you’ll reach 10. Few cities, if any, can account for such a positive emotional bump.
For the first time, I knew exactly where my hostel was. Changing locations wasn’t even a consideration. Familiarity and reliability are everything, and that place had both. When I got there, the same guy was manning the front desk.
Me: Remember me?
Manager: Yes, sir. It’s great to have you back.
Me: Is the jackhammering done?
Manager: Yes, it is.
Me: 3 nights then. Cheapest room. If I hear a jackhammer I get a full refund. Deal?
Manager: Sir, there is no more jackhammering. Nor is there bartering.
Me: Deal or no deal?
Manager: Fine. Deal. Or you could just take me at my word.
Me: I’ve been on the road for 5 weeks; I’m done taking people at their word.
Naturally, my first stop was a coffee shop, and NOT the Bob Marley one. There was to be no experimenting this time around. So, to be safe, I got 1/8 ounce of each indica strain I felt best on during my previous stay: Strawberry Cough and Trainwreck. The Raekwon concert was in two days, so taking any chances with a new variety wouldn’t have been smart. God forbid I got a panic attack from some weird sativa strain. Not the time or place to be experimenting.
Weed in tow, I grabbed a cab. My old haunt was calling me.
“H. Murray’s Bar, please. It’s on Sint Olofspoort, right where it turns into Warmoesstraat.”
As soon as I opened the bar door, Neil shouted my name, and Lilly hopped to for scratches. Norman was sitting in the same seat, stinking of weed. It was like I’d returned after only going to the bathroom.
Neil: Sam, you look like shit.
Me: So do both of you. Lilly looks beautiful.
Norman: It’s good to have you back, friend. We knew you’d be back.
Me: How did you know?
Neil: You forgot to pay your tab.
I pulled out a few grams from my weed container and put them on the bar for Norman, along with $80 for Neil to cover my previous tab.
Neil: I was joking. Put that money back in your damn pocket.
Norman: The weed too.
Neil: You’re on the house tonight.
Norman: And I have 3 joints rolled.
Me: You generous bastards, you.
It didn’t take long before I was drunk and rolling on the ground with Lilly. If there’s a dog, I’m on the ground. It’s that simple. My memory of the night unfortunately stops there. I must have had a good time though, because I woke up on Norman’s couch, covered with a blanket, a puke bucket next to me. The bucket was not filled, thank goodness.
Norman: You were fucked up last night.
Me: Oh yeah?
Norman: You kept dropping your glass and lighting cigarettes in the bar. Those have always been my moves. And you wouldn’t shut up about that concert you’re going to, Raymond or whatever.
Me: Raekwon.
Norman: Yeah.
Me: Did I do anything else?
Norman: You tried to steal Lilly at the end of the night but that’s about it.
Me: Eh, not too bad.
After our goodbye, as I was on the way out the door, Norman came running over with a book in his hand.
Norman: You said Hunter was your favorite writer. You should have this. It’s Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail,1972. It’s his best work.
Me: I don’t know what to say…
Norman: No need to say anything. Safe travels, my friend.
I took a cab back to my hostel, feeling better than I should have. Sometimes having ten drinks with the right people can do that. It has something to do with the spiritual component of a hangover outweighing the physical and mental components.
There were still cold eggs and over-cooked sausages left over from breakfast, so I filled up while watching BBC Sports. Phil Mickelson had just won The Masters. I despised him and still do. That phony. It would have bothered me in the past, but sitting there, I didn’t care at all. My mind was on mushrooms.
I went to the same store and saw the same guy. He remembered me right away.
Manager: Dried Hawaiian right?
Me: How did you remember that?
Manager: When I took lunch, I saw you by the canal, waving at the boats. Looked like you were having a good time.
Me: You saw that?
Manager: Yeah, I ate my lunch right next to you. I was surprised you didn’t notice.
Me: Well, I’ll be damned. I’ll take 3 more grams.
Two grams were reserved for my final night, and I didn’t want to take any at the concert, as to avoid a meltdown, so I popped the extra one as soon as I left the store. A gram was enough for a fun, riskless high, and the perfect amount for a day soaking up sun in Vondelpark, the most visited park in Amsterdam and a mushroom-taker’s dream. Not as sprawling as Central Park, but just as welcoming, if not more, and stunningly gorgeous.
There were tons of people sprawled about all over the grass, but not so many where I couldn’t find an isolated nook for myself. Everyone was high on something. Or at least that’s the way it appeared to me. Maybe they were all completely sober and I was projecting. Yeah, it’s probably that. Either way, the vibes were tremendous.
When the mushrooms kicked in, I was laying in the grass, staring up at the clouds, aligned with the universe. I was in exactly the right place at the right time. I was proud of myself, something I hadn’t been for over a year. I’d navigated Western Europe all by myself (before smartphones) with nothing but wit, instincts, and Mapquest directions. I’d been a gentleman to Caroline, and everyone else I encountered for that matter, even that cunt Simon. And, I hadn’t gotten arrested or robbed. I was doing much better than I’d been giving myself credit for.
For the second part of the trip, I laid like a grass angel, listening to my iPod shuffle. A shuffle is great when you’re tripping because each song comes as a surprise you can hardly believe. Your sense of linear time is gone; your brain wants randomness. Plus, your favorite song may turn into your least favorite. You never know. On my trips, I just get in and tell the driver to drive. If you give him a destination, he’s only going to get lost anyway. Might as well let him take you wherever he wants. Sometimes you end up at a carnival, sometimes a funeral. That’s the fun of it.
When “Glaciers of Ice” came on, I knew that would be the defining song of my trip. There’s always one and you know it as soon as it comes on. The song opens with an interlude in which Ghostface, eloquently, talks about shoes.
Yo, I got a crazy idea how to do Clarks nowCheck it out, boom, this is how you freak ’em, boomYou go get, you go get the cream joints right? BoomNow now, all you, all you dye, is this shit right here, boomAnd this, you know what I’m sayin’? Any color you wantBut it’d be like, blue and cream, you know what I’m sayin’?Shit like that, niggas don’t even knowBut, son, word is bond, I’ma rock niggas this summer.
The lyrics gave me an epiphany. New shoes were exactly what I needed. It wasn’t even a thought before, but now, all of a sudden, they were a necessity. Suddenly my brown converse sitting only a few feet away in the shade looked like they were on their death bed, barely holding on for dear life. I’d considered their condition before, but never while hallucinating. Their pain and exhaustion were personified. Their glow was gone. After a long, honorable life, they were dying. No more poop accidents, no more torn laces, no more broken backs… It was time to rest.
After lacing them properly one last time, I gently held them in my hands for a eulogy. It was very much like the end of The Big Lebowski when Walter and the Dude spread Donnie’s ashes. “Shoes, you were a good pair of shoes. You loved the outdoors and exploring the streets of New York…” It was a sad moment, perhaps even sadder than my dad’s death, which made me wonder what would have happened if I were high on mushrooms at his deathbed. I was high on weed. Would I have cried, instead of just staring at him indifferently? Would I have comforted him instead of telling him how much hurt he caused me? There was too much hate in my heart to have any perspective at the time. Mushrooms would have removed that hate and allowed me to see clearly. Or I could have lost my mind and ran out of the hospital like a lunatic.
After putting on my slides, I neatly laced up the Converse and placed them in the sun for their final rest like they were fallen soldiers. It was time to find their successor.
Only the perfect pair would do, no discretion, no skimping. So, I set out on foot, still good and high, to scour the city for shoes stores and skate shops. I would have done a Google search but using electronics on mushrooms is near impossible. You get the ick from the whole experience.
For the first 30 minutes I didn’t make it far because I got distracted by a 4-person public urinal. We didn’t have those in America and that confused me. Are we more insecure about our dicks being seen? Would homeless people just end up shitting in them? Do politicians want our cities to smell like pee? Is there a benefit to that? All I had were questions. You stare at a urinal too long though, and people will start to think you’re a pervert, so I had to move on even though I would have been content to stand there all day fleshing out my theories.
You remember in Wayne’s World, the way Wayne looked at his dream guitar through the window of the store, the way he was hypnotized? “She must be mine, oh yes, she must be mine.” That’s exactly how I felt when I saw my shoes sitting on a display in the window of a skate shop. They were cream Nike Dunks, with brown and yellow stitching. At a glance, you could have mistaken them for chocolate covered bananas. I stood admiring them for so long the salesman came out to ask if I wanted to try them on.
Me: No need. Do you have a 10.5?
Salesman: Let me check. Would you like to come in?
Me: No, I like it out here.
He brought back my size, and I paid him in cash outside the store like we were exchanging money for contraband. Going in would have ruined my vibe. I was thriving under the sun. Like a bear discarding unwanted food from a garbage can, I tore the box open and tossed it. Slowly, I put them on, triggering an instant religious experience. Suddenly, I felt pious, like I’d just left confessional with a clean slate. They inspired hope. I’d always heard black people talk about the ecstasy of lacing up a pair of crispy new shoes, but I’d never experienced it myself, at least not since I was a kid. And never on mushrooms.
That night, to save money, I drank a pint of whiskey and wandered while coming down from my trip. My favorite sex worker was on my mind, so once I was good and drunk, I headed over there, like a murderer returning to the scene of the crime to experience the thrill again. I waved, but she didn’t recognize me. If she had, I may have had a choice to make. A line item can always be crossed out. The pimp surely would have recognized me, but I didn’t see him, thank goodness. Knowing me I probably would have said something like, “Sorry about the ass slap. I didn’t mean to cause any waves. Can you forgive me?” It was for the best that none of us crossed paths again.
I called it a night early, so I wouldn’t be too drunk when I booked my plane ticket. Lord knows I tend to fuck up seemingly simple tasks like buying anything online, even when I’m sober. I used the hostel computer to compare flight prices, before settling on an American Airlines Flight leaving in 3 days, at 5pm (17 hundred hours). It cost $320. Things were finally working out, so I decided to push my luck and search for a new hostel for my final night in Amsterdam. Mine had been nothing but reliable, but I needed something else, a place where I didn’t have to interact with anyone. I had plenty of notes to go through, along with memories to piece together, and I needed some place calm to do it.
One place, more than any other, caught my eye. It was an outdoor campground 20-minutes from the city center. From the pictures on their website, it looked like shit. It had trailers (like trailer park trailers) and no amenities other than a communal grill, a firepit, and some bathrooms. It was janky, but for some peace and quiet, it seemed like a fair trade. Not to mention it was cheaper than my current hostel. There were no bars to take my money either. Just me, a bottle of whiskey, mushrooms, weed and cigs. I had my supplies; it was time to go to work.
I slept in until almost noon the next morning so I could conserve both money and energy for the concert that night. It was the best sleep I got on the whole trip, perhaps because I slept with my shoes on the bed next to me. I read, drank coffee, smoked spliffs and people-watched for the entire afternoon. When I’d get overstimulated, I’d take a short walk along the canal then return to the coffee shop to put more stimulants in my body. I snacked on chocolate cookies and bananas (you see why the colorway appealed to me) while people came and went. They too reminded me of the tulips, with their pastel-colored outfits and quirky glasses. Everything matched because it clashed. That was the style, and really Amsterdam in a nutshell. They embraced differences.
The concert was at 8pm, but lubing up was essential, so I got to the Melkveg early to pound a few beers before heading to the venue. While drinking, I noticed a weed shop across the street. The concert wasn’t starting for another hour, so browsing was in order. My shirt pocket already contained a large joint, but you never know when you’ll need more. Inside, one item caught my eye. I inquired at the counter.
Me: What is a space cake?
Lady: It’s our strongest edible. Take just a bite at first. It can really knock you out.
Me: I’ll take one.
Ignoring her advice, I ate half of it. She must have had me confused with an amateur.
The venue was smaller than I expected. With it nearly empty, it felt more like a club than a concert hall. The DJ was intricately spinning Wu-Tang tracks to set the mood for the show, but he may as well have just plugged my iPod in; the set would have been no different. My joint was locked and loaded but smoking it right away wasn’t the move. Waiting for Rae to instruct me was. I found a comfortable place against the wall, just left of the stage, to watch the show away from the gaggle of rabid fans who wanted to rap along to every word and throw their hands in the air on command. The security guards were right next to me too, which, if nothing else, made it a safe spot in case things got hairy. I had it all scoped out to a T.
When Raekwon came out, everyone went fucking nuts, how they do. I can never bring myself to go nuts, no matter how excited I am. A hole in one would probably inspire a fist pump, but I can’t see myself going any further than that. “WooHoo” is just not in my vocab.
Raekwon: Hellooo, Amsterdam! Let me see you put your weed in the air!
I proudly held my joint up with everyone else.
Raekwon: Now light that shit!
We all did what he said, exhaling at the same time. It looked like a bomb had gone off the way the smoke billowed up towards the ceiling. Bonnaroo couldn’t compare. Aside from my breath being impeded, it was a beautiful moment, everyone connecting through the communal high, our energies aligned. We weren’t just smoking weed; we were basking in the freedom of being able to do so. Afterall, that’s why we were there.
After a few hits, the oversized joint fell out of my hands like the mug at the end of Usual Suspects. When I went to pick it up, I fumbled it again, along with my lighter. My hands were completely limp. The space cake had taken hold, and my motor skills were gone. Like a heroin addict fresh off a hit, I stood bent over, swinging my arms to gather my lost items. Then, my feet stopped working and I went into full DiCaprio Wolf of Wall Street-mode, clawing at the walls to prevent from falling. My vision was so blurred that Raekwon may as well have been Cedric The Entertainer. I would have had no clue. Even the music made no sense. High does not do it justice. I was in outer space. Laying down was my only option, so I found the closest speaker, climbed atop it, and went directly into fetal position. The vibrations were comforting the way bouncing on your mother’s knee was when you were a baby. I closed my eyes and drifted away.
When I woke up to a bouncer nudging me, the lights were on, and everyone was gone.
Bouncer: We tried to let you sleep as long as we could, but we have to close up now. Can I call you a car? Only in Amsterdam are the bouncers that nice.
Me: When did the show end?
Bouncer: About an hour ago.
The next morning, I checked out of the hostel and grabbed a cab to head to the trailer park. The drive was odd. It looked like we were driving through Nebraska. There were no more flowers, just fields of wild grass and dirt roads. I wondered just where the fuck we were going.
Me: Have you ever taken anyone to this hostel?
Cabbie: I didn’t even know there was anything out here.
There were hippies visible as soon as we pulled in, which made me uneasy. A group of 3 dudes, approached me as soon as I got out of the cab, all of them smelling like patchouli,
Guy: What’s up man? We we’re the only ones here. Come hang out. We’re playing (hacky) sack. Do you smoke weed?
Me: Obviously. We’re at a trailer park in Amsterdam.
Guy: Good point.
Me: Maybe later fellas. I’m going to chill in my trailer and relax.
Guy: Ok cool. We’ll see you later.
The trailer was nicer and larger than I expected. It even had a sink, which was ideal, because that meant I’d only have to leave the trailer to use the bathroom. The hippies were were across the way, on the other side of the bathrooms, so I had a whole section to myself. A solitary night was almost guaranteed.
I wanted to get into the mushrooms before the sun went down, so as soon as I familiarized myself with the surrounding area, I chewed up the remaining two grams and got right to it. There was a pond only a few hundred feet away, so I waited there for the action to begin. I submerged my feet in the cool water and watched the frogs hop around. The trip began as soon as the “ribbits” started to make me laugh. It’s an inherently funny sound, but at that moment it was goddamn hilarious. The sound was so fun, I started making it myself, trying to mimic them. When they ribbited back, I knew for certain I was one of them. I got down in their posture and did my best to hop around like them. If someone saw me, they no doubt would have called the police, or even animal control. I was out of my mind.
The laughter and lightheartedness came to an end when the sun went down, so I went back to my trailer to buckle up for the rest of the ride. That’s when the mushrooms kicked me in the dick. I’d taken the same amount as last time, but for whatever reason, I was 10 times as high.
Soon, everything turned red. It was like there was a red filter on my eyeballs. Even my skin looked red. I turned the sink on to splash water on my face, but it looked like blood was flowing from the faucet. Then, I looked up at the mirror. DO NOT make that mistake during a bad trip. During a good trip, maybe, but never during a bad one. It was fiery red, and my face was peeling off. Blood was dripping from my chin. And there was this awful sound ringing in my ears, like the kind you hear when someone presses the red emergency button at a nuclear power plant. My brain was in crisis. What I needed to do, I thought, was get naked.
As I was taking my pants off, it struck me that I was still wearing my sandals, not my new shoes. “What the fuck was I thinking!?”
As soon as I put them on, my vision went back to normal. The blaring alarm stopped. It was magic. To make sure I wasn’t losing my mind (I was absolutely losing my mind), I took them off again. Everything turned red. I put them on once more. No red.
Then, I heard a knock at the door.
“OH SHIT,” I whispered, putting my clothes on.
If you’ve ever taken hallucinogens, you know a knock at the door is the last thing you want to hear. The sound itself is paralyzing. Anything can be behind that door, and I mean ANYTHING. There are no limitations to what the brain can conjure.
Then, there was a second knock.
They weren’t going to give up, I could feel it in my bones. My fears were on the other side of that door, and I needed to face them. Most trips, in some way or another, are about facing your fears.
I walked over to the door and placed my hand on it to see if I could feel any weird vibrations. Nothing. Then I grabbed the knob and turned it slowly, hoping the monster had already left. He hadn’t. In front of me was a smiling, shirtless hippie with dreadlocks.
Guy: Sorry if I scared you, man. I’m Liam. I wanted to invite you to join the group. We’ve got a fire going and we’re just jamming out. It’s pretty chill.
Me: Ummmm…
Liam: Those shoes. They’re amazing.
Me: Yeah, they just saved my life.
Liam: How?
Me: It’s pointless to explain. I’m on mushrooms.
Liam: Nice. Me too. We all are.
Before I could tell him I didn’t do well in groups, Liam walked me over and started introducing me.
Liam: This is Sam. He’s really high. Be nice to him.
Guy 2: Sweet shoes. They look like chocolate covered bananas.
Me: Right?
We hung out for a few hours. While they jammed out, I just stared into the fire, listening to the crackling sounds and appreciating the lack of conversation. It brought me back to the University of Iowa, where we’d have bonfires a few times a week, and where I’d done mushrooms for the first time. It was a time before my mourning started, before the year of death began. I was a different person then, more childlike. I didn’t feel that way anymore. Scars were developing, I was becoming more callous. I’d always felt like an old soul, but now I was beginning to feel just plain old, or at least like an adult. I knew the trip would be my last blowout before having to go back to face my problems, and I’d just begun to feel it. Running was no longer an option if I wanted to grow, and I very much did. I just didn’t know how.

They say never quit chasing the dream!
After two years of effort, I finally could be part of the world’s largest gathering of employer branding professionals organised by Brett Mitchington’s Employer Branding College in Amsterdam (one of my favourite cities).
Employer and Talent Branding is ever-evolving, and the best way to learn is to connect with practitioners. After attending the conference yesterday, I could say this was worth investing time, money and effort. What a brilliant showcase of amazing case studies (no gyaan) of varied organisations and passionate EB professionals. Here’s a run-down on few of the key learnings I could share with you.
ASML Presentation: Collaboration is key
Nanci (Global Head of Employer Brand at ASML) shared the importance of collaboration in employer branding. While she sat in the comms function, she talked about her work with HR, business, internal comms and brand teams to be successful. Over 10k employees participated in the EVP process, and her key KPIs were brand strength/survey (Universum). She also showcased a good example of an internal career fair as a way to strengthen the brand internally.
Takeaways — 1) Collaboration 2) Measure against Key objective. 3) EB is a team play
Activision Blizzard Presentation: Get strategic yet creative
Activision Blizzard’s presentation took us back to building a solid EB vision. Alex and Briana spoke about aligning it for the leadership and business objectives to people strategy. Employee advocacy is all about education, community, resources and gamification. The team shared the breakdown of their content elements and urged the community to build insights around what kind of content works for which TG.
An awesome example of creativity — Activision put in an in-game recruitment advertising. Makes sense since a lot of their users may be target candidates. Smart!
Lego Presentation: Playful and Employee driven
Lego’s iconic brand still needed to build an employer brand targeted to the candidates. I loved their brand framework, which clarifies the overall brand strategy. Their EB team also creates various infographics/assets shared with the recruiters for candidate experience. Clicks from the Bricks program attracted user-generated content, which always attracts better engagement than corporate photos.
The crux for me was how aligned their employer brand was to the heart of what Lego stands for. Playful and fun! Kudos to Andrew and Sarah.
Indeed and Glassdoor: Well-Being Score
In the last few years, well-being has become integral to employee experience. Indeed has launched a new well-being score on employers’ profiles, which assigns the scores based on employee reviews regarding Happiness, Purpose, Satisfaction and Stress-free experience. It provides a clear view to candidates if the organisation priortizes well-being and employees resonate with the promise.

Kaufland Romania: Innovation and Differentiation in EB
Estera’s presentation was truly differentiated as she passionately discussed diversity, inclusion and equity as part of employer branding. Beyond having created an ACCESS program to hire differently-abled talent, they hosted a hackathon to create an app for their target audience. Using TikTok influencers, they created a campaign to communicate and engage people with hearing impairments. They also opened a supermarket in a world-famous GTA5 game to attract candidates in-game applications. Both of these garnished wow among the audience!
DanceTalk — https://cariere.kaufland.ro/diversitate/kaufland-dance-talk.html
Siemens Presentation: Joint ownership of EB
Stefanie from Siemens started her presentation by sharing a long legacy and broad business range Siemens works for. One of the unique things she mentioned was that EB is a joint function between comms and HR. Their EB content always gets much better engagement than business content, which shows the power of people’s content.
Impact Metrics — 2X time spent on the careers page. The content reached 3 million candidates.
Primark Presentation: Recruitment Marketing Unleashed
Steven and Neil shared some amazing examples of recruitment marketing done by Primark for retail roles. They have created unique job description pages and programmatic job ads for recruitment marketing. Neil also shared integrating employer branding across employee and candidate life cycles.
Mondelez Presentation: Mind the Gap of Internal Branding
Ted’s presentation of Mondelez was one of the stand-out talks for me. Not only was he engaging, straightforward and no-BS, but he also shared an underrated element of employer branding for retaining top talent. He shared a very simple and useful method of measuring EB impact aligned to the external and internal objectives that include social engagement, eNPS scores, hiring/attraction measures and engagement index.
This slide is gold!
Haleon Presentation: Human Experience and Branding
A spin-off from another pharmaceutical giant, starting with no name or purpose. It’s a human-driven story to build the entire organisation ground up by leveraging human expectations and experience and co-build the org with them. Rhian and the team involved their employees in building the Haleon experience by using surveys and postcards to the leaders and leveraging the passion of their own employees while building the brand.
Power of Partnership CPO and CMO
For long, it’s said that customer and talent are two different target audiences and needs, although this slide sums up why they are aligned in their expectations. It’s important that marketing and HR needs to align and treat them in equal measure. Simon shared this amazing insight.
How often do your CHRO and CMO talk?
Team LIDL: Candidate & Employee Surveys
Catherine and Antanio shared some nuggets about using candidate and employee surveys to build EVP pillars. They talked about measuring the perception vs reality and identifying gaps as part of EVP or Lidl VP. It’s an important step to find the balance between reality and inspiration.
EY Presentation: The Balancing Act
Matthew started the presentation by asking which shoes are we wearing. (Literally throwing the shoes as recruiters :D ). Recruiters need to stop self-congratulating themselves for things like hyper-personalized reach. Let’s keep it real. EY, with over 400k employees and 170 EB specialists, have worked hard to build business cases to expand its capabilities. Along with him, Farrah shared various tech initiatives across recruiting and employee life cycles. I am sure Matthew Jeffery’s passionate talk inspired many!
This is how EY leverages tech for talent.
EveryoneSocial: Prioritize Distribution
Cameron spoke about prioritising distribution over content creation. Thanks to the algorithms of big social media firms, distribution has become a big challenge. He shared an interesting case study of Amazon where, by using employee advocacy tools, they solved the distribution problem. He also mentioned that the organic reach is dead and we have to do targeted investing for distribution.
Two simple reasons: People engage with people. Networks prioritise people’s content over the brand.
Short Video for Employer Branding: TikTok Tom
Since the rise of short videos, showcasing work culture and office videos has become a #WorkTok trend. Many companies have chosen this tool for engagement and a fun way to show their culture. Tom talked about some examples of organisations letting employees use this medium to share their stories.
Click here to learn more about #WorkTok.
(P.S. The emCee made Tom famous by calling him TikTok Tom)
Employer Branding Leaders and capability-building
In the concluding remarks, Brett talked about the need for employer branding leaders to take ownership of creating capabilities and work with leaders to build strong business cases to make this a full-fledged business function. This is one of the most exciting professions in the world, and responsibility is now with the leaders in the room to transform.
Here’s the quick framework to build a strong EB function and impact the business.
Huge shoutout to Brett for bringing passionate employer brand professionals under one roof and showing his vision for this profession. Employer Branding is no longer a side hustle TA folks would do, but more organisations are realising the value of employer (talent) brand to the business. After all, if people are the most important asset to the business, attracting and retaining them needs conscious efforts beyond operational talent management and acquisition. Also, a shout-out to Andrea for helping me in the process. I met some amazing folks, and this is my learning content from the conference — a real ROI of the trip!
It was lovely to meet you Google Dave!
I sincerely hope that this community grows globally and in India as well. I took a small step to create an EB community in India with over 30 employer brand professionals nationwide. Our conversations give us a sense of belonging and learning and help us to connect/grow together. This profession needs more leadership support beyond a nice-to-have IC person doing everything. If you are an employer branding professional in India, do get in touch with me.
Asta-la-vista #WorldEBDay! Bedankt!
(P.S) Some bonus fun nuggets from the conference where participants had a ball :D

Vuejs Amsterdam conference was amazing with over 1100 frontend developers and a screen of 180 degrees. It was amazing. The food was incredible, never seen such good catering at an event. They were very long days from 8:50 till 18:30 with 2 breaks of a half hour and a lunch break of an hour and a half. 12 talks per day. Very intense but very cool
The first day was all things frontend so not just Vue.js.
The future of JavaScript bundlers — Johannes Ewald — webpack core team
This was a great talk on what the future will be like and will we need things like webpack to make sure we can write code the right way and bundle it together. The browsers of course are not ready for this and that is why webpack is so necessary but in the future webpack’s purpose will be different.
New Features of Webpack 5 — Sean T. Larkin — webpack core team
Sean talked about the changes we are going to see in webpack 5 and how it is going to be really boring as they are doing so much behind the scenes that we will not notice much changes but our build times will be much faster.
Elegance of Movement with reactive Angular Animations — Elena Gancheva
This was a nice talk on animations using angular and what not to do so as things come across as natural movements.
You don’t know Microfrontends — Luca Mezzalira & Max Gallo
Interesting talk on breaking things down to create micro frontends.
Angular and Webcomponents — Ana Cidre and Sherry List
This was a really interesting talk on angular web components that just left everyone thinking oh my god angular why do you make things so complicated. It’s incredible at how many people dislike angular because it’s just complicated for no reason at all. Still it was a good talk. I think it would put anyone off trying to choose angular over Vue.
Transforming your Web Application into a PWA — Why and How? — Gijs Weterings
This was a great and interesting talk on service workers and Progressive web apps which is something that is super important right now especially since google added it to the google store and it now has full browser support but it was good to see how easy it is to setup and how the notifications work and that you can only ask the user once to install it on their home screen so you have to time that properly. PWA’s are interesting for the right project but are for sure worth looking into.
The Fresh Jest of Bel-Air — Rick Hanlon
This was a great talk on testing with Jest. Jest has come a long way since we started testing it out a year ago. Now I would for sure choose it over Jasmine, Mocha or Chai. Rick showed us some really cool things you can do with it to make your tests cleaner and for sure we should all be doing testing even though most people aren’t as it takes time. Writing tests means less bugs later on. Also when people learn to write tests they think of things from a different point of view so it’s always good to have a team working with tests.
Rest, GraphQL & gRPC — David den Toom
This was a great talk on graphQL. I love graphQL and would be so great to work with it. It basically just gives you back what you need from the JSON as opposed to giving you the full JSON like in Rest. It’s just nice. Perhaps we shall work with it in the future.
What is new with Gatsby.js — Kyle Mathews
This was an interesting talk on Gatsby by the creator of Gatsby and seeing how much it has improved. He has done a great job and it’s pretty cool but it’s for react based apps so something I won’t be using but good to know how it works etc.
What its like to be a full time open source maintainer — Evan You — Creator of Vue
This was interesting to see what Evan’s life is like as an open source maintainer, how he explains to his family that he gives his work away for free and then people donate money to him so he keeps working on it. Also he talked about how it just happened and then decided to give up his full time job to maintain Vue.js full time.
Automated Scaffolding with Schematics (Angular) — Natalia Venditto
This talk left everyone thinking ‘Seriously angular is there no better way?’ It was a good talk on schematics and I can see it’s use case on certain projects so that you set up everything once and then install it so that all projects have the same folder setup and global styles etc but it is a lot of work and something I would really have to test out and play around with before going ahead and using it. Good but complicated but then again that’s Angular for you.
Day 2 — Vue conference
State of the Vuenion — Evan You — creator of Vue
This was a great talk on the future of Vue and what is being done to make it better. It was also good to see the statics. 700,000 weekly active users, 3.3 million downloads a month on NPM and 461 million hits a month on jsDelivr CDN. Evan also talked about web components in Vue and how the CLI supports building as native Web Components.
Hot Vue — Guillaume CHAU — Vue.js core team member
This talk was a last minute add in as Sara Drasner was ill and couldn’t make it. It was a great talk on differences between server side rendering, single page applications and static pages and the benefits and differences between them all.
Vue.js for L’oreal, a case study- Tim Benniks
This was an incredible talk on how L’oreal are using Vue across all their brands. Their aim is that all brand websites will be on the same platform, will have the same technology stack and will adhere to the same KPI’s. L’oreal Paris has 60 markets which all need localisations. They deal with RTL, non-latin fonts, different KPI’s, different 3rd party integrations and local market adaptations. L’oreal Paris — no-js version, SEO, mobile first, progressively enhanced, async/lazy, fast. And to do all this they use Vue component files, vue devtools, vuex, vue-cli, cli-plugin-unit-jest, vue-test-utils, webpack wrapped by vue-cli-service, webpack-chain for configuration of site core helix structure, aslant — configured by vue-cli. Why Vue? Because it is simple to use.
NativeScript-Vue + ML = The Great MiniBar Challenge: MixoLogy — Jen Looper
This talk was really good fun from making cocktails to creating an app with nativeScript Vue and was interesting to see how easy it is to do.
GraphQL + Apollo + Vue.js = Magic — Sara Vieira
Great talk on GraphQL with Apollo and Vue. Really love GraphQL and how easy it is to query. For sure one day we will be doing stuff with graphQL.
Media for everyone — how to make your Vue Apps accessible for all users — Maya Shavin
Great talk on accessibility and how to make your apps more accessible. She showed us how we can use axe-core as a chrome extension to test our sites for accessibility with guidelines of how we can fix things. Also NoCoffee Simulator to test contrasts for people with vision problems.
Desktop Applications with Vue — Natalia Tepluhina — CTO at Vue Vixens
Interesting talk on how to build desktop applications using Vue. Not something I see us doing any time soon but good to know it’s possible with Vue instead of just ionic.
Designing Components in Vue —Damian Dulisz — Vue core team member
Great talk on Vue components, how you shouldn’t build them and how you should especially using slots and named slots. It was nice to see the contrast with how easy it is to create clean components and some great examples of slot uses.
Latest news on Vue Vixens
This was a mini talk on how vue vixens has grown ove the year. An initiative to try to get more women into programming by creating workshops etc
Latest news on CodeSandbox — Ives van Hoorne — Creator of CodeSandbox
This was a mini talk on what is happening next in CodeSandbox a tool for sharing code created by a 22 year old so he could share code with colleagues when he was working remote. It’s now a very successful project used by millions of people including me. Now he is working on it full-time with an amazing team to make it even better. He is amazing.
Full Stack Vue in the Era of Serverless Computing — Nader Dabit — Developer Advocate at Amazon Web Service
This was a really cool talk on how you can deploy to Amazon using aws-amplify and how you don’t even need any backend developers because you don’t need any servers. Really really cool.
Phenomenal design patterns in Vue using Vuex with Spiders — Jacob Schatz
This was a really cool talk on how to create your forms by building a form builder component kinda like creating your own form components that can be reused with different variations.
Day 3 — Vue
How to craft a Vue CLI Plugin — Guillaume CHAU — Vue Core Team
This was a great talk on how to create a plugin in Vue. Would be cool to do it one day and Guillaume showed us how it is actually quite simple to do.
Static Site Generation is Awesome — Alex Kyriakidis and Rolf Haug Vue School
This was a great talk on when you should use static pages instead of a single page application as it is easier to index and crawl and how hidden and visible content is available on initial render. They also talked about asyncData which runs before loading the page component and how to use the generate property to generate dynamic routes.
Everything’s a plugin: Understanding webpack from the inside out —Sean T. Larkin — webpack core team member
Sean did a great talk on webpack plugins and how weback is built from plugins, how it builds the graph and how a module gets to the browser with webpack. Really in depth behind the webpack scenes kinda stuff but very interesting.
Make your Vue apps Lighter by being lazy — Eduardo San Martin Morote — vue core team
This was a really cool talk where Eduardo explained what tree shaking was — dead code elimination and how webpack works to eliminate this dead code and how in general to make your apps lighter by lazy loading your routes for example or prefetching certain components.
Empowering Vue with TypeScript, Inversify, Vuex and some other super tools. — Quique Fdez. Guerra
This was a great talk by Quique and he really knows his stuff by I have no intentions of using typescript in Vue right now. Who knows in the future but for now I love Vue’s simplicity and adding typescript is just not necessary. Backend developers need types as it is what they are used to and I can see the reasons behind it but am not sure if we all need to be going down that road. But he also talked about Nuxt and universal Vue applications and how they work. Also he gave us some great tips such as making small components, use linting, use conventions for names, doing tests, continuously improving your code and being ready to change everything.
Introduction to Nuxt.js — Nuxt explained Visually — Gregg Pollack — Founder of Vue Mastery
Great talk by Greg on how Nuxt works. I pretty much had already done this course and as I am creating a talk on Nuxt I knew all about this but was good to see how others were not so familiar and also good to know that I am doing everything right.
Nuxt.js 2019 — Don’t miss the NEWS! — Sebastian Chopin — Creator of Nuxt
I had already had a sneak preview to what was coming up in Nuxt from my chat the previous night but was good to hear again and what was impressive was to see the companies that are trusting Nuxt, Adobe, Microsoft, Gitlab, Groupon, Yahoo, Lacoste, Fox News and many many more big companies.
Next Level Jest Testing with Vue.js — Roman Kuba
A great talk on testing with just in Vue with some great examples of testing async. Would love to have the time to deep dive into this and write more tests with jest.
Accessibility with Vue.js — Callum Macrae — Author of VueJS up and running
Great talk by Callum on accessibility by showing us what it was like for a blind person to use the web and how we can improve this and test things by using screen readers to see for ourselves. It really shows how important things like alt tags are or using the correct html semantics like a <button> for a button instead of an <input> or <a> tag for example.
Visualisations using SVG, Canvas, and WebGL in Vue — Chris Fritz — Vue core team
Really cool talk on using svgs and when you should be using them and what they can do and why you shouldn’t be using CSS for something that an SVG can be used for.
I think I have managed to cover everything that happened during the 3 days in Amsterdam. It was action packed and my highlight was getting to hang out with all the amazing speakers and personally meet Evan You, such an amazing person and so friendly too. It was worth every penny and I will for sure be back at Vuejs Amsterdam and Frontend Developer Love next year.

"Where Cities Erase, Fields Remember: Through the Amsterdam Exhibition of Anselm Kiefer",https://medium.com/@mariia.e.shevchenko/where-cities-erase-fields-remember-through-the-amsterdam-exhibition-of-anselm-kiefer-c7e463814079,"Sign up

In the rhythm of constant travel, I briefly left Amsterdam before a trip to Madrid. I set aside a few hours for my first in-person encounter with the works of Anselm Kiefer, made possible by a joint exhibition of two neighboring Amsterdam institutions—the Van Gogh Museum and the Stedelijk Museum.
Until this moment, my acquaintance with his work had been limited to the screen of a laptop.
The space of the first hall instantly strikes you with its monumentality. You feel tiny before this boundless field, which seems to swallow your presence. Walking through the large exhibition halls, step by step, you find yourself amidst endless landscapes that are frightening in their existential emptiness, deep and inconsolable loneliness. These images are materialized by tons of paint mixed with dried grasses, plants, and rusty metal.
The field becomes the leitmotif of his work — solitary, marked by bitterness, a place where the most complex collisions unfold; it is more a silent symbol of collective memory than just a landscape. I know well what such a field is, its frosty breath rising from the ground, dry and at the same time waterlogged leaves, suffering from constant temperature changes, snow, rain, and wind. In its original essence, it does not carry the promise of spring or rebirth, only a feeling of cold and dampness.
It is such a field that appears as one of the main images in Larisa Shepitko’s film “The Ascent” (1977). Her field is a space of suffering and separation. In Shepitko’s work, the field acts more as a backdrop for testing the human spirit, where the characters face specific moral dilemmas in the extreme situation of war. Their suffering has a more individual and existential character in a direct sense. In Kiefer’s work, however, the field is the very embodiment of memory of collective trauma. This is no longer so much about an individual test, but about the burden of history that lies on the shoulders of an entire nation.
The absence of a distant horizon disorients you, creating a sense of immediate presence before this field of emptiness, fear, and human suffering, allowing you to feel this cold. It is incredible to imagine how many secrets and tragedies the field has concealed throughout human history. Since the Neolithic Revolution, it has been both salvation and grave for billions of people. Human flesh not only fertilized the soil for future generations, ensuring their survival, but also became an integral part of this cycle of life and death.
Yellow color is undoubtedly a symbol of farewell, organically woven into the structure of overripe sunflowers that crumble, losing their seeds. Thus manifests not only a farewell to the past but also a premonition of an unknown future, where even in a post-apocalyptic landscape, a spark of hope flickers. Overripe sunflowers also symbolize the inner illness of memory, its fading and inevitable decay, before a new grain of memory can sprout.
Instead, the elements covered in gold look like the last threads of hope for a transition to rebirth and salvation, a kind of reflection of the transcendent in this harsh landscape.
The juxtaposition of Van Gogh and Kiefer in one context and one exhibition space is a bold and, in my opinion, provocative decision. Without a doubt, Anselm Kiefer in his work referred to the legacy of Vincent Van Gogh, perhaps even tracing his paths, however, this does not always justify their unification within the same exhibition space, since their artistic worlds unfold on completely different planes. While Anselm Kiefer is undoubtedly an interesting artist, to place his work alongside that of Vincent Van Gogh, in my view, suggests a curatorial misstep. The ambition of Kiefer is evident in his monumental scale and engagement with weighty themes, but to equate this with the deeply personal and revolutionary vision of Van Gogh feels misguided. Despite this questionable pairing, my focus here remains on exploring the compelling symbolism of the field within Kiefer’s specific artistic language.
Van Gogh’s field reflects an inner world charged with anxiety, the looming presence of a storm, and a profound emotional weight. In contrast, Kiefer’s field is empty, post-apocalyptic; it is a sublimation of the collective unconscious, the result of its traumatic processing by history.
In contrast to Van Gogh’s living, full of an inner struggle, Kiefer’s field seems frozen in time, as if etching a monument to a collective catastrophe. This contrast is particularly acutely felt against the backdrop of cities, where paved and built-up cities erase individual memory not only through the physical destruction of the old and the construction of the new, but also through the imposition of new narratives that overshadow personal stories. Through the constant regeneration of generations, they layer memories one upon another, accumulating them in a single space where the individual often dissolves into the collective, becoming both everything and nothing. Instead, the field, in its visible emptiness, retains the potential for individual experience of memory. The absence of imposed structures allows one to feel the past on a deeper, almost intuitive level. Where in its emptiness one can see and feel the presence of the past: hear the voices that have disappeared, recall lost things, catch barely perceptible smells. It retains the memory of all, preserves it in its boundlessness, and carries this endless sadness in its silent depth, without imposing specific interpretations.

“‘Beautiful’, chorused Adhiraj and Bhumika shortly after returning from their respective trips.
While Adhiraj is still in a trance of the magnificent BMWs and Porsches that gallantly rode on the streets of Amsterdam, Bhumika couldn’t stop crooning over the fact that city’s Live and Let Live attitude. Meanwhile, Snigdha was thinking hard on how to describe Amsterdam in a single word. “Freedom”, she finally declared stating that Amsterdam was the best thing that had ever happened to her. She maintains that it’s a free city in the literal sense, as people’s expressions are continuously ‘on the display’ be it in the form of wall graffiti, street plays or in in the way they tie their hair or wear their clothes and that no one judges anyone no matter what they do.
Bhumika and Snigdha were part of the Photography Trip to Amsterdam and Hamburg while Adhiraj was part of the Visual Arts and Theatre trip to Amsterdam and Berlin. And it seems like all three of them have come back with a suitcase of precious memories to share with us.
“In front of the Van Gogh Museum was this IAmsterdam thing…Climbing on that and taking pictures was very, very fun…and memorable too…’cuz there were these street musicians all around and me and my best friend Yaosh, took a lot of videos of those guys! I can still feel the energy around me, with the air soaked in music, the world felt so light and amazing!”, Adhiraj recalls his ‘ fondest takeaway’ from the trip.
Super-excited Bhumika couldn’t wait to share a funny experience that she re-lived for us with fondness and a lot of laughter too. “On the street photography assignment, as it was very windy, my friend’s tripod flew and fell on a lady almost dropping her cup of coffee! Unfortunate, it was, but we just couldn’t keep from laughing. The scene was so damn funny. And this annoyed a passerby more who started yelling at us. Poor Michiel (the Culture Fox leader for The Netherlands) was trying to stop us, but we just couldn’t contain ourselves; the laugh was so involuntary and so unhinged.”
On hearing this Snigdha wondered out loud how funny everything must have seemed to a third person viewing it all from the outside, “On the whole, it seemed like Carmen (CoFounder of Culture Fox and also the trip leader) was the shepherd struggling hard to direct her crazy heard of sheep who were intrigued and highly distracted by the ambiance of Amsterdam! …Oh such a beautiful place it is!!”
A lot of things about Amsterdam just freaked out these young travelers, in a good way though. Bagpipers, couples wearing pokemon suits along the streets, the fact that the place had more cycles than people itself, the fearless and flamboyant birds ruling the skies, the mystic canals and the shoulder-to-shoulder standing buildings! And despite that fact that Holland had lost a soccer match, they were all busy celebrating!
“Traveling is in itself an art and I loved being ‘in the moment’ at all times”, Bhumika blazoned out loud. “While other trips make touristy destinations, Culture Fox kept it art-focused. And I discovered the place through art, through photography! I enjoyed the offbeat venues. Mainstream venues would have resulted in mainstream pictures. The trip locations were simply perfect!” And saying so she gets lost back in time, “Oh how much I miss those long winding roads and those long walks…”
Yes! Quite evident as it is, these people had a heaven of a time in Amsterdam.
Apart from the funny moments strewn all across the memories of the trip, Adhiraj shared a slightly different experience, “it was our free time and we were out there shopping when a lady approached me for some cash. She said she will provide me with its change. I gave her 50 euros but she gave me back 35 and ran away. Such a thing had never happened to me before and yes, the situation did send chills down my spine. Definitely makes me more responsible and aware of my surroundings”
To this Snigdha and Bhumika said that they found the locals quite warm and nice, very steadfast to life as well and a tad bit selfish too. But the fact that they were dedicated to what they had to do, won over the girls.
What about food?
Snigdha says that she could hear bakeries all around Amsterdam screaming to her to feast up. The macaroons lover enjoyed a lovely culinary experience. And the city came with a little learning for her here too, “Harder breads are better unlike in India where softer breads are preferred”. Bhumika thinks food shouldn’t be given much priority as the place has a lot more to offer than just food although her personal favorite was the Ethiopian cuisine she got to experience; while Burger boy Adhiraj found food good throughout.
“Before taking the trip, I was under the illusion that I knew a lot about photography. But certainly, that wasn’t even a slightest bit true. I learnt a lot of things…about the many advanced modes available in the camera, about panning, and the new styles of photography…and there is so much more that I need to learn!” Bhumika blurted out, while Snigdha loved the youthful exuberance and zeal of the photographer Kasper Fugslang, “I liked the fact that he gave the students the autonomy of experimenting and learning photography themselves. He did not constrain them like other professionals would have. This helped me gain a lot of confidence.” Brimming with energy and all ready to put her skills to action, she is determined to take part in the Fotogram photography contest happening next year!
Meanwhile for the artist in Adhiraj; the most exciting part of the trip was the Spray Painting Workshop where he learned about a lot of new cool approach to painting. He painted a wonderful caricature of Mickey and said,” it took a lot of time for me to make it, but it was all worth it and I enjoyed myself thoroughly while making it!” He is all set to revamp his room and spray-paint the walls, and his ever so supportive parents are much to eager for him to do so as well.
Speaking of the Culture Fox Leaders, Adhiraj describes them as being his friends, cannot stop raving about the dressing sense of Nikhil. Bhumika found Michiel very intelligent and opines that he knows Amsterdam inside-out and that the group loved listening to his stories intertwined with walking the streets of Amsterdam! Snigdha loved Carmen and Marie. “I really miss you guys”, she states with a teary eyed look on her face!
The trip really brought to life a side of them they never knew existed. Snigdha says she has now become a confident traveler in terms of traveling alone.
That’s a sneak peek into Amsterdam through the lenses of a Culture Fox trip. If you would like to be on one such trip yourself …
What are you waiting for? Winter is coming!

I revisited Amsterdam this past week and spent Easter Weekend, along with countless Spaniards, Italians and Germans, in the early spring sun. Last time I was in Amsterdam was in June of 2008 and I went alone for a conference. This time I went with my wife and we lived in a delicious and charming apartment in the Oud West, on Douwess Dekkerstraat, owned by the artist Patty Schilder.
[caption id=”attachment_222"" align=”alignleft” width=”300"" caption=”Oud West Apartment — looking toward Farmers Market”]
[/caption]
From our balcony, looking out over the Buurtcentrum De Havelaar, we gazed at the Baarsjesweg Canal, especially beautiful in the evening when the sun sets and the large barges slowly make their way up and down after a long day’s work. Two blocks away, in the early morning, the farmers market gathers steam. Here, the true ethnic diversity of the Oud West comes alive — Middle Eastern women in their hejabs argue prices with their favorite vendors, breads and cheeses abound, fish and meats, too. The color and smells and sounds are soothing, seductive. There is no excuse here for not eating right. The food is fresh, beautiful. The difficulty is in buying only what you need, something the Dutch are very good at doing, it seems.
[caption id=”attachment_223"" align=”aligncenter” width=”300"" caption=”Oud West Apartment looking toward canal”]
[/caption]
The difference between this trip and my last one is the bicycle. The only real way to experience this culture is on the bike. Though a modern tool, the bike is the heart of Amsterdam. Many consider Amsterdam “the biking capital of Europe.” Amsterdam bikers have the right of way, not pedestrians. The flow and energy of this city is dependent upon how well the biking moves the energy along. The Dutch are great bikers, they weave in and out of crowds, move effortlessly through traffic, grinning or smiling and never (apparently) frustrated. This is Amsterdam. I’ve seen youngsters txting and biking, talking on cells, with passengers, children, sometimes two, one in the rear, the other up front. Much of Amsterdam’s life happens on the bike.
[caption id=”attachment_224"" align=”alignleft” width=”300"" caption=”Biking in the north”]
[/caption]
We rented our bikes from Bike City. The added bonus being that the only hint that this is a rental is written in small, elegant print on the black carry bag on the handlebars: Bike City. Otherwise, the bikes were like all others. Most rental bikes are loud reds or yellows and have huge insignias. Would you want to call attention to yourself like that? We didn’t. We found the best bikes to rent are the 3 speeds with hand brakes. They’re comfortable and sturdy. Our first trek took us through the city, to the ferry landing behind Amsterdam Centraal Railway Station, and up through the farmland of the north country all they way to Slot Ilpenstein. We biked through pasture land, in and out of canals. Sheep nearby. The famous Frisian horses, too. And we managed a glimpse of some drafts.
[caption id=”attachment_225"" align=”aligncenter” width=”300"" caption=”I Am Amsterdam”]
[/caption]
From that day on, we rode everywhere, including another “out of the city” day trip to Haarlem, a municipality and a city in the Netherlands, and also the capital of the province of North Holland, the northern half of Holland. The bicycle lends for a particular order to things, a graciousness and decorum we like to call civilized or civilization. It’s interesting because if one examines the history of the Netherlands, we see that this living has come at great human cost. Many fell to the strength and power of the mighty Dutch will. The rise of the Dutch Empire is extensive and dramatic. Out of this, comes Amsterdam, an important port city and center of commerce. What we see in Amsterdam today is a result of this history so as we ride through the city and sit comfortably in cafes adjoining canals, we have to weigh the awesome power that began somewhere around the 1540s and that conquered so much. To the victor belongs the spoils is quite evident in Amsterdam. These spoils are Amsterdam’s gift to humanity. But these spoils also bare an awesome responsibility that Amsterdam’s inhabitants are trying to understand. The story is complex.
Perhaps this is why we can describe Amsterdam as an incredibly important human experiment that’s ongoing. And just maybe, this is why the moral structure of this great little city is experimenting with an unbound secularism founded on an unprecedented egalitarianism, which, in turn, depends upon freedoms of expression and a tolerance for difference. But this is the idealized version, the romantic view. It’s not surprising, then, that when the world is exhausted by the constant chimes of terror, from the Netherlands explodes the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy. It’s also the place where Theo Van Gogh, the great-grandson of Theo van Gogh, the brother of painter Vincent van Gogh, was murdered by Mohammed Bouyeri, a Muslim extremist, after van Gogh, with collaboration from Ayaan Hirsi Ali, released the Anti-Islam film Submission.
[caption id=”attachment_226"" align=”aligncenter” width=”300"" caption=”Middle Eastern Women in the Oud West, after shopping”]
[/caption]
Amsterdam is not without controversy. It is an extraordinary diverse place; however, diversity brings contention, even among the most enlightened. When differences are thrust together, the potential for an explosion is always present. Before 1965, the Netherlands were totally a monoculture — all white Dutch and no threats. This changed with a very liberal immigration policy. Effectively, the society is now segregated. On the streets, we can see the diversity, but where it counts — schools, neighborhoods, business and so on, we don’t see it. There is resentment that what Dutch culture was is no longer — this is true. The monoculture safety net has been taken away. Now the struggle is different, particularly on religious grounds where the Christian and the Muslim, along with the Jew, have to live side-by-side in a society that is increasingly secular. What is Amsterdam turning into? What is it becoming?
I wonder whether Amsterdam today is the “new” Al Andaluz? It has the makings. Why not, why can it not be the “new” place where the three central religions, Christians, Muslims and Jews, live in relative peace and harmony? Only now we are called upon to protect the Muslim, not the other way around as it was when the Muslim protected the ahl al-dhimma (the people under protection). Maybe the tides have turned, though the challenges and the conflicts are as they were in the period between 711 and 1492. What we don’t want is the devastation and the destruction brought about by the Christian King in 1492 — in the name of God and love! Al Andaluz was a beacon of learning, and the city of Córdoba became one of the leading cultural and economic centers in both the Mediterranean basin and the Islamic world. Why can this not be the fate of the Netherlands, Amsterdam leading the way?
The Amsterdam I see today is in transition, in flux, pained by both its past and its future. But it’s how it negotiates its day-to-day where the mystery and awe exist. The seeds of tolerance are there — a young Muslim woman on a bike or a Vespa waiting for a light to change and waiting next to her is a tall Dutch blond, also on her bike, and they look at one another and smile. This is the new Amsterdam.
So perhaps the Dutch are such great bikers because they have been learning to negotiate obstacles all along. Whether by conquering territories for their wealth during the time of the Burghers or changing from a monoculture to an ethnically diverse culture, they have been challenging boundaries — national, ethnic and tribal, as well as economic and educational. Amsterdam could be the first small city that will evolve — or not — according to how well it enables those who reside in the margins of life to exist without threat; where once there was a singular uninterrupted culture, as is evident in the architecture and the museums, now there are only threads that are struggling to keep humanity together. And holding these threads are exiles. Amsterdam is a perfect example of a city of exiles, of histories that come from colonization, and newer ones that come along because they have been following the great human migration for survival, for subsistence.
[caption id=”attachment_227"" align=”alignleft” width=”300"" caption=”Bikes, Canals, and their Bridges — the web”]
[/caption]
The Amsterdam of tomorrow will be built on the shoulders of mindfulness and tolerance. And if successful, Amsterdam, as Al Andaluz before it, will hold a noble place in the continuum of great histories that have given humanity, even if for a moment, a ray of hope that we can live together and relish in our differences.

They wander into my dreams − now and again: Mario and Rita, head honchos of the Rodos Bar. Holding court, twenty-five-years ago, when I lived the life of a hobo in old Amsterdam. Mario, slightly unhinged in the nicest possible way, was Greek to his toenails. He was blessed with a mop of silver-greying hair and a scraggly beard that touched his barrelled chest as he shuffled about barking at his patrons. He used to make his way from the back room into the bar with gifts of food for one or two emaciated looking regulars. ‘YAMOS, comrade,’ he’d growl. And plonk a dish of Greek grub on to your lap, ‘Mario say EAT!’ A gift from the gods. Diamond geezer.
Time-warped and frazzled, Mario was an exiled maverick; forever paranoid about the long arm of the Greek Generals − always in his chair, early evening − monitoring. ‘Mario say OK’ ‘Mario’s happy now, ERRRR!’ ‘Mario say sit.’ A kind and generous man; no mistaking that. His old jukebox blasted out rebellious Cretan Rizitika folk songs and Horeftika dance tunes, as well as Frank Zappa, Joni Mitchell and Thin Lizzy numbers. We’d all scream along to Zappa’s ‘Bobby Brown’: ‘I can take about an hour on the tower of power/As long as I get a little golden shower.’ Mario allowed punters to put their own records on the machine if the Greek stuff stayed put. Priceless. What a place! Shebeen heaven …
It was more of a home than a pub to many. Buskers and musicians could store their gear in the back room: Mario’s domain. And they’d invariably drink their daily takings with Mario and Rita late in the afternoon till the early hours of the following morning. ‘Mario says OK!’ Bliss.
Cult writer Denis Johnson would’ve eaten his heart out to have supped in a place as cool as the Rodos Bar − I’m damned sure of that: vagabonds; grifters; whores; ex-whores; wastrels; artists; seamen; travellers; alcoholics; washed up deadheads; Amsterdammers; eccentrics; lost tourists, as well as an astrologer or two! All nations graced its dingy, dark, worn, wooden womb; all were royally nourished. A grubby brass bell hung down from one end of the bar. Once or twice a month, it was pulled with vigour, till it dinged and dinged and dinged. Then an almighty thirsty roar resounded through the place. That sound signified a free drink for everyone. One could only speculate what lucky touch precipitated such an action: A big welfare cheque, perhaps, dropped on someone’s doormat; a successful drug enterprise that came up trumps; a win on the lottery or horses; an artistic advance; someone about to leave Amsterdam for good; birthdays, christenings and the likes. Anything! I’ll never forget the sheer joy when that bell chimed, though. Righteous, bro, righteous, as they say nowadays.
Rita was an Amsterdammer and maintained matronly order in all things pertaining to the bar. Hazy demarcation lines, though: Amsterdam style. She had coded scraps of paper concerning bar tabs strewn all over the place. Only she seemed to be able to decipher who owed what, at any given time. In other words, it was organised chaos as regulars had to be reminded what they’d consumed or who they’d bought drinks for the night before. A lot of booze crossed that bar and there were always scrambled heads trying to get to grips with their tab.
Of course, Rita’s feral cat had right of way across the span of the bar: through bottles of Grolsch, vases of flowers, lit candles and tobacco paraphernalia it strutted. The banter and nonsensical exchanges hushed when the cat threaded its way past the bar’s animated throng. Rita epitomized the old saying: ‘how to stay sane in an insane world?’ She’d sit back on her high stool and take it all in; cool as a cucumber. She dished out reprimands, now and again, to the odd cantankerous drunkard. ‘Stay quiet or go!’ was usually enough. And a background grunt from Mario seemed to cement it. The place was precious to a lot of people. You don’t shit on your own doorstep, do you? That seemed to be the philosophical viewpoint of the Rodos Bar’s clientele, during that era.
On Rita’s birthday the bar resembled a flower market: roses, lilies, sunflower and wildflower bouquets abounded. Vase after vase of flowers lined the bar and tables. Lit candles adorned shelves and nooks. The Rodos Bar would be packed. Session on! A great show of love for her; people used to drop in all night to wish her well. Always a cracking night!
The wrecking ball and gentrification killed the Rodos Bar in 1997. Most of the people alluded to here are now dead including Mario and Rita, God rest their souls.
Thank you Rodos Bar for some of the best nights of my life!

We all know the power that being in and around nature has on us and the power of nature within us. We are nature, therefore we are at one with nature when we are amongst it. You cannot fight it. Nature and the natural world are our home and we, as humans, innately crave it. The biophilia hypothesis suggests that our intuitive longing to exist in and around greenery and living things is in contrast to the way we live as twenty first century humans — which is typically sedentary and indoors. Rekindling a deep relationship with nature makes us feel emotionally, physically and socially more together, more connected, better functioning. If you need evidence to back this up, I have tons of it as a practising organisational psychologist, but more and more I’m realising that you don’t need the hard evidence — simply stepping outdoors, hearing the birds, feeling the rain or rays of sunshine on your skin, being sheltered by a tree, watching that rogue squirrel finding today’s feast. That’s it.
I am coming up to a decade of immersion into the world of biophilia and well-being at work, and was therefore delighted to be invited, along with colleagues from St Monica Trust, to visit health care providers in the Netherlands, where they are already established in embracing the principles of biophilia, sustainable buildings and green health-care. Our northern European cousins have a reputation for leading in health care, social equity, workplace well-being, and other factors, compared to the UK. Think the Buurtzorg approach to health care in the Netherlands, the rise of the four day working week across Europe, Sweden’s Fika time, and Finland topping the 2024 happiness countries index. So, when I was invited along to join the group, I jumped at the opportunity.
So there I was, Monday morning, having leaped across the north sea from Blighty, sitting in a care home meeting room in Amsterdam with a small group comprising our CEO, CFO, two Trustees (a GP and Housing Exec), our Head of Sales and our care home Architect (an external consultant and fellow Cardiffian). If the individuals in this group knew about greenwashing before, the message was fully reinforced on this trip, if they hadn’t known, then the message was heard loud and clear. That’s what I like about the Dutch, straight to the point — and no beating around the bush (so to speak).
The architects we met talked about dynamic lighting that matches circadian rhythms. They introduced us (me at least) to the idea of ‘solar eis’, which is a heating and cooling energy system based on ice. We learned that gas is now forbidden in the Netherlands and that heat pumps, ground source and insulation are well used. Our 21st century British brains were encouraged to get our heads around a water system using brown water — it may take some persuading but it is truly recycling water — and using our wee for fertiliser. I was particularly struck when one architect said that the “goal is to be net positive — not less bad, but really good”. We were told about and shown images of tiny houses built like Lego blocks in different styles and units — all self sufficient. We heard about mycelium walls that you can eat from and how simply planting trees can support drainage and help keep our increasingly hot and noisy cities cooler and quieter by absorption. Ultimately the message regarding the buildings was about going back to how we used to live and work — working with nature and not against it.
From psychological, social and physical well-being perspectives, a number of speakers talked about studies on biophilia and the benefits of connection to nature in relation to rehabilitation and care. Us advocates of biophilia already know about Attention Restoration Theory and how connection with nature builds our cognitive capacity and has untold well-being benefits. Additional learning was in how to design a successful nature based intervention in health care, core factors were adaptability; accessibility; balanced design; wildness and variety; appeal; safety; and privacy. It is essential to collaborate with all stakeholders and users — what do people want to see in their green spaces?
We visited stunning gardens and land which were occupied by ancient trees, well-kept gardens, aviaries (mixed reactions), goats, sheep, chickens, rabbits and cows (not all together!). We gained an insight into the Dutch approach to risk — choice is key and always the decision of the resident and their families, but essentially the messages are — do not be afraid of steps; do not rely on automation — for example, let people open windows and doors as they wish; use different types of outdoor ground surfaces and textures for ‘real world’ variation and always view the world through the residents’ eyes. Note the wheelchair friendly benches, outdoor activities and varied walkways. From another perspective we learned how automation and technology are revolutionising access to and provision of care, medical interventions and social needs.
From a workplace perspective, there seemed to be a lot of staff. And there’s clearly a ‘thing’ about groups of staff taking lunch together. That is very much not a UK care scenario and I’d love to learn more about their working cultures for carers.
We took away so many learning points from our Netherlands trip — particularly from a buildings and sustainability perspective. What a fantastic opportunity. My colleagues and I also took away a feeling of genuine pride in what we already do well at St Monica Trust in embracing nature for resident wellness — for example the incredibly well-kept parkland with ancient trees, rooftop gardens, scented garden, indoor/outdoor shelters and space, and horticultural activities for residents. We always have more to do of course. And from an employee perspective, I personally took away a further drive to encourage, role model and give permission to spend time in and around nature during the working day — for well-being, for social connections, for interest, for moments of mindfulness and noticing. These are all essential bits of being alive and being human.
A few days after our trip, back into business as usual at work, one of my fellow Amsterdam trip colleagues messaged me to say Sharon Blackie was talking in Bristol — did I fancy it? Did I heck?!! Sharon Blackie writes beautifully about mythology and fairy tales and how they relate to our lives today. She draws upon the human connection (and particularly women’s connection) with the natural world, the seasons, the landscapes. I am fairly new to her writing and I find her books mesmerising and nurturing.
On a stormy splashy dark mid-week night, in the stunning setting of the Mount Without, a recently and compassionately restored church sitting opposite the hospital on a hill, we soaked up the ethereal tones of Sharon Blackie urging us to embrace life’s natural changes through aging, and to notice our own personal evolutions. It’s important to have the hard evidence for well-being interventions, but to remember that the stories and others’ experiences and simply noticing matter just as much.
“Connection isn’t about nature in our service, a slave to our needs, a commodity for our use, a sticking-plaster for our stresses. Nature isn’t there to provide us with therapy; that isn’t what connection is about. Connection is about love. Enchantment. Wonder. And a necessary and appropriate sense of awe.”
Sharon Blackie

March, 2006
Two nights in London was enough for me. I knew my money would go further elsewhere, plus the Michael Jackson music was haunting me. I must have heard Billy Jean once an hour while there. So, I decided to take the Stena Line ferry from London to Amsterdam, based on the recommendation of Jill, the girl I’d been making out with and rubbing up on the night before. The ferry wasn’t included in my Eurorail package, but for $30 it seemed well worth the price to travel in comfort. When I boarded the ferry, I was struck by how mall-like the vessel was.
There were movie theaters, restaurants, bars, even shopping… There may have been a casino, but I could just be adding that in my mind because the place felt like one. After scoping out the ship, I found myself a comfortable leather chair near the bar and plopped myself down, removing Atlas Shrugged from my bag along with a 10mg Adderall from my pocket.
I swallowed it without water, just as the waiter was approaching. Then, I ordered a Guinness, my daytime drink of choice at the time. By the time he came back it, I was enthralled in the book again. For the next five hours, I barely moved, save to flip a page or order another Guinness. I was lost in the world of the book. “Should I have sex with a prostitute tonight?” “Can you really buy mushrooms in stores there?” “Is this the best weed I’ll ever smoke?” The thoughts that had been running through my mind earlier now seemed like scattered roaches exposed to light. All I cared about now was Dagny Taggert. She is the main character in Atlas Shrugged. People now associate that book with right wing ideology, but I had a different reading of it.
Adderall had that effect on me. I always liked reading and found it easy to get into the world of a book, but on Adderall, it’s like I was IN THE BOOK, especially with this one. I’d light cigs and forget about them, leaving a trail of ashes that I’d discover a half hour later. Then I’d light another, take a drag, and get lost in the book again. I was devouring it, or maybe it was devouring me.
The ferry dropped us off at the Amsterdam Centraal train station at 2pm, amidst the perfect spring day. The sun was beaming down, and everyone seemed to be happy. It’s like the chicken and the egg thing… Are people happy because they’re in Amsterdam, or do happy people just gravitate to the place, making it so? Is that like the chicken and the egg?
My hostel was only a few blocks away, smart planning done from London the day prior, so I set course for there to check in and drop off my bag. I intended on getting higher than I’d ever been and I didn’t want to lug around a large travel bag.
The first thing that struck me on my 3-block walk was how preposterous Amsterdam’s street names are. Brouwersgracht, Princeneiland, Amsterveenseweg… I assume they made them ridiculous so people are encouraged to giggle while they walk around, because that was the effect it had on me. “Do not get lost here.” I told myself, imagining the hilarity that would ensue if I had to, God forbid, try to pronounce these names in front of a local.
There were “coffee shops” everywhere, some appearing to be more coffee-centric, and others more weed-centric. They all served coffee though, and everyone seemed to have a cup. I smelled a few people smoking what smelled like spliffs, weed mixed with tobacco, but that was it. In fact, I remember noting that I smelled more tobacco than weed on that first walk, for what that’s worth.
I chose a small hostel that advertised itself as a “quiet getaway” type, a far cry from the Flying Pig Hostel, which most people traveling around my age would have wanted to stay at. All the comradery stuff was not my bag. The last thing I wanted was to get hooked up with a group of people that I’d have to accommodate even for an evening. If I met a friend, fine. But that group think nonsense… no thanks. And no, I didn’t want to go to the Van Gough Museum. And I definitely didn’t want to see Anne Frank’s house. Granted, there was a weed café inside of the Flying Pig. But my hostel was laid back, and I needed that more than anything. Plus, there was a free breakfast, so I was sold.
When I checked in, the receptionist apologized for the construction that would be taking place from 9am to 5pm every day.
“I don’t think that’ll be an issue. I plan on being out and about during the days.”
“Perfect. Thank you for understanding.”
When I got up to my room, I realized what he’d meant. Right outside of our small, 2-bunk room, there was a man with a jackhammer, absolutely blasting away. The noise was so loud I could barely think.
“I’m Sam!” I screamed at the top of my lungs to a 30-something guy laying on the bottom bunk.
“I’m Eric! You mind the top bunk?” He screamed back.
“NO!”.
I removed my coat and threw it on the top bunk.
“See you later!” I yelled, closing the door, wondering what the hell would possess Eric to spend another second in that room.
I went and checked my bag into a locker, removing the essentials and placing them into a smaller backpack (Adderall, Ipod, water, Atlas Shrugged, notebook, pen, and a banana). I’d still only slept about 4 hours in the last 3 days, but my adrenaline was still kicking and I felt relatively good. A new city has a way of doing that to you.
The mission now, was weed, and it was an easy mission at that. I exited the hostel, took a right, and just started walking. I went in the first café that I saw. Ironically, it was called Coffee Shop Bob Marley. The brand is global, I guess. I was greeted by an old budtender who looked like Willy Nelson, all the way down to the bandana. He handed me a Trapper Keeper-style three ring binder. In it were plastic pages with little slots for what I assumed where supposed to be baseball cards. Instead, each quadrant contained a gram or so of weed, along with a short description that offered insight into what the high would feel like (e.g., purple haze: mellow, euphoric). It was the first time I’d seen such a set up and I was blown away. Though I’d smoked weed daily for 5 years, I’d never encountered such a selection, or even dreamed of it for that matter. Remember when Thurgood and the gang break into the weed room at the laboratory in Half Baked? I wanted to hump the air like he did in that scene. I played it cool though and selected 3 strains, all indica leaning, my favorite. I paid Willie 60 Euros for the 10.5 gram purchase, a good deal anywhere in the world at that time.
“May I light up in here?”
“Of course. The smoking room is in the back.”
I thanked him and walked around to the back, which was just a small curtained off area with a few high-top tables. Bob Marley music videos played on television that hung on the wall. It was silly, but it would do.
I put my bag on the table and removed a grape White Owl cigar that I purchased in London for just this reason. At the time I was still smoking blunts and wanted to represent my own culture while in Europe. What I didn’t give thought to, was the fact that I had barely smoked for the last 2 weeks while in New York. And, though I smoked a hash spliff the previous night in London, the quality was not the best. Drug tolerance must always be considered. Remember that. Unfortunately my hubris prevailed, and I proceeded to roll a 2.5-gram monster of Afghan Kush.
There were two other people in the room with me, a couple who both appeared to be in their 30’s. They were smoking out of a pipe and laughing. When I dumped the guts out of the blunt into a garbage bin near the wall they began staring in my direction. They didn’t say anything, but I could tell they were interested in what I was constructing. “Maybe it’s the first time they’ve seen a blunt being rolled. Put on a nice show for them,” I told myself, proud of my talent.
After licking the blunt closed, I sparked my lighter and ran the flame along the wrapper to dry it out. Then I lit it, taking a deep drag and coughing slightly. The couple, again, glanced my way. I looked in their direction, smiled, and kept smoking, trying to stare at the television as to not make them uncomfortable.
I got about halfway through the blunt, when it really hit me. Suddenly, I was overcome with dizziness, something I’d never experienced from smoking weed before. I was sweating too. The couple was getting concerned. I could tell they wanted to say something, they just weren’t sure if it was their place to do so. I mean, I must know what I’m doing, right? You don’t just roll a blunt like this if you’ve never smoked weed before.
My equilibrium was gone and now I was gripping the small, circular table like we were engaged in a Greco Roman wrestling match. I knew I had to say something.
“My name is Sam. I’m from America. If I die, my mom’s number is in my bag,” I blurted out, before falling off my stool and passing out.
When I came to, Bob Marley’s I Shot The Sheriff was playing on the tv. The couple was now hovering over me, looking like they’d just seen the most disturbing scene of their lives. Their highs were ruined. All our highs were ruined, even Willie’s. Even he was now in the back room, worried about me. I didn’t even know how long I’d been out.
“We were scared, man. Glad you’re ok. We don’t even allow cigars in here,” Willy said.
“So much for representing,” I thought to myself. I grabbed the remainer of the blunt, wrapping it in a bar napkin and placing it in my pocket. I apologized and left, knowing I’d rather be dead than show my face in that establishment again.
“My name is Sam. I’m from America…?” I was so ashamed of myself. Obviously, they assumed I was from America. Only an American would go to another country and insist on putting their culture on display like that. “From now on,” I told myself, “We go with the current, not against it.”
By this time, it was almost 8pm and my exhaustion was catching up with me. With my tail between my legs, I headed back to the hostel for some much-needed rest. On my way back though, I passed what looked to be the weirdest food establishment I’d ever seen. It reminded me of the Gray’s Papaya hot dog shops in New York, in that there was no seating inside, but this place took it a step further. There was nothing at all inside of this place. Yet, it smelled like fast food. I didn’t really eat fast food, but this was too weird to not investigate.
When I went in, I was struck by the feeling that I was inside a vending machine. The walls were lined with rows and rows of slots, where hot food was kept. There must have been a kitchen in the back where the food was prepared, but I couldn’t see one, nor could I hear one. All I could see was the hand of one of the employees replenishing the stock after an item was purchased, kind of the way you see a hand replenishing milk at the grocery store. “What a genius idea,” I thought to myself. “Make the store itself a vending machine.” Maybe I was just still really high, or delirious from passing out, but I felt like I had stumbled upon the Pyramids. This idea must have really planted itself in my brain because I opened a take-and-go food establishment only 7 years later.
I put my credit card in and pressed the cheeseburger button twice. The slot unlocked and I removed my burgers, which were still delightfully warm. I went over to a bench and enjoyed them while watching a few kids play tag.
“Do they know about the prostitutes?” I thought to myself, realizing we were right around the corner from the Red-Light District. “Probably.”
I awoke from a much-needed night of sleep at 9:30am, just in time to get some free breakfast. After getting my plate of fruit and toast I found a seat near the television that played the BBC news on a loop and made myself at home. I loathed the American news, but the BBC version didn’t strike me as being too salacious. It was almost pleasant to watch, and it made me feel like an adult.
I knew exactly where my next destination was: The Smart Shop. That’s what they called the Mushroom Store, the most apropos of names. It was only a few blocks away and opened 10am. I could see that it was drizzling outside, but that wasn’t going to change my plans. I was going to trip, it had been written.
I’d done mushrooms a handful of times before, with experiences ranging from spiritual bliss to utter terrified madness, but I’d always learn something about myself in the process, and that was the most important part. Doing them alone wasn’t an issue for me either, I preferred it.
When I entered the store, I was greeted by the kind of guy you’d think would be running a psychedelic mushroom store; long hair, flannel shirt, with monk vibes.
“Hello friend. How may I help you?” He asked me, gently.
“Can you please advise me on which mushrooms I should take, and how much of them I should take?”
“Of course. That is exactly what I am here for. Have you done psilocybin before?”
“Yes, maybe 10 times.”
“Ok, well, let me walk you through what we have.”
He took me over to a glass case with about 10 varieties of mushrooms, some wet, some dry, all of them unique in shape and color. He walked me through their different levels in potency and their array of effects.
“How about something in the medium-strength level?” I asked.
“Sure. Would you like to see visuals?”
“Yes, please.”
“I suggest 1 to 2 grams of the High Hawaiian variety, dried.”
“That sounds good to me.”
I paid the man, about 10 Euros and exited the Smartshop with my mushrooms. Then, I walked over to the canal and found an unoccupied bench. It was drizzling but the perfect amount, almost a mist. I pulled a banana out of my bag that I’d saved from my free hostel breakfast, along with a bottle of water. I took the mushrooms out and inspected them.
“Lord, please look after me during this trip” I said, downing the entire 2 grams and chasing it with a bite of banana.
Once I had the mushrooms down and the nausea passed, I sat back and opened Atlas Shrugged, sinking back into the world on the pages. I read until the words no longer looked like words, maybe 30 minutes. That’s when the laughing started. Here I was, sitting alone, staring into a canal, laughing hysterically at nothing at all. It’s Amsterdam, so people probably had a sense of what was going on, but I didn’t care about anything in that moment.
Then, it happened. I saw a tourist boat approaching slowly in the canal. There were 20 or so passengers on the small boat, and nearly all of them looked to be of Asian descent. They looked so happy, and I was overcome with the urge to connect with them. I stood up and waved my arms as they passed.
“Helllloooooo!!! Welcome!!!”
They waved back jubilantly.
I was in hysterics now, laughing and crying like a maniac, waving and yelling.
Then it passed.
“Holy shit, that was fun.” I thought. “I wonder if there are more of those.”
I sat, waiting patiently, looking around the bend for the next one, letting my mind drift like ripples in the water below.
I almost exploded with excitement when I saw another boat coming around the bend 15 minutes later. Again, it was carrying Asian tourists. And again, I welcomed them with air kisses and waves.
“Welcome friends!! We welcome you to Amsterdam!! Enjoy your stay!!”
“Thank you!!” They waved back.
At this point the rain had increased to a light downpour. I was soaked, shoes and all. But I had more tourists to welcome, so I stayed at my post, laughing crazily in the rain, welcoming travelers to a country that was not mine.
I did that for 2 entire hours. 8 boats-worth of people were greeted by me that day. There’s no other way to explain it; the drugs turned me into a volunteer civil servant for a country that I’d only been in for two days.
My feet started to prune around 2pm so I ended my shift. I grabbed my bag, which too was soaked, and headed back to the hostel to dry off and relax during my comedown. When I got to my room, I was delighted to find no one else in there to ruin my high. What I forgot about though, was the Jackhammering. outside my window.
The drugs were making my ears even more sensitive to the sound, causing the sound to seem even more comically loud than it had previously, which was already INSANELY loud. I didn’t want to leave though. So, I changed clothes and laid down in my bed. The sound was so loud all I could do was laugh. I laid there, laugh-crying at the ridiculousness of the situation.
“Mushrooms… You did it again.”
I woke up to rain the next day. My tentative plan had been to go to Vondelpark, the largest park in Amsterdam, and one of the most spectacular in the world. It was one of the few sights I wanted to see while there, but I was unwilling to spend another day soaking wet, so I thought against it. Instead, I’d decided to spend the day bouncing around from coffee shop to coffee shop, smoking and mingling. This time around, I wanted to roll spliffs to avoid another embarrassing scene, and to stick with my plan of going with the current. I was smoking Parliament regulars because for some reason Parliament Lights weren’t sold in Europe at the time. You’d think the two would be similar in flavor, but the Regulars were awful. Mixing it with weed, I thought, would be a great way to mask the flavor.
After purchasing a few grams in a random shop, I settled into a small booth and began dumping the guts of my cigarettes out onto the table. Then, I broke down the weed into a more workable state, before mixing the two together in a 1:1 ratio. It took me about 30 minutes, but by the time I was done I had rolled myself 12 spliffs, certainly enough for the day. Pleased with myself, I lit one up and smoked it while enjoying a coffee and Biscoff sidecar. I put the rest back into my pack.
Everyone in the cafe seemed so elegant to me. No one was wearing suits or formal attire, but they all dressed so thoughtfully. Their clothes featured bright, fun colors, and so did their umbrellas, which sat in a small receptacle near the door. They all looked unique. There didn’t seem to be a style of the time either, rather, they all appeared timeless. No one was overweight either, something I’d always taken note of, given that my father was extremely obese before he died. Most people read the paper, some typed away on computers. I did a little reading from my book but mainly people-watched. It was a delightful afternoon.
Afterwards, I wondered around for a bit amidst the drizzle before stopping to eat a herring sandwich at a little cart overlooking the canal. It made me think of my Bubbie, who’d long passed. She loved herring and would always try to get me to eat it when I was little. I hated it then but had now grown to love it. And this version, with just pickled fish and onions, was pleasing both my belly and my heart.
After finishing my meal, I went in my pocket for another 10mg Adderall for dessert. Fully recharged, I decided it was time to find a bar. Not just a bar for the evening, but one I could call home in future visits. I still had a month left in my trip and I knew I’d be back. Bars were that important to me. I can’t just go anywhere, willy nilly. I need a home base, where I feel comfortable.
I walked for a bit before finding myself at the intersection of Nieuwebrugsteeg and Warmoesstraat, right where Warmoesstraat turns into Sint Olofspoort. I’m not joking. I looked up and saw the most perfect bar I’d ever seen in my entire life. The sign under the awning read: H. Murray’s Bar. Next to it was another smaller sign that read “Anno 1619”. There was also the obligatory Heineken Bier sign adorning the doorway, which was situated at the right angle formed by the intersection of the aforementioned streets.
The location made it seem so discrete. It also felt more like an old house than a bar. Even from the outside it looked and felt like I was peering into a someone’s living room.
Upon entering, I knew I’d found my spot. The bartender greeted me as soon as I walked in.
“Hello friend. Welcome.”
There was a golden retriever laying calmly near the bar that barely noticed my presence.
“Hello. I’m Sam.”
“I’m Neil, and that’s Lilly,” he said, introducing me to the pup. “And that’s Norman,” he said, pointing to the only other man in the bar.
“Hello gentlemen”.
“Pull up a seat,” responded Norman, welcoming me.
“Don’t mind if I do. Guinness please.”
We got to talking and time got to flying, the way it does when you’re in a good bar, surrounded by good people. Norman told me about his time in Berkley, how he knew Tim Leary, Tom Wolffe and the Merry Pranksters, characters that I’d only known from books like The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test. He was a well-traveled man who knew how to tell a story. I wish I remembered more of them, but the whiskey came out after a few beers and wiped my memory clean. That’s how it goes. Sometimes you sacrifice memory for fun. I’ve always found that to be a fair trade.
My last memory of the night was when Norman pulled out about an ounce of loose weed from his pants pocket, handing me no less than a quarter of it.
“I knew I smelled something,” I said cheekily.
“Try this. I grow it. You’ll love it.”
I don’t even know how I got back to my hostel that night, but I made it home safely. I must’ve walked, but I have no recollection of it whatsoever.
When I woke up the next morning, I felt like death. I checked my pocket and found a decent amount of money. “Did Neil even charge me?” I wondered.
Before I could spend any more time contemplating the prior night’s conclusion, the jackhammering started. This time I was not finding any humor in the situation. I reached in my bag and grabbed an Adderall pill from the interior compartment. After showering as quickly as I could, I changed, and headed out, still wobbly.
I went down to saw there was still time to get some breakfast. I was starving, and I knew once the Adderall kicked in that I wouldn’t be hungry for hours, so I took advantage. I had a full plate of pastries and fruit, making sure to stock up on carbs for the day. I watched the BBC news as I ate, and it just so happened they were showing highlights from the NCAA Men’s March Madness tournament, something I certainly would have been keen on in years passed. Now though, it felt like insignificant news from a distant land.
After finishing my breakfast, I headed out to do some wandering. I hit a few bookstores, but mainly I just walked, soaking up the surroundings and chain smoking the spliffs I’d rolled the day prior. I had more than enough weed, but I still stopped in cafes to see their product line. Each store was unique and I just couldn’t get enough of being inside of stores that sold weed. I live in California now and the novelty still hasn’t worn off.
As night rolled around, I found myself in a bar, drinking Irish Whiskey, not my usual. I don’t know exactly where I was, but I do know it was right by the Red Light District. THAT I’M SURE OF.
As I got drunker my loneliness began transforming into horny rage. When my erection grew, I knew the decision was being made for me. It was time to experience the Amsterdam sex worker scene.

Written by Craig BerryCreative Intern at VBAT
Last week, thanks to VBAT I was given an entry pass and the opportunity to attend the 2016 Packaging Innovations convention and the Dieline Conference in Zaandam at the Taets Arts & Event Park.
The journey from Amsterdam Centraal to Zaandam was quick and as soon as I stepped out of the station I was in awe of the city’s architecture. Straight away you see the Hotel Inntel Zaandam — which literally looks like a Christmas Disney attraction. Its outer façade is a bunch of traditional Dutch houses in blue and green cladding, piled up on one another for 12 storeys. Reading up more about the design of the building I found out it is by WAM — a Delft based group who say it wasn’t designed to be shocking and they feel that it fits in place in Zaandam because “it uses the architectural language of Zaanstad’. Although this building wasn’t part of the visit to the Packaging Innovations convention it was impossible not to be amazed by it as a non-native.
At the convention I received my pass (which looked official and made me feel official) and started wandering around the exhibits.
It was hard to pinpoint and be exceptionally amazed at any one particular exhibit at first as most of the stuff that was being shown across the convention was somewhat similar in its look and also the way it was being described as i.e. ‘Some new cardboard’, ‘a new bag design’, ‘a new method of sealing containers’ etc.
But once I stopped at the more design related booths it was a lot more interesting.
A really good part was the BNO NEXTpack booth where the products being displayed where much more exciting. Instead of just presenting a new material compound, here were products that actually used some of these new materials and ideas in a real-world application.
The main ones that stood out firstly on their immediate visual impact but later on with their rationale were some Heineken and Jumbo products.
The Heineken products were a series of bottles, cans and glassware that gave the user a real experience across a range of innovative ideas, such as: a bottle with a light up star that reacts to the beat of dance music, a bottle which has a personalised label to connect with the user. Lastly a branded cup that fits on-top of cans and bottles, encouraging and allowing the user to drink responsibly by holding water. Along with these bottles were the VBAT/DBOD designed Heineken light up bottles which was cool to see.
The Jumbo stuff was much more simple but equally as impactful with its visual design. Using simple and basic product shapes: butter, milk and wine but applying the traditional Jumbo yellow all over them with bold 3D letters placed on top of them. A simple idea executed well; although I’m not sure how practical this is for the shelf.
I attended some of the talks that were taking place on the day. The first one was by Paul Earnshaw, packaging manager from the huge UK supermarket company Tesco. This was insightful as he was explaining how people are able to get their products into Tesco stores and also current food trends that the UK consumers are buying into right now, which also reflect the design, such as “retro renaissance” — 70’s/80’s looking design, “how formal is normal” — high cost products packaged in a less formal and affordable way and vice versa and “restless taste” — how consumers want the next food taste all the time. These topics were all interesting to me and I totally understood and connected with what he was saying along with his British humor and jokes. I also shop at Tesco regularly in the UK so I’ve witnessed these trends.
At the Dieline conference there were a range of talks as well as the chosen designs on display of which had won awards. What I liked here were the cans for ‘Fort Point Beer Company’ which were described as ‘ornately old-fashioned’. They were simply really nice can designs using geometric patterns and illustrations with a single weight line. The colours were also really nice and despite being dull greens and blues they really did pop and attract my attention, further research showed me that the packs and boxes that the cans were transported in were equally as beautifully designed with the same principles.
There were also some talks organised by The Dieline, one was by Leeds based branding agency — Elmwood, about design and its role in packaging and how we can really play to all of our senses. It was good but quite word heavy.
My favourite talk however was by PJ (Pieter Jelle Braaksma) from VBAT where he presented the Prophecy whiskey project.
I didn’t know much about this project and the talk was really different from the other talks as it was much more personal and wasn’t just about the beautiful design and final outcome of the bottle — the entire process was explained and it made me appreciate the bottle design a lot more than just seeing the final glossy images.
Overall it was good day out and nice to explore and experience a different part of Amsterdam and also to see some great new packaging things. The discipline of packaging isn’t what I am most interested in or directly connected to but I do like seeing these kinds of things and it’s always good to see what the future of any industry is; especially one that we as consumers are a vital part of and get to experience it daily.

The first stop is Amsterdam, the Venice of the north. Although I’ve been to the Rapha store a few times, it was the first time hanging out with folks in the store and a mate visiting from Ye olde Kingdom. Nourished with a hot Chocolademelk with the obligatory slagroom, the visit quickly devolved into ogling up the amazing-looking Rapha x Van Gogh Museum Canyon hanging on the wall.
On a side note, each Rapha Clubhouse has its stash collection and unique emblem representing a local aspect of the host city — X Marks the Spot, nine crosses of Saint Andrew in echelon format.
Occasionally, the clubhouses have extremely limited collections borne out of collaborations with local artists or institutions, such as the Van Gogh museum or Saša Ostoja. Generally, these tend to fly off the shelves, but now and then, some secret stash locations remain unbeknownst to most — head on over to the Van Gogh Museum website for a chance to nab some remaining pieces ;)
How would I rate the Rapha Amsterdam Clubhouse?
Verdict: I would visit again and again
Although not home to a Rapha Clubhouse (yet?), we next headed to Antwerp as a seemingly close-by location for heading to Hoogerheide for the CX World Cup. As it turns out, heading toward the river and old town yields a beautiful experience, whereas turning right takes you into “one of the sketchiest suburbs in all of Belgium.” Much to the chagrin of my mate, who had initially booked an AirBnB in the latter area only to require police intervention to get his stuff back after canceling his AirBnB over safety concerns.
Freshly rested in a new Airbnb next to the Cathedral of our Lady Antwerp, the only question was:
How do we spend a day in Antwerp? Let’s go to a cycling cafe! How about after that? It’s Belgium, so a brewery?
The interactive De Koninck Antwerp tour started with a freshly poured Bollecke and was followed by a self-poured Triple D’Anvers halfway around the museum.
The first response upon seeing a chemistry lab with fully stocked beer fridges by my ‘started chemistry and decided it ain’t for me’ mate was — maybe I should go back to chemistry?
Although I’d argue that visiting the Clubhouse was the main highlight of the trip, the main event was undoubtedly the CX WorldCup in Hoogerheide. The WC was indeed an “interesting” experience.
Given the course layout, the consensus of the Hoogerheide experience was standing in a cold field to watch a race on TV and occasionally going – oh right, it’s happening behind me.
What made it were the random interactions along the way — from hanging out with a belated Flybe-stranded Irishman to trying random beers and food concoctions. The hilarious standout moment was a sudden shriek and forming of space around someone pissing himself while staring straight at the TV, utterly unphased with a beer in hand as the battle between Van Aert and Van der Pool evolved.
One way or the other, the entire trip and its antics can be summed up as
Seems appropriate
Next stop — London

Dutch the way aha, aha, I like it!
Welcome to a country where sex trade and smoking marijuana is legal. I don’t see it perplexing in a first-world country like the Netherlands. But on the contrary, I am not a fan of both.
I am an enthusiast for riding bikes though and this was definitely something I didn’t miss. Amsterdam is known to be one of the most bike-friendly cities in the world. Highways, streets and alleys offer a space for bike lanes. In fact, it is true that bikes surpass Amsterdam’s human population. There were so many people riding their bikes everywhere that I was more likely to collide with another biker than with a car.
I won’t elaborate much on food because I had been eating at Subway and satisfied my daily cravings for fresh croissants and ready-made salads and fruits from the supermarket but I tried waffles, jams, and cheese. After all, Dutch people like fried food which I am not fond of and they say they eat warm food only at dinner most of the time because they prefer easy to eat or on-the-go kind of meals such as sandwiches.
I flew to Amsterdam straight from a well-known island destination of the Dutch themselves, the island of Santorini. I was ready for a cooler and even rainy climate and yes it was way too cold for my taste when I arrived but the skies cleared the next day until the end of my stay. What a lucky tropical girl I was! I enjoyed up to 22 to 26 celsius of midday heat. Perfect enough for a tropical girl like me to shed away layer of clothes and show some bare skin.
It would be wise to buy a a travel ticket which gives you unlimited access to trains, trams, and busses within the Amsterdam city centre and its outer region. There are a lot of options to choose from when it comes to tickets so I suggest you check them out early on through this website https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/plan-your-trip/getting-around/public-transport. You can buy these tickets right at the airport. Just look for Iamsterdam booth/store.
I highly suggest you buy the Regional ticket if you are in Amsterdam for more than a day so that you can check out the attractions outside of the city centre such as Zaanse Schans, Haarlem and even Lisse where you can find the famous Keukenhof Gardens. I chose the 3-day Amsterdam & Region Travel Ticket which cost 33,50 Euros.
My first day was spent walking around the city centre and getting to know the vibe and the streets, canals and lovely bridges which looked entirely the same at every turn!
The next day was spent seeing the city of Haarlem which is obviously much more relaxed and quiet. It was just all about this place in one day, walking, window shopping, seeing how people live their everyday lives, and watching children bike all the way home from school. I and my bubbly travel buddy, Cassandra, spent more than an hour sipping delicious coffee at a very cozy restaurant located at the corner street. It was a relaxed and amazing day to really get to see and know this part of the country’s capital.
We enjoyed a day of bike ride! There were many bike shops to rent a bike from but we chose Green Budget Bikes because it was closest to our hostel and it was fortunately the bike shop that offered the cheapest rent. For just 10 Euros, we had the bikes entirely at our disposal for 24 hours. It has three shops around the city and you can find them below.
Here are my TOP THREE picks of interesting tours in Amsterdam. These tours will save you time by avoiding having to fall in line to get tickets.
Like I said, my Amsterdam & Region Travel Ticket gave me the freedom to hop on and off trains, trams and busses as I wished. This let me go to Zaandam which was my home base during the rest of my stay. Zaandam is fortunately where Zaanse Schans, a typical old style Dutch neighbourhood, is located. I rented the green bike for 24 hours so I had the chance to take it home with me and take an early morning bike ride to this place before I was required to return it at 1:30 PM at the city centre. This is a very charming town where you can see traditional windmills and enjoy museums that let you see how windmills work and how Dutch people make traditional gouda cheese which Netherlands is known for around the world. There is no entrance fee here. All you need to do is arrive and enjoy the rest of your stay.
Amsterdam is a place where coffee shops legally sell pastries mixed with cannabis. It is a place where it is common to experience the stink or smell of marijuana while you are walking down the street. It is a city where to find the Museum of Prostitution, the Museum of Erotism, Torture Museum or the Museum of Cannabis. These museums may likely give you an impression that Amsterdam is not a safe place but don’t let it dampen your spirits. Because all these are legalised and properly regulated, Amsterdam is safe and has indeed become one of my favourite cities in Europe.
If prostitution is legal, then Red Light District definitely exists and is even a famous spot for tourists. This is a proper place in the city to hire prostitutes who stand behind a glass window while dressed in skimpy clothes. These windows are literally lit with red neon lights at night time when these women are “working”. Here, prostitutes pay taxes, and are offered medical care and protection against discrimination or abuse. It is highly prohibited to take pictures of women at the Red Light District so if you don’t want your vacation to be a mess, keep your camera and phones in your bags. Brothels, sex shops, live shows…name it. The Red Light District has it. And whatever you may have heard about this place might just be all true.
Speaking of museums, Amsterdam is famous for iconic painters such as Vincent Van Gogh, Rembrandt and many others. Here you will find Van Gogh Museum, Rijksmuseum and Anne Frank House Museum. There is no need to purchase tickets in advance for Van Gogh or Rijksmuseum but if you are keen to see the inside of Anne Frank’s house where she hid for two years during the Nazi regime, then it is best to purchase tickets with your credit card through the AnneFrank website. I chose to skip this because my phone didn’t have the international roaming service from my local phone provider so I couldn’t receive the code sent by my credit card company every time I wanted to purchase something online.
I had the chance to vicariously see the inside of Anne Frank’s house through the movie The Fault in our Stars anyway so it was no longer something to obsess about. It would have been a good experience but I didn’t have a ticket. I rode the bike towards the museum though and I and my travel buddy was outside for a couple of minutes. The house was surprisingly modern from the outside because the building was renovated but as seen in the movie, the inside remained intact as it was in the 1940’s.
I am a fan of Van Gogh so I bought a ticket for 18 Euros. I was excited to see his paintings in person and get to know him more through the exhibits inside the museum. Most of Van Gogh’s work can be found in this museum except for the famous Starry Night painting which is located in New York at the Modern Museum of Art. It was still worth seeing his life’s work from the time when he first practiced painting up until his death at a ripe age of 37. I was happy to feel closer to the incredible but short-lived life of a highly talented and troubled Dutch painter.
Amsterdam is such a beautiful city with beautiful parks and gardens. It was so easy to get lost in time sitting by the bench and watching people. I especially loved this fountain where you can play with the water and risk getting wet if you dare go inside the circle and miss the proper timing. We all felt like kids! It was so refreshing!
Tulip season runs from the end of March until mid May, but the flowers are usually at their best halfway through April. More than 7 million flower bulbs bloom in spring at the Keukenhof in Lisse. I would say that going to Keukenhof was an extraordinary experience. I was glad to never have ignored going to this amazing place. It was unbelievably beautiful. I couldn’t believe my eyes seeing all those blooming colourful flowers everywhere. What a beautiful, beautiful world we live in. Don’t miss this when you are around Amsterdam during spring time. Just don’t you dare miss it.
I would say it felt and looked like heaven on earth.
This country is expensive. That’s a given.
It is therefore very important to manage your day wisely to be able to take advantage of the budget you have during your stay. I hope you got some helpful tips and ideas from this blog and find your way to Amsterdam and enjoy Dutch culture to the fullest. Good luck!

I love to travel, more specifically I love to travel internationally. If one can be so lucky to visit other countries in their lifetime, do it. For some people, I’ve learned, this statement is obvious — of course you should travel, why wouldn’t you? these people can simply afford to travel without consequence. The idea isn’t even considered an impossibility to some — they just plan and go. They’ve never known a life without the boundaries of financial difficulties. I say all this as a preemptive statement because I know how lucky I’ve been, and for as much as I’ve traveled, I’ve never taken it for granted. In a sense I want to show my humility in my travels, and in another, I’m talking directly towards some of the people I’ve met and known in New York City for whom personal, international travel is an exception, not a privilege, and their influence effects my perspective on travel.
My first time out of the country was in 2000, I was fifteen years old when, with my high school Russian language class, I visited Russia. Collectively, we spent ten days in Moscow and St. Petersburg and the experience was profound for me. Not only did the experience open my eyes to new landscapes, people and architecture (staying overnight at a monastery that was over 500 years old will bring some perspective on what’s considered “old”), but this was pre-9/11, in a world where it was easier to travel internationally. For that, I’m grateful I was able to see a part of the world before it became even more hostile and suspicious. Seeing a film in a cinema whilst in Russia was not on the itinerary. However, I was able to catch snippets of Once Upon A Time In The West (1968) on a fuzzy television in a hotel room in St. Petersburg, over-dubbed in that monosyllabic Russian voice I’d come to realize was more common than not in televised films. The sole voice of a man dispersing every line of dialogue that was said in English, in Russian, without inflection or change for characters. As stating, matter of factly, these are the words that are being said in this movie.
From 2000 onwards I wasn’t able to travel internationally for another twelve years, but continuing to see the world was always on my mind. In between that time I used my wanderlust to traverse across the country by way of road trips and destinations to music festivals to: Florida, Mississippi, Georgia, Washington, Missouri, Michigan, California, Tennessee, Texas, Iowa, Wisconsin, Indiana, New York, Illinois, Idaho; and to Canada, Manitoba and British Columbia.
Because of the focus of these essays, serving to regale the memories of going to the cinema, you might think I’m going to recount my cinematic memories for every one of these states or road trips. No, not entirely. I could go on about my memories of The Oriental Cinema in Milwaukee, or The Music Box Theatre or The Gene Siskel Film Center in Chicago during my college years, but I’ll keep those for myself. Although the recollections of being independent for the first time and seeing Lost in Translation or The Return of the King in 2003 prove to be warm and comforting, I’m going to focus elsewhere.
These long-form essays will focus on: Amsterdam and Tangier, with a forthcoming essay on Los Angeles and their cinema scene.
After that twelve-year dryspell of international travel, I was finally able to satiate my desire to leave the U.S., and in the spring of 2012 I traveled to Paris, France and later that summer went to live and work in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
I came somewhat late to completing my higher education. After dropping out of a university I took a gap year, enrolled in a film program at a college in Chicago, then dropped out again after two years. I floundered in my mid-twenties until I finally decided to try one last time to get a degree. I would attend a small, private arts college and study for my BFA in photography. In the third year of every student’s education at the arts college, part of the curriculum was to engage in an internship for their focus: sculpture, printmaking, painting, graphic design or photography. There were no specifications that ones internship had to be in or around the city we were in (Minneapolis or St. Paul, Minnesota), they simply had to be concerned with ones focus and had to abide by a certain number of hours worked. Since I saw this as an opportunity to take on an internship wherever I wanted, I reasoned my way towards Europe.
Here was my rationale: I didn’t want to fulfill an internship in the Twin Cities, so you expand from there, and realize, I don’t want to be in this region, either. So that crosses off Chicago, St. Louis, Milwaukee, Cleveland. What about the coasts? Would you look towards San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City or Philadelphia? I reviled both coasts, the binary choice of choosing between East Coast or West Coast still annoyed me then. So where, then? Outside of the country? Yes, that’s possible. Why not? In Europe — Paris, London, where? Well, my grandmother, whom I never got the chance to meet, was from Holland, and supposedly we still have distant relatives there. Maybe this could be an opportunity to experience a part of my heritage I’ve never known. So, The Netherlands, is it? Yeah, let’s say I want to do my internship in The Netherlands. Where in The Netherlands? Amsterdam, of course.
Over half a year spent in correspondence with different Dutch art galleries proved a success when my desire to intern at an art gallery in Amsterdam was accepted by the Annet Gelink Gallery, in the Jordaan district. I’d live in Amsterdam-Noord, in an apartment used typically for post-graduate residents at de Appel Arts Centre, or visiting artists, on Oleanderstraat. I found the room a day before I got on the plane, and luckily the setup worked perfect: I’d walk or bike to the ferry and take it into Centraal Station, and from there meander along the canals, soon formulating a routine and feeling that I was an Amsterdammer. It was a new, exciting, wild, breathtaking experience, being on my own, living and working in a different country.
The owner of the gallery, Annet, when she became aware of my affinity towards films, mentioned something to me about The Eye Filmmuseum, or rather, the “spaceship” on the river which had finally completed construction earlier that year. I’d noticed this giant, white building that, indeed, looked like a parked spaceship, as I took the ferry to and from my apartment, but I never knew what it was. I was a bit intimidated to approach it, in fact, but now that I knew what I was seeing was a film museum my interest rose and I planned to visit on some weekend.
The summer of 2012 was the return of Wes Anderson, who, in my mind up to that point, had lost his way. With the financial failure of the depressing, bloated The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2005) (his most expensive film at the time, a film which I like, but is too dour to embrace), his follow up, The Darjeeling Limited (2007), was smaller in scale and budget, and, I thought, completely wayward. I was disappointed by some of Anderson’s cultural appropriations and cliched storytelling of rich, white people and their problems seeking out spiritual enlightenment by traveling to India and meeting “real people.” Although, what came next, The Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009), was a surprise, an enjoyable animated Roald Dahl adaptation. The film also failed to recoup its production costs at the box office (although, it appears to have had a longer lifespan than most of his films, becoming endlessly re-watchable and used as a perfect example for embracing the autumnal season), and then the idea of Wes Anderson being able to be as creatively wild as his earlier films promised looked dimmer and dimmer with each modest success. That is until 2012 and Moonrise Kingdom,
a film that broke the wheel of Anderson’s seeming listlessness, transitioning between a nascent filmmaker into a professional craftsman, and pointed towards a new direction, a new era.
Walking up the stairs and into The Eye Filmmuseum, I’m struck by just how beautiful this new modern building is, the contradiction of futuristic design, clean, white angular shapes and rustic, ancient wooden floorboards that rise up and level off as they lead towards the auditoriums. That spacious, relaxed, open lobby is a place to eat or drink at the bar, sit before a film or mull over a film after a screening and look out at the river, and Amsterdam beyond that. Their shop is world class and the programming, I would learn, is monumental. The film collection of the museum itself is one of the oldest and most important in the world, having their formative roots, in the iteration of Nederlands Historisch Film Archief, created in 1946.
Every city should have a film museum. You have your historical art museum, your modern one, even a local art museum — most cities have science museums and ones for children, but seldom are there as frequent as those just mentioned, are there film or cinema museums. Why is that? Am I not looking deep enough? Okay, I’d reason that most cities have a film society (maybe connected to their most prominent university or college), and they screen films at different locations and are a small unit of cinema devotees and film programmers. But if most cities have children’s museums, film museums should be up there on cultural priorities, at least. The Eye Filmmuseum was the culmination of 70+ years of collecting, restoring and moving from venue to venue, starting small, finding space in The Reijksmuseum, almost moving its collection to Rotterdam until the government finally intervened and planned its final location in Noord-Amsterdam along The River Ij.
Seeing Moonrise Kingdom with some trepidation at Eye Filmmuseum was spectacular, because my doubts of Anderson’s direction were satiated in that tween love story of 1965. I became obsessed with the film (a film about puppy love, infidelity, unrequited love, sad people told through monotone dialogue delivery), its music became the soundtrack of the summer, it reinvigorated my love of cinema, it made me fantasize about romance, young love (I wonder where my first crush is right now? Still living in Japan?), and the East coast island vibes, rainy nights and quaint forests, lived on in my imagination as the rain fell on The Netherlands.
Cycling through Amsterdam in the rain and listening to Gary & The Playboys or Hank Williams, it felt particularly strange to feel the sensation of a slice of American culture whilst in the lowlands. 8tracks, a music website that would allow one to make a mix online to post and share (the conceit being you could only choose eight tracks on your playlist, instead of infinite songs), collaborated with American Empirical Pictures to release a few playlists on their site. The playlists were credited for each prominent character, as in, Bruce Willis’ Captain Sharp picked these Hank Williams and Buck Owens songs for you to hear, or these are the songs that characterize Cousin Ben, Sam & Suzy, The Bishops, and it made being immersed in the film even more possible.
Being in a different country whose native language wasn’t English was also a trip. Like I said, at this point I’d only ever traveled to Russia and France. In both instances a trip to the cinema wasn’t on the table, but now here I was in The Netherlands at a cinema. English isn’t the native language of The Netherlands, but everyone speaks English, anyway. It’s not intimidating to speak English without feeling you’re inconveniencing anyone, or even, to try to learn a few Dutch phrases to order a coffee, a pastry, and dispense some pleasantries. I always try to learn the language of wherever it is I’m traveling. I want to fit in, I want to be respectful and see how other people live, listen and express themselves. However, since it’s a Dutch-speaking country, Wes Anderson’s film was subtitled in Dutch, and before the screening a short film (from the Dutch film archives, a newsreel on winter skating in the canals from the 1960’s) was programmed, which wasn’t subtitled in English. It was interesting to follow the imagery to try to glean some insight into what was happening, to hear the audience collectively laugh in parts and then attempt to figure out what was so funny.
That’s something I wish I’d have tried more often in my travels — to see a film in the native language of whichever country I was in, without English subtitles. Of course, I can do that watching any international film on home video or online (just flip the subtitles off), but being in another country, surrounded by another culture different than my own, it’s an entirely new experience. It’s an experiment in engaged watching and listening, it’s an exercise in immersion. Conversely, watching an English language film amongst non-native speakers is interesting. You glean a different appreciation for humor, insight into drama receptiveness. Hearing the crowd, you can understand a different culture and what they appreciate through the visual art of cinema.
What I gleaned from this screening is that teenage romance is the same everywhere, and Anderson’s humor and visual wit translate to mass appreciation from the Dutch.
After the film I went into the shop and bought three movie posters: Eraserhead, A Clockwork Orange, and The Shining. When I got back to my apartment I put them on the wall. I was making the place my own, I was finding the things that I could connect with and brought them home with me. The hanging of movie posters on a wall might seem cliche, but looking at those posters brought me comfort, familiarity, and knowing they were printed in The Netherlands made me feel a connection that people here also loved films.
Later on that summer, one day in June, as if casually, the gallery owner mentioned she had tickets to an opening exhibition but couldn’t make it due to other plans. She asked if I wanted one, to which I asked, What’s the exhibition?“It’s the opening of the Stanley Kubrick exhibition at The Eye Film museum. Do you know who Stanley Kubrick is?” She asked.
In my mind I wanted to explode with the enthusiasm of a schoolboy ready to expound all of his knowledge of the filmmaker. Yes, I know all of his films. I’ve been watching and studying them since I was 13 years old. I’ve seen Barry Lyndon five times. I’ve even seen Fear and Desire! But I held my tongue and said,“Yeah, I know who he is, 2001, right? Brilliant filmmaker.”“Yes, spectacular film. Would you want a ticket? I have two — ”“I can go,” interrupted Marie-Claire, the second intern I’d met that summer — a relatively young, lithe woman with bushy eyebrows and an intense stare.“Good. Here you go. The two of you together.” Said Annet, handing us our tickets.
So Marie-Claire and myself planned on meeting up to see the exhibition together. With Sam and Suzy’s love story practically in my marrow, I tried not to over compensate and fetch for a summer love story.
We met outside, both of us dressed in black, and made our way into the auditorium, which was filling up very fast. As part of the Stanley Kubrick Exhibition, Eye Filmmuseum would be screening all of his films throughout the summer (save for Fear and Desire [1952], Kubrick’s first film, which, at the time, could really only be seen in private screenings and was not as promoted as much as Killer’s Kiss [1955], his second feature, for being of interest to view), but that evening, it was about the material. I didn’t realize it at the time until Christiane Kubrick (Kubrick’s widow) said it, but this was the worldwide opening of what would become a traveling show that toured for at least six years afterwards. A show that would include ephemera from Stanley Kubrick’s life and filmmaking career: his film cameras, his Golden Lion Award from the Venice Film Festival, storyboards and script excerpts for all of his films behind cubes of glass, movie posters from a myriad of countries, props, miniatures, costumes, drawings, any and everything you could think of was displayed in a series of black rooms where the only blank walls were being projected clips from his films. The rooms full of sounds: Penderecki, Nelson Riddle, Also sprach Zarathustra, Wendy Carlos, Handel and Ligeti.
Marie-Claire and I sat next to each other and listened as the director of the museum introduced Christiane Kubrick and Jan Harlan (Kubrick’s brother-in-law and producing partner for over 30 years), who soon gave a brief introduction, a quick Q&A after which we were presented with a short film trailer for the exhibition, as if to get us even more ready to view the collection.
When the exhibition opened up I was in awe. Marie-Claire and I kind of nodded to each other as if to say, This is cool, overwhelming, and we don’t need to stick together if we want to, we can explore. All that in a nod, but we got it — this was a big deal, not only for Kubrick admirers, film fans, but the Amsterdam film scene, absolutely. I noticed how small Jan Harlan was when I said hello to him, after having only seen him in documentaries on DVDs when I was a teenager, it was surreal to be standing next to him. The exhibit was overwhelming, and it was so overwhelming that I went back two more times when I attended 35mm film screenings of Barry Lyndon (1975) and Eyes Wide Shut (1999).
When I wasn’t working, I was wandering. I was exploring the city until it felt like home, walking and cycling, with some trips outside of the canal rings, I’d visit Haarlem and cycle up to Marken (an island village known for their wooden homes). Wandering around Amsterdam I came across a magnificent building, the Pathé Tuschinski. By chance I’d come across it after what looked like a premiere had happened and I snapped a picture. I made a mental note of where this place was in order to return soon.
I never found out what the movie was, but the building shook me to my core. A tall, bronze, golden, green art deco masterpiece. It stood out between the middling, unimpressive buildings beside it. I couldn’t believe this was a movie theater. I’d heard of “movie palaces” before, and I’d thought that I’d been to a few, but this was unparalleled. Such grace, such attention to detail, such reverence for a place that screened films.
The theme of intimidation grows as I approach the Tuschinski Theater on tiptoes, careful not to offend, not to do the wrong thing. I found that my personality throughout my travels abroad was to never offend. To be just right, plain, interested and open, but never boisterous. The stereotypical American abroad I was not. I knew I was a guest, and as a guest I wanted to abide by my host’s rules and traditions. The concept of being that arrogant American persona never even entered my mind as I traveled. Perhaps it was my first experience in Russia, wherein I was somewhat familiar with the culture already, or maybe it was my upbringing and how I was taught to interact with the world, but to act as if I owned the fucking joint just because I was American — no, hell no, never, the idea that I could make someone else uncomfortable or feel bad was not in my purview. Perhaps, and this is a stretch, Minnesota’s claim as being “America’s Canada” played into my attitude in a different country. I just wanted to be nice to people.
So as I enter into the cinema and order my ticket, I buy a cup of green tea and wait in the opulent lobby for the auditorium to be opened. The film I was seeing wasn’t particularly worthy of the cinema I was seeing it in, it was The Amazing Spider-Man (2012). I had no real interest in seeing this re-boot of another version of Peter Parker’s origin story at all, but it’s all that was playing there, and I kind of wanted to experience this movie palace.
When the auditorium let out and we were allowed to go in, I felt like I was underdressed. Red and gold, amber lights, a stage with footlights and a golden curtain.
Like many movie palaces from the early part of the 20th century, its use was manifold — from indeed being a place to premiere and screen films, they were also used for musical performances. In The Tuschinski theatre, Marlene Dietrich, Edith Piaf, and Louis Armstrong all played on that stage. The surrounding architecture of the auditorium had the seats fanned out in an oval with multiple levels, in a design that is rarely seen or built these days.
One had to feel veneration sitting in a place like this if it were an uncommon visit, and the fact that Pathé were screening a superhero movie about a mutant spider-kid made it all the more strange. When the lights went down, the Grolsch bottles opened up. At first it annoyed me, those swing top bottles popping open with such a pronouncement, but after I realized what they were, and that people were relaxed enough here to have a beer in a movie theater, the noise grew endearing.
I don’t remember much of the film I saw. I really wasn’t paying that much attention to it, really. It was simply incredible to be in this space, and seeing an American movie, at that, was a bit like maybe putting a CD into a boombox and listening to The Prodigy inside The Sistine Chapel. Old and new. Elegance and loudness. Unfortunately, most of what they screened were new, American releases of films I had little interest in seeing. If only the films were up to the standards of the movie palaces, things would’ve equalled out.
I became immersed in the world I lived in, and being there I forgot about America, and of course, at times I felt homesick, but not for anything specific, just a sense of a familiar culture. Moonrise Kingdom filled that void, and Eyes Wide Shut did, too, but in a way, not having easy access to communicate with people in The States was the best thing for me. I never wanted to be in two places at once, to feel that where I was was temporary. This was it, there was nothing else but that moment, be there and live it up and experience all there is to experience. Don’t wish you were somewhere else, if only because you worked so hard to get here, may as well keep pushing your ambitions further.
My little experience of shedding some of America was disturbed that summer. The first inclination of how America was perceived from out of the country was the tragedy of a mass shooting inside a cinema during a screening of The Dark Knight Rises in the state of Colorado. I’d heard nothing about it, I wasn’t paying attention to any news coming out of America and I loved it, until someone at the gallery mentioned this news story to me. The news headlines were on their computer and their response to me was one of concern, as if I should have an explanation for the event. I didn’t. If any explanation came out at all, it was one of despair (America loves its guns and it will never change, it’s a violent culture). It was tragic, unbearably violent and horrific, but I had no connection to the event or those people. It was depressing to have the impression put upon oneself that where I came from was a place of extreme, nonsensical violence. Maybe I was like that, too. How could I explain it? Was it my responsibility to be an ambassador for a place that huge, with a multitude of different cultures and ideals? I tried to just represent myself, alone, stoic, with my American English accent. Now people had to be concerned that the cinema was unsafe from terror. The world would become more violent, and every place one deemed safe was now being prepped for exit strategies and warned of suspicious activities.
I’d leave Amsterdam that year, I’d visit again five years later and yearn to stay. God how I want to work and live there, to forget all that’s behind me and forge a new life ahead, in a new land, but maybe not yet.

Remembering Amsterdam Houses
I wrote this essay nearly 30 years ago, drawing on interviews with my parents and research on Amsterdam Houses. I revisited it after reading some of the excellent history in The Legacies of San Juan Hill on the Lincoln Center website.
Although some of the information is now outdated (especially rental prices!) I resisted updating it. I’ve added footnotes in a couple of places, but that’s it.
Keep in mind this was written circa 1995.
The West Side I knew was just beginning its transformation.
There are time-machine moments in New York City, when something out of synch with the present comes into view and provides you with a glimpse of the past. It might be an odd, faded building sign, a storefront’s original wood frame, barely visible under decades of old paint, or the trolley tracks that relentlessly push through their tar graves. A sound can do it, powerfully, I discovered. Once, in an office where I worked on the far west side of 58th Street,[1] I could hear the brisk clopping sounds of horses making their way from a nearby stable. I knew the sound was connected to the horse and buggies that tourists love, but for a split second, I thought of how common that sound was a hundred years ago. It was probably a sound that my grandparents were familiar with when they arrived from Puerto Rico in 1918.
The far, west side of the city was always a congenial place for those encounters with the past. You can see the Hudson River without a man-made promenade from Amsterdam Avenue and other points along the west side in the 50s and 60s. Until recently, there wasn’t a whole lot of building going on. Until recently.
If you walk along some parts of West End Avenue in the sixties, you can see the parade of new high-rises, including Trump Place, that block the cherished views and light of the older high-rises, such as Lincoln Towers. The New York Times has been diligent in covering some of the reverberations that have shaken “longtime residents.” Their window views of sunlight, sky and their sliver of the Hudson are gone.
It may simply seem that people with money have been one-upped by other people with even more money. But when I visit the area, I feel a keen sense of loss for the neighborhood I knew, and the low-income families such as ours who thrived there. For example, on West End Avenue, there are people who have lost not just their view but, one can argue, the kind of neighborhood that was once congenial to their kind: not largely poor, not mostly white, but working families who were getting so close to the security of the middle class that they could almost taste and touch it. Those are the families who live in places like Amsterdam Houses, a low-income housing project, squeezed between Lincoln Center and Trump Place.
You may not have heard of Amsterdam Houses, or if you did, you may not have placed it as a neighbor to Trump Place. The area map posted on the Trump Place website does not show the housing project, which runs from 64th Street to 61st Street, from West End to Amsterdam Avenues. It does show other neighbors who are much farther east from the luxury towers: the Museum of Natural History, for example
And why would a developer cite a low-income housing project as a neighbor? No one gets credit for mixing rich and poor, black and white when it comes to housing. It’s not a draw for most people buying a home or renting an apartment.
It was a different time and place when my parents arrived at Amsterdam Houses. To trace their arrival at, and their departure from, Amsterdam Houses is to map what had once been a familiar journey for many families struggling to “make it” out of tenements and projects, into some kind of holy land of home ownership. That journey, with all of its twists and turns, not only defined their neighborhoods, it defined them as New Yorkers.
For my parents, as for many others, moving around the city was a game of hopscotch. Before obtaining their first Amsterdam apartment, they had already lived in several Manhattan neighborhoods. My mother’s family, who arrived from Puerto Rico in 1945, rented various apartments first on the Lower East Side and Greenwich Village before moving to an apartment on 54th Street between 9th and 10th avenues. My father was born in Manhattan, at East 39th St., off 2nd Ave., and as an adult his first apartment when he came out of the Navy after the second World War, was on W. 66th Street, where Lincoln Center stands today. Later, he shared a room with his brother on W. 84th Street.
After my parents married in 1951, they stayed in the W. 54th St. apartment where her mother still lived. It was a back apartment, overlooking the backyards of newer buildings. A police station was across the street; a chocolate factory was down the block. When a family friend told her about Amsterdam Houses, she and my father immediately went to look at an empty apartment in the development. They were impressed: the unit had a new kitchen, and even if the rooms were small, there was storage space in the basement for strollers and carriages.
The New York City Housing Authority opened Amsterdam Houses for low-income families in 1948 on 10 acres between 61st and 64th streets, stretching from Amsterdam to West End avenues.
My parents moved into a two-bedroom apartment in the Amsterdam Houses at 248 West 62nd St. in 1952.
There were many World War II veterans and their families in Amsterdam at the time, my mother recalled, but they didn’t stay very long. It is easy to imagine those families using the projects as a brief stopping off point, before purchasing a house in the suburbs. For others who followed, Amsterdam would be home for a longer while. When my parents needed more space, they chose to relocate to a larger two-bedroom in the projects, apartment 4D at 250 West 61st Street.
Home ownership was still years away. In the projects, there was still a newness that made it attractive. Amsterdam Houses was big and sprawling, the way a lot of low-income housing projects are, but there were parks, playgrounds and benches scattered around the grounds, and people congregated there and created community. My mother joined the other mothers who would sit on the benches and talk. She recalls that they were white, black, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Polish, Greek and Italian. In another small park, young men would bring their conga drums and jam on hot summer nights. When children played outside, it was underneath open windows, where a mother or older sister would look out every once in a while, to keep an eye on things. We could look up from where we played and see a familiar face.
A narrow park overlooking West End Ave. at 61st St. has no playground equipment but has more than 20 benches facing the river. The view itself was not spectacular: it was simply a sliver of the Hudson River and the New Jersey shoreline. What distinguished it was the amount of sky you could see, a release from the density of the tall brick buildings of Amsterdam Houses. My memories of Amsterdam will always be of playing double-dutch and other games under what seemed a spreading sky, not large by comparison to the rural sky, but large compared to what I saw in the rest of Manhattan. Those benches are a kind of testament to postwar optimism, New York City-style, a bread-and-roses approach to the needs of low-income families. Low-income housing is rarely conceived with those types of quality- of- life amenities.
Growing up in Amsterdam Houses, I took for granted the small parks, where I could mark the change of seasons by the color of leaves in the fall and the sound of conga drums in the summer. But change was already afoot by the mid-1960s. There was the constant drone of jackhammers and drills; the old tenements around the project were coming down at a fast pace, sidewalk sheds, made up of old, pastel painted doors and smelling of damp rooms went up. If it wasn’t too unbearably hot, we kept the windows shut and the yellow parchment shades drawn against the early morning construction rattle.
We soon got a good look at what all the drilling and excavating was about. Lincoln Center opened its doors, although it showed its white marble back to Amsterdam Houses.
Thousands of low-income apartments were torn down for the cultural center, and never replaced. Grace Institute ran a small school for Catholic women but soon gave up its site for a new Fordham University campus. At St. Paul the Apostle School across the street, my classmates and I could monitor its progress. There was a slope of grass there one day, and the next it was gone. Losing Grace Institute and its grassy slope is one of my earliest memories of losing a personal landmark. While my classmates and I clapped erasers at arms length outside the window, or played in the cordoned off street, our neighborhood was changing forever around us, but we didn’t know it.
Now the changes, large and small, obvious and subtle, are too numerous to count. On the east side of Amsterdam Ave., Power Memorial High School is long gone, replaced by a luxury high rise. On the west side of the avenue, just north of the Amsterdam Houses, there was once a Pioneer Supermarket and other affordable stores so critical to a community’s day-to-day life: a tailor, a shoe repair store, a variety store with odds and ends. Once, a person could shop at those stores, gradually walking uptown to 72nd St. and the crossroads of Columbus Ave. and Broadway. Today, two high schools — LaGuardia and Martin Luther King, Jr. — loom over the avenue where Pioneer once stood.
Trump Place is not the first luxury high rise development to touch Amsterdam Houses. Two luxury towers loom directly behind it, on West End Avenue. The rental office for the West End Towers issues business cards that say the buildings “overlook” Lincoln Center. Not quite. There are the 2,500 families in the 13 buildings of Amsterdam Houses standing between West End Towers, which opened two years ago, and Lincoln Center. The rents of the projects and the luxury towers occupy vastly different universes. At Amsterdam Houses, rents are tied to 30 percent of income, with the top rent somewhere in the low $600s. Tenants in the 1,000 West End Towers apartments are paying between $1,200 and $1,500 for a studio, $1,600 to $2,000 for a one-bedroom and $2,450 for a two bedroom. All of the 200 apartments set aside in West End Towers for working low-income families have been rented.
This is not nostalgia for a neighborhood Eden. My New York City is not the New York City of the 1940s or the 1950s, but the 1960s and 1970s, when things had seriously soured: people who could afford to, mostly, but not only whites, left the city in droves, jobs evaporated, and drugs seemed to be everywhere. That memory is still vivid to those of us who lived through it. There was the drug dealer who lived on the floor below us, and the night the police raided his apartment. Suddenly there was the smell of urine in the elevator. Something began to fray about the place, and the connections that made us feel strong seemed thinner. There were rumors about closing St. Paul’s. And then the housing authority notified my parents that they made too much money to stay in the apartment. It was time to get out. They bought a house in Queens in 1969.
Suddenly when we looked back at “the city,” as people in Queens called Manhattan, we wondered how we ever fit in. It looked more to us like a city of the very wealthy or the very poor, not the in-betweens that we were.
We were not used to feeling like outsiders in Manhattan. We had defined our community through the places where we shopped, played, and went to school, and those places were disappearing.
The narrow park overlooking West End Ave. is still there. But the view of the Hudson River is gone. Now the vista is blocked by the walls and windows of the West End Towers, where people are paying up to $2,450 for the light and sky that were once part of living in Amsterdam Houses. St. Paul the Apostle School was torn down for a luxury apartment building. In an improbable, small-town moment, I ran into Rev. Francis X. Ryan on 57th Street about 10 years ago. Father Ryan had been the pastor of St. Paul’s parish when the last waves of students — mostly Puerto Rican, black and still some Irish — filed through. I recognized him immediately: he had changed little from the days when he scolded St. Paul students about jumping up — like kangaroos, he would say — from the altar rail after receiving Communion. “It broke my heart when they closed that school,” he said. Not every child who lived in Amsterdam went to St. Paul’s, and not all my friends were classmates there. But it was part of the diversity of the Amsterdam community, and something was lost when it closed.
The last time I saw many of my St. Paul’s classmates was at an Amsterdam Houses Reunion.[2] The reunions were sporadic events over the years. I attended the 1985 reunion, in the playground of PS 191, right across the street from the projects on 60th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. Some came from as far away as Puerto Rico and Atlanta; others were in Westchester or New Jersey. Some still had parents who lived in the projects. Others who never lived in the projects, but attended St. Paul’s showed up, too. Some played softball, but most of us just hung out and caught up with one another. One of my former classmates and I walked over to where the school once stood. In its place was a luxury tower. She was a teacher in Puerto Rico, and it had been her dream to teach at St. Paul’s some day. The new building abuts the Professional Children’s School. Having a parochial school with mostly black and Latino students share a block with a school for child actors and models is the kind of neighborhood diversity that is becoming extinct in New York. When people talk about diversity, it is usually in terms of providing the poor, or the low-income or minority with a glimpse of how the other half lives. But diversity enriches in both directions. The erosion of New York’s liberal tradition may very well be traced to our isolation from one another, our lack of conversation with people different from ourselves.
Shutting St. Paul the Apostle school was another small rip in the fabric of that community, and it also settled an old score. When the school was open, 60th Street between Columbus and Amsterdam was closed off so that we could play in the street during recess. Swarms of girls in their rolled-up plaid skirts and boys in their white shirts and navy blue ties congregated in front of the school. It was there that we spied the students from the Professional Children’s School next door. They were the misfits then, a school for performing artists in a very working-class neighborhood. But they have endured, and we have not. The saddest part is that our families are not missed, our contribution to the city not fully weighed and appraised. We are as out of synch with the West Side today as those horses I used to hear, dragging their carriages from west to east to ply their trade.
[1] The Caribbean Cultural Center, where I worked briefly in the early 1980s, is now located in East Harlem.
[2] The 1969 graduating class of St. Paul’s had a great 25th reunion in 2004, thanks to our classmate and my Amsterdam Houses upstairs neighbor (now Florida resident) Lindsay Santos.

(Updated January 2020 — check out my new Paris guide!)
I’ve been calling Amsterdam my home for eight years now, and there’s still nothing quite like it. After 3.5 years at The Next Web, I recently switched to a freelance lifestyle — which means I’m often hanging out in a cafe.
Amsterdam has a great coffee culture — the city is riddled with amazing cafes. Unfortunately, it can be hard to find one that’s laptop-friendly. I’ve seen taped-off outlets, forced wifi resets and staff bluntly asking if you could just stop using your computer.
It’s hard out there for a freelancer, so I’ve curated the best spots to get some work done in Amsterdam. My selection is based on a few simple rules:
This list is continuously updated, dropping places that fail to meet the above criteria and adding newly opened gems. Found an incredible place I’ve missed in this guide? Reach out on Twitter!
A short ferry ride away from Central Station you’ll find this breathtaking space that’s dedicated to the highest quality coffee, inventive lunch dishes and lightning-fast wifi. Don’t forget to try the banana bread!
This stunning space serves fantastic coffee and has a great selection of pastries and lunch. Just a heads up — the table in the back is meant for working, so don’t get too comfortable with your laptop in the front.
Not only does the shop in this four-story building sell beautiful clothing inspired by Scandinavian design, there’s also an impeccable cafe on the ground floor that’s perfect for working. Don’t leave without trying their crumble.
In the east of the city you’ll find this cozy, laid-back hangout that’s well known for serving incredible coffee—but maybe even more famous for its array of freshly baked pastries and cakes.
Hasn’t even been open for a year and is already one of the best spots. Very speedy internet, decently priced coffee and incredible lunch make it a great place to hang out for a while.
Most stores of this ubiquitous Dutch chain are too crowded, but this one next to Central Station hits all the right spots. Lots of natural light and a spacious interior make for a perfect working environment.
In classic Dutch tradition, this cozy cafe gives you a small cookie with your drink — a most welcome addition. Watch out for a few clearly-marked tables where you can’t put your laptop.
This place has a secret trick up its sleeve for making its milk-based coffees, which makes them the richest and creamiest in the business. In summer, the small terrace is shielded from the sun so you can easily bring your laptop outside.
This charming cafe in the west of the city has enough spots to land your laptop. Don’t miss out on their signature spappelsap — a funky mix of sparkling water and apple juice. Fills up quickly on weekends, so come early or miss out.
This branch of the popular food market features a cafe that’s perfect for whipping out your laptop. Grab anything from the store, or order one of their stellar sandwiches.
Located on one of the city’s most beautiful canals, this hip hotel also houses a spacious restaurant and cafe. Follow the stairs to the first floor for the best working spots. Closes at 1AM, so perfect for getting in some work at the end of the day.
Another hotel! This one’s located in the east of the city, and especially well-equipped for working. To the right of the entrance you’ll find rows of workstations, while the bar to the left caters to your every need.
I know — Starbucks sucks. But this one’s different —it combines a unique interior with copious amounts of space to work and plugs everywhere. As one of the few stores in the world with a Clover machine, the coffee isn’t even that bad.
Found an incredible place I’ve missed in this guide? Reach out on Twitter, because I edit this post from time to time with the best tips.

A few weeks ago we spent a great 48 hours in Amsterdam. As this wasn’t our first time we decided to visit places we hadn’t been before. So after you’ve visited the amazing Rijksmuseum, Anne Frank House, Heineken Experience and picnicked in Vondelpark, then why not take a look at these five different things to do.
Hortus Botanicus is a beautiful greenhouse and botanical gardens, founded in 1638 it’s one of the oldest in the world. This wonderful attraction has range of plants and flowers to explore, from cactus’ to the Persian ironwood tree there is plenty to see, even some plants which are on the “danger” list!
We loved wandering around the greenhouse, from feeling like we’re walking through a jungle at the bottom to viewing the tops of the trees from the rooftop bridge. Afterwards heading out into the fresh air and autumnal gardens, taking our time to appreciate the beauty and serenity!
Amsterdam has lots of stunning parks and open spaces, however Hortus Botanicus is definitely our favourite place to relax and escape the hustle and bustle of most tourist attractions in the city centre.
2. Bloemenmarkt
Amsterdam is known for it’s flowers, especially Tulips, so where better to see them than the world’s only floating flower market?! Bloemenmarkt is a great place for any flower lover, from market stalls selling seeds, tulips, cactus’ and more it’s a great place to find Dutch trinkets to take home for friends and family. The bulbs even come customs ready so you’ll have no problem getting them through security at the airport!
Furthermore, this stunning market runs along side a series of shops where you can find even more traditional Dutch goodies, including a delicious cheese shop! Now who doesn’t love cheese?!
3. Moco Museum
The Museum Quarter is full of wonderful museums from the Rijksmuseum to the Van Gogh Museum, even the I Am Amsterdam sign. However, one smaller museum which is less well known on this square is the Moco Museum, and personally our favourite.
Moco Museum, which stands for Modern Contemporary, was a museum founded in an early 20th-century townhouse and holds a stunning collection of Banksy and Dali pieces in both the house and surrounding garden. Including works such as Banksy’s ‘The girl with balloon’ this is one museum you cannot miss!
4. Foam
After visiting the Museum Quarter you may have had enough of walking around galleries and museums, but if we can we’d definitely encourage you to visit just one more…
Foam is a beautiful photography gallery situated in an canal house not to far from Bloemenmarkt. The gallery combines exhibitions from well-established photographers with the up and coming, giving those new to the scene a platform on which to exhibit their work.
If you’re a photography lover then this is one you must visit! We loved the range of subjects this gallery had to offer, as well as some moving pictures thrown into the mix.
5. The Hoxton
Now Amsterdam has plenty, and we mean plenty of bars! But many of these will be found in the busier parts of the city, filled to the brim with tourists heading for a night out on the town. And if like us every now and then you just want to relax with a good crowd, glass of red wine or cocktail in hand, then Lotti’s at The Hoxton is the place for you!
Lotti’s at The Hoxton has a great buzz and atmosphere with an even better cocktail list! And if you’re feeling a little peckish then the bar snacks we spied did look delicious.
To top it all off Lotti’s has a great old fashioned Photo Booth and we have to be honest we can’t resist a good Photo Booth!
There is so much to explore in Amsterdam and we’d definitely encourage visiting the usual tourist hotspots, however if you’re looking for something a little bit different then we hope we’ve given you some inspiration.

Happy Blessed New Year everyone :) I hope the start of 2025 has been kind to all of you. 🧡
The last story that I wrote was on Christmas Eve. The next day, I had a flight out to Amsterdam. Although I wrote a few drafts on Christmas Day and the days that followed, I never got to editing them in order to publish it. Then a week passed and another, and I decided I might as well just take a long holiday break (away from work and writing and everything) and come back again in the new year. So here I am, back again :)
➡️ non-medium members can read from here 📖
My full three-week travels took me from Breda in the Netherlands to Milan, Maranello, Siena and Rome in Italy, and finally ending at Istanbul in Turkey. Today, I will write about an incident that happened to me while I was taking the train from Amsterdam to Breda.
I landed in Amsterdam on December 26 at around 7.30am. There wasn’t much of a crowd when I landed, so I managed to clear immigration and collected my luggage and exited the arrivals by 8.10am. After which, it was time to buy a train ticket to Breda. I opted for the 8.44am train so that I didn’t have to rush to the platform.
Boarded the train at exactly 8.44am and the scheduled arrival was 23 minutes later at 9.07am. However, 10 minutes into the ride, the train suddenly stopped. For what felt like the longest time.

AK-47 or White widow? Shane asked, grinning as he pointed at a menu as if either one of us had any business dabbling in strong marijuana. We could barely handle cigarettes, let alone smoke any of those strains of weed, that sounded more at home on an MI5 terrorist watch list than in rolling papers. We eventually requested the weakest space cake they had and left to take in the rest of De Wallen.
Eight of us were in Holland for the Rotterdam carnival. As part of our package, we had a day trip to Amsterdam scheduled, and my O-my was it going to be a trip (pardon the pun) that none of us will ever forget. Getting high didn’t appeal to Missy, Prince and Helen, so we (Shane, Ricardo, Carl, Jay and I) decided to split our group in two and meet back at the coach at the end of the day.
Now let it be known that De Wallen (where the red light district is situated) is a small enclave of Amsterdam and is probably one of the craziest sections of any city worldwide. With women in windows and weed, the word ‘liberal’ doesn’t do it justice at all. Suppose De Wallen were a bike rolling down a hill, it’d be brake-less, without a seat, stabilisers, or wheels — just a rickety old frame trundling at full speed into those fiendish red lights below.
Anywho, we had a good laugh throughout the day and were on the way back to the coach. Jay and I were deliberating on how the “weak space cake” was a little too weak. Unsatisfied, we happened upon, and decided to stop off at the most stereotypical edible peddlers I had seen there. So there are five of us squeezed-up in this weed takeaway shop, plastic inflatable palm trees everywhere, reggae beating over the speakers.
The guys behind the counter wore red, gold and green string vests and had locs. In true British fashion, I began small talk. I assumed they were Jamaican, and with me being of Jamaican heritage, I asked where in Jamaica they were from.
​They both answered ‘Barbados’. ‘Oh’, I replied — Now here’s where Carl swears I had doomed our expedition, for I went on to state — “So you guys aren’t real, Rastas then?” Carl reckons that on account of my faux pas, the brother going to get our order from the cabinet stopped in his tracks and looked back at me in complete disdain before selecting an entirely different batch of space muffins to those requested. Anyway, we paid and left. Carl, Shane and Ricardo had walked up ahead, opened their muffins, and ate them whole.
We had agreed to buy rum to drink back at the hotel before heading out for our evening meal — so we stopped off at a shop that had benches out front, and it was there that both Jay and I realised that the rest of the guys had accepted their seats on the maddest ride in Dam! The space muffin-coaster. The only catch was, it rode you instead.
Whilst outside the shop, Shane began to giggle. When I say ‘giggle’, I mean tears and uncontrollable fits of what I first thought was a joyful display of happiness (Boy, was I wrong). Ricardo took a seat outside the shop, slouched halfway down on a bench — both hands in his pockets, his eyes mere slits in his face whilst Carl, deep in silence, repeatedly walked between the seats like one of those deranged bears in captivity.
Shane’s giggle rapidly escalated to hysterical bouts of laughter. By now, these boys are starting to look crazy, and I have to ask if everyone’s cool? Ricardo gives me a look that I now know meant ‘brother — right now I’m simply trying to keep my choo-choo on the tracks’. Jay shook his head in disbelief, looked at me and said, “Shit, how strong could those things be?” At that point, Shane comes up from behind and puts his arms around both of us and says, “Trust me, I’m waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too high right now!” At that point, I don’t know what part of Shane’s “way too high” Jay didn’t get, but he took his muffin and devoured it. Four down, one to go.
So Jay and I walked into the shop, chose a bottle of rum, placed it on the counter then split up to get individual items. Before picking up some wine gums and nuts, I walked around for a bit, then headed back to the till. When I got there, Jay had both hands on the counter, hovering over several bottles of water and a shelf-load of Pringles. I looked further and couldn’t see the rum. So I’m like — “Jay, that’s way too much crisps — bro, and where’s the rum?” Jay turned to me — Pringle crumbs falling out of his mouth as he spoke, “Nah bro…” — Shaking his head — “Nah…we won’t be needing that rum tonight, trust me.” With that, he turned back towards the shopkeeper, purchased the Pringles he was eating, paid for the water and left the rest of the items he had gathered behind. The shopkeeper and I watched him clambering through the shop door; I was shocked at how fast he had gone under.
Getting back to the coach was a mission. A, we couldn’t remember where we were meant to go and B, the rest of the guys were so high it was astounding. I liken the journey back to the coach to that of a Sheppard trying to keep sheep from going astray. By the time one was back on track, another had f@*ked off doing something else.
We finally made it, and I cannot describe how happy I was to see Missy, Prince and Helen. Prince frowned at their peculiar behaviour, “What’s wrong with them?” He asked. I told him, and he just laughed. Carl, Shane and Jay went to the back of the coach, and I sat next to Prince. The coach set off, and all I could hear from the rear was Shane and Carl giggling with each other and other passengers. I looked over at them, and from where I was sat, it looked like they were over the worst and were now having a rip-roaring time without me — FOMO set in.
I took my muffin out and figured if I had three quarters and gave a quarter away, I wouldn’t be hit as hard, so I offered a quarter to Prince — who took one look at the others and declined. So I turned and offered Missy the piece, she took it, and I had the rest. Five minutes had passed, and I felt nothing. Eventually, I fell asleep.
When I woke, we had arrived back in Rotterdam, and everybody was making their way off the coach. Prince had to haul me up, and immediately I knew something was off, really off. Edging my way out of the seats felt like an extraordinarily complex task. I walked the coach holding seat headrests for support, and when I got to the steps to disembark, I descended them as if I were seventy-five with bad knees and worn discs. When I took the final step off the coach, I heard (within my head) that weird sound the six million dollar man-made when he would jump off buildings or kick objects, and I knew right off I was in for one hell of a long night.
So now we’re all stood in a huddle outside our hotel, discussing plans for the rest of the evening. Now, if I were completely honest, my sole goal was to keep all my marbles in their bag. Eventually, Prince, Missy and Helen got fed up with our random bouts of laughter — not to mention our inability to follow any single thread. Pissed off, they went up to their rooms, leaving us to our own devices. Oh boy!
We (the wasted) decided we’d go into Rotterdam central to eat (How we were going to manage this, only God knew). Before I knew it, we were walking towards the train station, each randomly bursting out into unruly fits of laughter that would set everyone else off. My stomach muscles had begun to hurt so badly I thought I was going to keel over and die. Between laughing and walking in irregular patterns, we tried to hold regular conversations, but conversing whilst at that altitude is so mentally taxing, we opted to walk in silence, every one of us trying to hold on to the minuscule shred of sanity the muffins had left. Just shy of the train station, Jay turns to me and says, “Mate, do ya reckon if I go hospital they er…they, can er. They can errr get rid of this feeling?” Now, if you knew Jay, you’d know he was by far one of the most level-headed people you knew, and his question smacked of panic, which panicked me further. I stopped in my tracks and did the basketball time-out hand sign to their backs (I know, trust me, I do) and announced I was abandoning the mission and would be heading back to the hotel. Everyone agreed and followed suit.
I kid you not, on the way back, the theme music of the X-Men the animated series kept playing over in my head, and I began to believe we were characters from the show. Don’t ask me shit about it; I have no idea why my brain would conjure such things. We returned to the hotel and walked straight towards the restaurant, which was oval-shaped with a bar and bartender in the middle, seats situated all around. Shane took a seat at one end, Jay on one side, Carl chose to leave and go up to the room, and Ricardo just stood swaying — hands in his pockets, cap pulled down over his eyes. What must that lady have thought? We had come in together but were seated so far apart you’d have thought we were strangers.
My mouth suddenly felt like it was filled with sawdust and cotton wool. I ordered five one-litre bottles of water. At this time, Jay is so engrossed in his menu, you’d have thought he was reading the Magna-carter. I look over, and Ricardo has gone. I look towards Shane, who is now ordering everything on the menu, and I mean everything! Wings, fries, pasta, salad, a bread basket (normally meant for a group), more wings and cake. As he’s ordering, the visualisation of all that food makes me feel sick. The waitress also takes Jay’s order and leaves to go to the kitchen. Shane then shouts from across the bar, “Someone could punch me in the face right now, and I’d have to charge it ta the game.” I look at him and think — f@%k this, I’m going to bed. When you’re that high, there’s no time for niceties like hi, bye, and how’d you dos — you just get up and go.
I got up and took whatever bottles of water I could, the grand total of two of the five I had paid for, and began making my way to the lift. I looked back, and Shane is watching, waiting for me to react to his comment. In my head, I’m thinking — we are way too far in distance for us to engage any more. Secondly, I ain’t got time for jokes, brother, I’m trying to keep my shit together, and you’re not helping. I shuffle past reception and get in the lift but cannot remember how to use it or which floor I’m on. I ride that thing up and down at least four times, ground floor to the top and back. An older woman eventually joined me, and we looked at each other. I recognised her from the coach trip earlier; unfortunately, she shared the same look as me; I conclude that she’s obviously mashed as well. We both rode the lift, up and down, a further two times, swaying in absolute silence before she got off, and I eventually remembered my floor.
I opened my room door, and Carl is sprawled out on Ricardo’s bed. I wanted to ask him how and why he’s in our room but immediately came to the conclusion that I just didn’t give a shit about the answer.
I lay down and the room goes wild! Spinning out of control, my heart started beating fast, I closed my eyes, trying to calm my body to sleep, but I begin to feel unwell. I looked up at the ceiling, and I kid you not, shadow animals are running on it — at that point, I was like ‘Nope!’ don’t like that, I need an ambulance — right now! I jumped up and called reception. I told them to get me an ambulance. Carl sprang up from Ricardo’s bed and screamed, “Noooooooo! I don’t need one, man!” I looked over at him, ignored his plea and continued. “Yes, I’m in room 355; I need an ambulance please, in fact, you might need to order a few”. The woman asked what’s wrong. I told her I’m incredibly high, and my heart is racing. She began to laugh. Looking back now, she was probably used to this from overzealous Brits coming back from Amsterdam. She told me to come down and wait in reception. Carl insists on coming with me.
Once down in the lobby, I glanced into the restaurant area and Shane and Jay are gone. A fellow guest from the hotel was trying to be helpful — and he’s like, “Mate, I’ve been there, you don’t need a hospital, you need ta ride it out.” I looked at him like — brother, if I could raise my hands right now, you wouldn’t have teeth.
Anyway, my ambulance arrived, I went to get in, and this random dude begins to walk with Carl and me; eventually, Carl gets annoyed with him and tells him to f@%k off.
I looked around outside, and there are two other ambulances, with patients from the hotel getting in. So now I’m sat in my ambulance with the doors slid open, and the paramedics are talking in Dutch whilst checking my blood pressure and vitals. They gave me sugar sachets to swallow, and I’m like, Ooo-kay, not sure this is it, guys, I was thinking more of an open heart surgery type solution — “but hey”. Anyway, my heart rate wouldn’t settle, so they decided it was best I go to the hospital to be on the safe side.
As we were about to leave, a man and his wife came over and began talking to my paramedics. I looked closer, and it’s the woman from the lift earlier. Her husband stated, “My wife’s had some of that funny cake, and I think she’s having a heart attack”. I know I should be ashamed to admit this, but all I could think was — Bro, that’s you and your wife’s business… Right now, I need all these guys on me. Your gonna have to get your own team.
I think they gave me a sedative, as the next bit is a complete blur. I woke up in the hospital; Carl is sitting in a seat. Nurses and doctors are in and out of the room, asking me questions and doing tests. They eventually gave me an injection, and things go black; my last thoughts were of my fiancé and mother and how much I would miss them. My next memory is sharp, bright daylight, making the white hospital room glow. My initial thoughts were… Oh Lord, I didn’t make it! The feeling of dread quickly subsided when a nurse came through my curtains with a breakfast trolley, her blonde hair humming under the sun’s rays. She smiled, her face was warm and kind, and I felt at ease. I took the food and water on offer and awaited a doctor to come and check me over. The doctor came and gave me the all-clear — which I thank God he did, as I had to catch my return ferry from Calais that afternoon.
My friends had been calling, and after several missed calls they finally got through — and I explained I was on my way back.
When I arrived at the hotel, everyone was sitting in the restaurant area eating breakfast, looking like shit warmed up with raisins. Shortly after, we packed our bags, got on the coach and went home; that bad feeling from the muffin hanging around us like a bad smell.
It took me days to feel one hundred per cent again. A week after the trip, I emptied my trouser pockets to wash them and found the wrapper for that dreaded muffin and written clear as day on the packaging were the instructions for consumption — “DO NOT CONSUME MORE THAN A QUARTER A DAY”. I had to laugh. I threw it in the bin, vowing to never touch an edible again and guess what? I never have. We still laugh about it to this day. The story never gets old.
I hope you enjoyed the read. Please show your support by giving me a follow and a wave or two or three or even four!
Thanks in advance!

I got to Amsterdam on a quick bus ride from Brussels, one of those trips short enough to avoid existential dread but long enough to feel like a soft reset. The moment I arrived, the city greeted me like it had nothing to prove. Clean air, standardized houses standing proud, and that effortless beauty that almost feels rude. It didn’t need to win me over. It already had, love at first sight.
That first night, I made the classic mistake of letting hunger choose the restaurant. An overpriced place that served a perfect sirloin, without any sides. Just meat. As if to say, “You came here for this and nothing more.” Fair enough. I washed it down with a pink grapefruit soda that tasted like someone whispered the word “fruit” into a glass of carbonated nothing.
My first real day was spent at the Artis Zoo. I forgot how much I love giraffes. Tall clumsy creatures, there’s something almost ancient about the way they move, like they know they’re above the rest of us. Well, they are. I also spent way too long near the penguins, despite the stench. They wobble like drunk little gentlemen and I can’t help but love them.
I did find out that Amsterdam in late October is magical. Being Brazilian, I’d never experienced proper seasons before. This was my first real autumn, the kind I’d only seen in movies. The streets were carpeted with red and yellow leaves and I took dozens of photos of my own feet because the ground looked like a painting. Every step felt like a poem.
The canals? Don’t get me started. I took a boat tour with a guide so charismatic I considered proposing. There’s a peacefulness in floating slowly past crooked houses and quiet bridges. I could do that for days. I want to be rich one day, but only for one reason, to own a boathouse in Amsterdam. That’s the dream. Not yachts, not diamonds. Just a floating home and a view of still water.
I tried marijuana brownies and gummies, in an attempt to finally experience what everyone raves about. Yeah, I know, the most stereotypical and touristy thing to do in Amsterdam. Spoiler: nothing. My psychiatrist once explained that ADHD sometimes turns the brain into a dopamine black hole. So there I was, chewing overpriced weed sugar, waiting for a high that never came. Just me and my broken reward system. Fun.
When it comes to food, Amsterdam gave me two cravings I still haven’t shaken off almost a year later. First, the bitterballen: crispy, deep-fried balls filled with a creamy meat ragout that somehow feels both luxurious and comforting; second, Rudi’s stroopwafels, which deserve their own national anthem. Thin caramel-filled wafers that taste like joy. I’d fly back just for them.
I did a lot of walking in Amsterdam. How could I not? The streets felt like a canvas. At a local fair, I bought two belts that are still holding my life together, literally and figuratively, and a cashmere scarf that followed me across Europe, hugging my neck as the days grew colder. Funny how some objects start to feel like companions.
All the walking led me to a train that led me to Zaandam, a city close by. The architecture there is surreal, the massive hostel that looks like a stack of colorful fairy tale houses? Perfection. It’s like someone let a child with great taste design a building.
One night I joined a tour of the Red Light District, led by a former sex worker. She was brilliant! Sharp, warm, unapologetic. There was a roughness to her friendliness, hard to explain. The district itself is overwhelming, neon-lit and pulsing with voyeurism. Even as a little fag, I was impressed. The women behind the glass know how to hold power with a single look.
Speaking of shocking, I caught a screening of The Substance at Pathé Tuschinski, the most gorgeous cinema I’ve ever been to. I wouldn’t be back in Brazil before the film left theaters, so I made the time. The Dutch subtitles were distracting, but the experience was unforgettable, especially the part where people started leaving during the bloodier scenes. Brazilians would never. Oh, and I may have stolen a tiny spoon they gave me for nuts. My only crime. My tiny metallic souvenir.
Museum-wise, I had only one priority: Van Gogh. I stayed for hours and cried more than once. His story has always cut deep for me and there’s so much vulnerability in his brushwork, in his letters, in his legacy. Seeing his strokes up close was like meeting his ghost. It was gentle. It stayed with me.
Now, I’ve tried not to make these travel pieces about the tattoo studios, I want to focus on the cities. But I have to make an exception for Hachi Ink. My favorite studio of the whole trip. Chikage made me feel at home like we’d known each other for years. On the last day there was even homemade Japanese food. I left full: stomach, heart, everything.
After a week of scenic tram rides, stroopwafels, falling leaves and unspoken love for a city I barely knew, it was time to leave. Berlin waited with more leaves, more streets, more chaos and a couple love stories.
But Amsterdam? Amsterdam stays with me.

During one of our tours, the guide mentioned how Amsterdam and the Netherlands in general is extremely vulnerable to rising sea levels. This made me wonder whether the canals had any role in helping the city avoid the crisis, but also what techniques had been invented. David had mentioned in one of our meetings that a portion of Amsterdam had been quite literally reclaimed from the sea. I wanted to know if there were more plans of doing this in Amsterdam, and if not, what they were planning instead.
In 1953, there was a flood in the city that killed upwards of 1,800 people. This was from a lack of reservoirs and space for the rainwater to go. To combat this, flood barriers such as dams and dikes to suppress and redirect the water. On the personal level, it has gotten to a point where children are even taught how to swim with shoes and clothes on in case there is ever a flood. With climate change, rising sea levels are decreasing the land of the Netherlands, as well as increasing the possibility for dangerous floods. Amsterdam is one of the most likely cities to flood by 2050. This means if action is not taken now to protect Amsterdam and slow the process of climate change, the city may not remain by the end of the century. A third of the Netherlands is below sea level, leaving a good chance to be severely affected by sea level rise. Because of this, Amsterdam has plans and innovations in which they can attempt to suppress the changes.
All these innovations are different, with some figuring out new ways to displace water, while others worry about how to adapt to saltier water levels. Water Squares were thought up as a way to have a reservoir during periods of large rainfall. This is an area that can be used for sitting and gathering, but instead of the square being on a flat plane, it is inset into the ground. There are steps to walk and sit on, but during periods of floods, the square can be used as a makeshift reservoir. Water flows into the square from gutters in sidewalks and would hopefully decrease the water surrounding residences and businesses. A technique for farmers is growing salt water tolerant crops. Some crops, such as potatoes, are being researched and genetically changed to become more salt tolerant. Researchers have been able to make a potato that is four times more tolerant than a regular potato. Some farmers decide to go a different route, growing crops like samphire, which is known as “the poor man’s asparagus”. This vegetable comes from the sea, meaning it will be able to grow within saltier conditions.
The Delta Programme is a program to constructing different infrastructure that will protect the city. This includes constructing and revamping dikes, using modern engineering of construction techniques, and proposing new management strategies. A map of climate projects is used to determine the weaknesses of different areas in the city and what can be done to aid these weaknesses. Currently, the program’s main areas of research are figuring out how to incorporate fresh water supplies, flood mitigation, and flood-resistant urban planning. The idea of having man-made floating islands for housing has been suggested, but the issue arises of whether these islands are going to raise sea levels itself. However, there is currently a floating dairy farm in use. This farm raises dairy cows and was built in a sustainable and transparent way. The animals were moved onto a floating farm to increase housing space, but it may not be entirely plausible to do this on a larger scale.
Beaches in the Netherlands oftentimes must be replenished with sand every five years, as the additional sand is used as a storm barrier. The sand in these areas get dispersed and misplaced from storms and natural degradation, requiring dredged sand from the Delfland coast to fix what is lost over time. Now, a giant sandbar is being placed for wind and waves to gradually displace the sand. While this sounds like the exact same thing that was happening before, there is actually a larger amount of sand being dredged at once, but instead of it happening every five years, it can happen every twenty. This hopefully decreases the effect on surrounding wildlife and decreases how often the sand must be fixed. This creates a barrier for the surrounding area, keeping most of the water at bay with the sandbar.
The Dutch are leading experts in the world of sea level rise. While they have been able to figure out many ways to reduce or protect Amsterdam and the rest of the country from this part of climate change, they also know that sometimes it’s more important to retreat from the issue than attack it. Some farmers have been moved to higher elevations so that they don’t have to worry about the effects of flooding. Hopefully, in 2050 Amsterdam will still exist and still be thriving, but that depends on the innovations created and a potential slowing of climate change.

Disclaimer: This is my personal point of view and I published it late because of my holiday.
AWS Summit is an event organized by AWS and sponsored by many tech companies. There AWS showcase their technologies and also companies have many presentations on their experience with AWS, and how AWS accelerated their work. It covers many aspects from basic to advanced and trendy such as security, governance, Data processing, Machine Learning, AI. What I found amazing is that this kind of AWS event is all FREE.
Last year in April I went to AWS Summit 2022 in Brussels. That was the first time AWS organized such an event after Covid time, also was the first time I joined AWS Summit, so it felt very special. This year I got familiar with the concept of the AWS Summit, so I’m more curious about the content, rather than the setup. Moreover, luckily this year it was in the Netherlands where I live so I did not have to travel that far.
This year, the main topics I found seemed to revolve around ML, AI, data, and security.
Highlights/ my note from the talks that I attended:
The use of Quantum technology is increasing. Many countries are increasingly investing in Quantum Technology. The map on trend shown by the presenter mentioned it. I found this is very good to raise awareness about what is happening with this technology. It is also good that they mentioned some other aspects such as Sustainability
AWS tech stack learnt: Quantum hardware: Amazon Braket
This talk was quite long and to me, the AWS presenter topics were a bit boring. It was more like a small version of Re:Invent where he mentioned, for this problem, you can use that AWS service to solve it or so. There was a more enticing talk though, was the Efteling presenter talking about using models to suggest the customers places to go. Efteling is an amusement park in the Netherlands and is in the top 5 amusement parks in Europe. It is nice to know how they used data to help the company's innovation. Also, the keynote hall is massive and looks very cool
AWS tech stack learnt: One thing the presenter mentioned is Zero ETL Future — for a data person like me, I’m curious to know more
Then came the lunch break in the big hall with variety of food.
The 4 days of ML training were very helpful to understand the part where AWS explained Fraud Detection. Therefore basically it was not new for me, except for the Graph-based approach to manage payment fraud. The graph-based approach detects fraud using relationships among entities and attributes. It uses SageMaker (Deep Learning Graph Library), Amazon Neptune
AWS tech stack learnt: Graph-based approach
The main hall was divided into 4 parts with 4 presentations. I like the concept of using headsets (looks like a silent disco) — but it was hurting my ears after I wear them for some time. Among other presentations, this is a more realistic version. It mentioned the journey of a big organisation to go to the cloud. Key points are the people, the mindset, and cooperation (they work with TCS)
Observability: To measure of how well you can understand a system from the work it does. Observability: a virtuous circle. Its 4 pillars are something basic that I mentioned also in EKS course: metrics, logs, traces, profiles (tracking function calls, CPU, IO, network to trace to the code)
Full stack o strategies:
outside in: from end-user
inside out: from backend application, measure internal performance
I know that this one might be too much detail and not so interesting, but I was still curious. This presentation showed the process from collecting hospital data with Amazon Health Datalake, or collecting third-party data with Amazon AppFlow until using Sagemaker to predict the waiting time when going to a hospital.
AWS tech stack learnt: Amazon Health Lake, Amazon AppFlow
The queue to get in was super long, but luckily it moved fast so it took me about 20 minutes to get inside the hall Amsterdam RAI.
I wanted to attend a talk at 9.30am but that was only when I arrived at the queue, so I missed it.
Experience for next year: I want to join some F1 racing or DeepRacer. I didn’t prepare to bring my laptop. I will look into it next year, seems fun.
Food and drink last year was better, they had nice cocktails at the end of the day
While we were drinking wine and Heineken, a magician came and showed us some fun tricks with cards and coins. That was very fun. I still didn’t get why I had a pen marker passing from the magician's hand to my hand…

A city with buildings are like made from cookies, canals, bicycles, cheeses, tulips, wooden shoes… A cultural heritage! Moreover, it is filled with freedom. Such a liveable, alive, peaceful place with young and old sides.
After having trips to many European cities, arriving in Amsterdam in late hours (11 p.m.) was making me nervous. I thought, the city would be in sleep and deserted. On the contrary, Amsterdam was awake! I felt completely safe.
We spent our first night relaxing and sleeping. The next morning started with a walking tour to Museumplein. Rijksmuseum is such a gigantic museum and we only have 2 days in Amsterdam, so we skipped.
Then, the museum of my dreams: Van Gogh Museum! Unfortunately, I have a story to tell… My friend and I were so excited and we immediately bought a museum ticket. We had a message from the bank of the card that we made the payment, we didn’t look for details and thought ‘we succeeded’. Until our museum visiting hour, we sat on Vondelpark and ate something, wandered around Amsterdam’s modern streets ( not that classic streets…). After all of them, it was to visit Van Gogh. With cheerful faces, we went to ticket-control points. No. There was no ticket for us. It was really sad because all the tickets were sold out… However, we didn’t give up and bought tickets for another day. Such a relief…
The museum was a-w-e-s-o-m-e. Feeling and seeing those paintings which I admire and choose for drawing… It was unique. We also looked at painting from a microscope. It was not like what I expected. It was wild.
Also, the cafes in Museumplein were wonderful.
We wandered a lot in random streets. It was joyful! Exploring somewhere is why I love traveling.
While wandering, I tasted lots of cheese. Cheese heaven! I’ve never tasted cheeses with coconut, green pesto and lavender aroma before. They all were delicious.
We also went to Dam Square, Red Light District, Anne Frank House, Bloemenmarkt…
Our dinner was fried potatoes in Manneken Pis with truffle mayo, peanut sauces. The sauces, potatoes all were EXTREMELY DELICIOUS! I definitely recommend it. We tried both potatoes with sauces and potatoes with separate sauces, I prefer the second one. Also, while eating delicious potatoes, looking at the canal view is such a core memory.
We couldn’t buy the famous cookie… The place was closed at 4.30 p.m. So sad :(
To explore and experience Dutch culture, we went to Zaandam. Because of a timing mistake, we only saw lego-like-buildings…
Our Flixbus station was in Sloterdijk… It was pretty far from the center and our hotel. When I think about the station, I just have goosebumps.
I really loved Amsterdam. I want to go again ❤
Overall
Amsterdam is not very suitable for a student budget. I want to visit Amsterdam again with a rich budget and that time I must have more cheeses, have van stapele cookies, have a canal tour, go to Zaanse Schans, visit Anne Frank house, attend Tulip and King’s day…
Regards, Ozlem.

The culturally bloated, artistic, and liberal city of Amsterdam, with its eight hundred thousand plus bicycle population, copious coffee shops, and infamous Red Light District, had us undoubtedly intrigued by its kooky character.
We were assiduous walkers during our two-day experience — and rightfully so. Much needed to be done for two tourists seeking refuge in Amsterdam’s guilty pleasures.
The Goods:
After snoozing, and taking intermittent snack breaks on our four-hour train ride from Frankfurt, Germany, we arrived at the highly anticipated travel destination of the Netherlands.
Kathleen and I exited the Amsterdam central train station to the likes of some sunshine and brisk wind and began our foot journey to the hotel.
In a state of sensory overload from the city’s unique surroundings and busy tourist activity, we shuffled through the area of Dam Square, stopping every so often for a photo or to heave our overnight bag to my other shoulder: going against the advice of the hotel’s tram ride suggestion was a great way to greet our new cultural friend.
Between the bickering over a Madame Tussaud building photo and my complaints over having to carry the “heavy stuff,” our patience…

Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, is renowned for its picturesque canals, historical buildings, and vibrant cultural life. With such a rich history, it is a place I have found stunning. However, its urban planning and architecture have evolved significantly over the past century, balancing preserving historical charm and embracing modern sustainability principles. This intricate dance has led to notable successes and challenges in creating thriving communities harmonizing with the city's natural geography and cultural ethos.
Amsterdam’s urban planning has always been influenced by its unique geography. The city’s layout, characterized by concentric canals known as the “Grachtengordel,” was initially designed in the 17th century during the Dutch Golden Age. This historic planning emphasized functionality and aesthetics, creating a beautiful and practical cityscape. However, as the city grew, new challenges emerged, requiring innovative solutions to accommodate a growing population while preserving the area's historical integrity.
In the 20th century, Amsterdam faced significant urban development pressures. The post-war period saw a surge in modernist architecture, focusing on efficiency and functionality. However, this often came at the expense of the city’s historical character. The construction of high-rise buildings and large-scale infrastructure projects sometimes clashed with the traditional low-rise, dense urban fabric that defined Amsterdam.
One of Amsterdam’s significant successes in urban planning has been integrating modern sustainable practices with historical preservation. The city has implemented policies prioritizing the adaptive reuse of old buildings, converting them into modern residential and commercial spaces while maintaining their historical façades. This approach not only preserves the city’s cultural heritage but also reduces the environmental impact of new construction.
Amsterdam’s Eastern Docklands is a shining example of how thoughtful urban planning can transform an industrial area into a vibrant, sustainable community. Once a bustling hub for maritime trade, the docklands fell into disuse by the mid-20th century, leaving vast expanses of derelict land. The redevelopment of this area in the late 20th and early 21st centuries showcases how innovative urban planning can successfully integrate historical elements with modern living requirements.
The Eastern Docklands project began in the 1980s to convert the obsolete industrial space into a mixed-use residential and commercial district. Unlike the high-rise developments in other parts of the world, the Eastern Docklands favored medium-rise buildings, typically between 3 to 7 stories, which complemented the traditional Amsterdam skyline. This approach ensured that new developments did not overshadow the historical city center and preserved the human-scale urban fabric characteristic of Amsterdam.
The planning process was highly inclusive, involving architects, urban planners, and the community. The result was a series of distinct neighborhoods, each with its unique architectural style yet harmoniously integrated into the overall urban landscape. The Borneo-Sporenburg area, for example, features innovative row houses with private gardens and public spaces that encourage social interaction. The Java and KNSM islands blend modern architecture with maritime heritage, creating visually striking and functionally diverse neighborhoods.
One of the critical successes of the Eastern Docklands redevelopment is its emphasis on sustainability and community-oriented design. Green roofs, solar panels, and energy-efficient building practices are standard in the new constructions, significantly reducing the area's environmental footprint. Public spaces, parks, and waterways were carefully integrated into the design, providing residents with ample recreational opportunities and enhancing the area’s aesthetic appeal.
The docklands’ design also prioritizes walkability and cycling, aligning with Amsterdam’s broader commitment to sustainable urban mobility. Extensive cycling paths and pedestrian-friendly streets encourage residents to use bicycles and walk, reducing reliance on cars and contributing to a healthier, more connected community.
Furthermore, the Eastern Docklands redevelopment incorporated a mix of housing types, including affordable housing units, to ensure a diverse population. This inclusivity fosters a vibrant community where people from different socio-economic backgrounds can live, work, and socialize.
The success of the Eastern Docklands redevelopment lies in its holistic approach to urban planning. By respecting the area’s historical context, prioritizing sustainability, and involving the community in the planning process, the project has created a thriving, dynamic district that serves as a model for urban redevelopment worldwide. The docklands have become a sought-after residential area known for its quality of life, architectural innovation, and harmonious integration of the old and new.
The lessons learned from the Eastern Docklands can be applied to other urban redevelopment projects. Emphasizing mixed-use developments, sustainable practices, and community involvement are critical strategies for transforming underutilized areas into vibrant urban spaces. As cities worldwide grapple with sustainability and urban growth issues, the Eastern Docklands is a testament to what can be achieved through thoughtful, inclusive urban planning.
Another success story is the city’s extensive cycling infrastructure, which has been integrated into urban planning to reduce car dependency and promote a healthier lifestyle. Amsterdam’s network of bike paths and cycle-friendly policies have made it one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world, significantly lowering urban pollution and enhancing the quality of life for its residents.
Brandevoort, a neighborhood in the Dutch city of Helmond, is a remarkable example of modern urban planning that successfully integrates traditional architectural styles with contemporary living standards. Designed to resemble a conventional Dutch village, Brandevoort blends the charm and aesthetics of historical townscapes with the functionality and sustainability required for modern urban living. This neighborhood has become a benchmark for new urbanism in the Netherlands, illustrating how thoughtful design can foster a sense of community and enhance the quality of life.
The development of Brandevoort began in the late 1990s with a clear vision: to create a new residential area that respects and reflects the rich architectural heritage of the Netherlands. The planners and architects drew inspiration from historical Dutch towns, incorporating features such as narrow streets, gabled roofs, and picturesque canals. This traditional aesthetic fosters a sense of familiarity and belonging among residents, attracting visitors who appreciate its quaint charm.
However, Brandevoort is not just about replicating the past; it seamlessly integrates modern sustainability practices into its design. The neighborhood includes energy-efficient buildings, green spaces, and robust infrastructure for cycling and walking, reducing reliance on cars. Using sustainable materials and renewable energy sources further underscores the commitment to creating an environmentally friendly community. These efforts not only enhance the quality of life for residents but also contribute to broader environmental goals.
One of the standout features of Brandevoort is its focus on fostering a strong sense of community. The layout of the neighborhood encourages social interaction and community engagement. Central squares, local shops, schools, and recreational facilities are strategically placed within walking distance for most residents, promoting a vibrant regional economy and a close-knit community atmosphere.
Integrating mixed-use buildings allows for a blend of residential, commercial, and recreational spaces, ensuring Brandevoort remains lively throughout the day. This mix of functions supports local businesses and provides residents convenient access to amenities, reducing the need for long commutes and encouraging local engagement.
Moreover, Brandevoort’s urban design includes a variety of housing types to accommodate different demographics, from young families to retirees. This diversity enhances the community's social fabric, making it a dynamic and inclusive place to live.
Brandevoort’s success lies in its ability to harmonize the old with the new, creating a nostalgic and forward-thinking community. The neighborhood’s design principles offer valuable lessons for urban planners and developers. Brandevoort demonstrates that modern urban developments can be functional and beautiful by prioritizing sustainability, community, and aesthetics.

Despite these successes, Amsterdam has faced challenges and failures in its urban planning journey. One of the significant issues has been the tension between development and preservation. The drive for modernization and expansion sometimes led to the demolition of historically substantial buildings, sparking public outcry and resistance. For instance, the construction of the Bijlmermeer, a high-rise housing project in the 1960s, was initially hailed as a modernist triumph but soon became a symbol of urban failure due to poor design and social isolation.
The Bijlmermeer, commonly known as Bijlmer, was conceived in the 1960s as a utopian vision of modern living in Amsterdam. Designed by architect Siegfried Nassuth, Bijlmer was planned as a high-rise residential area to embody modernist architecture and urban planning ideals. Its innovative hexagonal layout and extensive green spaces aim to provide a harmonious, efficient, and socially integrated environment. However, the reality diverged sharply from these aspirations, leading to challenges and failures that ultimately transformed Bijlmer from a symbol of modern utopia to one of urban dystopia.
The design of Bijlmer was heavily influenced by the principles of Le Corbusier and the modernist movement, which emphasized clean lines, functional living spaces, and the separation of different urban functions. The area was planned with a clear distinction between pedestrian and vehicular traffic, vast open spaces, and high-density residential blocks meant to foster a strong sense of community. The high-rise buildings were intended to provide spacious apartments with ample natural light and views of the surrounding greenery.
Despite its innovative design, Bijlmer faced significant challenges from the outset. The timing of its construction coincided with changing housing preferences in the Netherlands. By the time Bijlmer’s first residents moved in during the late 1960s and early 1970s, there was a growing preference for low-rise, single-family homes over high-rise apartments. This shift in housing demand led to difficulties in attracting residents to Bijlmer.
Moreover, the social and economic composition of Bijlmer’s population deviated from the planners’ expectations. Initially intended to attract middle-class families, the area became home to a diverse population, including many immigrants and low-income households. The high concentration of disadvantaged groups, coupled with a lack of adequate social infrastructure and employment opportunities, contributed to social isolation and economic hardship.
Initially praised for its innovation, the architectural design soon revealed several practical flaws. While theoretically ideal for community building, the vast, monotonous concrete structures often felt impersonal and alienating. The separation of pedestrian pathways from road traffic, though meant to enhance safety, resulted in labyrinthine walkways breeding grounds for crime and vandalism. The large open spaces, initially envisioned as communal areas, needed to be more utilized and better maintained, further contributing to a sense of neglect and decay.
Maintenance issues exacerbated these problems. The sheer scale of the high-rise buildings made upkeep expensive and challenging. As the area aged, the lack of proper maintenance led to deteriorating living conditions, with frequent reports of broken elevators, water leaks, and general disrepair. This decline in the physical environment mirrored the social challenges, reinforcing a negative feedback loop that further stigmatized the area.
Bijlmer’s failure can be attributed to a combination of design flaws, changing social dynamics, and inadequate planning for the socioeconomic realities of its residents. The high-rise utopia envisioned by its planners did not account for the human need for more intimate, human-scale environments. The grand, impersonal architecture failed to foster the sense of community it aimed for, leading instead to social isolation and alienation.
Extensive redevelopment efforts were undertaken in the 1990s and 2000s in response to these challenges. Many of the original high-rise buildings were demolished and replaced with low-rise housing, and significant investments were made in improving infrastructure, public spaces, and social services. These efforts aimed to address the underlying issues of social segregation and economic disparity while preserving some elements of the original vision.
The story of Bijlmer offers critical lessons for urban planners and architects. It underscores the importance of flexibility in urban design, the need to adapt to changing social preferences, and the necessity of integrating social and economic planning with architectural innovation. Bijlmer’s experience highlights that successful urban environments must balance visionary design with practical, human-centered considerations. As Amsterdam continues to evolve, the lessons from Bijlmer’s ambitious but flawed experiment serve as a cautionary tale and a guiding framework for future developments.
Social engineering in urban planning, particularly during the mid-20th century, often led to the creation of monolithic housing estates that did not cater to the social and cultural needs of the residents. These projects sometimes resulted in social segregation and failed to create cohesive communities.
Today, Amsterdam’s urban planning is guided by sustainability, inclusivity, and community engagement principles. The city moves from top-down social engineering approaches towards more participatory planning processes. This shift recognizes the importance of working with nature and local communities to optimize urban living.
Modern projects focus on enhancing green spaces, improving public transportation, and creating mixed-use developments that combine residential, commercial, and recreational spaces. For example, the Zuidas district, also known as the “Financial Mile,” is being developed as a mixed-use area with a strong emphasis on green buildings and sustainable infrastructure.
Amsterdam’s urban planning reflects a delicate balance between preserving historical character and embracing modernity. By prioritizing sustainable practices and community-oriented development, the city continues to evolve in a way that respects its rich heritage while addressing contemporary needs. This approach ensures that Amsterdam remains a vibrant, livable city that harmonizes with its natural and cultural environment.

Earlier this week Bloomberg published an article about a meeting of multiple cities in Amsterdam last month “to forge an alliance in response to Airbnb and Uber.” This headline misses the mark; it is both misleading and glosses over what actually happened. I should know: I was at the meeting.
The Global Sharing Cities Roundtable was conceived by the City of Amsterdam several months ago, as an opportunity for cities who are leading efforts to understand and promote the sharing economy worldwide. Participant cities ranged from Seoul, whose Sharing City initiative dates back to 2012 and includes everything from a city-owned space sharing platform to investment of public funds in more than 50 sharing economy initiatives, to Copenhagen, whose sharing economy strategy is linked to its goals for sustainability and the circular economy. Of course, Amsterdam played a leading role — as Europe’s first self-declared sharing city, home to numerous sharing economy enterprises and a fresh approach to policy reform.
Airbnb and Uber were discussed at the roundtable. But to be clear: the roundtable was not “about” them. The purpose of the roundtable was for cities to meet each other — the overwhelming majority of them had never been in contact before — and to engage in blue-sky thinking about the sharing economy’s potential.
True, Amsterdam’s innovative approach to policy reform for homesharing and short-term rentals was one topic discussed, due to popular demand by other cities. But it was only one topic. Dozens of other topics were also part of the agenda. Ridesharing and ridehailing were another popular topic, though ironically Uber itself barely came up. Rather, more time was spent on brainstorming how the sharing economy can link with waste reduction initiatives, serve to rethink delivery of public services, engage youth and elderly, and potentially help tackle a wide range of other social problems for cities worldwide. The Bloomberg article misses the mark in failing to detail — or even acknowledge — this much broader agenda.
I was honored to be invited as the only non-city employee. (For full disclosure, I have advised several of the cities in attendance.) Bloomberg reached out to interview me but did not follow through in doing so. Meanwhile, none of the people quoted in the interview were at the meeting. With all due respect, this falls short of what I would expect from one of the world’s most esteemed publications.
The sharing economy is about much, much more than Airbnb or Uber. We should know that. It is extremely frustrating to see the media focus disproportionately on what is but one piece of a much larger pie. It is increasingly easy to single out one or two companies, but by doing so, we are missing the forest for the trees — and missing a much bigger opportunity.
April Rinne is an independent advisor to sharing economy companies, governments, policy makers and investors worldwide. She is a Young Global Leader at the World Economic Forum and an inveterate globetrotter (93 countries and counting).

I have lived in the Netherlands for nearly four years now, the past two in Amsterdam. Because I moved here during the pandemic and then was sick quite a bit for the last year, I haven’t done as many of the touristy things as I might have liked.
Starting August 1st, things are about to change.
My family lives on the same block as I do, but they are going away this year for August. That means I will be on my own in my beautiful apartment.
I have decided to pretend that I am in a beautiful vacation apartment in a city I don’t know well and act like a tourist. I will visit museums and gardens, take a canal tour, and do anything that seems fun. I will probably even take some of my own advice:
medium.com
And, of course, I will regularly write about it, so stay tuned!

From Bicycles to AI Agents: How Amsterdam Changed the Way I Think About AI,https://nwijesekare.medium.com/from-bicycles-to-ai-agents-how-amsterdam-changed-the-way-i-think-about-ai-111f5a910569,"Sign up

Not long ago, I found myself in Amsterdam — one of those “I need a break, but let’s call it inspiration” kind of trips. I was wandering along a canal with a ridiculously good coffee from a tiny cafe that looked like it had been decorated by someone who really loved vintage postcards and didn’t believe in chairs that match. I wasn’t thinking about work. Or at least I told myself I wasn’t.
At some point, I was standing at a crosswalk near Jordaan, watching bicycles zip past — one woman riding no-handed, coffee in one hand, phone in the other, somehow gliding through this chaotic mess of tourists and trams like it was nothing. And I just stood there, kind of stunned by how everything was working. No signs, no instructions, no one directing the flow. Just people navigating it together independently, but weirdly in sync. I don’t know why, but it made me think of AI agents and the way they should work — fluid, reactive, quietly doing their thing without being micromanaged.
If you’ve ever watched Amsterdam cyclists at rush hour, it’s like a ballet — chaotic but balanced. Dozens of people moving independently, but somehow in harmony. There are no detailed instructions, no central planner shouting orders, and yet everyone knows where they’re going and how to get there.
That’s exactly how we should think about AI agents — not as rule-bound bots waiting for step-by-step commands, but as autonomous systems capable of interpreting vague goals and getting things done. Rather than telling them exactly what to do, you provide a clear objective, like “Draft a user-friendly changelog from these commits”, “Find three good flights next Friday that don’t land before 10am” or “Clean up this spreadsheet and flag anything that looks off.” And the agent figures it out. It plans, makes trade-offs, calls tools, revises, and checks back when needed — all without being micromanaged. Just like a cyclist adjusting their route on the fly to avoid a crowd or take a shortcut.
Amsterdam cyclists don’t know every street by heart. But they don’t stop pedalling every time they hit a new neighborhood. They ask. They glance at signs. They check their phones mid-ride. They adjust without missing a beat.
That’s exactly what Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables in AI. Traditional models rely on what they learned during training but that knowledge gets stale. RAG allows agents to “ask” for updates from real-time sources: internal wikis, live documents, recent chats, or APIs. The model doesn’t have to memorize everything; it just needs to know when and how to retrieve what matters.
Imagine asking an assistant, “Can you send the updated vacation policy to the team?” Without RAG, it might make something up or pull in outdated info. But with RAG, it actually retrieves the real policy from your Google Drive and shares the correct details. It’s like giving your AI access to your company’s memory, so it doesn’t just sound confident, it is accurate.
It’s the difference between blindly guessing your route and checking the map mid-ride. Cyclists don’t freeze up when they’re unsure — they adjust. That’s the spirit behind RAG: staying curious, staying responsive, and rolling with the unknown instead of rigidly sticking to a script.
If you have ever ridden a creaky old bicycle through cobblestone streets, you know: even a good system needs upkeep. In Amsterdam, riders are always tweaking something: fixing a squeaky brake, tightening a loose seat. You’ll see tools everywhere like air pumps on the sidewalk, little repair stations on corners. It’s just part of keeping things rolling.
This is the dance of AI-for-code and code-for-AI.
On one side, tools like Copilot, ChatGPT, and Cody are transforming how we write software. They help generate boilerplate, catch bugs, write tests, and even explain complex code. They’re like having a bicycle mechanic riding shotgun, tightening bolts as you move.
But on the flip side, code-for-AI is where the real infrastructure gets built. It’s where you define your agent’s behaviors, their constraints, their tools, their norms. It’s how you make sure your AI doesn’t veer into the wrong lane. You give it a frame, a drivetrain, a set of rules.
What’s exciting is how the two are starting to build on each other: as AI gets better at coding, it becomes easier to create smarter, more dependable agents and those agents, in turn, help us write even better code. But it’s not just about moving fast. It’s about holding up over time. You don’t just want an AI that can sprint — you want one that can go the distance, and patch things up when they break along the way.
The magic of Amsterdam isn’t just the bicycles — it’s the unspoken rhythm everyone seems to follow. People just know when to slow down, where to ride, how to signal. It’s not about strict rules or endless signage. It’s something built into the culture. That shared understanding is what keeps everything flowing, even when the streets get packed.
That’s what Model Context Protocol (MCP) does for AI. MCP defines how agents interact with tools, with other systems, and with users. It gives them structured context about what’s available, what’s off-limits, and how to behave in a given environment. It’s like a silent rulebook that all agents agree to follow. Without MCP, each agent is a rogue cyclist dropped into traffic with no map and no idea what a red light means. With MCP, every agent enters the environment already knowing the rules — not just for itself, but for the broader system it’s riding within.
The future of AI isn’t just about making individual models smarter. It’s about building shared standards and frameworks that let these agents work together smoothly and safely in real-world situations. Think of it this way: training the model is like teaching someone how to ride a bicycle, while MCP is like giving them a map and the rules of the road.
Watching a group of cyclists ride in sync, adjusting speed, spacing, and direction as one is kind of hypnotic. No shouting, no instructions, just quiet coordination. One slows down a bit, another speeds up, and they glide through a tight turn together.
That’s what agent-to-agent collaboration can unlock. You don’t need one giant all-in-one “super-agent” doing everything. Instead, you want a bunch of smaller specialists who each focus on what they do best, communicate clearly, and work together smoothly. One handles the schedule, another puts together a proposal, and someone else makes sure everything’s following the rules. It’s like a group of riders on bicycles — each with their own job, but all moving in sync because they’re paying attention to each other When agents talk to each other i.e. when they can share state, delegate tasks, escalate decisions, and adapt dynamically they stop being tools and start becoming teammates.
Standing at that crosswalk, I wasn’t thinking about AI. But somehow, AI found me anyway.
What really stuck with me about Amsterdam’s bicycle culture wasn’t just how charming or efficient it was — it was the independence. No one was waiting around for instructions. No hesitation. Just people who understood their surroundings, trusted their instincts, and moved with just enough awareness of others to keep things flowing.
That’s the kind of AI worth building — not rigid scripts, not those bloated, do-everything systems that crumble when things get messy. Instead, it’s about small, capable agents designed to think, fetch what they need, follow protocols, and work together. Tools built to handle the unexpected without constant oversight — to move, adjust, and ride.
Because the future of AI isn’t some bullet train locked to a single track moving fast but missing the turns. It’s more like a fleet of bicycles — light, responsive, and always adapting. And if they can keep your coffee from spilling in the middle of the chaos? That’s a win :)

Beautiful Amsterdam / Built on Poles/ Who would pay if it all fell down?
–Old Dutch nursery rhyme translated
Since early times, the houses in Amsterdam have been built on wooden foundation piles[i] that are driven deep into the clay, peat, and water until they reach the first layer of solid sand. Even some of the trees in Vondelpark are supported on wooden piles to keep them from sinking into the marshy ground.
How long can a wooden pile remain in the ground before it has to be replaced?
300 years? 80 years? Until next week? The answer depends on many variables:
Quality of the sand layer
In Amsterdam, the first layer of sand lies approximately 12 meters below the surface. However, the quality of the sand layer is not consistent throughout the city. In some areas, the first sand layer is thinner than normal or missing entirely. As a result, the houses in these areas sink at an abnormal rate, and the foundations have to be replaced faster.
The top of the wooden foundation pile should be below the lowest expected water level. If part of the pile reaches above the water, it will be subject to insect attacks and decay. A problem is that the water level under Amsterdam isn’t always stable. For instance, it can drop during long periods of drought. Or a sewer pipe can develop cracks, allowing the ground water to flow into the pipe and be carried away. As a result, the water level drops.
On the other hand, if the water level rises too high, as sometimes occurs after a heavy rain, the Amsterdam cellars and crawl spaces fill up like bathtubs.
Construction projects can also interfere with the water level. An example is the incident on the Vijzelgracht in 2008 during work on the new metro station. A leak in the dam wall at a depth of 60 meters caused water and sand to stream into the pit. Part of the sand layer that was supporting the wooden foundation piles of the nearby houses washed away, causing extensive damage to the structure of the houses.
Spruce is less vulnerable to damage from bacteria than pine. Since around 1970, piles made from pine are prohibited from use. Concrete and steel piles are often used in present day construction.
The visible signs are slanted floors, cracks in the walls, doors and windows that stick, and broken front steps. The charming crooked roofline of Amsterdam is actually a symptom of unstable foundations.
If a foundation that is in poor condition is not repaired in time, the wooden piles will need to be replaced. No homeowner wants to get this news. A new foundation can easily cost 100,000 euro. Furthermore, the floor may need to be opened up, thereby making the house unlivable for some time.
In recent years, the housing corporations have been replacing the wooden piles under their properties with concrete piles.[ii] For example, Ymere is replacing the decayed pine piles in the Van der Pek neighborhood — a costly investment. However many houses that are at risk are privately owned.
The condition of the old wooden piles will only worsen in the coming years, so the question is: who will pay?
[i] Referred to as poles in the nursery rhyme.
[ii] Palen onder Amsterdam verpulveren

Hi there!
Welcome to a cityscape with unique merchant houses, intersected by numerous canals. Amsterdam is a lively city with a rich cultural scene and 800 years of history.
Forget about the typical tourist traps.
I will tell you the best things you can do for the first time there to feel fabulous.
Stay with me so you don’t miss anything.
Here we go with the Top 10 Must-Do Activities In Amsterdam:
Cycling isn’t just a mode of transportation in Amsterdam.
It’s a way of life!
With over 800,000 bicycles in the city — more than its human population — Amsterdam is often called ‘The Cycling Capital of the World’.This is owed to the city’s flat terrain and extensive network of bike routes.
Experience the city alongside locals on two wheels.
I am sure that you will love Amsterdam’s cycling culture:
www.dutchamsterdam.nl
Grab your saddle and pedal through Amsterdam’s bike-friendly streets.
You will enjoy passing by historic landmarks and picturesque canals.
Try to choose a sunny day or be prepared to cycle in the rain, as is often the case there!
The city of Amsterdam has a unique network of canals stretching to the west and south of the historic old town. The project was initiated during the late 16th and early 17th centuries.
It consists of the reclamation of swampland and the construction of concentric arcs of canals.
The canals, along with radial waterways and streets, showcase the city’s rich history. Now you have a chance to enjoy its beauty and heritage!
Find more information here:
whc.unesco.org
I had the opportunity to step into the evolution of Jordaan.
Once a humble working-class enclave, it has now transformed into Amsterdam’s hippest neighborhood!
Here, you can stroll along streets lined with art galleries, vintage boutiques, and bars.
Amsterdam’s Nine Streets, nestled behind the Royal Palace on Dam Square, attract both locals and tourists alike:
www.iamsterdam.com
Lose yourself along the cobblestone streets and peaceful canals of Amsterdam’s historic district!
Now, get ready for a journey through time. In just 40 minutes, you’ll zip through 400 years of history, starting from a swampy area.
The best part? This museum tells how Amsterdam, a city built on water, came to be:
grachten.museum
The museum itself is housed in a jaw-dropping building on the Herengracht.
Once you’re inside, grab an audio guide and settle in.
Before you know it, the lights dim, and bam! You’re whisked back to 1600, smack dab in the middle of Amsterdam’s golden age.
But wait, there’s more! This museum isn’t just about history.
It’s also about the city’s vibrant life.
The doll’s houses are straight out of the past and snippets from cult classic movies.
Yeah, it’s that cool.
Ever wondered what it’s like to live on a houseboat? Well, now’s your chance to find out!
Step aboard the Woonboot Museum, a cozy floating museum housed in a converted cargo ship from 1914:
houseboatmuseum.nl
You can sip tea and enjoy cake while lounging in retro armchairs.
But that’s not all — Amsterdam’s houseboat scene is a unique way of life. Dive deeper into its story at the Boat Museum of the Canals.
Located on the famous Prinsengracht, this museum offers a glimpse into Amsterdam’s aquatic past and present.
Learn about the evolution of houseboats, canal history, and more.
After all, where else can you get a firsthand look at life on the waterways?
Explore one of Amsterdam’s most powerful historical sites, the Anne Frank House.
Enter the hidden annex where Anne Frank and her family sought refuge during World War II.
Here, you’ll uncover the truths of the Holocaust:
www.annefrank.org
In this museum, you will see Anne’s actual diary and other relics.
I was inspired by the lasting message of courage and hope.
Experience the world of art at the famous Van Gogh Museum.
You will see the largest collection of Vincent van Gogh’s masterpieces!
This museum provides a close look into the life and art of the iconic Dutch painter:
www.vangoghmuseum.nl
Admire his lively paintings, sketches, and personal letters, witnessing the journey of his artistic brilliance.
Dive into centuries of Dutch art and history at the legendary Rijksmuseum:
www.rijksmuseum.nl
Discover masterpieces by Rembrandt, Vermeer, and other masters, highlighting the richness of Dutch culture.
From stunning paintings to decorative arts and more, the Rijksmuseum invites you now.
As soon as I walked into the Heineken Brewery, the delightful aroma of hops surrounded me.
Exploring the brewery’s vats and vintage equipment, I discovered the story of Heineken’s beginnings and their dedication to brewing excellence:
www.heinekenexperience.com
No wonder it’s my favorite beer!
The tasting room was a highlight for me.
With every sip, I savored the essence of Heineken’s craftsmanship. Heineken truly deserves its high regard in the brewing world.
Do you enjoy this beer as much as I do?
As the sun dips below the horizon, Amsterdam ignites with exciting nightlife.
The Red Light District, famous for its legalized prostitution, is a must-see spot and that caught my eye too:
amsterdamtickets.tours
I wandered through lively streets with friends, enjoying its unique vibe.
But there’s more to see in the district than just its reputation. Amongst the buzzing nightlife, you’ll discover a fascinating mix of history, culture, and cutting-edge experiences.
Explore cozy cafes, trendy bars, nightclubs, and live music spots.
Amsterdam offers endless possibilities for nighttime adventures.
Whether you’re into groovy beats or prefer a chill night with locals, the city promises unforgettable experiences until the early hours.
Ready to dive in?

In conclusion, Amsterdam invites adventurers with its captivating mix of past, present, and excitement.
Whether you’re gliding along its famous canals or diving into its rich art scene, this city has something for everyone.
So, what are you waiting for?
Get ready for an epic adventure through Amsterdam’s beating heart!

The last time I ventured to Amsterdam was 20 years ago, so I decided that it was perhaps time to make a return visit and see what had changed. When most people think of Amsterdam they automatically and quite rightly think of Anne Frank, the beautiful canals and the tulips (& maybe even the brownies).
However, as is always the case, going slightly further afield can offer other sights and events. Having been there before, I had already visited the Anne Frank house and museum, and so I decided to spend the limited time that I had available on simply exploring areas of the city and visiting a few other select attractions.

Amsterdam by Ian McEwan certainly isn’t the first novel in the history of literature that deals with moral hypocrisy in a corrupted society, nor is it the last. But the way McEwan deals with it, the approach, the focus — it is all so fresh (even now, in 2015) and remarkable. The narrative instance doesn’t criticize and doesn’t even laugh at those characters. Instead, we, the readers, are encouraged to take the protagonists seriously. There is no bare sarcasm, only the finest irony, essential to characterization and plot. McEwan is a master of the free indirect style. We are in the characters’ heads, thinking their thoughts, afraid of their fears. We are worried that Clive will end up just like Molly. And there is Vernon with his feeling of non-existence, which is a postmodernist moment, for he certainly does not exist until someone reads the novel.
The introductory setting is hilarious. Two middle-aged guys are attending an ex-lover’s funeral. The ex-lower was a kind of femme fatale cliché of the XX century. The sound of the name, Molly Lane, somehow recalls Molly Bloom. There is, also, at least, one more ex-lover of hers, and her husband. They are all connected in various ways, but the existence of Molly deepens those connections. The first two guys are friends and, which is more important, they give us the first two points of view. They are the good guys. According to them, the husband is stupid and possessive. The third lover, a politician, is an enemy of the previous three.
The language of the novel is extraordinary. Characterization is delicate and minutious.
So, we have two bad, and two good guys. And then Vernon appears to be quite immoral and without human principles. Nevermind. There is Clive, with his moral superiority. He is the one who really loved Molly, who deeply misses her, and who doesn’t even want Vernon to publicly humiliate the arch-enemy, by publishing his photos in women's clothes, taken by Molly, and provided by her husband. We also read a long and rather pathetic passage about how Clive had always been a so much better friend to Vernon than he was to Clive.
Just a few pages later, this morally superior guy goes hiking, in search of inspiration, and then witnesses an act of violence, perhaps a murder, and just walks away, because, for god’s sake, he has the symphony to write!
After less than half of the novel, there is no good protagonist left for us to feel empathy for. But, instead of becoming boring, the novel’s plot starts to accelerate, preventing you from letting it from your hands before you’ve read the very last page of it.
The main plot triggers are behind us by now. Clive and Vernon have made a pact: if one of them gets ill the way Molly did, the other will arrange euthanasia abroad. After that, they’ve had the first, but crucial, argument in the history of their friendship. It is about embarrassing photographs of Foreign Minister, Julian Garmony, which were about to be published in the magazine that Vernon runs.
Now comes a deus ex machina — and the first spoiler to Vernon’s plan. A new character, the Minister’s wife, gives a press conference, which turns things upside down. On the sudden, it is not the politician’s head urgently needed on a plate, but Vernon’s.
Vernon and Clive are mad at each other, as they both feel betrayed. They start to hate each other and, in the end, mutually arrange a murder in Amsterdam, where the grand premiere of Clive’s symphony is about to be performed.
It is Molly’s husband who, followed by now ex-Foreign Minister, buries them all. The most of his wife’s former lovers are dead, and now he recalls memories of Vernon’s wife, who used to be wild. He is about to call her for a dinner. So, who is laughing now?
We are. At this moment, I can’t recall any other piece of prose in which the death of the main characters produces such a comical effect. It is even not morbid humor; it is just humor, and it is great.
Ian McEwan won the Man Booker Prize for Amsterdam in 1998.

It’s my third year in the Netherlands. Or, as we Highly Skilled Migrants like to say, year 3 out of 5.
When I arrived in 2022, as full of enthusiasm about the future as the whole newly reopened post-Covid world, the border officer asked me how long I was planning on staying. ‘Maybe forever!’ I replied with a broad smile. (Coming from the UK, I was still used to the image of public officials as banterous teddy bears). Then, I marched straight into the Dutch winter.
I was proud to have intentionally chosen a new country to live in and determined to be happy. As it happens, reality proved to be more complex and less controllable, and not just because of the weather. The job was actually worse than my previous job in London. The housing market was broken beyond understanding. The friendships were effortful and shallow. The relationship I started turned long distance.
And that’s okay. That’s how you fall in love with a city, through a journey of joys and disappointments. You will survive, grow and thrive, as long as you have a guiding principle. Mine, as many other expats in Amsterdam, has always been:
At least stay until the end of the ruling. Then you can always leave.
The Dutch government calls it a “facility” or “reimbursement” as if trying to hide its own intentions. But when you fill any legal forms here, the literally translated question they ask you is “Are you enjoying the 30% ruling?”. I surely am, thank you very much. That’s the purpose of it — it’s an incentive. A tax scheme from 1964, according to which Highly Skilled Migrants don’t pay taxes on 30% of their salary, as well as wealth tax for shares, savings and properties they have abroad. The aim is to compensate them for the cost of moving countries.
Much has changed to this program since its introduction 60 years ago. Firstly, the definition of Highly Skilled Migrant has blurred, from someone with a specific expertise needed in the Netherlands, to someone that earns more than roughly €70k per year. Secondly, the duration of the tax advantage shortened from 10 to 8 to 5 years. And finally, just a year ago, the percentage of tax-exempt salary has decreased. Just like Milka has been gradually replacing cocoa with palm oil and Uniqlo has added polyester to their T-shirts, the Dutch government, too, has diluted its concentration of a promised land.
Between 2010 and 2022, the number of expats in the Netherlands nearly tripled, reaching about 70 thousand. The incentive to attract skilled labour has clearly worked. But instead of celebrating this with a champagne and liquorice candy, officials in the Hague have started to scale back the program. So… attracting expats is now a bad thing?
I think the Dutch government finally realised that it’s neither good nor bad, but it’s complicated.
Learning the local opinions from personal anecdotes and discussions, as well as Dutch media and online forums, I can confirm that the policy has more resonance than a simple reimbursement that it claims to be.
One thing I love about the Dutch is how hard it is to annoy them. It takes a group of stoned British lads disregarding the cyclist's path to cross that barrier. Even then, the worst that happens is a Dutchie elbowing the tourist so that they trip, while they could’ve run them over and still win in any Dutch court (since cyclist paths are sacred and bikes always have priority).
Bottom line is, the Dutch are easy-going people, not precious about things. That’s why very often their opinion about the 30% ruling goes along the lines of: “it doesn’t affect me, so why would I care”, “the policy is there to use it, so let expats use it”, or even: “it’s not right to envy someone when I already have a good life”. Besides, apparently expats are polite and their culture doesn’t bother others.
The neutral attitude can trend towards solidarity and even enthusiasm. Some Dutch people say that their country is too small to keep its economic importance without highly skilled migrants. Expats bring knowledge, innovation and jobs: they are the reason that multinational companies are not afraid to have an office in the Netherlands, which in turn creates jobs for the locals. Everybody benefits.
The “everybody benefits” argument is important for Dutch people, who value equality and are proud of it. That’s why to some, it seems unfair that they may earn the same as their expat colleagues, but take less pay home, based just on their origin.
Still, this group is not hostile to the expats. They’re disappointed that the government facilitates unfair pay by effectively subsidising companies. If companies want to attract talent, they should just offer higher pay to everyone, to make up for the high cost of living in Holland. Some people even argue that the ruling allows companies to suppress salaries.
Then there’s the smallest and most extreme camp. Expats overcrowd big cities, don’t learn the language, don’t contribute to the community, and don’t intend to stay. Make them pay back the cash if they leave within 5 years after their ruling ends.
Which leaves some expats confused, because… wasn’t that the plan all along?
Here I can speak in the first person: we know that we are seen as a contingent workforce. A touch of variety to the local fauna & flora, fertilising the economy as we hop from country to country in search of nectar. As long as most of us don’t stay, we’re not an invasive species.
The point of a fixed-term incentive is to get as much out of the workforce as possible in their productive years, without having to provide for them in old age.
Shortening and diluting of the ruling in the last years proves this point. Highly Skilled Migrants are still incentivised to come, they are still needed. But they are also welcome to leave.
Similarly, an argument can be made that it’s fair not to pay full taxes if you haven’t relied on the country before reaching a productive age.
A Highly Skilled Migrant contributes to the economy from day one. No public money has been invested in their healthcare and education.
Contrary to the locals, though, they need to take the cost and risk of relocating, and so it would seem fair that they are compensated for it. They don’t have a home in the new location and their pension takes a hit. This means that applying wealth tax to their foreign properties or savings wouldn’t be fair either.
Among the expats there is also a radical camp. High cost of living, high taxes, expensive health care, crap weather — you shouldn’t even be questioning why I need an incentive to be here, they say.
Like with the hostile locals, this is a small camp. The majority of Highly Skilled Migrants are just happy to receive the ruling and not make a song and dance about it. Just like the Dutch see them: expats are polite and their culture doesn’t bother others.
Some of the Highly Skilled Migrants will grow roots, if they happen to keep a good job, find a flat, meet friends and partners. Others will see how it goes, and if it doesn’t go great, after five years they will have one less reason to stay.
But during those first five years, nobody knows which is which, including the expats themselves. And so, the best plan is to stay put. Invest, but not so much to tie yourself down. Find friends, but maybe just other expats who are easy to connect with. Learn a bit of language. Keep checking out LinkedIn for jobs in other cities.
Do a little taster of how it’s like to live here, so that in five years, when you suddenly earn 1k less per month, you can make an informed decision if it’s worth staying.
In those five years, expats can be accused of making a poor effort at integrating, but the setup doesn’t encourage it, either.
Don’t get me started on the language, since I’ve mentioned it so many times. It’s not pretty or easy to pick up, has little value outside of this small country, and has to be learned in one’s spare time and out of own pocket. Sure, that’s what the tax break is for, but if it’s up to an individual to decide, realistically they will have other priorities in their budget.
The institutions who need and can afford Highly Skilled Migrants are multinational companies. Their employees will work in a group of other expats and their skill will be niche enough to only be relevant to another multinational company. As a result, it’s unrealistic for such a person to think about switching to a Dutch business.
I’ve described at length what it’s like to make friends and date as an expat. The social circle is not just your friends and partners, it’s also the community around you and even wider, the strangers you meet every day. And this wider Dutch community, just like I’ve described, is characterised by the prevalent sentiment of: “I’m not affected, so I don’t mind”. The easy-going character of the locals allows them to ignore the expats, for good and bad. Even if internally they are annoyed by the cash that expats get, they won’t make a big deal out of it, and just get on with their life.
On the plus side, this unbothered attitude promotes a peaceful coexistence. On the downside, it kills any curiosity in the Dutch about the expats and any motivation in the expats to fit with the Dutch.
I hear it in the uninterested, short smalltalk in polite English from any Dutch person I meet. It can be translated to: I get it, you’re one of the passing expats, coming here to have a good life for a few years and contribute to the economy. I’ll leave you be.
I sometimes wish they shouted back at me in their native language, as it would happen in Paris, Barcelona or even Berlin. It would mean: I want you to integrate! If you choose to live here, I need you to be a part of this community!
But no, they don’t need us to integrate, they understand we probably won’t. They assume we probably won’t. They just don’t care if we do or not.
That attitude of indifference in the Dutch, a very indirect and unplanned consequence of the 30% ruling, is the real reason for the transient character of Amsterdam.
It’s a city where everyone assumes that you may just be on a grown-up exchange program, so by absorbing the local atmosphere, you start to believe that yourself.
Eventually, when your ruling runs out, if you decide that it’s worth it to graduate from a nomad to a settler, you will likely settle outside of Amsterdam anyway. Maybe you’ll look for more space, more greenery, maybe you’ll want to hear Dutch on the streets and contribute to the community. Most likely, you’ll just be fed up with Amsterdam property prices, which have gone up a lot in the last few years, similarly to the number of Highly Skilled Migrants.
The Dutch attitude of “the 30% ruling doesn’t affect me, so I don’t have an opinion about it” ends when their house search starts. Without a doubt, they will find it very hard to buy a property, and at the same time, they will meet many foreigners who are to do it. And now they wonder: does the tax break for expats really not affect me? Or if an expat with spare cash didn’t overbid on the house I wanted, maybe it would’ve been mine?
And that’s how the expats, who are apparently polite and whose culture doesn’t bother others, have apparently caused the housing crisis in Amsterdam. But that’s a topic for next time.

I’m not the author: it’s written on this bicycle basket!
Three words, just as inspiring as the plastic-cleaning initiatives carried out along the river.
This city offers endless sources of inspiration, from biking and boating to street art, nature, shopping, museums, architecture, food, and even cannabis!
For those seeking a thrill, dare to swing into the void at the top of the XXX tower, with its swing above the abyss.
However, cycling in THE bicycle city can be just as exhilarating, having to watch out for fast-moving cyclists and pedestrians.
The key to this city’s success lies in its diverse offerings, ensuring that everyone can find their way around.

This month I am engaged in an experiment. Normally I spend a lot of time with my family, who live only a few doors away from my apartment in Amsterdam. However, they are on a month-long adventure to Great Britain, leaving me on my own. Rather than feeling sorry for myself, I am creating a month’s worth of exciting touristy plans where I am going to pretend to be a tourist in my own city.
I haven’t developed a full itinerary yet. Today, August 1st, I helped my family get to the train station, then came home and relaxed after several days of helping them pack for their own adventure, which consists of biking all over Great Britain and camping for a good portion of that time.
I am also getting started on creating a calendar. I am going to publish the first draft of it, which will consist of a few plans I’ve made in advance by necessity, such as making reservations for the Van Gogh Museum and my oncologist appointment, which was scheduled six months ago. I will add activities as they arise—some of which will be pre-planned, and some will be scheduled the way I most enjoy things: on the fly, depending upon my mood and the weather.
There are a number of things I don’t want to miss, such as going on a canal cruise or visiting some of the less…

Cities and their spaces are designed experiences — we’re just not always aware we’re users. Within these spaces, we encounter countless touchpoints — physical, emotional, and social — all shaping the way we experience them.
With a background in product design and professional experience in UX, I’ve always understood user experience as something holistic, more than digital interactions. But during a recent trip to Amsterdam and Dubai, I noticed something deeper: cities themselves are designed experiences.
Walking through these two very different cities made me reflect on how much urban design and service design overlap. From the ease of getting around to the emotional tone a space creates, I started seeing each city as a living system — one with its own user flows, pain points, and design choices.
In this article, I share some of those observations from my personal experience and the UX lessons I took from them.
My trip began in Amsterdam —a city where user experience extends beyond screens, shaping how people move through their environment every day. One of the first things I noticed was how bikes aren’t treated as a leisure activity or exercise, but as the primary means of getting around. People bike everywhere, even to nightclubs.
Back home in Portugal, cycling is more of a weekend activity — something for fitness or family outings. In Amsterdam, it’s everyday life. That difference struck me, not just because it was unfamiliar, but because it revealed something deeper: how infrastructure shapes behavior, and how behavior, over time, becomes culture. The flat terrain, narrow streets, and widespread bike infrastructure all work together to make biking the most natural choice.
Design made it easy. Culture made it normal.
As I walked alongside the canals, passing locals on their bikes or stepping out of houseboats, I began to understand something about pace and emotional design. The layout of the city encourages slowness. Not in the sense of inefficiency, but in presence. The kind of design that makes you look around more, breathe slower, take things in. Amsterdam moves differently — both physically and emotionally. The environment isn’t just designed for mobility; it’s designed for human connection.
One small detail that caught my eye — and kept coming back to me — was something I might have overlooked if I hadn’t asked about it. I noticed strange hooks jutting out from the top floor facades of the narrow houses. Curious, I brought it up to the friend travelling with me, who had already been to Amsterdam and explained that these are centuries-old fixtures for moving furniture and goods through windows. The buildings are too narrow, the staircases too tight, and so people developed an outside-in system. A centuries-old solution to a simple but real problem:
“How do you get your couch into a house with stairs too small and steep to carry it up?”
It’s a quiet example of design under constraint. Faced with tight architecture (partly shaped by historic tax laws), people innovated through a humble, mechanical workaround. What struck me most is that it’s still used today. It reminded me of a moment in Urbanized, the documentary by Gary Hustwit, where it’s mentioned how the most meaningful urban innovations often come from the bottom up — citizens adapting space to fit real needs.
The second and final part of the trip was spent in Dubai. If Amsterdam felt spontaneous and human-scale, Dubai felt curated — like someone was handling it for me.
Getting around wasn’t just about driving — it was about being moved. From valet parking to full-service fuel stations where we never had to leave the car, every step of the journey felt taken care of.
Across both service and transport, I noticed a pattern: the city was designed to require less from me. Less friction. Less effort. Fewer choices to make. I could compare it to a seamless user journey where each step is thoughtfully designed, with no critical pain points.
In UX, we talk about reducing cognitive load and anticipating needs. In Dubai, it felt like that idea was everywhere. From how you moved to how you were received, the environment kept stepping in for you before you even realised what you needed.
As I settled into Dubai, it became immediately clear that the city was designed with an extraordinary level of attention to detail. In fact, it was so present that I almost didn’t realise it at first.
It wasn’t just that Dubai was clean — it was that someone was always cleaning it. From mall bathrooms to rooftop clubs, I saw staff quietly maintaining the space, constantly resetting it. And that’s when it hit me: it wasn’t just about upkeep; it was an integral part of the user experience.
Most people only notice cleanliness when it’s absent. In Dubai, it was so proactive and seamless that it became a continuous, visible signal of care. There was a sense that the space was always ready for you, that someone had already anticipated your needs. This wasn’t just about hygiene; it was about creating a sense of psychological safety, comfort, even luxury. Cleanliness here didn’t just make the space more pleasant; it made you feel valued. It told you: your experience matters. Everything was designed to make you feel supported, reducing mental load so you could simply exist in the moment without worry.
It reminded me of how digital services work in the background — updating, syncing, backing up — without you having to lift a finger. You don’t see it, but it builds a foundation of trust by keeping everything running smoothly. In Dubai, this same principle applied to the physical environment, where every detail felt carefully planned to keep things effortless.
Behind this seamless experience, of course, is a larger system of labor and structure. Dubai’s focus on high service standards relies on a workforce of trained individuals, which are migrant workers. Their work enables this constant care, and it’s important to acknowledge that the experience of ease and luxury is held up by a whole infrastructure designed to support it.
As a tourist, everything felt designed to be easy, polished, and thoughtful. Not just functionally, but emotionally. It was the kind of design that made you feel cared for, without even realising it.
On a final note, the most striking aspect of my travel experience was how I was addressed. I was consistently greeted with “madam”. It wasn’t just politeness. It was a signal — a small, repeated gesture that carried emotional weight.
You’re seen. You’re respected. You’re valued here.
And what struck me was how consistent it was. Whether I was at a humble restaurant or shopping, the tone didn’t change. The same level of care and attention showed up everywhere. That consistency created something rare: a shared emotional tone across different service levels.
In a way, this mirrored what I’d already been feeling in Dubai: that the city was designed not just to function well, but to make you feel looked after. The details weren’t loud — but they added up. And sometimes, all it takes is a single word to shape the emotional tone of an entire place.
Luxury in Dubai is easily accessible. The views are framed just right, designed to impress and soothe. You got the sense that someone had considered how you might feel at every turn.
Of course, none of this is accidental. Dubai’s focus on aesthetics and hospitality is a cornerstone of its identity. The city markets itself on these experiences. It is curated — carefully and deliberately — to feel seamless. But even knowing that, it still worked. What stayed with me wasn’t the imposing skyline or luxury touches, but the quiet signals of care: a clean space, fuel stops anticipating needs, and a respectful “madam” at every place. It reminded me that thoughtful environments — digital or physical — aren’t just designed for function. They’re designed to shape how we feel.
In Dubai, that feeling was clear: you’re being looked after. It was frictionless, anticipatory, and emotionally consistent. A good experience designed end to end.
Looking back, it’s clear how deeply our environment shapes our experience — often in ways we don’t even realise. Whether through frictionless mobility systems, services that anticipate needs, or subtle cues that build trust and emotional safety, thoughtful design operates on many levels at once.
What surprised me most was that, in a place known for innovation and cutting-edge tech, it wasn’t the digital interfaces that left the strongest impression. It was the experience of navigating the city itself — the people, the spaces, and the seamless care in every interaction.
Great user experience — whether in a product or physical space — isn’t just about usability. It’s about how we feel while interacting with it: confident, cared for, at ease.
This trip reminded me that UX and service design extend far beyond screens. Every touchpoint — human, digital, or physical — shapes the journey. And in the best cases, that journey feels seamless — not because it’s invisible, but because every detail works in harmony to support the user.
A note on context
The perspective in this article comes from my experience visiting Amsterdam and Dubai as a tourist. While my time in Amsterdam was shaped by exploring the city on my own, in Dubai I stayed with people who live there. That experience gave me a different kind of access — more immersive and seamless — which naturally shaped how I experienced and noticed the city.

When I woke up the next day I knew I was cooked. I’d wanted to go to Italy, but that wasn’t realistic anymore. My engine was puttering. Plus, I was almost out of Adderall. I only had 4 pills left, enough for one more day and a plane flight. So, by that math, I had one more night left.
Using the hostel computer, I booked a one-way ticket from Amsterdam to O’hare for the following day at 5pm (17:00). I also booked new lodging for my final night. It was an outdoor campy-type place about 20-minutes away from the city center. On their website, it looked more like a trailer park than a hostel. There were no amenities other than the communal grills, firepits, and bathrooms. It was definitely weird, but I didn’t mind weird, so I rolled the dice, hoping for a day of peace and quiet. I had a lot of notes to go through and memories to piece together, and that seemed like the perfect place to do it, away from the world, on mushrooms, in a trailer. That’s what Hunter Thompson would have done to make sense of a romp of that magnitude, and Hunter was my North Star.
After checking out of the hostel and saying goodbye to Karim, I went to take care of one last errand. What do you do when you’re completely exhausted and need a little extra pep that speed can’t give you? You buy shoes, of course. The right pair of shoes can give you super powers. Throw in a haircut, and you can defeat an army.
Before passing out at the concert, I remembered noting that Raekwon had on a snazzy pair of blue and red Nike Dunks. That’s probably what planted the seed. Plus, my brown low-top Converse were mangled and nearly unwearable. So, I set out on a mission to find the perfect pair of life-saving shoes to propel me through the rest of the trip.
After an hour of searching, I was just about to give up, when I saw them in the window of a skate shop. I immediately knew they were the ones. I stood staring at them like Wayne from Wayne’s World did with his dream guitar. They looked like beautiful chocolate covered bananas, immaculate, and completely in line with my style, other than the 130 Euro price tag. They were emergency medical shoes though, so cost be damned. (Insurance should really cover fly shoes).
I paid the guy right after lacing them up and gave him my old Converse to toss. I felt like a new man. I was ready for whatever the next 24 hours had to throw at me.
After buying some mushrooms (I still had a ton of weed left), I checked out of my hostel, called a taxi, and headed to the trailer park. Saying goodbye to Amsterdam wasn’t easy, which made the ride a little emotional for me. Throughout my hectic 6-week trip, Amsterdam had been my home base, a place where I always felt comfortable. For some reason I just fit in there. The city opened their arms for me — Willy Nelson, Karim, the bouncer at the Melkveg, Neil, even the pseudo-pimp who chose to spare my life— they all looked out for me at a time when I needed it most. I felt so grateful to all of them.
I saw hippies before I even got out of the taxi, which made me uneasy. (For someone who doesn’t like jamband music, I find myself around people who do quite often.)
“Don’t worry about the hippies,” I told myself, “ you’re motherfucking John McEnroe.”
I wanted to get into the mushrooms before the sun went down, so as soon as I familiarized myself with the trailer and the surrounding area, I got right to it. I’d purchased the same style of mushrooms I had before. I’m that way with everything. If I like something, I will continue with it until it burns me, be it restaurants, people, or socks. I always get out when the gettin ceases to be good.
I took them around 5pm and wandered around in my flip flops, waiting for them to kick in. When they did, they kicked in hard, like a mule or the DEA. I took the same amount as the last time, but for some reason I was 10 times as high. When I went back into my trailer to gather myself, the exact opposite happened. I completely freaked out. My vision wasn’t right. I had no clue what was going on. I grabbed a pen and wrote, “EVERYTHING IS RED”. There was a mirror in the trailer, and I made the mistake of staring into it. DO NOT make that mistake during a bad trip. During a good trip, maybe, but never during a bad one.
The mirror was firey red and my face was peeling off. Blood was dripping from my chin, it was a horrifying scene. There was also this awful sound, like the kind you hear when someone presses the red emergency button at a nuclear power plant. My brain was in crisis.
I splashed water on my face in an attempt to tamp down the flames, but it didn’t work, so I started removing my clothes. They had bad juju all over them, and they needed to go.
As I was taking my pants off I looked down. That’s when it hit me.
“I’m not wearing my shoes! What the fuck was I thinking!?”
As soon as I put them on, my vision went back to normal, and the blaring alarm in my head stopped. To make sure I wasn’t losing my mind (I was absolutely losing my mind), I took them off again. Everything turned red. I put them on once more. No red.
Then, I heard a knock at the door.
“OH SHIT,” I whispered, tossing on a new shirt.
If you’ve ever taken hallucinogens, you know a knock at the door is the last thing you want to hear. The sound itself is paralyzing. Anything can be behind that door, and I mean ANYTHING. There are no limitations to what the brain can conjure.
Then, there was a second knock.
They weren’t going to give up, I could feel it in my bones. I had to open the door and face my fears. Most trips, in some way or another, are about facing your fears.
I walked over to the door and placed my hand on it to see if I could feel any weird vibrations. Nothing.
Then I grabbed the knob and turned it slowly, hoping the person had already left. When I opened the door I was greeted by a smiling, shirtless hippie with dreadlocks.
“Hey, sorry if I scared you, man. I’m Liam. I wanted to invite you to join the group. We’ve got a fire going and we’re just jamming out. It’s pretty chill.”
While I tried to comprehend the words he was saying, he began staring down at my feet intently.
“Those shoes. They’re amazing,” He said, slowly.
“Trust me, I know. I’m really high on mushrooms and they just saved my life,” I told him, just as slowly.
“Ha, sounds intense. I’m on mushrooms too. We all are.”
Before I could tell him I didn’t do well in groups, Liam walked me over and started introducing me.
“This is Sam. He’s really high. Be nice to him.”
“Sweet shoes,” one of them said. “They look like chocolate covered bananas.”
“They do, don’t they?” I said, enjoying my inside joke.
We hung out for a few hours. They played their guitars while I just stared into the fire. We didn’t talk much, but it was nice. No one felt the need to fill the air with bullshit. We just utilized the good vibrations to enjoy our own thoughts. The red was a long lost memory, and the fire didn’t scare me one bit.
When the drugs started wearing off I thanked the guys for their company and made the walk back to my trailer to call it a night. To be safe, I kept my shoes on inside. I wasn’t going to make the same mistake twice. Lying in bed, I grabbed my notebook and a pen.

Was Johnny Mac a hippie?
AM I A HIPPIE?!
I stayed in bed until noon the next day, relaxing in silence and smoking joint after joint. I felt terrible about wasting weed and I still had a quarter ounce left that I didn’t want to just leave in my trailer. If I’d seen anyone on the property other than the manager I would have given it to them, but I didn’t. When the cab driver picked me up, I could tell he wasn’t an option either, so I just stuffed the remainder into my pants pocket, assuming I’d be able to give it away at the airport.
After the cab dropped me off, I stood right in front of the exit, next to the “No Weed Past This Line” sign, and held the baggie in my open hands. “Free weed, get your free weed. Take as much as you want. Free weed here,” I yelled like a peanut vendor. People just walked right past me though, one after the other. I was in disbelief. No one wanted free weed. Every 20-something that I stopped declined. Some said they had their own, while others declined based on strain preference.
“These snobby bastards,” I thought.
I stayed as long as I could, smoking cigs, and advertising my goods. After an hour of embarrassment I gave up and threw it in the garbage (just like the stand-up comedy fliers I used to pass out in exchange for stage time). I was pissed off for the first time since I’d been in Amsterdam. It wasn’t the weed thing, I was just irritable. I didn’t want to go home. Home was where the problems were, where that awful basement was and all those terrible memories. I had no place else to go though. It was my mom’s or nothing, at least for a little while.
And just like that, my trip was over. I felt trapped again.
The flight home was anxiety filled. Instead of reading or writing I just sat there and stewed. I’d quit comedy, graduated college, left to find myself, and returned to the same exact spot, completely clueless about what to do next. The only thing I knew was that stopping to mourn and take care of myself was not an option. I had to keep running, no matter the cost.

So, you are visiting The Netherlands? Don’t get stuck in Amsterdam- visit Texel! You will love it, and here is why.
Texel Island can be found in the North Eastern part of The Netherlands and is one of the five Wadden Islands, also known as the West Frisian Islands, where many city dwellers have chosen to escape the busy lifestyle and settle on this thriving yet peaceful island. The word “wadden” refers to the mudflats that appear with the ebb and flow of the tide. You are just there in under two hours from Amsterdam Schiphol airport by car — including the ferry.
Some even call it the “Ibiza of The Netherlands” which underlines the relaxed attitude by the locals and the existence of many beach clubs.
Here it is: my 5 favourite spots!
This area is part of National Park the Dunes of Texel and has an open connection with the North Sea. Wander around and discover the many creeks The Slufter has. Great for hikes, bird watching — over 80 species breed here every year.
The most northern part of the island had a giant stretchy beach with a pretty lighthouse built in 1863. This makes up for long evening sunset strolls. If you are in a sporty mood you can climb the inside of the historic lighthouse by day.
My favorite place for breakfast in the lovely unofficial capital of Texel — Den Burg. They offer free coffee or tea with a paid breakfast if you order before 10.53am — random, ha! Around the open kitchen you will find all types of sourdough bread, wonderful sweet pastries and lightly roasted coffee. Must visit. Location link (Google Maps) | Website
Visiting with kids? They will love Ecomare which educates and shows how they care for seals of all kinds. Don’t miss out on the daily seal feed every morning.
Location link (Google Maps) | Website
When I visit Texel I often go to this place. Get the best strawberries locally grown and picked here! If you are into it, you can wander around in the food gardens and pick your own vegetables and fruits for a small fee. You can also get buy local products here and take it with you before you depart to the ferry.

Yay, this was my very first Medium post! If you love this story, make sure to Subscribe.

After visiting the many great talks of the Voxxed Days I started my journey home to resume my responsibilities as a parent. While leaving the conference location I saw people already entering the Pathé building for the movies that evening. While part of the community was still sharing their thoughts upstairs at the venue I looked back at a great conference. The nine or so hours I stayed flew by and this was all made possible by Codelab, sponsors and volunteers, so thank you for your efforts.
I saw many familiar faces that also decided to do something else than work, meetings or chores that day. The sun was definitely shining outside the sky was blue and people were happy. IT people almost naturally retreated to the dark movie theatre rooms.
The conference started for me with Sander Hoogendoorn talking about AI and what it can bring developers and companies. A massive boost in capabilities, creating bigger things with the same team. In my opinion the use of AI will probably increase the amount of tech debt and developers will be still needed to actually fix problems and write better code. Sander also mentioned that AI must be seen as a tool for developers it would be good to embrace it or you will miss opportunities.
After that Sander Mak told a story about taking risk and not being afraid to fail. Failure is part of learning, true words. At the company Picnic they introduced Calcite for querying over databases, this lead to many changes and some very challenging ones. This change allowed the more technical business users to get data with their own queries without going directly to the separate databases. Calcite provides federated querying and makes queries database independent. I left the room with a positive vibe both keynotes were great.
Many more great talks followed and many of them I was not able to visit. I very much struggled with the fear of missing out. One of the talks I really liked was about Redis 8. Raphael De Lio showed in rapid pace, and with a live demo, some of the new features which include fast vector search. Something that makes Redis very useful for AI applications.
One of the overlying themes of the conference I observed was loose coupling, on every level of a software platform. In the code as the hexagonal architecture and the use of Spring Cloud Functions. The latter is ideal for separating business logic from cloud specific logic Elena van Engelen-Maslova told us. For logging, tracing and metrics the use of Open Telemetry and on the infrastructure side the use of tools like Rancher. Also for testing the need for better integration testing between external interfaces has become possible with the use of a tool like Testcontainers which was mentioned in the talk of Adam Michalik.
It’s nice to get advice which I can apply directly the next day and that was given by Paco van Beckhoven about merge requests (roll eyes, yes Gitlab). A template for a merge request with checklists is useful according to him. Also it always good to provide the reasons for the changes in the merge requests. I think carefully reviewing MR’s will become even more important if more of the code is not written by a person
It was getting late and the final talk would soon start. I did not know what to expect. After 5 minutes it became clear it was like a nightmare story for engineers. Adele Carpenter provided a story about airplane systems and how we as software people can learn from the reasons for planes crashing. Often it was mixture of systems having no useful alerting and redundant systems making it more complex to understand what is going on for the pilot. This hits home because badly communicated redundancy was the reason for a recent production failure of a system I am working on.
While walking back to the metro station I was divided, on one hand I felt comforted because I had seen people doing their utmost to improve and create software, platforms and processes and on the other hand the need was shown for even more secure, green, reliable and well architected software. The world as we know has become more unpredictable and with IT becoming more critical it feels like we need to be better prepared for the unexpected.

I used to think flowers were a sign of weakness, a delicate fragility that I couldn’t afford to indulge in. Femininity seemed like a luxury, something I couldn’t permit myself to embrace. I hid my love for it, buried deep where no one could ever find it.
But she did.
I was walking down the street when I saw a bunch of blooming flowers, I photographed it then a smile formed on my face, feeling giddy with all the colourful blossoms in front of me.
She had a way of unravelling me, peeling back the layers I had so carefully constructed. She learned my language, deciphered the unspoken truths I kept locked away. She discovered my secret affection for spring, their vibrant petals whispering of beauty and life.
Someday,
she would say, her eyes twinkling with dreams,
we’ll go to Amsterdam together and walk through fields of tulips.
I never believed her. Not really. Our lives were a constant dance of reality and dreams, with reality often winning. But she was different; she believed in the power of dreams.
The rain drizzled gently against the cobblestone streets, each droplet a whisper of sorrow from the grey sky above. A lone figure stood by the edge, cloaked in a heavy coat that did little to shield against the biting chill of late autumn.
We never made it to Amsterdam together. Life intervened, pulling us apart in ways we couldn’t mend. Two years passed since the last time she learned my language, each day stretching the distance between us. I thought time would dull the ache, but some wounds only deepened.
Then, I received the call. The words were cold and final:
She’s gone.
She had gone to Amsterdam alone. She had gone to find solace among the field of tulips, but now, she lay beneath them, the place of our unfulfilled dreams.
I booked a flight without thinking. The journey felt like a cruel joke, a pilgrimage to the land of what-ifs.
As the plane descended, I remembered her voice, her promise of tulips, and my heart shattered once again.
I made my way to her grave, a simple plot marked with her name. Tulips surrounded it, their colours mocking my pain. They were the flowers I had secretly loved, the ones she had promised to show me. And there she is, in the middle of it all.
I let the tears fall, unchecked and raw. The tulips swayed gently in the breeze, their petals brushing against my skin. They felt like her touch, a reminder of what I had lost. She had been my only refuge, now, she was gone, and all I had left were these cursed flowers.
Standing up, I whispered to the wind,
Meet me in Amsterdam.
but there was no one left to hear. The tulips nodded as if in understanding, their vibrant colours a silent testament to a love that could never be.
From now on, I would walk through life crying for flowers, for the tulips, for a dream that died too soon, I buried my heart among the petals and turned away, forever changed.

Two weeks ago I decided Amsterdam would be my place to settle, hoping finally this would be the place for me and even though I had been warned by my peers and colleagues, I did all my homework, studied the market and told myself that it couldn’t be as hard as finding an apartment in China, where everybody just spoke Mandarin to do so.
I was extremely wrong, the market here is insane, maybe because we are in a post-covid season and the city is blooming with tourism, perhaps is the interest younger people have towards trying the so-called “legal drugs”, it might be due to the high season rental as schools and Universities are starting again or simply just a slip from the Dutch government when considering housing options for everybody.
The reality is that thousands of people are competing on a daily basis to find an apartment, a room or at least a long-term stay without paying a kidney and a half for it.
I got an Airbnb type of apartment via Expedia, it was a great deal for one week, only paying 917€ after my Genius 30%…

I’ve been more time as an adult in Amsterdam, than in my home country. In Amsterdam, there are many options for everything. But be careful. It’s so very easy to get lost in Amsterdam. For me Amsterdam is stressful.
Study
In Amsterdam, you will find all sorts of studying careers, and people are very free on choosing. Many Dutch people drop out in the first or second program because “they don’t like it”. And is very normal to try different things. Education is many times in English. However I would say that education can be very stressful because it’s a bit chaotic and challenging at the same time. You have to do everything by yourself, and teachers are more mentors than teachers. It’s like you never can really relax, and you have to think a LOT in every subject, because education here priorities thinking by yourself, they absolutely infinitely 100% hate things “by the book” (typical Dutch). Of course, you meet people from everywhere. Your colleagues are from everywhere. It can be stressful, especially if you come from cultures where “everything is organized”, where you know what you really gonna learn, where grades matter a lot, where everything has a specific linear way of being. In Amsterdam simply things are free.
Informality
Here no one likes any form of formality. Everything must be informal by default. No one absolutely no one cares about formal clothing, and genuinely everyone will hate that. It’s not…

Amsterdam moves. People walk briskly, bikes fly past, trams glide along their rails. Everyone seems to have a place to be, a purpose to fulfill. And yet, despite the chaos — bikes weaving through pedestrians, cars stopping and starting, boats slipping quietly through the canals — there’s a strange kind of order. No honking, no shouting, no visible frustration. Just movement. It feels like watching a symphony with no conductor, a city that somehow just knows how to keep itself in rhythm.
I sit by a restaurant window and watch it all unfold. The rain-speckled glass blurs the edges of passing figures, turning them into something out of a painting. I catch glimpses of them — sharp jawlines, loose scarves, hands tucked into the pockets of long coats. I find myself romanticizing over every woman that walks by, assigning them stories they’ll never know they’ve been given. She’s on her way to meet a friend. She’s heading home after a long day at work. She’s just as lost in thought as I am.
And then there are the couples. The ones who share a cigarette outside a café, the ones who lean into each other on their bikes, the ones who don’t need words to fill the space between them. I am content here, alone, but I can’t help but envy them. Amsterdam is beautiful on its own, but I imagine it would be even better when shared.
The Dutch language wasn’t a necessity — I could’ve gotten by just fine without it — but I’m glad I learned it anyway. Even simple exchanges feel like small victories, a way of stepping further into this place instead of just passing through it. And the food? The beer? It all just sits better. There’s a freshness to it, a simplicity. I don’t leave meals feeling sluggish, just satisfied.
Maybe that’s the feeling I’ll take home with me — not just the admiration, not just the longing, but the quiet contentment of being here. The realization that I don’t have to understand how everything works to appreciate that it does.

By Johannes Novy
When COVID hit the Netherlands in 2020, Amsterdam emptied of visitors overnight. Long-term residents, inured to the permanent noise and litter and tourists peeing in the streets, welcomed the newfound tranquillity. The pandemic, they told the Washington Post, was “a blessing in disguise”.
COVID has offered a rare, if not unique chance to address tourism’s enduring problems. From how people reach destinations to how tourism is managed within the cities it floods, not to mention the way its benefits and costs are distributed to local communities, the burden of overtourism has long been a concern.
Amsterdammers aren’t the only city dwellers to perceive the current pause as a much needed relief. From Kyoto to Venice, residents see a return to pre-pandemic tourist numbers as a threat, not a promise.
For years, we’ve been told that tourism needs to be sustainable, without much consensus on what sustainable tourism looks like. COVID, meanwhile, has seen the term “resilience” become a go-to for industry insiders and policymakers. But what exactly is resilient tourism? And can it make our cities any more socially and environmentally responsible? Can it make them any better to live in?
Broadly conceived as the ability to manage adversity, resilience is touted as an essential quality for coping with uncertainty and change, stress and shock. As trends go, resilience isn’t new. It was Time Magazine’s environmental buzzword of the year in 2013. It has since become one of the dominant tropes in contemporary debate on everything from island studies and child psychology to urban disaster risk reduction.
The pandemic has of course brought global tourism to a virtual standstill. In 2020, 1 billion fewer international trips were made to tourist destinations than in 2019. Up to 120 million jobs were threatened. So thinking about how this industry, which previously supported one in ten jobs worldwide, might cope with the stress and shock of COVID is no bad thing.
However, critical geographers and political sociologists alike have warned that the concept of resilience is in danger of becoming as empty a notion as sustainability. It has its roots in ecological and engineering thinking, wherein it refers to the ability to return to normal － to a state of equilibrium — after a period of adversity. Critics argue though that, in the social world, we deal not with equilibrium structures, but constant flux.
In a city, there is no normal state to return to. And those affected by natural hazards — a coastal mega-city prone to flooding, say — were vulnerable to begin with. Returning to an original state is therefore as undesirable as it is impossible. Instead, cities adapt.
More broadly, resilience thinking is deemed inherently conservative. With the emphasis it places on bouncing back, it is underscores reactive and short-term solutions. These distract from the need to address the root causes of major challenges such as climate change.
It is also not as harmless a theory as it may seem. When politicians insist that investing in a more resilient city is plain common sense, they often downplay issues of power and inequality. New Orleans is a case in point. Rebuilding after hurricane Katrina in 2005 came at enormous social cost, when the city privileged economic gain over the needs of marginalised communities.
Resilience is nonetheless an elastic concept, and it is increasingly associated not only with the ability to bounce back after a setback, but also to bounce forward — to a new and better state. The UK government’s slogan “ Build Back Better”, has become the mantra for a myriad post-COVID ambitions, particularly with regard to tourism.
That said, as travel restrictions are lifted and the cruise ships return to Venice’s St Mark’s Square, mere weeks after the Italian government promised they wouldn’t, it looks like this golden opportunity to rethink tourism has been lost.
Governments generally seem more interested in a return to business as usual than in thinking about how much tourism we can actually afford. Calls to come up with a fairer, less exploitative model have, at best, been met with a muted political response. Governments appear loath to discourage business trips, despite climate scientists advocating for less air travel, because they bring in money.
Any attempt to make tourism truly resilient, however, has to go further than short-term economic recovery. It has to address the tourism sector’s carbon footprint and its injustices and ethical quandaries.
In this respect, Amsterdam presents an interesting model. COVID has accelerated the implementation of several measures under consideration well before the pandemic took hold. The city has adopted ordinances that variously prevent souvenir shops from displacing local businesses, developers from turning residential spaces into holiday lets, and new hotels from being built.
Elsewhere, it has hiked up the tax tourists pay for overnight stays and introduced measures to reduce the so-called incivilities (littering, public urination) they unthinkingly leave behind.
More broadly, it has become the first city ever to embrace British economist Kate Raworth’s doughnut economics model for sustainable development. This theory centres on the environment and the basic needs of its citizens as opposed to economic growth. The council has pledged to use it as a guideline for all future policies that govern urban life — from emissions regulations to fixing the city’s housing crisis.
It is still too early to say whether these efforts will pay off. Without a similarly bold rethink, though, more residents will likely rebel against the touristification of their communities. If, on the other hand, more cities follow the Dutch capital’s example (as Copenhagen, Brussels, Dunedin in New Zealand and Nanaimo in Canada are reportedly doing), the idea of a real bounce forward might indeed apply.

Within minutes of having waved each other goodbye we received a call from the friend. He seemed worried, having received some information about the train schedules, and wanted to make sure we had not been affected.
It happened to be the final episode of what had been a forgettable trip to what is otherwise among the most preferred travel destinations for my partner and I.
There are lots of things about the Netherlands that we simply adore, and it is precisely these aspects that make us head to that country over and over again.
The Netherlands is by far the country that we have visited the most, so much so that every time we head there, we have to look for places that we are yet to visit. It is also a fact that, while we have been to a lot of places in the Netherlands, there are still quite a few that we are yet to visit.
Having said that, there is also a flip side to everything, and this narrative is about a trip to the Netherlands when nothing seemed to work for us.
Amsterdam is the largest city in the Netherlands, and definitely the most beautiful. During my early visits to this country, it was palpably the first…

By the time we visited Amsterdam, we read enough blog posts and talked to other travelers who raved about Amsterdam and figured we just had to go there. It just didn’t do it for me.
As a person who enjoys the beauty of architecture, it wasn’t as stunning in comparison to the other places I’ve just traveled through in Europe, Brussels and Barcelona. Amsterdam is a place of things to do over a place of things to see. If you really want to enjoy Amsterdam then you should focus on the houses, and museums, as there are few stunning points of interest in the city.
Amsterdam felt like a trip to Brooklyn, N.Y. on steroids, which made sense after I learned Brooklyn and Harlem were designed by the Dutch and New York used to be New Amsterdam.
Being that Amsterdam is a place of things to do, I focused on food, museums and the major attractions.
The major visually pleasing attractions:
Must try foods / snacks:
Must Do Activities:
Note: Only a select few ‘coffeeshops’ sell alcohol at theses establishments
I think 2–3 days in Amsterdam is more than enough to be able to enjoy what it has to offer. I’d schedule the visit for a weekend so you can enjoy the party scene in Amsterdam as well. I can’t say I’ll be back to visit any time soon, but I will say this is a place I could easily live in because there’s plenty to do.
Pro Tips:
Almost everyone in Amsterdam speaks English
The Dutch are very rude, but just be aware of it and accept it , New Yorkers are rude as well
Bicycles have the right of way, get out of the way or they WILL hit you
Look left and right before crossing and beware that you’re not accidentally in the bike lane

My journey to Amsterdam started in Paris, and to be honest, I was desperate for Amsterdam because I compare it to other places all the time:
Sin City vs. the City of Love. But, this is just a preamble.
On the first evening, I met with some speakers from the conference, and we did an excellent night tour. The next day, I went to the fantastic Van Gogh Museum, which encouraged me, with a cultural elixir, to continue my art.
Preparations for the conference were underway at full speed, and organizers were working like bees and doing their best to bring all React lovers around the world to one place. That place was Amsterdam.
After some preparations and checking the area where I would talk, I went to the boat speaker dinner, which was a lot of fun. I met React rock stars, and we officially put the React Amsterdam flag up.
Surfing between bikes and boats,I arrived at the meeting in the early morning full of energy after a fantastic breakfast in the middle of the city.
That was a well-organized event, and I met a lot of curious people who were seeking new knowledge and frontend energy.
It causes me to remember my first conference in Moscow. The community has grown so much since the first React release. Now, React is not a geeky thing; it is the enterprise standard. Now, React is not a question anymore.
The React native session surprised me a lot; I did not expect some prototypical framework that I saw two years ago to become a big thing.
Also, I had recorded a marvelous frontend podcast during the conference to share my knowledge with the Russian speaking frontend community.
My talk was the last one. It took a lot of coffee to be ready to spread my energy and show cool stuff.
Many people said the music was bombastic and that they want me to continue playing on the stage. ;) I’ve decided next time I will do a Full Music of React session. :) Why not?
I want to thank the organizers for this opportunity to speak at the most prominent React conference in the world. See you all at something big next year.

Amsterdam is a truly unique and beautiful city that’s well worth a visit on any European adventure. It’s best known for its canal houses, abundance of tulips, and easy biking trails. With world-class museums, quirky festivals, theater, live music, laid-back bars and delightful restaurants, there’s never a shortage of things to do and see in Amsterdam… The best word to describe Amsterdam is ‘tolerant’. The world famous red-light district, coffee shops might make it a city of sin, but in truth, it is a city of freedom. And in freedom, most people find sin…

“Your body is not a temple, it’s an amusement park. Enjoy the ride.”
-Bourdain
The ferry dropped us off at the Amsterdam Centraal train station at 2pm, amid the most perfect spring day. It looked like a real-life Truman Show, the way everyone was smiling and laughing without a care. Even the pigeons looked happy, chilling by the canal, generously sharing food.
It made me wonder…
Are people happy because they’re in Amsterdam, or do happy people just gravitate there, making it so? Hard to tell. Sounds like a chicken/egg situation. Speaking of which, I’ve always wondered if people weigh more because of their genes or because their caloric intake is higher, and they work out less. Like, if you took two people who eat and workout the same amount but one’s family has been fat for generations (like mine) and the other skinny, would they end up weighing the same exact amount? I ask because I’ve always felt predisposed to fatness due to my dad’s genes.
Before looking for a hostel, I wanted to get high, so I went in the first “coffee shop” I saw. Now would be a good time to describe the difference between coffee shops in America and coffee shops in Amsterdam. They look the same, except in Amsterdam, some sell weed. Pretty simple.
I ordered a pre-roll and a latte. If cocaine and heroin together is a speed ball, weed and coffee together is more like a curveball. Part of me felt demure, sitting there smoking a joint by myself in a café. The other part though, was high as fuck, and VERY paranoid. The American penal system was so ingrained in me that my Pavlovian response to being high was an intense fear of the police. No matter how much I reassured myself that I wasn’t breaking the law, I couldn’t shake the fear of being arrested. You don’t realize you’re paranoid amidst the paranoia. If you did, you wouldn’t be paranoid.

On my walk to find a hostel I couldn’t stop laughing at the ridiculousness of the street names. I wrote some of my favorites down. I also made up some of my own. See if you can guess which are which. I can’t even remember myself.
- Brouwersgracht
- Hosenlendinvein
- Princeneiland
- Amsterveenseweg
- Grunarpeilveg
- Einelpenilhar
- Brouwersgracht
The hostel I chose was a far cry from The Flying Pig, the “it” place I’d read about in my research. The Flying Pig was the most popular hostel for people under 30 (still is) because it has a weed smoking section in the common area where they have pipes and bongs to rent. There was a communal element, one I was not looking for. I don’t like being part of groups and try to avoid it whenever possible. I want to do what I want to do, not what “us” wants to do. “Us” is always some lame compromise. Instead, I went with an off-brand hostel, one that catered to an older, more laid-back crowd. When I booked it online from London, the picture made it look like a nondescript Holiday Inn Express. It was a little off the beaten path, but not too far from the action. It seemed clean, calm, and quiet, exactly what I wanted.
When I checked in, it did seem both clean and calm. But, to my surprise, I heard jackhammering. When I inquired, the manager told me there would be construction every day from 9am-5pm. I thanked him and went up to my room.
That’s how I am, I thank people who inconvenience me. I’ve always been way too accommodating, even to my own detriment. I try to save the world one favor at a time. I could have very easily found another hostel that didn’t have Jackhammering, but that, somehow, in my mind, would have been considered breaking a commitment. The hostel was probably struggling because of the jackhammering, and I wanted to help. I know, that’s crazy.
When I got up to my room, there was, in fact, a man jackhammering five feet from my window. It sounded like the gunfight from Heat. So, I turned right around and got out of there.
On my way down I saw the Manager again.
Manager: Sir, how is your room?
Me: Perfect. Thank you.
I still had an hour to kill before the jackhammering stopped, so I set out to buy weed, enough to last at least a week. After 5 minutes of walking, I stumbled upon a place called Coffee Shop Bob Marley. From the outside, it looked exactly like you’d think it would, Jamaican flag, pictures of Bob, Wailers albums. It was corny, but it would do. Afterall, they had weed for sale.
When I entered, I was greeted by an old budtender who looked exactly like Willie Nelson, all the way down to the bandana. From his voice, I could tell he was an American ex-pat. He handed me a Trapper Keeper-style three ring binder. In it were plastic pages with little slots for what traditionally would have been baseball cards. Instead of cards though, each quadrant contained a nugget of weed, along with a description (e.g. purple haze: mellow, euphoric). It was the first time I’d seen such a professional setup, and it blew me away. I’d smoked weed daily for 5 years but had never dreamt of such a variety. I’d hit the motherload.
After much consideration, I selected 4 indica strains and paid Willie 60 Euros for the 14-gram purchase, an amazing deal anywhere in the world at that time.
Me: May I light up in here?
Willy: Of course. The smoking room is in back.
The smoking room was just a small, curtained off area with a few high-top tables. A Bob Marley music video played on the television hanging on the wall. I put my bag down and removed a grape White Owl cigar that I’d bought before leaving London. At the time I was still smoking blunts and I wanted to “represent” my “culture” while in Europe. Ha. What I didn’t consider, was that I’d barely smoked the previous two weeks in New York. And, though I smoked a few hash spliffs the night before in London, my tolerance was still lower than usual. Regardless, I went ahead and rolled a 2.5-gram monster of Afghan Kush.
There were two other people in the room with me, a couple, who both appeared to be in their 30’s. I couldn’t hear their voices, but I assumed they weren’t from America. I did that with everyone who wasn’t traveling in a group. There’s just something about Americans, we love traveling in guided groups. Very rarely did I see a duo of American travelers, let alone a solo one. When I dumped the guts of the blunt into a garbage bin near the wall, they stared in my direction. They didn’t say anything, but I could tell they were interested in what I was constructing. I was proud of my blunt rolling skills and wanted to put on a show for them, so they could see how we did it in the states. I considered myself an ambassador.
After licking the blunt closed, I sparked my lighter, running the flame along the paper to dry it out. Then, I lit it, taking a deep drag and coughing slightly. The couple, again, glanced my way. I looked back at them, smiling like a cool dude.
About halfway through the blunt, I realized I’d made a huge mistake. I wasn’t cool at all. In fact, I was sweating bullets and overcome with dizziness. I could tell the couple wanted to check on me, they just weren’t sure if it was their place to do so. I mean, I must’ve known what I was doing, right? You don’t just roll a blunt like that if it’s your first time smoking weed.
My equilibrium was totally askew. I gripped the small, circular table like we were Greco Roman wrestling. I had to say something before it was too late.
Me: My name is Sam. I’m from America. If I die, my mom’s name is Audrey —
Then I passed out and fell off my chair.
When I came to, Bob Marley’s I Shot the Sheriff was playing on the tv. The couple was hovering over me, disturbed, their highs obviously ruined. Willie was concerned too, standing over me with a bottle of water. I didn’t even know how long I’d been out.
Willy: We were scared, man. Glad you’re ok. We don’t even allow cigars in here.
Lady: That was so scary. Why would you try smoking that whole blunt?
Me: You know what blunts are?
Guy: Of course. We’re from America too.
*
On my way back to the hostel, I passed what looked to be the strangest food establishment I’d ever seen. It reminded me of a Gray’s Papaya, a New York hot dog chain I loved, in that there was no seating inside. In fact, there was nothing at all inside. It was just an empty room, like an American check cashing place. Yet, it smelled like fast food. It was too weird to not investigate.
When I went in, I thought I was tripping out. I was still extremely high and woozy from the fall, but I was pretty sure I was standing inside a life-sized vending machine. The walls were lined with rows and rows of slots where hot food was kept. There must have been a kitchen in the back where everything was prepared, but I didn’t see one, nor could I hear one. The only sign of human life was the hand of an employee replenishing the stock after a sale. I didn’t love the impersonality of it all, but I had to admit it was ingenious.
My dad would have loved to have access to a place like that, where he could anonymously buy food without the judgement of a cashier. It’s just you and the food, no interaction whatsoever, perfect for an addict.
I was enjoying my burger on a nearby bench, when off in the distance I saw the glow of the Red-Light-District. Until that point, I’d thought the name “Red-Light-District” just referred to the illicit activities that went on there, I didn’t know it was a literal description of the place. It looked like a devilish carnival, the dope dealers being the carnies, and the ladies, the rides. Young adults, mostly backpackers, lined the outskirts, trying to get up the nerve to make the plunge. “How pathetic,” I thought to myself. “I can’t believe I’d wanted to do this.”

March 26, 2006
After a wonderful night of stoned sleep, I woke up to my alarm at 8:45am, which left me the perfect amount of time to shower, eat, do laundry, and get to the Smart Shop right when it opened. They call places that sell mushrooms “smart shops” the way they call weed stores “coffee shops”. I’ve always found that to be telling. Those are delicate, non-fear inducing terms. We don’t have “safety stores” in America, we have “Gun and Ammo” shops. Rather crude, if you ask me.
I’d done mushrooms a handful of times before, with experiences ranging from spiritual bliss to utter madness, but I’d always learned something about myself in the process, and that was the most important part. Wait, that’s not totally true. Sometimes, I just spend 4 hours in the bathroom trying to wipe pee that isn’t there off my pants. A psychologist would have a field day with that one.
When I entered the Smartshop, I was greeted by the kind of guy you’d think would be running a psychedelic mushroom store, long hair, flannel shirt, monk vibes.
Clerk: How may I help you?
Me: Can you please advise me on which mushrooms I should take, and the quantity?
Clerk: Of course. That is exactly what I am here for. Have you done psilocybin before?
Me: Yes, maybe 20 times.
Clerk: Ok, let me walk you through what we have.
He took me over to a glass case with about 15 varieties of mushrooms, some wet, some dry, all of them unique in shape and color. He walked me through their different levels of potency and their array of effects.
Me: How about something in the medium-strength level?
Clerk: Sure. Would you like to see visuals?
Me: Yes, please.
Clerk: I suggest 1 to 2 grams of the High Hawaiian variety, dried.
Me: Will they make me laugh?
Clerk: Ooohhh yeah.
I paid him 25 Euros and exited the Smartshop with my mushrooms. Then, I walked over to the canal. There was a light mist, so I found an unoccupied bench and dried a small spot for myself. I took the mushrooms out of my bag, along with a banana I’d saved from breakfast and a bottle of water. Then I said my usual pre-hallucinogen prayer. “Lord, please look after me during this trip. And please, please don’t let me think I peed my pants.”
Once I had the mushrooms down and the nausea passed, I sat back and read my book until the words no longer looked like words, maybe 30 minutes. That’s when the laughing started. EVERYTHING was funny. I spent 10 minutes laughing at my shoes because they looked like chili dogs. Then it was the word “wanker.” I couldn’t stop saying it. “Oy ye wanker”, “Aye wanker, quit ya wanking”, “Bloody, scheming wanker.”
Down the canal a few hundred yards away, I saw a tourist boat slowly approaching. There were about 20 or so passengers, all of them Asian. They looked so happy, with their big visors and smiling faces. I was overcome with the urge to connect with them. I stood up and waved my arms, yelling to them as they passed.
“Helllloooooo!!! Welcome to Amsterdam!!!”
They waved back jubilantly, while I cry-laughed in the rain like a maniac, yelling in their direction as they passed by my bench.
“Enjoy your staaayyyy!!”
I greeted 8 boats-worth of people over a 2-hour period. For nearly my entire trip, I worked as a volunteer civil servant for a city I’d just arrived in. You never know where hallucinogens will take you.
I walked back to the hostel soaked; my feet pruned from the rain. What I needed more than anything was a peaceful place to come down and dry off. When I got to my room, I was delighted to find none of my roommates there, a rare occurrence in a 4-person room. I toweled off and hung my clothes on the edge of the bunk before getting into my bed to reflect and relax. I couldn’t have felt calmer, laying there. My heart was pure, and my thoughts, loving.
Then the jackhammering started up. I’d completely forgotten about it. And this time, because of the mushrooms, it sounded even louder and more menacing than before. My trip was turning dark, and I had to make a move. Either go down and watch the BBC in the lobby, which would inevitably end up in conversation, or spend the next hour showering.
I went with the shower.
*
March 27, 2006
I came to the next morning, feeling exfoliated, if nothing else. My clothes were dry, finally, so I set out to find an outdoor market where I could buy an extra pair of cheap pants in case I found myself in a similar situation again. In America, we call them swap meets. They’re the same thing, just with a bad name.
When I was on my way out, I saw the manager.
Manager: Sir, how has your stay been?
Me: Perfect. Thank you. Is there an outdoor market where I can buy pants and food?
Manager: The Albert Cuyp Market would be the place.
To his credit, it was the place. Within 10 minutes of being there I bought a pair of cheap sweatpants, an onion and herring sandwich, and a crepe. I am perhaps the only person in history to purchase those 3 exact items at once. I wanted to experience the local delicacies though, and figured I could knock em out in one fail swoop. The meal brought back memories of my Bubbie, who I missed dearly. She loved herring and crepes (separately). Seeing me holding them at the same time would’ve given her a good chuckle. She’d probably ask, “What is it, my birthday?” My father loved crepes too, but the image of him eating 30 crepes is not a pleasant memory to conjure up.
After finishing my meal, I went in my pocket for dessert, 20mg of Adderall. My mom told me my Bubbie took uppers in the 60’s, when they prescribed it to housewives as a weight loss drug. I bet her grandma was a speed freak too, drinking that Coca Cola with actual cocaine in it.
I needed to charge up, and without sleep, Adderall was the best way to do that (even with sleep, for that matter). I was on a mission to find a bar that evening. And not just a bar for that night, but one I could call home in future visits. I still had a month or so left in my trip and knew I’d be back to Amsterdam, so I needed to have a reliable place to hang my hat. Bars are that important to me. I can’t just go any old place to drink willy nilly. I need a home base, somewhere I feel comfortable, where they know my name. Like the Commonwealth.
I had no clue where I was going to find it, but I knew I’d know it when I saw it (the same way pornography was defined by the Supreme Court in 1964). It took some walking, but then I stumbled upon what was undoubtably the place. I was standing at the corner of Nieuwebrugsteeg and Warmoesstraat, right where Warmoesstraat turns into Sint Olofspoort. I’m serious. I looked up and there it was… The perfect bar. The sign under the awning read: “H. Murray’s Bar.” Next to it was a smaller sign that read “Anno 1619.” It looked to be more of a house than a bar. There was even a Golden Retriever in the window, standing with its’ paws on the sill. A bar dog is a surefire sign of a good bar. If it’s good enough for a dog, it’s good enough for me.
I entered like I was returning home.
Me: Hi. I’m Sam.
Neil: Hello, friend. I’m Neil. That’s Lilly (pointing to the dog). And that’s Norman (pointing to the only other man sitting at the bar).
Me: Hello gents. May I…?
Norman: Pull up a seat, Sam.
Me: I’ll have what Norman’s having.
Always drink what the house drinks. It will endear you to the crowd. For me, that only backfires when the house drink is Sambuca. I hate Sambuca. It tastes like Christmas tree water. Or Malort. Don’t even get me started on the Chicago bars that push that lighter fluid on their clientele. Monsters.
We got to talking and time got to flying, the way it does when you’re around good people. Norman told me about his time in Berkley, about how he knew Tim Leary, Tom Wolffe and the Merry Pranksters, people I’d only known from books like The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, and Hunter’s Hells Angels. We shared the same sense of humor too. When he told me his favorite comedian was Steven Wright, I knew we were cut from the same cloth, only a generation apart.
Steven Wright is one of the more obscure, odd comedians; real dry, great word economy. He can make you laugh in less than 20 words.
“A lot of people are afraid of heights. Not me, I’m afraid of widths.”
“I think it’s wrong that only one company makes the game Monopoly”
I told him to look up Mitch Hedberg, but didn’t bother telling him how Mitch’s death contributed to my quitting stand-up, or that I even did stand-up at all. I couldn’t have done that without crying, so I just listened and enjoyed being a guest.
I wish I remembered more of that night, but that’s how it goes sometimes. I’ve always found sacrificing memory for fun to be a fair trade. Not everything has to be remembered and documented with a picture. I can’t recall most of the best times of my life and I’m just fine with that.
*
March 28, 2006
They started jackhammering bright and early the next day. Still half-drunk, wearing my clothes from the prior night, I darted down to the lobby to get breakfast before it ended. While scarfing down cold eggs and toast, I checked my pockets and counted the money I had. It was the same exact amount I’d gone out with the night before, along with a few grams of unfamiliar loose weed. John Mulaney has a joke about blacking out and coming home with more money than he left with, and that’s exactly what happened to me. Neil didn’t even charge me. He must’ve denied my attempts at tipping too, because every dollar was still in my wallet. I couldn’t recall his kind gesture, but I was sure I hadn’t just skipped out on my tab. I mean, I was pretty sure. When I’m blacked out, I’m more inclined to try and pay twice than I am to skip out on the bill. One time in New Orleans, I paid my tab, then sat there trying to pay my tab again, four more times. The bartender eventually threw me out.
Some hair of the dog seemed in order. “Hair of the dog” means “Alcohol.” They used to rub it on dog wounds. The way it’s colloquially used now is to say, “you can’t get hungover if you stay drunk.” I still had about an hour before the intense hangover would take hold, and figured a large quantity of Adderall and drinks could fend it off.
I found a nearby Irish Pub and ordered a shot and a beer. Realizing I was American, the bartender tested me before serving me.
Bartender: Do you like George Bush?
Me: He’s a cunt.
Bartender: Guinness and Jameson coming right up.
I drank and gobbled pills the whole afternoon and into the early evening, until I could hardly see straight. Bender mode, engage.
Let’s talk about benders for a minute… During 24 hour-plus drinking benders, your brain swells to the point you can barely remember who or where you are. You become erratic, uncontrollable. For no reason at all, you push over garbage cans, rip signs out of the ground, and piss on walls. And you’ll fuck anything with a pulse. You become possessed. And the choice remains… Give up and succumb to the impending hangover or continue on with disregard for all human decency. Either way, you’re fucked.
I marched on. After leaving the bar, I bought a 20oz Heineken and brown bagged it on my walk to nowhere. At least I thought I was going nowhere. My subconscious had a different idea though. I didn’t realize it at first, but I was retracing my steps from the previous day. My boozed soaked brain was leading me to the very place my sober brain found disgusting. I didn’t even realize where I was going until I saw the glowing red lights.
*
I walked the entire length of the Red-Light District multiple times, prowling amongst my fellow creeps, trying to find the perfect lady. I have always been a very discerning shopper, that time being no different. I didn’t just want any random lady; I wanted one who showed interest in me. God, that’s pathetic.
The women all had their own room where they sat, positioned toward the outer sidewalk. The ones who were “busy working” had their large window covered with a red curtain. The others, who were “waiting for work,” had their curtains drawn, allowing you to see the entire layout of the room. They were all similar; a bed in the corner, a small nightstand, presumably for keys or other knickknacks that may interfere with the coitus, and a few mirrors. Everything was red, the lights, the bed, the carpet… Like white is the safest car color, I think red makes for the most fucking.
All the women were objectively gorgeous, much more gorgeous than the sex workers I patronized in Tijuana the prior summer. They were hideous. And they robbed me. I don’t want to talk about that though. These ladies weren’t beaten down, figuratively speaking. They looked confident, even proud, like hard working small-business owners. Some of them weren’t even dressed scantily and gave off a “take it or leave it” vibe, which I dug. There were no pimps in sight either. Just the ladies and their red rooms.
With each trip down the corridor, I narrowed my selection, like I was hosting my own March Madness tournament, pitting lady against lady, with the winner advancing to the next round.
The eventual winner was white, with long, dark brown hair, and weighed about 150 pounds. She curled her index finger and invited me in, licking it between curls with the effort of a champion.
Inside, I met the pimp. He may not have been a pimp technically, but he held the money like a pimp does. And probably for the best. I gave him 50 Euros and he gave me a single condom. He didn’t say a word. Then, he opened the door to the red room.
Tonya: I’m Tonya. What’s your name?
Me: I’m Sam.
I forgot I could lie.
Her bubbliness left. Now she was working. She’d already caught her fish; the rest was just fileting.
Tonya: Bed or standing?
Me: Uhhh, standing.
I feared I might pass out if I lied down
She turned around and faced the dresser, gripping the top of it with her hand. Pulling down her black, lace panties, she began to prepare herself with one hand, the other braced on the dresser. I took my pants down, following her lead.
Lady: Ok, ready.
I tore open the condom and put it on. Then, I inserted myself.
When she moaned, I gained confidence. I started to go faster, and she moaned more, my confidence growing stronger yet. I took my left hand and slapped her ass cheek.
That’s when the pimp came bursting in.
Pimp: NO, NO, NO! NONE OF THAT!
He was pissed. I looked over at him to apologize for my lapse in judgment, and while doing so, ejaculated into the condom I was wearing. I knew I was jizzing. He knew I was jizzing. I knew he knew I was jizzing.
We both jumped back.
Pimp: Ok, that’s it you’re done.
Me: But I didn’t even cum.
He pointed to my shriveling dick.
Pimp: Yes, you did.
I had no recourse. There was jizz in the condom and I couldn’t remove it in his presence, causing a smoking gun, “gotcha!” type of situation. So, I waited until he left the room, then I got dressed, alongside Tonya.
Me: So, Tonya. Thank you very much.
Tonya: (doing a crossword puzzle) Yeah, whatever.
Me: Have a good rest of your evening.
*
March 29, 2006
I woke up the next morning wreaking of vomit. I’d gone to a bar to cement my blackout after having sex with Tonya, but unfortunately, I wasn’t able to drink enough to forget I came while looking into another man’s eyes. I guess that’s the type of memory no amount of alcohol can erase. To this day, I still see his face . I like to think he still sees mine too and were forever cosmically connected through semen.
I knew I’d be back, but I had to get the hell out of Amsterdam, pronto. I needed a reset. I couldn’t fall deeper into depravity so early in the trip. I had to pace myself if I wanted to survive another 2 weeks on the road.
After showering (I know, I’m disgusting for not having showered the night before. Get off me), I headed to the train station and looked at the big board to see what my options were. Paris was appealing but I wasn’t mentally prepared to take an 8-hour train ride. That would have left far too much time to reflect on the previous night. So, when I noticed the option to take a 4-hour bullet train, I jumped at the chance and made a reservation for the 11am departure.

I heard the conductor’s announcement as we approached Rotterdam train station — “Watch out for pickpockets!” We had nothing valuable in our pockets, I thought. The thieves would be disappointed if they picked OUR pockets.
We had barely arrived in Amsterdam two days prior, but we jumped right into action. There was too little time and too much to see. Our American employers weren’t sympathetic to our desire to see the world, and our European or Aussie friends weren’t helping when they flaunted their five-day stay at a place and uncertain departure. We heard that all of Europe shut down in August. What?! What if I got appendicitis?
Jet lag is for wusses and we are biased for action. We have to be. We got our bearings during the first evening in Amsterdam so upon our return from Belgium, we would have an optimized route to tackle our must-see list. The day before, we wandered through Delft and Leiden while keeping an eye on the watch. Thank goodness for the Netherlands’ robust train system and the manageable size of the country. Those little towns were charming even in the rain and vendors in the open market didn’t complain, so why would we?

Back in July of 2023, I flew into Amsterdam to start my new life. Amsterdam was going to be it for me. The magical canals, the tulips, the summer sun.
It was the place to be.
I understood there was a lot of weed in Amsterdam, I’m not a user but I’ve never been bothered by other peoples choices as long as there’s no pressure for me to partake.
I was excited — I’d heard so many good things about the Dutch culture, they’re friendly and community minded, they love flowers, and are some of the happiest people on earth.
I was convinced that I would step into Amsterdam and say, “this is my home,” and live here happily for the rest of my life.
I know, I set very realistic expectations for myself.
I did not own a jacket. The wind whipped you like a smoothie, what more can I say, I’d just arrived from Spain and I was cold.
I ate a sausage roll and felt like I was back at home, then I was annoyed because right next door was a salad bar I hadn’t noticed. I walked out the door, caught a taxi and asked them to drive me to my hostel.
They said, “This is not a good area.”
I’ve heard that so many times. It’s a tradition of mine to book a dodgy hostel the first night in a new country — never on purpose.
I hopped out of the taxi, payed the million bucks, and headed on in. The reviews had been good; they provided all meals if you wanted them too (and can pay for it), the common area was social with table tennis and pool and a bar.
All of this was true, and the staff were lovely. The only problem was everyone was buzzed. Is that the right slang?
Everyone checking in was out of it. Not like they’d taken a few puffs at a concert — they were not there at all. Had I walked into a hostel or a hospital?
The only problem was everyone was buzzed.
I checked in and was treated like I was also very out of it. I went to my hostel room, dumped my bag and decided to go exploring.
I enjoyed a walk through a lovely park, I was stopped by a guy who tried to get a lot of personal information from me and I assertively said, “I’m going to leave now.” Which I was quite proud of myself for doing.
I found another lovely park but it was filled with homeless people, and people on drugs. I left pretty quick.
I sat down at a restaurant and tried to get some food in me, and a cool drink. It wasn’t hot but sometimes you have to fake it till you make it.
Pro Tip: If you’re ever alone and feel less than 100%, you need to eat. Even if you’re not hungry, just pick at something.
So I ordered with a grumpy waitress, and tried not to cry as I thought about how all my dreams had been crushed in just a few hours. I was alone in a scary city. I had walked for about three hours and hadn’t made it to the Anne Frank House like I wanted, instead I was tired, scared, and the most alone I’d ever felt.
While sitting at this café fighting back tears I remembered I was in complete control of my life, choices, and actions. So I looked up hostels elsewhere. I had been told to go outside of Amsterdam and explore little towns, so I thought I’d do that.
I looked on booking.com and picked the cheapest hostel with at least an 8/10 rating. The place was advertised to be quiet, along a canal, and within walking distance to a conference centre. The complete opposite to my vibe but I was tired and I thought it’d be worth a shot.
I caught a taxi back to my hostel, contacted home, and went to bed with a very early alarm set for the morning.
The next day was the start of my overseas adventure, I just didn’t know it yet.
Have you ever been in a situation where you felt uncomfortable?
Have you ever felt unsafe in a new city?

As a fanatic football fan, it is a dream to watch European Championship knockout match in the stadium. The championship was cancelled in the year 2020 due to pandemic. In 2021 it started with empty stadium and eventually with minimal capacity. Budapest is the only city which got permission to hold international matches with 100% capacity. Thanks to the circumstances that I got a ticket to one of the knockout matches. It was a ticket for Netherlands Vs Czech Republic for round of 16 Euro 2021 match, hosted in Budapest. Without any second thought, I booked tickets. Now during the COVID situation it is hard to travel via Aeroplane. So, that option had been discarded. I’m personally very passionate about drive. Often and regularly whenever I get chance, I go for long drive with my family. Why not in Car ?
As Google says, the distance between Amsterdam and Budapest is around 1400 KM. So, a round trip will be around 2800 KM and we need to complete the same within 72 hours. Challenging ? Isn’t it ? I called my friend, Supratik, another fellow MDM expert, and tell about the plan. He was too very excited and was ready to hit the road.
I have a Tesla Model 3 Long Range AWD Model. As claimed by Tesla, with 100% full charge, it can go upto 580 KM. Off course, I’m not planning to challenge the claim. Even I can complete with scheduled Supercharging facility, I’m good. The plan is to start by Friday evening and end by Monday afternoon.
2800 KM in 72 hours. Fascinating journey. Route plan has been automatically created by GoAnywhere Tool available with Tesla. We are supposed to stop in the designated points. There are total 5 super charger points decided by Tesla Tool and I decided to abide by completely without trusting my own ability of making prediction for charging.
As I’ve approached towards the date, I prepared a mini bucket list to carry. 1. Toothbrush 2. Half Pant (1 extra) 3. T-Shirts (1 extra) 4. Netherlands Flag with Team jersey 5. My wife prepared a flux full of strong coffee and two plates of Noodles prepared in Indian style for the night 6. My laptop, phone and chargers 7. Credit card (For emergency). And 8. Passport and PCR Test result.
I called my Insurance company to check about the Travel Insurance. In order to travel in Germany, Austria and Hungary, three different autobahnvignet was required which I purchased two days before the travel date. PCR Test was mandatory, so we did the same and was expecting the result by 10 PM on the travel date. We decided that once we get the result, we should start.
25th June, 2021 Friday 10:00 PM : just received the PCR Test result for COVID-19 and it was negative. I was good to go. Finally the time came to say BYE to my wife and two daughters for the awaited travel. I started from Almere, Netherlands. Supratik, who was accompanying me, was waiting in Amersfoort. I took him and then started for Budapest.
1:00 AM in the morning. It was 26th June Saturday then when we reached our first destination. The first stop was at Westerwaldpark 4, 56587 Oberhonnefeld-Gierend, Germany. The distance we covered was 308 KM and it took me nearly 3 hours. The sky was clear and Full-Moon was visible like burned Indian Roti. The last time I saw this kind of moon was in my village when I was 7 years. Looking at the moon just reminded me those days. We were tempted to take some the pictures of Moon while the Tesla was getting charged. Supratik was carrying SLR Camera, he took some good photo of the red moon. I had my half portion of meal (prepared by my wife). It was a short break of around 20 minutes and the car was ready for another destination.
3:20 AM I stopped at Hauptstraße 231, 63879 Weibersbrunn, Germany. The distance travelled so far was around 500 KM. I found myself little fatigue and took a break of 30 minutes with the strong Indian Coffee. Sipping the home-made coffee in the middle of the road was enjoyable. I feel loved.
7:00 AM stopped at Junkersstraße 3, 93055 Regensburg, Germany. The distance covered 870 KM so far. Took a break for 30 minutes. It was morning with super Sun shine. I really needed a coffee. Oh yeah !! before I forgot to mention, my fellow friend was sleeping from start, as I imagined he was actually dreaming with his seat belts on. I was so certain because, he had not even moved while I stopped, had a coffee and completed the charging.
10:00 AM Rasthausstraße 3, 4300 St. Valentin, Austria. We crossed the Austrian border around 8:00 AM in the mornging. The distance travelled so far was 1050 KM. Took 30 mins break here.
2:00 PM Győrújbarát M1 autópálya, 119. kmsz, 9081 Hungary. The distance travelled so far 1300 KM. Unfortunately, I detour at Viena. The usual road shows the route bypassing the city of Viena. I took the road though the city. It was around 12–00 noon, the traffic was medium. That increased the travel time by 30 mins. At around 1:00 PM, I crossed border of Hungary and Austria. Once I reached the pre-defined Supercharger location, took 30 mins break. I was feeling Hungry. I had bread with Goulash soup.
3:30 PM Budapest. The distance travelled so far was 1400 KM. Total time of travel is approximately 17 hrs 30 minutes. It was hot outside around 35 degrees sunny. Dog tired.
Tesla is incredible. My highest speed was about 220 KM per hour in the Germany autobahn. There are plenty super charging facility available. So, you don’t need to worry about it. GoAnywhere tool automatically determines the best available route for your journey. Return journey was around the same. We started from Budapest at 11–00 PM on Sunday 27th June. I returned Home (Almere, NL) at 5–00 PM Monday 28th June. It took me 16 hours to return. Faster though !!

My sons were profiled by a racist predictive policing system — the AI Act must prohibit these systems,https://medium.com/@FairTrials/my-sons-were-profiled-by-a-racist-predictive-policing-system-the-ai-act-must-prohibit-these-b2ea66a9a763,"Sign up

By Diana Sardjoe
When I found out my sons were placed on lists called the ‘Top 600’ and the ‘Top 400’ by the local Amsterdam council, I thought I was finally getting help.
The council says the purpose of these lists, created by predictive and profiling systems, is to identify and give young people who have been in contact with the police “extra attention from the council and organisations such as the police, local public health service and youth protection,” to prevent them from coming into contact with police again. [1]
This could not have been further from the truth.
These predictive systems assess and profile young people in Amsterdam to determine who is likely to commit crimes in the future; the ‘Top 600’ profiles children over the age of 16, the ‘Top 400’ profiles children under 16.
As a result of my sons being profiled by these systems, they were continually monitored and harassed by police. One was repeatedly accused of criminal activity along with other young boys he hung out with. Another time, I had to deal with police coming into my home. My son was arrested and I had to go and pick him up from the detention centre late at night. Other mothers I know were threatened with having their children taken away.
We had to deal with a system based on prejudice, with the weight of the authorities behind it. I was completely alone in this struggle, and there was nothing I could do. During this time, my sons withdrew further and further. I felt like a prisoner, watched and monitored at every turn, and I broke down mentally and physically, ending up on cardiac monitoring.
These events were an eye-opener for me, and it made me look for answers. How did my sons end up on these lists? What information do they use to decide this? How is it that it is always young, minoritised ethnic boys on these lists? How do the authorities have so much information on me and my family, and how is that justified? When does the monitoring start — and when does it end? I started a group for other mothers called The Mother is the Key, to share our stories, and start questioning and challenging the authorities.
So let me tell you the problems with these profiling systems.
First of all, the information they had about me and my family was inaccurate and prejudiced. The authorities’ data collection on young people often starts in school, the Top400 system uses this information to profile children. [2] Maybe the child missed some days of school. Maybe they had to go to a different school. All this information is registered, and it is used by the Top400 system to profile a child as a future criminal.
Once these authorities make a negative report about you, and it’s filed away in their system, you’ll never get rid of it. This is the consequence of our database society: you no longer have control over your life. Every time you interact with an authority or agency, you notice that they are suspicious of you, that they hold some prejudice against you. Your data and these profiles and predictions are shared amongst different public authorities, and held against you forever.
Another piece of information the police use to profile young boys on these lists is ‘contact’ they have had with the police. [3] This contact is often purely the result of ethnic profiling. I once saw my son, aged thirteen, being stopped by police and asked for ID while he was walking home down the street. That was enough for him to be registered on the police database as having had ‘contact’ with them. In this way, racist policing becomes hard-wired in the police data, and young men from racialised backgrounds are of course unfairly over-represented within that data. The information that goes into these systems is the same as the information that comes out. If prejudice goes in, prejudice will come out.
These predictive and profiling systems used by police and criminal justice authorities always use this same racist data and produce the same outputs. They are based on the idea of what a ‘criminal’ is, what their background and profile is, something that in western countries is often tied to ethnic minorities. Anyone who fits this mould is considered a ‘risk’ and criminalised. The majority of young people profiled by the Top400 and Top600 are minoritised ethnic people, including people with Moroccan or Surinamese heritage, or from neighbourhoods and districts where there are many residents with migrant backgrounds.
I do not agree with the use of these predictive and profiling systems, and I think they should be banned. They are inaccurate and racist, and they label people as criminal, including children, before they have done anything wrong, often just based on their background. This is completely unjust, and we must act before it is too late.
Many groups in Europe have investigated and challenged the use of these harmful data-driven technologies. In the US, where many of these technologies were first implemented, community groups have advocated for and legislated to prohibit predictive policing systems and other invasive surveillance technologies, like facial recognition. We must prohibit them in Europe too.
The AI Act, a law which aims to regulate these types of systems, is currently being considered by the European Parliament. But this proposed law does not go far enough — yet. It should ban law enforcement and criminal justice authorities from using these predictive and profiling systems completely, to protect people like my sons from racism and injustice.
Tell you MEP to ban predictive systems in policing and criminal justice here. It takes less than one minute.

After spending a great weekend in Amsterdam and an even better Monday in picturesque towns of Volendam, Zaanse Schans, and Haarlem, on Tuesday I attended the Firebase Summit held at the magnificent concert hall named Muziekgebouw aan ‘t IJ.
At the entrance I was greeted by the Firebase team with a free 👕. Afterwards, together with other Firebasers™, I had delicious breakfast 🥐🧀🍪 and some pitch-black ☕ (there was no milk 😞). While mingling with other people and strolling through the crowd, I was amazed by diversity of this year’s Firebase Summit. There were people from all over Europe, with all kinds of backgrounds, and all kinds of problems that Firebase was helping them to solve.
A bit later, doors of the mesmerizing Auditorium opened and the keynote began.
What we could expect from this year’s summit was presented to us by Sam Ramji, Francis Ma, and Kristen Johnson. There were a lot of new things that we were going to hear more about that day; Firebase Prediction, Firebase Crashlytics, Redesign of the console, new A/B testing framework, and much more.
The day was filled with great sessions, interesting ideas, and general positiveness 🙌. In my opinion, the highlight of the summit was the session “Actionable insights with Firebase Predictions” held by Jumana Al Hashal and Subir Jhanb. I had a great time being a lab 🐁 and choosing between 🇩🇰, 🇩🇲, 🇩🇴, 🐑, 🐘, 🦅.
Firebase Predictions was by far the biggest announcement of the summit. This talk just scratched the surface of this topic and excited one’s imagination when it comes to all the new and undiscovered things that can be done using this powerful tool.
There were some great things to do between the sessions. You could go to the #AskFirebase lounge and speak with people who were behind all this Firebase magic. There, I had the opportunity to speak with Kat Fang and Jon Mensing about problems and new features of Firebase Android SDK as well as about the future of Firebase in general. Another way to kill the time between the sessions was to play AppShip3000.
Of course, you could go crazy in the photo booth.
After the closing notes, there was a crazy party that I had to miss in order to catch my bus 😭. I hope that the next Firebase Summit will be at least as good as this one, and I also hope that I would be able to stay for the party next year.
If you are interested to see in detail what happened at the Firebase Summit 2017, recordings of all the sessions can be found in this playlist.

I landed in Amsterdam pretty late, and then immediately took the wrong train from the airport. I doubled back and got on the right one, and then when I switched to the aboveground at Lelylaan station, I got on that going the wrong direction too. Thanks to GPS I realized this after just one stop, but once I got on the tram going opposite, my phone died.
I tried to pronounce the name of the stop to the conductor — Tramhalte Bilderdijkstraat (De Clercqstraat), and he laughed. He understood vaguely what I was saying, and let me know when we arrived, so I found a shop and they happily let me plug my phone in. They also helped me interpret my upside down google maps and told me where to walk.
Just as I left, a woman walked past me and when I looked at her, she SMILED AT ME.
I’ve been traveling for two weeks and I admire hundreds of people every day, I really can’t get enough of the diverse beauty and style over here. Whenever someone notices me looking, I give them a big, genuine smile, because I appreciate them! Guess how many people have smiled back? I was absolutely overjoyed when this Dutch stranger grinned at me, and so even though my 15 minute trip from the airport took me over an hour, Amsterdam felt like the place to be already :]
Wendy was house-sitting for her friends who are on honeymoon. She told me to find the apartment by the pink flamingo in the window. Beautiful!
I think the first thing Wendy said to me was “so ehm, vodka?” I fucking love you Wendy! We had pizza and then her friend Sonja took us to to a special nightclub, MADAM. MADAM is a brand new venue at the top of A’DAM tower, a 360 degree observation deck, over 100 meters high in a city with an average building height of 30 meters. The view is astonishing. It’s the former Shell Oil tower, and I remember thinking, what a nice triumph of man’s sheer will over good sense and modesty — my my, it’s beautiful.
ADAM stands for Amsterdam Dance and Music, and we danced all night on the beautiful rooftop deck. The DJ put on Mike Dunn, Barbara Tucker, Adonis, all on 7″ vinyl which blew me away. There’s an observation hole in the middle of the dancefloor, so you can look down and see the ground 100 meters below. Scary!
To get to the tower, we had just followed Sonja by bike, it’s about a 30 minute ride to anywhere from anywhere in Amsterdam and the bike paths are amazingly well maintained. Everyone in Amsterdam rides a bike EVERYWHERE, it’s perfect. Wendy has a super dutch yellow beach cruiser, and it has bars in back and front for passengers.
Wendy was wearing some amazing linen pants which really showed off her perfect bum, her jetpack pants she called them, and a very pretty little Dutch woman in all white told Wendy “you are the most beautiful woman alive, I want to marry you!” The rest of the night, the woman kept telling Wendy how horny she made her, and Wendy went, guess I’m a lesbian tonight!
There’s no bridge to ADAM tower, you have to take a ferry, which is full of bikes and scooters. After we danced till about 3am, we left and took the ferry back over for AIR nightclub. It’s an amazing techno club and has hosted some incredible acts judging by the posters on the walls, but this night was a hip-hop pre-party and after hearing tons of the best house music on earth, you don’t really wanna hear Sean Paul. Wendy’s lover woman came too, and continued to let Wendy know how sexy she is, which I thought was nice of her.
I do love old, sexy hip hop, but I also avoid hip hop clubs because in my admittedly narrow experience people there are aggressive, unfriendly, don’t give too much of a fuck about the music anyway, and are there primarily to get laid.
It’s okay to want to get laid, but when that is everyone’s primary motivation for being somewhere, it makes the party shit for everything else. New hip hop also seems to celebrate ridiculous materialism and encourages people to treat others poorly, especially women.
House music celebrates love, inner beauty, helping each other and valuing diversity, and the people who love to go dance house music are amazing because they really seem to embody these attitudes.
We left AIR after about an hour for a gay club called NYX that’s meant to be incredible, but it was nearly closed when we got there so we went home.
SATURDAY
NOMADS IS THE BOMB!!!! The way it’s been described to me, during Awakenings everyone and their mom comes from all over NL and the world to be one of fifty thousand people in a pitch black tent listening to Richie Hawtin whine, but the lovely people who actually live in Amsterdam get the heck out of the city and get to Nomads.
NOMADS
Wendy and I biked there, it rained lightly on us and took about twenty minutes. We arrived at 4pm and lots of people were chaining up their bikes, but once we got in, there was plenty of beautiful space to dance.
Festival mania is everywhere though, and within an hour the place was fucking PACKED, in the rain!
Robert Owens was jammin, and got on the mic and told us ‘ain’t nothin but house party baby, you’re in the house with Robert!” Embarrassingly enough, I actually didn’t recognize his face at first, and Joppe laughed when I asked who he was. I hate FILAS but Owens had on some pretty nice designer inspired sneakers I’d never seen before (No Rick).
The festival gave limited edition “Nomads” slipmats to all the performers, with their names and some lovely artwork.
Moomin was straight Moomin, I love the guy. We spent a lot of time at his stage dancing, all the stages used d&b audiotechnik line arrays with massive infrabass stacks and the sound was INCREDIBLE. If you’re putting together a club soundsystem, remember, sub harmonics are essential!
I bumped in to my old boy Dieuwer, and Vincent and Joyce from the Midnight City crew who I met exactly a year ago when they hosted thatmanmonkz. If you’re in Amsterdam, look up Midnight City and pray they are doing something while you are around cause their parties are so good!! It’s very nice to see old friends :]
I also made lots of new friends, as wonderful Dutch people would come up to me up just to dance and talk and they told me about Dutch music, dance culture, fashion, designer drugs, festivals, love, drugs again, etc.
The Lumberjacks in Hell stage was non-stop fury. Marcel Vogel, Mr. Mendel, Rahaan, and Red Greg served up endless, impeccable disco. While Red Greg was playing, Rahaan was standing behind him and going wild at every mix, he couldn’t contain his excitement, and the crowd absolutely fed off of it, everything was perfect.
After Moomin, Nick V, Titia, and Carlos Valdes went back to back. Everyone was wonderful, but every time Carlos came on he was simply next level. It’s a really interesting thing, DJing, because these guys are playing other people’s music, they’re mostly selectors, but there are intangible qualities which make these guys immediately distinguishable from each other. It’s like, texture, presence, loudness, and MAGNETISM.
Mike Huckaby did a double take and started laughing when he saw me. I’d just caught him in Detroit and joked about how I’ve showed up in the weirdest places on Earth, ever since he took a video after his gig in Barcelona two years ago and I was in the front row getting loose. He was playing in Sicily the next weekend and I would have loved to have made it, but I had to get to Croatia!
SUNDAY
For Awakenings, you get to Amsterdam central station, and then there’s a shuttle for ten euros (bus #999, gasp!) which takes you fifteen minutes out to an industrial park in the middle of nowhere with some wind turbines. You get off, and then you have to walk about thirty minutes through the wilderness along a path to the festival entrance.
A kid got kicked off the shuttle right when we were about to leave the station, cause he snuck on without a ticket. The security guard took his drink, and then spilled it all over himself trying to throw it away.
I meant to get something to eat at Amsterdam central, but one ATM was broken so the line for the other was like twenty minutes, and by then I didn’t want to waste any more time.
When I got to the entrance and gave my name for the guestlist, they told me I was actually on a paid list, and it would be fifty euro. I said single day tickets are fourty-five euro, what? The other lady behind the counter chimed in and said yeah, but with fees and everything.. I said so what’s the point of the list? They laughed, and then I paid the fifty euro. I waltzed in and immediately got a “premium hot dog”, and then caught some of Damian Lazarus.
The festival grounds are HUGE, and the installations are pretty incredible, but after such a sexy, intimate experience at Nomads where everyone is chatting up everyone, where it feels like family, being lost in anonymity at Awakenings made me feel a bit lonely. Even by yourself at Nomads, the stages are small and you can climb up next to the DJ booth, so you feel like you’re part of something and you’re enjoying the music from the “inside.”
At Awakenings, the stages are twenty feet off the ground, so it’s just a bunch of DJ shows, you squint to see who is playing in most of the tents. There are some nice outdoor stages, I stayed and danced for most of Paco Osuna’s set, and every time there was a big build or something, they shot fire and smoke from the stage.
I bumped in to the lady in all white who asked Wendy to marry her, and she told me that she was still horny. She was with her friends, all laughing hysterically, and she asked me if I like women or men and I said women, so she said let’s hang out, and I said cool, but I had to go get something to eat though, and then we never bumped in to each other again.
I met a friend from Nomads the night before, and she took me with her friends in to the middle of the tent Maceo Plex was playing at. You couldn’t see much, pitch black, techno I didn’t really enjoy, and you just stood in your space and danced. I knew it was a shit question, but I asked a few people if they had ever come SOBER to stand in the middle of this crowd, and just listened to techno and dance silently. Everyone said “I’ve never thought about that,” which was strange.
After the festival I walked back, through the fields, to the bus, to the tram. Wendy was at Bram’s, and she sent me a photo with directions from her place. We had a drink and I found this place De Skool on Resident Advisor. The headlining DJ had a mix online which was just African drumming.
We got there, and some kids outside told us it was like trippy electro. I asked two guys who were leaving how the party was, and they said “it’s shit, mate. they found pills on us and kicked us out. i’d forgot I even had them.
De Skool is amazing. It’s an old primary school I guess, it has this campy front entrance like where you’d imagine kids would have sat at recess, enormous long empty corridors, a beautiful park in the middle where vines and trees have overgrown the jungle gym, and when you take the stairs down to the dancefloor, the fun really starts. The basement is the size of the entire building, and it’s completely filled with fog, so you can only see a few feet in front of you, but you can tell that off in the distance there’s music and movement. You walk through the fog like you’re in outer space or something, and then eventually you come upon this insane, sweaty mob of Dutch kids, who happened to be going nuts dancing to acid house. I’ve never been a huge fan of acid before, and in this context, it was PERFECT, it sounded amazing and Wendy and I had a blast.
love ya Wendy, thanks Sonja, till the next time Amsterdam!

By Rita SilvestreCreative Intern at VBAT
Olá! Hello!
I’m Rita Silvestre, I’m from Porto, Portugal and I’m a new intern at VBAT. I’m really passionate about art, design and travelling! The name Rita, derived from Margherita, and Silvestre which means wild, like forest fruits or wild plants.
Two months ago, I graduated in Communication Design at the Fine Arts Faculty in Oporto University (FBAUP). Porto is the city where I was raised and lived until one month ago. Even though I’ve spent all my life living in Porto, I don’t think I’ll ever get tired of it. From the river side to the beach side, from the little traditional corners of the city centre to the coast, Porto is a heart-warming, welcoming and cosy place. If I were you, I would probably book a flight right now to go there!
Many people ask why I decided to come to the Netherlands and leave such a beautiful country. Portugal is great for sure but not so much when it comes to work opportunities, salaries… design and arts aren’t so much recognized as an important work as here (now it’s starting to get better…I hope…) but yes, our weather and food are amazing.
During my degree, I took part in the Erasmus+ Program and I went to Salford University in Manchester, an amazing experience where I acquired lots of knowledge and experienced a different culture and way of living. During my degree I was involved in many things, highlighting FBAUP Design Inc., a junior company created by students in my university. In this company I could be in touch with the real market, working with clients and developing real projects. I joined this company in my first year and stayed until my fourth year of university. I got the president position and I managed to juggle everything during my Erasmus+ semester in Manchester. Besides that, I was Secretary and Student Representative at Board of Regents in FBAUP, where we could discuss our position as students, our university/infrastructures conditions and what we could change for a better future in FBAUP. I think Porto University gave me the basic design tools but then it didn’t prepare me so well for the outside world. However I am glad I worked at FBAUP Design Inc. and this helped with experience that the university didn’t provide me with, I felt more ready to go out and tackle the world!
Before this internship at VBAT, I did a Summer Internship and a University Internship. I worked for SonaeMC in Porto where I developed all Continente Supermarket’s plastic bags. It was a really good experience being in a huge company, working with different departments and not just within design.
The other internship was in Studio Eduardo Aires, a design studio in Porto that works primarily with editorial, branding and packaging. The studio has a particular design style, really clean, responsive and with a huge importance on detail. I worked in multiple projects, but my main project was developing brochures for the studio, presenting all the projects developed by them, including wine companies like Quinta das Murças, Porto City Identity, Bolhão Market and so on. These brochures functioned as an individual project portfolio to show to their clients.
I always believed design to improve society and following this I have since always tried to develop projects that can have a message that carries forth into the future. All the projects that I choose to show you are the ones that I felt took me out of my comfort zone. The design field that I feel more comfortable to work in is editorial and typographic but the subject that I enjoy developing is illustration. In high school I specialised in textiles and since that time, I’m really passionate about textiles and everything surrounding the subject.
In illustration I found my own personal therapy. When I’m stressed I draw a lot in my sketchbook, mostly people or my routine for example.
Now I’m really interested to improve my skills in motion graphics and illustration. From this experience at VBAT, I want to learn everything possible, try different disciplines of design like packaging design or animation.
As a textile lover, I try sometimes to step away from the computer and work in traditional and analogue methods. This project is born from a reflection that I wrote about society and the way that people are living, with all the standards that often make us lose our personality and our paths. The main goal was to create images from words. These are three images of the whole project. I used colour and monochrome images that represent a bridge between our reality and our dreams/feelings, sewn to connect them. Even if you try to take the thread out, it will be always marked.
I have always been fascinated with Illustration, but I never invested a lot of time because I didn’t have a lot of self-confidence. These illustrations were my first connection with the subject. I developed a zine about how the world could be, when humans were characters of the animal world. How would be our position and how would we interact with them if our worlds were inverted.
The next is a recent illustration, about the universe but in a way in which a person is recognized as a universe, and a unique individual.
This special work was dedicated for all cerebral palsy people in Porto City with the intention of demonstrating the capacity they have to choose and decide everything themselves. Porto doesn’t have a lot of accessibility or acceptation and there is little incentive to make progress to change this, many people don’t wish to dwell on the subject. With two types of software “GRID3” and “PCEYE”, I tracked the eye movements of two cerebral palsy persons during making some decisions on their computer. The movement has been drawn in a lower layout of the software from which I created the sketches and developed them into posters advocating the cause. As an answer to this problem, this posters illustration shows the product of their decisions, proving that it is something they can do.
Slightly closer to my comfort zone, I designed Sunny Sushi. An editorial project design answering to a proposal to make a cookbook according to a design style. I chose Japanese Design and my main goal was to show how sushi can be easy to make, in the same way it’s easy to set an IKEA chair.
Now that you know a little more of me, I present to you Nando, my little desk cactus. He is super kind and gives really good advice. Feel free to say hello to the both of us anytime! Just drop a comment below…
Best, Rita

I’m starting my 4-weekish adventure today and I’m still not quite sure if I’m a excited about it. The thing is: I’ve been looking forward to this trip for a while now, yet my knees have been acting up lately and I’m very worried that they might deter me from completing this adventure. But, I’m just going to give it a try.
Here’s a quick overview of my current status and what I’m planning to do: I arrived in Germany on the evening of Saturday, August 3rd. I spent the next day packing my bags and in the evening I’d invited friends and family to celebrate my 45th birthday. It was a mild summer evening and there were about 20 of us. (I’m really lucky to have friends who just make time for me at the spur of the moment as I’d only announced this little gathering few days before.) For the next few weeks, the plan is to cycle from Amsterdam to Budapest (from point A to point B) via Hamburg, Berlin, Dresden, Prague, Vienna and Bratislava. I’ll be returning via the night train from Vienna.
Today, Monday August 5th, I got up early and headed to the train station bright and early. Another worry, on top of the worry about my knee, had planted itself in my head: while I’d bought a train ticket to Amsterdam, I didn’t purchase the ticket for my bike. Shit! And my friends last night mentioned that recently they’ve had a really hard time to get reservations for their bikes. Shit! It’s so like me to forget essential things like this and it reminds me of what my mom used to tell me: “If your head wasn’t attached to your body…” (Speaking of my mom: 5 years ago, when I was starting my bike pilgrimage to Puglia, my mom still bid me goodbye in the morning. It’s now over two years that she’s gone and this morning I got a little sentimental about that.) Yet, as much as my head isn’t always working properly, luck usually tends to be on my side and I ended up being able to book a separate bike ticket. Phew!
I know a lot of people dislike the Deutsche Bahn (German Rail) because of severe delays and cancellations , ( newsflash to my non-German friends: German trains are no longer in sync with stereotypes about my people) but today everything went super smooth! I even arrived in Amsterdam five minutes early and the conductor apologized for this “inconvenience” over the intercom. (Amsterdam is obviously not in Germany but the German Intercity train, originating in Berlin, brought me there.)
From the train station I headed straight to the hotel in a neighborhood called Weesperzijde. The hotel is very trendy: a mixture of hotel, co-working space, café/bar and community hub. I feel way too old but the price was right. What surprised me a lot is that the hotel doesn’t have a dedicated bike parking space. I mean: Amsterdam is such a bicycle-friendly city, yet I have to park my bike on the busy street outside the hotel.
After I’d freshened up, I ventured into the city center with my bike and let myself float through the narrow streets filled with tourists. Turns out it was Pride weekend just yesterday and it was quite a joy seeing the streets and shops still adorned with rainbow flags. This inspired me to mingle with the gays and I looked up where the next gay bar was: I was ready for a refreshing beer. I ended up at a pub called “The Queen’s Head”, which was refreshingly retro/vintage and not busy at all. I ended up sitting by the window with a view of the canal. Here, I caught up on messages and started writing this blog.
After a couple pints, I was sufficiently tipsy which led to the terrible decision to have McDonald’s for dinner. After that, I went back to Weesperzijde, where I sat by the canal and watched the sun set over the typical Amsterdam brick houses.
When I got back to the hotel, I turned into a bitch. I become one of those guests that I hated when I was working in hotels. Here’s the thing: I was still quite annoyed with the fact that the hotel didn’t have any secure bike parking. As I was about to get into the elevator, I saw a sign “bike parking” and my Sherlock Holmes instincts kicked in. I followed the signs and eventually emerged in a huge bike parking garage. I “stormed” to the front desk and asked the clerk if I could park my bike there. “No”, he said, “ that’s employee bike parking and we park our rental bikes there.” I want to spare you the details of how I blew up, but suffice to say the clerk made an exception for me and allowed me to park my bike in the garage.

Exactly two years ago, I met my oldest ever friend to date. The name and details of this star have been changed for privacy purposes. However, the memory is deeply etched in my mind forever.
I remember how I felt as I first walked to the bus stop and later as I waited, sat next to her. She reached for my gloves when they fell and handed them to me, a cute smile etched on her wrinkled face. It was early February, the coldest month of the year. The beautifully trimmed lawn glistened with frost, and the air was crisp and cold -3 degrees. I was shivering, feeling super chilly. I noticed she was in a long gray jacket, not wearing any gloves. I was amazed to see her all by herself, timid in some ways, but stronger and mightier with age. Clearly, the latter is just a number.
“It’s koud,” she smiled and laughed heartily at me as I gloved up and tried to brace my body against the harsh wind.
“Wat is jouw naam?”
“Astrid. Mijn naam is Astrid,” she said adorably.
“Mijn naam is Apurva.” I showed her my travel card to help her better.
“Apurfaa?” she said, her wrinkles stretching with her voice. The skin around her lips moved as she read my name with ease and smiled. A kind one.
“How old are you?” I asked in amazement. I normally don’t intrude so much, but I couldn’t help it.
“I am 92. I am old and wise,” she said, laughing cheerfully. “Very wise.”
“Oh wow! I am 29.”
“Oh, prima!”
I observed her face closely, the wrinkled lips smudged with red lipgloss that opened to a smile encasing a false tooth set. Her thick hair was fashionably groomed and trimmed into a short bob that covered her head uniformly. The smile was really infectious.
“You look happy. What is the secret to your happiness?”
“I am healthy. I am alive. I have money. I have friends. I have a family. I don’t look happy. I am happy,” she said in a kind but bold voice. Her English was perfect.
“So happy to see you. You really made my day today.”
“So I did something good?” she inquired kindly.
“You have no idea.”
After a moment of silence, I added, “I am coming from my therapist.”
She looked at me intently, a knowing look on her face. She said nothing, but I could swear I saw a small nod of understanding.
“Are you working?”
Bam! She asked me an innocent, totally harmless question. But it was a trigger. Please, no. I will be truthful but answer safely without telling the whole story that I hadn’t accepted myself back then.
“I used to. Now I am studying here.”
“Do you live alone?”
“I am married. I live with my husband.”
Some more smiling. Looking around for the bus which was the reason we were here, we continued to talk.
“What is your lievelingseten (favorite food)?” I had translated the phrase using Google Translate and showed her my phone, because mijn Nederlands is niet zo goed back then.
“I eat everything. But I never skip salads. I eat salads every single day,” she said matter-of-factly.
“Have you always lived here?”
“I have lived here all my life. For 92 years. In Zilver Windstraat.”
“I live in Zilver Windstraat too.”
“What’s the huis number?”
“I live in 118.”
“We are in 20!”
“Wow. We are buren (neighbours).” She looked really happy now.
“Everyone is taking their own car these days. Only one person in each car,” she said, pointing at the vehicles passing by as we waited patiently for our bus, grimacing and shaking her head in disagreement.
“Do you live alone?” Once again, my curiosity got the better of me.
“My second husband died five years ago…” She spoke for a second into the distance, then looked at me briefly, smiling. “It happens, you know…” with a shrug and half-smile.
“I am going to visit a friend who is ill,” she continued. She was clutching her cover filled with clinking glasses. She proudly showed me her glass jar collection, filled with onion plants growing at various heights. She mentioned she couldn’t move her left arm much, though that wouldn’t stop her from being strong and getting things done. A trait I admire so much in the native Dutch. They are not made of sugar.
Each time a pair of headlights appeared around the corner, she got excited in the hope of finally getting into the bus. Then, in a matter of nanoseconds, she said, “Nee…” as the lights extended into a delivery van or, worse, a truck.
She laughed at a small Canta car waiting timidly by the road, its indicator on.
“Klein? (small)”
“Klein…”
“Ik spreek een beetje Nederlands.”
I showed her the Dutch lessons on my phone. She read a few of them and said, “Heel goed!” She had excellent eyesight and could read from my poorly backlit, almost-dying iPhone.
“Why don’t you drive a car yourself? You can get around anywhere so easily!”
“Nee, my children will not allow it.”
She kept murmuring bits of Dutch here and there, and I, like a small child pretending to understand, responded with a confident, typical, and lazy… “Jaaaaa…”
The bus was late as usual. Typical Dutch public transportation.
“I will start walking,” I signalled to her that I might leave now, half-heartedly.
“I will wait for the bus,” she said hopefully, glancing left every time to the corner of the road.
My patience was not the same. “I will call a taxi for us and ask the driver to drop you on the way.”
“Oh, that is not fair. You will pay for it. Oh no…!”
“Nee, geen probleem! It is totally fine. Where do you want to go?”
“Ziekenhuis Amstelland.” Then, after a pause, she added, “You should come home for a coffee one day.”
“I would have visited anyway. I don’t need any favor returned.” I added, kindly.
She probably only heard the word visited. That registered as a yes, and she beamed happily.
I called an Uber. Hafez would arrive in two minutes. That was quick.
In no time, we scrambled into the old KIA. The driver greeted us in Dutch. Astrid took charge and converses fluently with Hafez, a kind man from South Africa. He proceeded to drive us toward her stop, barely 5 minutes away.
By mistake, Astrid poked her finger into the glass screen separating the driver from the passengers. It was so invisibly clean that she hadn’t noticed it. She chuckled to herself for a while. The glass now bore a small fingerprint mark.
“Nooo…” Ans wailed, looking lost and a bit down when Hafez took a wrong turn at the roundabout.
“No, it’s okay… You can tell him where you want to go. He will drop you there.”
Hafez quickly corrected his route and dropped Astrid off exactly where she wanted to go.
As she was getting out of the car, she looked at me and said, “Dank je wel. Coffee is waiting for you,” with a wink and a twinkle in her eyes. She turned and walked away.
Hafez continued driving toward my destination.
“Is she your family?” he asked, peering through the rearview mirror.
“No, I just met her at the bus stop half an hour ago.”
“You did a really kind thing there.”
I rushed to the nearest café after finishing my errand. I had to jot down this incident before it faded from my ever-busy, memory-laden mind.
Coffee is waiting for you…
She didn’t look old — not one bit. So precious. She still had the fire of youth burning inside her, fighting within her. She made me feel hopeful.
As she wakes up every morning to another beautiful day in her life, I wondered what kept her going so positively.
Does she see each day as a blessing or another hurdle to pass?She probably knows her loved ones are waiting for her. That she will meet them when her time comes.But until then, she must go on…
I couldn’t stop the flow of words as I furiously scribbled into my Remarkable, all while holding and pushing my almost-filled bladder to a dangerous extent.
While the incident replayed itself on a loop in my mind, one question bothered me the most.
Was her hair brown or blonde?
I couldn’t recall anymore.
PS: I wanted to simply meet her again after a few months. And I did. This time, with my husband and some flowers. We rang the bell downstairs, hoping against hope that she would remember me. She answered, took the lift, and promptly came down to meet us, her face lighting up when she saw me. Dressed smartly, she took the flowers and went back up, inviting us over another time.
That was a year and a half ago. I tried multiple times to ring her bell again, but there was no answer. We really hope she is still happy and cheerful, wherever she is.

Welcome! Happy to see you in the sixth part of my Vuejs Amsterdam Conference 2022 summary series, in which I share a summary of all the talks with you.
You can read my JSWorld Conference 2022 Summary series (in four parts) here, where I summarized all the first day’s talks. You can also find the previous Talks of the Vue Amsterdam conference 2022 in my blog.
After two and a half years, JSWorld and Vue Amsterdam Conference were back in Theater Amsterdam between 1 and 3 June, and I had the chance to attend this conference for the first time. I learned many things, met many wonderful people, spoke with great developers, and had a great time. On the first day the JSWorld Conference was held, and on the second and third days, the Vue Amsterdam.
The conference was full of information with great speakers, each of whom taught me something valuable. They all wanted to share their knowledge and information with other developers. So I thought it would be great if I could continue to share it and help others use it.
At first, I tried to share a few notes or slides, but I felt it was not good enough, at least not as good as what the speaker shared with me. So I decided to re-watch each speech, dive deeper into them, search, take notes and combine them with their slides and even their exact words in their speech and then share it with you so that what I share with you is at least at the same level as what I learned from them.
Everything you read during these few articles is the result of the effort and time of the speaker itself, and I have only tried to learn them so that I can turn them into these articles. Even many of the sentences written in these articles are exactly what they said or what they wrote in Slides. This means if you learn something new, it is because of their efforts. (So if you see some misinformation blame them, not me, right? xD)
Last but not least, I may not dig into every technical detail or live codings in some of the speeches. But if you are interested and need more information, let me know and I’ll try to write a more detailed article separately. Also, don’t forget to check out their Twitter/Linkedin.
Here you can find the program of the conference:

Ramona Schwering — Software developer at shopware
“It’s a trap” — a call or feeling we all might be familiar with, not only when it comes to Star Wars. It’s signalizing a sudden moment of noticing imminent danger.
This situation is an excellent allegory for an unpleasant realization in testing. Imagine having the best intentions when it comes to testing, but still ending up with tests failing to deliver you any value at all?
Tests who are feeling like a pain to deal with?
When writing frontend tests, there are lots of pitfalls on the way.
In sum, they can lead to lousy maintainability, slow execution time, and — in the worst-case — tests you cannot trust.
But it doesn’t have to be that way. In this session, Ramona will talk about developers’ common mistakes. And of course, on how to avoid them. Testing doesn’t need to be painful, after all.
You might be sure that testing has many perks and advantages, but all of those wonderful things can be out shadowed by pain points caused by various reasons. All the things you did with the best intentions but in the long run or even earlier they turned out painful or exhausting.
For example, slow tests can kill the fun. Imagine you have your pull request and you want it to be merged, but you need to wait hours or maybe days for the pipeline to finally be completed.
Even worse are tests that are painful to maintain. You think about your past self and you ask: What did you do with this test? What was the purpose?! What did you think about that one? Or other team members who are asking you questions about what you did in the past and you have no clue.
But the worst pain point is those tests that give you new value and result because they are flaky. You have a build that sometimes passes and sometimes fails and you did nothing in between.
It doesn’t have to be this way. One of the most important mindsets and golden rules in JavaScript testing best practices is Simple.
Tests should be designed plain and simple in every case. In unit tests, integration tests, and End to End tests, keep it stupid simple.
Our goal should be that one is capable to understand your test and get its intent instantly without thinking about it.
Try to aim for a flat test design, which means only testing as much as needed and using few to no abstractions at all.
Let’s look at the first Trap.
It should throw an error if the deprecated plugin is in use.
When you look at the title — should throw an error — you don’t know what it wants to accomplish. But the Golden rule says you should know instantly what it’s doing.
We can make it more comprehensible with the “Three-Part Rule”. The test title should contain three things:
With this rule in mind, this is what our test will look like:
The next Trap can be the test structure:
In this case, declarations, actions, and assertions are written all over the place without any clear structure. Especially in bigger tests, this can be a huge pain. We can make it more structured with AAA Pattern. You divide your test into three parts:
This is what our test looks like with AAA Pattern:
This looks much better!
But there is a problem. Think back to our test case. It is a context menu and it is hidden by default. So we need to open it to interact with it. But it means we need to do an assertion to make sure that it’s open before the act. Doesn’t it destroy the pattern?
If we are testing the DOM, we sometimes need to check the before and after states. So Let’s take a look at this pattern from another perspective.
This is a pattern taken from behaviour driven development: Given — When — Then
Our prior test with the usage of this pattern:
Avoid using placeholders and use realistic naming as much as possible.
If you don’t want to come up with thousands of names, maybe you can use faker or other tools to generate some dummy data, or if it’s okay with the laws and your project, import it from the production state. Just make sure that your test stays comprehensible and easy to read and that you know what it does.
Let’s take a look at the same test for the next trap, which is selectors.
If you refactor your application and change some classes — which is common — this could cause your test to fail, and in this case, the test failing without a bug present in your app — which is called a false negative giving no reliable report of your app because it’s not broken, just your implementation changed.
Look at selectors you must! In other words, you shouldn’t test implementation details. Instead, think about using things a user would call attention to and navigating your application. For example some text inside your page. Even better, use selectors which are not that prone to change, like data attributes. You can even call it for example for cypress data-cy=”submit” so one instantly know that it is meant for testing.
Last but not least, don’t use fixed waiting times.
On one hand, that can slow down your test way too much if a test case will be executed so many times. It can be even worse when your application is being used on weaker hardware. In this case, you may need more than that fix 500ms.
There are some solutions for that, for example waiting for the changes in the UI, like a for loading spinner to disappear or an animation to stop or something to appear.
Or even better, wait for API Requests and Responses.
Tests are there as an assistant to you, not a hindrance. They should feel like a routine not like solving a complex mathematical formula.
I hope you enjoyed this part and it can be as valuable to you as it was to me.
Here you can find the next talk about animations.

In the mornings, there was still a slight chill in the air despite it being late June. In Amsterdam, the sun came up too early and went back down too late, and I was struggling to adjust to this new sleep schedule. By the time the sun went down completely at ten or eleven at night, it would be hours until I felt tired enough to actually sleep, and still would be up too early for comfort. This routine heavily affected my circadian rhythm.
Despite being the world’s sleepiest girl in Amsterdam, I could enjoy the slow living that the Dutch are accustomed to. I took long walks in the mornings around the canals, listened to Dutch language lessons while wandering residential neighborhoods, and got to explore the history of the quiet, bustling town I would definitely visit again.
For travelers obsessed with history like I am, Amsterdam is a place steeped in stories and lives you will love to learn from. Here’s some of my favorite places in Amsterdam to experience the legacy of “Venice of the North.”

I walked into a cafe that looked unlike any other cafe I had visited.
Endless Moroccan lamps hanging from the ceiling, and strategically placed mirrors reflecting the lamps gives you an awe moment upon first stepping in to Lost in Amsterdam.
The bar was just gleaming with sparkling glasses hanging from the ceiling wine rack with brass and rich wood everywhere.
Candles provided an extra welcoming warmth.
I grabbed a U-shaped booth table covered in Moroccan cushions with lanterns and candles behind me. Even the ashtray next to the candle illuminated an exotic glow on my table.
I was travelling alone to Amsterdam, and I sat across from the bar to not feel so awkward. Besides it’s was such a stunning vibe that I could spend hours just relaxing in that comfortable booth.
I ordered my drink, an amazing margarita, although they are famous for their milkshakes, with and without alcohol.

Amsterdam, the Venice of the North. Risen from reclaimed marshland. The city of Rembrandt. The city with the harbor and the cruise ships. The port where the crowds buzz like a beehive. The city where dormant changes can suddenly rear their heads. The city with once the beating Jewish heart. Where once Jewish life flourished and vibrated. The heart brought to a halt by betrayal and murder.
I am sitting on a quiet terrace opposite the Museum Square, right next to Museum Square the Concertgebouw. The sun slowly begins to draw melancholy shadows from people and buildings. The birds of the city migrate over to find a safe roost in one of the surrounding parks. The cars, streetcars and cyclists roll silently by. The rush to be home is marked on the faces.
Amsterdam pulls up to the dinner table. People passing by carry with them a variety of food. Above them the hungry faces. The restlessness of the end of the workday is almost palpable. People and the city are getting ready for the coming evening and night. The poverty of the city is also visible in the form of vagrants, begging and trying to scrape together some money to get something to eat.
The terrace where I am sitting is not full. I like watching people. An sich, man is an evolutionary marvel. The Museum Square I am looking at is lined with museums: the Stedelijk, the Van Gogh, the Moco and a little further…

Once you start buying beans from a speciality coffee roaster, there is no turning back. For some people the taste of speciality coffee is not like coffee and more like some aromatic tea. Some might not enjoy with this. Because the big coffee chains(hint: Starbucks) and supermarkets coded that burned taste into our tongues. They do this because they cannot sell as fresh as local roasters do and they have to sell the same consistent taste which is the burned coffee taste in this case.
(Originally posted on https://uludagcan.com/2023/01/13/speciality-coffee-in-amsterdam/)
But coffee can have multiple different flavors. There could be multiple factors that affects flavor of the beans such as where the bean grown, other plants around the coffee farm, drying methods and roasting processes. That’s why you can see different tasting notes on the packaging of a speciality coffee product. Which is something great. Losing all these with over roasting is a huge shame.
It’s not cheap. We should admit that. Coffee is an expensive commodity and getting expensive each year. Due to that we can see the reflection on the prices. If you compare a cup of filter coffee or latte price at a speciality coffee house with the big coffee chain, you can see it’s much more expensive at coffee roasters. Or if you compare 500g bag of coffee bean at a supermarket with the bag at roasters, again you can see the price differences. That comes from the quality and the effort that put into quality grown coffee. Those roasters cannot access coffee with cheap prices like big chains. Because of that they have to reflect it into prices. And the coffee farmers are the ones that suffer the most and earn the least in this equation. According to Moyee Coffee, 90% of the total coffee value disappears into the pockets of a handful of large multinationals, which we call Big Coffee. This means that the coffee farmers are left with only 10% of the value. It’s even worse, because there is nothing is added to this value– only 2% of that amount is actual profit. So if you consider all, it’s actually not that expensive.
Netherlands ruined the word “coffeeshop” for me. It is used to be one of my favorite word. “Going to coffeeshop”, “working from coffeeshop”, “getting a takeaway latte from a coffeeshop”. I was using the word excessively. But “coffeeshop” means “drug store” in the Netherlands. If you ask anyone on the road for the nearest coffeeshop, they will show you the place where you can smoke some weed and get high. So now it’s “coffee house”. Or with a bit more hipster way, “coffee roaster”. I’m getting used to it. If you are visiting Netherlands, especially Amsterdam and if your intention is not the drugs, keep that it in mind 😉
Amsterdam has a really good coffee scene. There are many good quality coffee roasters and coffee houses around. I think it’s one of the two best speciality coffee cities in Europe. The other one is definitely Berlin. During my last two years in the Netherlands I created a list of my favorite coffee houses and roasters. Of course these are not all of them. It’s impossible to list all but these are mostly the ones that I visited and bought coffee. The ones that I enjoy and suggest with wholeheartedly.
I’m a bit biased with Bocca to be honest. It’s my first coffee roaster that I met in Amsterdam and the first one that I buy coffee beans. Even before moving to the Netherlands I bought beans from them. But objectively, they are one of the top coffee roasters in Amsterdam. Coffee is great and their store has a great atmosphere in the heart of the Netherlands. They also have great workshops for people who wants to dive into coffee brewing or making latte art. I took one of them and it was a great experience. Bocca is also selling many coffee making equipments. Even some unique tools like GINA Smart Brewer.Location: https://goo.gl/maps/tuQaThyreSvg8scU8
Even though I haven’t sit and drunk coffee that much at the store, Lot61 is the roaster that I buy most of my beans for home brewing alongside with Bocca. I like the taste of roasting profile and also I found it the best value for money. Their regular blend coffee beans are perfect match for my daily filter coffee machine routine and espresso beans have rich, and bold taste.Location: https://goo.gl/maps/zSjNP1L5kDxkAgqd7
I cannot stress enough how much I like this place. They don’t have their own roasted beans as far as I know. Last time I checked beans were coming from Berlin. But this cafe has small, cozy and warm vibe. Located very close to my favorite street Haarlemmerdijk. With good coffee, nice desserts, foods and hipster people profile, it’s a lovely place. If you are around, definitely stop by Toki.Location: https://goo.gl/maps/8yfFc2qDWeH8vbWf7
Shining star of Bos en Lommerweg. This cafe was one minute walking distance away from my old house in Amsterdam. It was a great location for me to go and takeaway a coffee then walk in Westerpark. I always loved the vibe of FUKU. Nice cafe, good latte and tasty bites. And I know the name sounds like the F@$! word.Location: https://goo.gl/maps/EjcU18pEVL4hZ56V8
Another place where you can find good coffee at west. In between two beautiful parks of Amsterdam, Erasmus and Rembrandt park. I haven’t bought coffee online from them for a while but I was happy with the coffee when I do. What I also like is the cozy interior space.Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Xt7CKBn6xQZPiF1CA
I’ve been into the store where located in Weteringstraat. Although I don’t have strong opinions about the coffee at Back to Black, I liked the interior. Nice place to hang with friends. Take a cup of latte, eat a croissant, read your book and give some love to the cat that sleeps on the chair.Location: https://goo.gl/maps/a1LoUeBMcAknSyam7
Usually I search on maps before finding a new coffee roaster. But sometimes I just come across a cafe while walking on the streets of Amsterdam. Rum Baba is one of them. I was so happy when I find this roaster. Their colorful interior and delicious beans makes this place a great coffee house. There was not enough space to sit but since it’s located on beautiful Elandsgracht, it’s even better to take a cup coffee from there and walk in Amsterdam. I also recently learned that they have walk-in workshops. Keep following for new ones.Location: https://goo.gl/maps/B92xfJ3PSAYDQ81HA
Do you want Fika in Amsterdam? Then Scandinavian Embassy can be a right place for you. It has spacious and cozy interior. As you might imagine delicious Swedish desserts like cinnamon rolls and cakes. Combine it with coffee and relax. Location is also great. Near Sarphatipark and close to Albert Cuypmarkt.Location: https://goo.gl/maps/WmLKS5T6ZvTEWxvg8
This is another coffee house that I discovered randomly while riding my bike on the crazy traffic of bike lanes. Immediately loved the place. During my visit I enjoyed reading one of the Standart magazine on the shelf and drank my coffee. I remember that I liked the “pastel de nata” tart that they serve. Good coffee companion.Location: https://goo.gl/maps/G6zpFncywpMj8RWU9
Almost every month, there is a transaction on my bank account for coffee beans. It’s one of my fixed costs. Since it’s an expensive purchase, I look for the best value for my money. Along with coffee quality, the smooth online shop experience is also important for me. After trying multiple online stores, I decided on these four roasters for now. Bocca Coffee, Lot61, Wakuli, Manhattan Coffee Roasters. All have good online stores and delivery options. In terms of coffee, I can’t say one is way better than the other but if you want me to pick two favorites, Bocca Coffee and Manhattan Coffee Roasters are the best. But also the most expensive ones. So not every month I can buy from them. I usually distribute my purchases amongst all four of these stores. By the way, I need to mention that Manhattan Coffee Roasters is not from Amsterdam. They are based in Rotterdam. Even though this guide is about Amsterdam, I have to mentioned their excellent quality beans. They are only online store and no cafe to visit so it suits my online buying section. I strongly advise to try.
Among those four, Wakuli is a bit different. They have the best subscription model and best price to be honest. You can easily start your subscription based on your preferred frequency. Weekly, bi-weekly or monthly it’s up to you. If you have too much coffee at home, just skip next delivery. Or suddenly you ran out of coffee, then request for an emergency batch. And if you want to pause your delivery for a while, it’s very easy and convenient to do that. Beautiful online shop, smooth experience. And it combined with good coffee. I highly suggest if you are looking for a coffee subscription service that you can manage based on your budget and schedule.
Of course there are more coffee houses and roasters in Amsterdam. Also in other cities like Utrecht, Rotterdam or Den Haag in the Netherlands. But these are just the ones I experienced and suggest without any hesitation. Please let me know if you know other coffee roasters in the Netherlands. Maybe we can update the guide next year.

“Are you driven by fear, or passion?”
August marks the first year since I moved to Amsterdam to begin a new chapter in both my life and career. Reflecting on this journey has brought a flood of complex emotions. Everything seemed to happen in a flash — what began as chaos has gradually settled into a rhythm. Now, having gone through the full cycle of ups and downs, I finally know what to expect, both in life and at work.
“Everything happens for a reason.”
I feel fortunate that, in June, a friend shared her experience with spiritual response therapy. After trying it myself, I noticed a significant shift in my energy, and more positive things began to flow into my life.
One of the first changes I noticed was at work, where I became more proactive and positive by making small adjustments in my approach.
While the typical practices — like meditation, reading, working out, and cold showers — have proven their value to many, myself included, I’ve found it essential to switch things up from time to time to keep things fresh and inspiring. So, here’s my updated morning routine
Beyond adjusting my routine, I’ve experienced a mental shift in how I approach work.
Work will never be done, but people and events come and go.
Inspired by one of my colleagues, I’ve started making an effort not to skip fun events when they appear on my calendar. Attending these has brought some wonderful moments, like being part of the biggest social event at my company.
“What are you afraid of? Don’t let your fear hold you back.”- one of my fav leaders said to me.
I now wanted to cry hahahah as I feel so lucky that I’ve met lots of incredible people that show me care and warmth and support.
Outside of work, I’ve also learned valuable lessons from personal relationships:
Hey, so, are you driven by fear or passion now?
Alrighty, a quick reflection.
If you are reading, applauses and comments can encourage me to share more my personal journey! :)

I am finishing up a 3 month stint mostly living in Amsterdam as my mobility startup, Iomob completes our participation in the smart cities themed Techstars accelerator here. As a smart cities and mobility guy I have always paid attention to Amsterdam’s efforts to be a smarter more liveable city, led in part by their CTO Ger Baron seek to blend tech-driven and citizen led approaches to transform itself.
After arriving I heard about Swapfiets which offers a bike as a service on a monthly subscription plan (less than 20 euros per month). Swapfiets has a booming business with more than 100,000 current subscribers. I was surprised to learn that many locals have even switched to SwapFiets since they offer full service of the bike included in the plan. I have found cycling around this city and the outlying areas with a great network of dedicated cycling lanes and amazing parks to be an awesome experience.
Having just finished a 24km bike ride out to the Ajax stadium and back to my apartment I began to reflect more on my time in Amsterdam and what life has been like in this bike-centric city and what it means for Iomob too.
While my American friends are still in shock that I haven’t had a drivers license since I moved to Barcelona in 2015, I have not even noticed the lack of “independence”. On the contrary, living and working in Europe, I find owning and driving a car to be more of a burden than a benefit. Obviously I am not alone as the younger generation has been flocking to alternatives to car ownership in big ways, as this graphic from CBInsights demonstrates.
We have counted at least 22 different mobility services in Amsterdam across taxi and ridehailing, micromobility and public transit. This includes 13 micromobility services and scooter sharing services like Bird and Lime have not even arrived here yet as the city works to establish the regulatory environment for them.
Much has been made of Amsterdam’s incredibly bike-friendly culture and the fact there are more bikes in this city than people. However, as my urbanist colleague Brent Toderian has expressed, there is an under-appreciated part of the story here which is how the city has helped transform itself from a car-dependent culture to a haven for cyclists through a range of strategies including an amazing array of dedicated cycling lanes, growing bike parking services and gradually decreasing the opportunity for driving and parking cars in the city center (e.g. last night I met another founding team from Techstars at a hopping food court with underground, free parking for bikes, but no parking for cars). Recently the city announced plans to remove 1100 parking spaces from the city center per year until 15,000 are removed.
Amsterdam could do more to promote this switch of course. I believe they need to further expand the non-car paths to support dedicated paths for different modes of personal mobility. For example many bike paths allow for motorized mopeds to share the paths with cyclists. A city like Amsterdam should continue to lead by supporting dedicated bike paths, dedicated cycling paths and dedicated micromobility vehicles (electric bikes, scooters, etc.).
And the city needs to embrace Mobility as a Service (MaaS) by supporting seamless access to those 22 and counting mobility services through one app which allows residents and visitors to route, book and pay for any of the mobility services in a simple intuitive way. This will further support the city’s shift from personal car dependence to greener shared and electric mobility services.
Yet, coupled with its vibrant arts, creative and entrepreneurial scene, Amsterdam is poised to become a leading light in the European smart cities scene through its innovative approach to embracing more active, less contaminating forms of mobility. This will help attract more innovators and urban entrepreneurs in the coming decades. Of course to do that, they will have to figure out there serious housing shortage and embrace co-living as promoted by another Techstars startup in our program, Kndrd.
About us:Iomob is working to decentralize and build the Internet of Mobility, by incentivizing and facilitating the use of alternative transport. By using the blockchain, iomob plans to minimize fees and allow mobility providers and end-users alike to connect on a peer-to-peer basis. In their own words: Iomob is “a system which produces a useful output at the lowest possible marginal cost.”

I moved to Amsterdam two months ago. In the first weeks, I asked on twitter what meetup groups I should know in Amsterdam. I was mainly interested in tech, infrastructure, SRE, DevOps related topics. It got quite a few responses from the people in the area. I thought “why not collecting them in a blog post?”
Thanks to all who helped me to compose this list by responding to my tweet. Hope to meet you sometime in the future at one of the events!
This is a list in no particular order. It is basically in the order of the responses I got. I am sure you will find the ones you like. :)
Software Circus
There are ~4K people in the group. Only for Feb; I see three evenings planned already! From their about page:
We are a motley crew of dreamers who are unhealthily obsessed with consuming information and changing ourselves and those around us. We love software, tech and anything (from any discipline) that is going to change the world. Apart from our wider focus, we believe that meetups should be a lot of fun where laughing out loud and meeting new people is built in, not an opt-in extra.
Docker Randstad
A lot of people in the group again!
Learn, Collaborate & Dockerize! Meet other developers and ops engineers in your community that are using and learning about Docker. Docker is an open platform that helps you build, ship and run applications anytime and anywhere. Developers use Docker to modify code and to streamline application development, while operations gain support to quickly and flexibly respond to their changing needs. Docker ensures agility, portability and control for all your distributed apps.
Meetin’up at Picnic
Picnic is the company I work for. 🤓 It is an online supermarket who delivers groceries to your door in a sustainable way. Picnic has a meetup group that holds regular meetups in their office.

We host regular talks on all things programming with in-house speakers, in our offices, with our very own bar tap and kitchen. What else could you be asking for? 😉
Continuous Delivery Amsterdam
Looks like Amsterdam’s meetup groups are huge!
This Group will bring software people together to share ideas and experience in the domain of Continuous Delivery. Continuous Delivery addresses the entire software delivery pipeline — from CI to testing to deployment to release — and addresses technology, process and organization. Anything within that domain will be in scope for our Group.
DevOps Amsterdam
Of course, there is one DevOps meetup group in Amsterdam. Surely, I will join them soon!
Bringing together developers and operations people united in a common goal: destroy silos and remove obstacle to deploy and maintain awesome software and reliable infrastructures. Monitoring, continuous integration, packaging and automated deployment will all be covered. It’s going to be fun too!

They say never quit chasing the dream!
After two years of effort, I finally could be part of the world’s largest gathering of employer branding professionals organised by Brett Mitchington’s Employer Branding College in Amsterdam (one of my favourite cities).
Employer and Talent Branding is ever-evolving, and the best way to learn is to connect with practitioners. After attending the conference yesterday, I could say this was worth investing time, money and effort. What a brilliant showcase of amazing case studies (no gyaan) of varied organisations and passionate EB professionals. Here’s a run-down on few of the key learnings I could share with you.
ASML Presentation: Collaboration is key
Nanci (Global Head of Employer Brand at ASML) shared the importance of collaboration in employer branding. While she sat in the comms function, she talked about her work with HR, business, internal comms and brand teams to be successful. Over 10k employees participated in the EVP process, and her key KPIs were brand strength/survey (Universum). She also showcased a good example of an internal career fair as a way to strengthen the brand internally.
Takeaways — 1) Collaboration 2) Measure against Key objective. 3) EB is a team play
Activision Blizzard Presentation: Get strategic yet creative
Activision Blizzard’s presentation took us back to building a solid EB vision. Alex and Briana spoke about aligning it for the leadership and business objectives to people strategy. Employee advocacy is all about education, community, resources and gamification. The team shared the breakdown of their content elements and urged the community to build insights around what kind of content works for which TG.
An awesome example of creativity — Activision put in an in-game recruitment advertising. Makes sense since a lot of their users may be target candidates. Smart!
Lego Presentation: Playful and Employee driven
Lego’s iconic brand still needed to build an employer brand targeted to the candidates. I loved their brand framework, which clarifies the overall brand strategy. Their EB team also creates various infographics/assets shared with the recruiters for candidate experience. Clicks from the Bricks program attracted user-generated content, which always attracts better engagement than corporate photos.
The crux for me was how aligned their employer brand was to the heart of what Lego stands for. Playful and fun! Kudos to Andrew and Sarah.
Indeed and Glassdoor: Well-Being Score
In the last few years, well-being has become integral to employee experience. Indeed has launched a new well-being score on employers’ profiles, which assigns the scores based on employee reviews regarding Happiness, Purpose, Satisfaction and Stress-free experience. It provides a clear view to candidates if the organisation priortizes well-being and employees resonate with the promise.
More information — ​​https://www.indeed.com/employers/work-wellbeing
Kaufland Romania: Innovation and Differentiation in EB
Estera’s presentation was truly differentiated as she passionately discussed diversity, inclusion and equity as part of employer branding. Beyond having created an ACCESS program to hire differently-abled talent, they hosted a hackathon to create an app for their target audience. Using TikTok influencers, they created a campaign to communicate and engage people with hearing impairments. They also opened a supermarket in a world-famous GTA5 game to attract candidates in-game applications. Both of these garnished wow among the audience!
DanceTalk — https://cariere.kaufland.ro/diversitate/kaufland-dance-talk.html
Siemens Presentation: Joint ownership of EB
Stefanie from Siemens started her presentation by sharing a long legacy and broad business range Siemens works for. One of the unique things she mentioned was that EB is a joint function between comms and HR. Their EB content always gets much better engagement than business content, which shows the power of people’s content.
Impact Metrics — 2X time spent on the careers page. The content reached 3 million candidates.
Primark Presentation: Recruitment Marketing Unleashed
Steven and Neil shared some amazing examples of recruitment marketing done by Primark for retail roles. They have created unique job description pages and programmatic job ads for recruitment marketing. Neil also shared integrating employer branding across employee and candidate life cycles.
Mondelez Presentation: Mind the Gap of Internal Branding
Ted’s presentation of Mondelez was one of the stand-out talks for me. Not only was he engaging, straightforward and no-BS, but he also shared an underrated element of employer branding for retaining top talent. He shared a very simple and useful method of measuring EB impact aligned to the external and internal objectives that include social engagement, eNPS scores, hiring/attraction measures and engagement index.
This slide is gold!
Haleon Presentation: Human Experience and Branding
A spin-off from another pharmaceutical giant, starting with no name or purpose. It’s a human-driven story to build the entire organisation ground up by leveraging human expectations and experience and co-build the org with them. Rhian and the team involved their employees in building the Haleon experience by using surveys and postcards to the leaders and leveraging the passion of their own employees while building the brand.
Power of Partnership CPO and CMO
For long, it’s said that customer and talent are two different target audiences and needs, although this slide sums up why they are aligned in their expectations. It’s important that marketing and HR needs to align and treat them in equal measure. Simon shared this amazing insight.
How often do your CHRO and CMO talk?
Team LIDL: Candidate & Employee Surveys
Catherine and Antanio shared some nuggets about using candidate and employee surveys to build EVP pillars. They talked about measuring the perception vs reality and identifying gaps as part of EVP or Lidl VP. It’s an important step to find the balance between reality and inspiration.
EY Presentation: The Balancing Act
Matthew started the presentation by asking which shoes are we wearing. (Literally throwing the shoes as recruiters :D ). Recruiters need to stop self-congratulating themselves for things like hyper-personalized reach. Let’s keep it real. EY, with over 400k employees and 170 EB specialists, have worked hard to build business cases to expand its capabilities. Along with him, Farrah shared various tech initiatives across recruiting and employee life cycles. I am sure Matthew Jeffery’s passionate talk inspired many!
This is how EY leverages tech for talent.
EveryoneSocial: Prioritize Distribution
Cameron spoke about prioritising distribution over content creation. Thanks to the algorithms of big social media firms, distribution has become a big challenge. He shared an interesting case study of Amazon where, by using employee advocacy tools, they solved the distribution problem. He also mentioned that the organic reach is dead and we have to do targeted investing for distribution.
Two simple reasons: People engage with people. Networks prioritise people’s content over the brand.
Short Video for Employer Branding: TikTok Tom
Since the rise of short videos, showcasing work culture and office videos has become a #WorkTok trend. Many companies have chosen this tool for engagement and a fun way to show their culture. Tom talked about some examples of organisations letting employees use this medium to share their stories.
Click here to learn more about #WorkTok.
(P.S. The emCee made Tom famous by calling him TikTok Tom)
Employer Branding Leaders and capability-building
In the concluding remarks, Brett talked about the need for employer branding leaders to take ownership of creating capabilities and work with leaders to build strong business cases to make this a full-fledged business function. This is one of the most exciting professions in the world, and responsibility is now with the leaders in the room to transform.
Here’s the quick framework to build a strong EB function and impact the business.
Huge shoutout to Brett for bringing passionate employer brand professionals under one roof and showing his vision for this profession. Employer Branding is no longer a side hustle TA folks would do, but more organisations are realising the value of employer (talent) brand to the business. After all, if people are the most important asset to the business, attracting and retaining them needs conscious efforts beyond operational talent management and acquisition. Also, a shout-out to Andrea for helping me in the process. I met some amazing folks, and this is my learning content from the conference — a real ROI of the trip!
It was lovely to meet you Google Dave!
I sincerely hope that this community grows globally and in India as well. I took a small step to create an EB community in India with over 30 employer brand professionals nationwide. Our conversations give us a sense of belonging and learning and help us to connect/grow together. This profession needs more leadership support beyond a nice-to-have IC person doing everything. If you are an employer branding professional in India, do get in touch with me.
Asta-la-vista #WorldEBDay! Bedankt!
(P.S) Some bonus fun nuggets from the conference where participants had a ball :D

Vuejs Amsterdam conference was amazing with over 1100 frontend developers and a screen of 180 degrees. It was amazing. The food was incredible, never seen such good catering at an event. They were very long days from 8:50 till 18:30 with 2 breaks of a half hour and a lunch break of an hour and a half. 12 talks per day. Very intense but very cool
The first day was all things frontend so not just Vue.js.
The future of JavaScript bundlers — Johannes Ewald — webpack core team
This was a great talk on what the future will be like and will we need things like webpack to make sure we can write code the right way and bundle it together. The browsers of course are not ready for this and that is why webpack is so necessary but in the future webpack’s purpose will be different.
New Features of Webpack 5 — Sean T. Larkin — webpack core team
Sean talked about the changes we are going to see in webpack 5 and how it is going to be really boring as they are doing so much behind the scenes that we will not notice much changes but our build times will be much faster.
Elegance of Movement with reactive Angular Animations — Elena Gancheva
This was a nice talk on animations using angular and what not to do so as things come across as natural movements.
You don’t know Microfrontends — Luca Mezzalira & Max Gallo
Interesting talk on breaking things down to create micro frontends.
Angular and Webcomponents — Ana Cidre and Sherry List
This was a really interesting talk on angular web components that just left everyone thinking oh my god angular why do you make things so complicated. It’s incredible at how many people dislike angular because it’s just complicated for no reason at all. Still it was a good talk. I think it would put anyone off trying to choose angular over Vue.
Transforming your Web Application into a PWA — Why and How? — Gijs Weterings
This was a great and interesting talk on service workers and Progressive web apps which is something that is super important right now especially since google added it to the google store and it now has full browser support but it was good to see how easy it is to setup and how the notifications work and that you can only ask the user once to install it on their home screen so you have to time that properly. PWA’s are interesting for the right project but are for sure worth looking into.
The Fresh Jest of Bel-Air — Rick Hanlon
This was a great talk on testing with Jest. Jest has come a long way since we started testing it out a year ago. Now I would for sure choose it over Jasmine, Mocha or Chai. Rick showed us some really cool things you can do with it to make your tests cleaner and for sure we should all be doing testing even though most people aren’t as it takes time. Writing tests means less bugs later on. Also when people learn to write tests they think of things from a different point of view so it’s always good to have a team working with tests.
Rest, GraphQL & gRPC — David den Toom
This was a great talk on graphQL. I love graphQL and would be so great to work with it. It basically just gives you back what you need from the JSON as opposed to giving you the full JSON like in Rest. It’s just nice. Perhaps we shall work with it in the future.
What is new with Gatsby.js — Kyle Mathews
This was an interesting talk on Gatsby by the creator of Gatsby and seeing how much it has improved. He has done a great job and it’s pretty cool but it’s for react based apps so something I won’t be using but good to know how it works etc.
What its like to be a full time open source maintainer — Evan You — Creator of Vue
This was interesting to see what Evan’s life is like as an open source maintainer, how he explains to his family that he gives his work away for free and then people donate money to him so he keeps working on it. Also he talked about how it just happened and then decided to give up his full time job to maintain Vue.js full time.
Automated Scaffolding with Schematics (Angular) — Natalia Venditto
This talk left everyone thinking ‘Seriously angular is there no better way?’ It was a good talk on schematics and I can see it’s use case on certain projects so that you set up everything once and then install it so that all projects have the same folder setup and global styles etc but it is a lot of work and something I would really have to test out and play around with before going ahead and using it. Good but complicated but then again that’s Angular for you.
Day 2 — Vue conference
State of the Vuenion — Evan You — creator of Vue
This was a great talk on the future of Vue and what is being done to make it better. It was also good to see the statics. 700,000 weekly active users, 3.3 million downloads a month on NPM and 461 million hits a month on jsDelivr CDN. Evan also talked about web components in Vue and how the CLI supports building as native Web Components.
Hot Vue — Guillaume CHAU — Vue.js core team member
This talk was a last minute add in as Sara Drasner was ill and couldn’t make it. It was a great talk on differences between server side rendering, single page applications and static pages and the benefits and differences between them all.
Vue.js for L’oreal, a case study- Tim Benniks
This was an incredible talk on how L’oreal are using Vue across all their brands. Their aim is that all brand websites will be on the same platform, will have the same technology stack and will adhere to the same KPI’s. L’oreal Paris has 60 markets which all need localisations. They deal with RTL, non-latin fonts, different KPI’s, different 3rd party integrations and local market adaptations. L’oreal Paris — no-js version, SEO, mobile first, progressively enhanced, async/lazy, fast. And to do all this they use Vue component files, vue devtools, vuex, vue-cli, cli-plugin-unit-jest, vue-test-utils, webpack wrapped by vue-cli-service, webpack-chain for configuration of site core helix structure, aslant — configured by vue-cli. Why Vue? Because it is simple to use.
NativeScript-Vue + ML = The Great MiniBar Challenge: MixoLogy — Jen Looper
This talk was really good fun from making cocktails to creating an app with nativeScript Vue and was interesting to see how easy it is to do.
GraphQL + Apollo + Vue.js = Magic — Sara Vieira
Great talk on GraphQL with Apollo and Vue. Really love GraphQL and how easy it is to query. For sure one day we will be doing stuff with graphQL.
Media for everyone — how to make your Vue Apps accessible for all users — Maya Shavin
Great talk on accessibility and how to make your apps more accessible. She showed us how we can use axe-core as a chrome extension to test our sites for accessibility with guidelines of how we can fix things. Also NoCoffee Simulator to test contrasts for people with vision problems.
Desktop Applications with Vue — Natalia Tepluhina — CTO at Vue Vixens
Interesting talk on how to build desktop applications using Vue. Not something I see us doing any time soon but good to know it’s possible with Vue instead of just ionic.
Designing Components in Vue —Damian Dulisz — Vue core team member
Great talk on Vue components, how you shouldn’t build them and how you should especially using slots and named slots. It was nice to see the contrast with how easy it is to create clean components and some great examples of slot uses.
Latest news on Vue Vixens
This was a mini talk on how vue vixens has grown ove the year. An initiative to try to get more women into programming by creating workshops etc
Latest news on CodeSandbox — Ives van Hoorne — Creator of CodeSandbox
This was a mini talk on what is happening next in CodeSandbox a tool for sharing code created by a 22 year old so he could share code with colleagues when he was working remote. It’s now a very successful project used by millions of people including me. Now he is working on it full-time with an amazing team to make it even better. He is amazing.
Full Stack Vue in the Era of Serverless Computing — Nader Dabit — Developer Advocate at Amazon Web Service
This was a really cool talk on how you can deploy to Amazon using aws-amplify and how you don’t even need any backend developers because you don’t need any servers. Really really cool.
Phenomenal design patterns in Vue using Vuex with Spiders — Jacob Schatz
This was a really cool talk on how to create your forms by building a form builder component kinda like creating your own form components that can be reused with different variations.
Day 3 — Vue
How to craft a Vue CLI Plugin — Guillaume CHAU — Vue Core Team
This was a great talk on how to create a plugin in Vue. Would be cool to do it one day and Guillaume showed us how it is actually quite simple to do.
Static Site Generation is Awesome — Alex Kyriakidis and Rolf Haug Vue School
This was a great talk on when you should use static pages instead of a single page application as it is easier to index and crawl and how hidden and visible content is available on initial render. They also talked about asyncData which runs before loading the page component and how to use the generate property to generate dynamic routes.
Everything’s a plugin: Understanding webpack from the inside out —Sean T. Larkin — webpack core team member
Sean did a great talk on webpack plugins and how weback is built from plugins, how it builds the graph and how a module gets to the browser with webpack. Really in depth behind the webpack scenes kinda stuff but very interesting.
Make your Vue apps Lighter by being lazy — Eduardo San Martin Morote — vue core team
This was a really cool talk where Eduardo explained what tree shaking was — dead code elimination and how webpack works to eliminate this dead code and how in general to make your apps lighter by lazy loading your routes for example or prefetching certain components.
Empowering Vue with TypeScript, Inversify, Vuex and some other super tools. — Quique Fdez. Guerra
This was a great talk by Quique and he really knows his stuff by I have no intentions of using typescript in Vue right now. Who knows in the future but for now I love Vue’s simplicity and adding typescript is just not necessary. Backend developers need types as it is what they are used to and I can see the reasons behind it but am not sure if we all need to be going down that road. But he also talked about Nuxt and universal Vue applications and how they work. Also he gave us some great tips such as making small components, use linting, use conventions for names, doing tests, continuously improving your code and being ready to change everything.
Introduction to Nuxt.js — Nuxt explained Visually — Gregg Pollack — Founder of Vue Mastery
Great talk by Greg on how Nuxt works. I pretty much had already done this course and as I am creating a talk on Nuxt I knew all about this but was good to see how others were not so familiar and also good to know that I am doing everything right.
Nuxt.js 2019 — Don’t miss the NEWS! — Sebastian Chopin — Creator of Nuxt
I had already had a sneak preview to what was coming up in Nuxt from my chat the previous night but was good to hear again and what was impressive was to see the companies that are trusting Nuxt, Adobe, Microsoft, Gitlab, Groupon, Yahoo, Lacoste, Fox News and many many more big companies.
Next Level Jest Testing with Vue.js — Roman Kuba
A great talk on testing with just in Vue with some great examples of testing async. Would love to have the time to deep dive into this and write more tests with jest.
Accessibility with Vue.js — Callum Macrae — Author of VueJS up and running
Great talk by Callum on accessibility by showing us what it was like for a blind person to use the web and how we can improve this and test things by using screen readers to see for ourselves. It really shows how important things like alt tags are or using the correct html semantics like a <button> for a button instead of an <input> or <a> tag for example.
Visualisations using SVG, Canvas, and WebGL in Vue — Chris Fritz — Vue core team
Really cool talk on using svgs and when you should be using them and what they can do and why you shouldn’t be using CSS for something that an SVG can be used for.
I think I have managed to cover everything that happened during the 3 days in Amsterdam. It was action packed and my highlight was getting to hang out with all the amazing speakers and personally meet Evan You, such an amazing person and so friendly too. It was worth every penny and I will for sure be back at Vuejs Amsterdam and Frontend Developer Love next year.

A friend and I took this trip in February 2025. Enjoy!
DAY 1: FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 14th 2025
After checking into our hostel (THIS HO(S)TEL, Warmoesstraat 14) and dropping off our bags, we headed straight to Burgerbar Warmoesstraat, had a much-needed feast following a 05:00 wakeup, and planned the day ahead. BTW, the meal was sublime.
Next, we walked to De Negen Straatjes and ambled around Jordaan for the majority of the afternoon (which was noticeably quiet, maybe as it was a weekday), with a pitstop at La Tertulia, a coffeeshop with a gorgeous, calming, garden-style interior.
After returning to the hostel to freshen up and prepare for the evening, we decided to look for a Ramen restaurant for dinner. After visiting RAMEN-ISM & IMPOSSIBLE (fully booked) and Ramen-Ya (also fully booked), we ended up at Taste of Ramen which I must commend — their vegetarian ramen was tasty and extremely soothing!
Recommended by a local man on Hinge (lol), our next stop was Rembrandtplein for an evening of excitement. After perambulating the square, we decided to visit Coco’s Outback (a sports bar) for the evening. With its reasonable drink prices, lively tunes and excited energy, I would highly recommend it.
A couple of drinks down, the tiredness from the day hit, so we left Coco’s for the hostel — via the Red Light District. I had no expectations (probably as I’d never seen any photos (they are prohibited, take note)), but it’s fair to say I was completely astounded by the scene. Truthfully, I didn’t want to have an opinion on the trade until I learned some background/context regarding the circumstances in which these women work, so I planned to visit the Museum of Prostitution the next day.
DAY 2: SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 15th 2025
We woke up early, eager to dabble in Dutch cuisine — with pancakes for breakfast. After scouring the internet for recommendations and stellar reviews, we settled on Pancake Company Amsterdam and ordered a plate of poffertjes with Nutella, strawberries, and whipped cream to share. As you may expect, it was *chef’s kiss*.
Next up were Noordermarkt and Lindegracht Market, both pleasant markets with a strikingly local clientele.
For some time to rest, recuperate, and plan the rest of the day, we ordered a lovely vegetable pizza to share at Pizza Beppe Spui.
It became exceedingly apparent, upon reading various travel blogs, that a canal cruise is a non-negotiable addition to any Amsterdam itinerary. Taking this advice, we sought to book a slot within the next hour. Only at this point did we realise the scale of the Amsterdam canal cruise business and, concurrently, the myriad of providers we could book with. After 20 agonising minutes spent poring over Google reviews and cruise packages, we settled on the one-hour “cheese and drinks” tour (€29) with Amsterdam Boat Trips, departing from a small dock at Oudezijds Voorburgwal 226. Oh, what a smashing choice we made. As our departure time grew nearer and nearer, we became surer and surer that we were the only people who had booked this tour. Wahey!
I’d give this tour a 6/5 review with a standing ovation (the extra star comes from the tour being unexpectedly private), and there are three key reasons why. It would be amiss not to open with the tour guide and captain; Ties and Huib were super knowledgeable and personable, and I came away with an array of trivia facts in my arsenal. Further, the tour covered various areas we had not yet explored, particularly on the eastern and southern sides of the city. Lastly, the cheese (Dutch gouda with a side of mustard) and drinks (I had one glass of prosecco, one of rosé wine, and one of white wine) were a great addition to the journey and well worth the extra €9 versus the tour sans extras. We disembarked the boat in great spirits.
Continuing our cultural education, we visited the Museum of Prostitution (Red Light Secrets). Overarchingly, it was informative and provided a fair amount of “behind the scenes” insight. However, drawbacks included overcrowding (it is only a small museum) and the tickets’ steep price tag (€14.50). My highlight was definitely the wall at the end exhibiting visitors’ written sexual confessions.
After another brief break at the hostel, our next outing was an evening visit to the Anne Frank Huis. We had booked tickets including a 30-minute introductory talk about Anne’s life. This was extremely well-presented and engaging, and instrumental in contextualising the subsequent information presented in the house tour. It was a highly effective and sobering reminder of the atrocities of the Holocaust.
Our last stop of the day was Nooch, a nearby Asian fusion restaurant. Even at ~21:15, we had to wait 10 minutes for a table to become free. Overall, the food was delicious and the low lighting created a pleasant ambience.
Again, we strolled back to the hostel via the Red Light District which, presumably as it was Saturday, was noticeably busier.
DAY 3: SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 16th 2025
After picking up a couple of breakfast pastries from Dirk van den Broek (Warmoesstraat 157), we decided to take the ferry to Amsterdam Noord for a change of scene. There, we meandered around the tranquil Noorderpark and subsequently returned to the ferry via Van der Pekstraat, although most of the charming stores were shut.
It was lunchtime upon our touchdown in the city centre, so we headed to Omlegg (Nieuwebrugsteeg 24) where — surprise, surprise — we found ourselves in a queue forming down the street. Waiting in line was absolutely worth it, though, as my meal was scrumptious.
Re-energised, we walked to OBA Oosterdok, the central public library. I was particularly enthralled by the unique decor on the lowest floor, as well as the general spaciousness and airy feel of the building. The panoramic city views from the 7th floor are nice, however, glass barriers and an overhanging ledge cause some obstruction.
In need of a snack, we crossed Centraal Station to reach Fabel Friet (Nieuwendijk) and yes, these fries live up to the hype :).
With only a couple of hours of our trip remaining, we visited the Amsterdam Tulip Museum. Unexpectedly, and maybe owing to my lack of previous tulip-related knowledge, this was one of my favourite attractions!
With great reluctancy, we then packed up and made our way to the airport.

I revisited Amsterdam this past week and spent Easter Weekend, along with countless Spaniards, Italians and Germans, in the early spring sun. Last time I was in Amsterdam was in June of 2008 and I went alone for a conference. This time I went with my wife and we lived in a delicious and charming apartment in the Oud West, on Douwess Dekkerstraat, owned by the artist Patty Schilder.
[caption id=”attachment_222"" align=”alignleft” width=”300"" caption=”Oud West Apartment — looking toward Farmers Market”]
[/caption]
From our balcony, looking out over the Buurtcentrum De Havelaar, we gazed at the Baarsjesweg Canal, especially beautiful in the evening when the sun sets and the large barges slowly make their way up and down after a long day’s work. Two blocks away, in the early morning, the farmers market gathers steam. Here, the true ethnic diversity of the Oud West comes alive — Middle Eastern women in their hejabs argue prices with their favorite vendors, breads and cheeses abound, fish and meats, too. The color and smells and sounds are soothing, seductive. There is no excuse here for not eating right. The food is fresh, beautiful. The difficulty is in buying only what you need, something the Dutch are very good at doing, it seems.
[caption id=”attachment_223"" align=”aligncenter” width=”300"" caption=”Oud West Apartment looking toward canal”]
[/caption]
The difference between this trip and my last one is the bicycle. The only real way to experience this culture is on the bike. Though a modern tool, the bike is the heart of Amsterdam. Many consider Amsterdam “the biking capital of Europe.” Amsterdam bikers have the right of way, not pedestrians. The flow and energy of this city is dependent upon how well the biking moves the energy along. The Dutch are great bikers, they weave in and out of crowds, move effortlessly through traffic, grinning or smiling and never (apparently) frustrated. This is Amsterdam. I’ve seen youngsters txting and biking, talking on cells, with passengers, children, sometimes two, one in the rear, the other up front. Much of Amsterdam’s life happens on the bike.
[caption id=”attachment_224"" align=”alignleft” width=”300"" caption=”Biking in the north”]
[/caption]
We rented our bikes from Bike City. The added bonus being that the only hint that this is a rental is written in small, elegant print on the black carry bag on the handlebars: Bike City. Otherwise, the bikes were like all others. Most rental bikes are loud reds or yellows and have huge insignias. Would you want to call attention to yourself like that? We didn’t. We found the best bikes to rent are the 3 speeds with hand brakes. They’re comfortable and sturdy. Our first trek took us through the city, to the ferry landing behind Amsterdam Centraal Railway Station, and up through the farmland of the north country all they way to Slot Ilpenstein. We biked through pasture land, in and out of canals. Sheep nearby. The famous Frisian horses, too. And we managed a glimpse of some drafts.
[caption id=”attachment_225"" align=”aligncenter” width=”300"" caption=”I Am Amsterdam”]
[/caption]
From that day on, we rode everywhere, including another “out of the city” day trip to Haarlem, a municipality and a city in the Netherlands, and also the capital of the province of North Holland, the northern half of Holland. The bicycle lends for a particular order to things, a graciousness and decorum we like to call civilized or civilization. It’s interesting because if one examines the history of the Netherlands, we see that this living has come at great human cost. Many fell to the strength and power of the mighty Dutch will. The rise of the Dutch Empire is extensive and dramatic. Out of this, comes Amsterdam, an important port city and center of commerce. What we see in Amsterdam today is a result of this history so as we ride through the city and sit comfortably in cafes adjoining canals, we have to weigh the awesome power that began somewhere around the 1540s and that conquered so much. To the victor belongs the spoils is quite evident in Amsterdam. These spoils are Amsterdam’s gift to humanity. But these spoils also bare an awesome responsibility that Amsterdam’s inhabitants are trying to understand. The story is complex.
Perhaps this is why we can describe Amsterdam as an incredibly important human experiment that’s ongoing. And just maybe, this is why the moral structure of this great little city is experimenting with an unbound secularism founded on an unprecedented egalitarianism, which, in turn, depends upon freedoms of expression and a tolerance for difference. But this is the idealized version, the romantic view. It’s not surprising, then, that when the world is exhausted by the constant chimes of terror, from the Netherlands explodes the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy. It’s also the place where Theo Van Gogh, the great-grandson of Theo van Gogh, the brother of painter Vincent van Gogh, was murdered by Mohammed Bouyeri, a Muslim extremist, after van Gogh, with collaboration from Ayaan Hirsi Ali, released the Anti-Islam film Submission.
[caption id=”attachment_226"" align=”aligncenter” width=”300"" caption=”Middle Eastern Women in the Oud West, after shopping”]
[/caption]
Amsterdam is not without controversy. It is an extraordinary diverse place; however, diversity brings contention, even among the most enlightened. When differences are thrust together, the potential for an explosion is always present. Before 1965, the Netherlands were totally a monoculture — all white Dutch and no threats. This changed with a very liberal immigration policy. Effectively, the society is now segregated. On the streets, we can see the diversity, but where it counts — schools, neighborhoods, business and so on, we don’t see it. There is resentment that what Dutch culture was is no longer — this is true. The monoculture safety net has been taken away. Now the struggle is different, particularly on religious grounds where the Christian and the Muslim, along with the Jew, have to live side-by-side in a society that is increasingly secular. What is Amsterdam turning into? What is it becoming?
I wonder whether Amsterdam today is the “new” Al Andaluz? It has the makings. Why not, why can it not be the “new” place where the three central religions, Christians, Muslims and Jews, live in relative peace and harmony? Only now we are called upon to protect the Muslim, not the other way around as it was when the Muslim protected the ahl al-dhimma (the people under protection). Maybe the tides have turned, though the challenges and the conflicts are as they were in the period between 711 and 1492. What we don’t want is the devastation and the destruction brought about by the Christian King in 1492 — in the name of God and love! Al Andaluz was a beacon of learning, and the city of Córdoba became one of the leading cultural and economic centers in both the Mediterranean basin and the Islamic world. Why can this not be the fate of the Netherlands, Amsterdam leading the way?
The Amsterdam I see today is in transition, in flux, pained by both its past and its future. But it’s how it negotiates its day-to-day where the mystery and awe exist. The seeds of tolerance are there — a young Muslim woman on a bike or a Vespa waiting for a light to change and waiting next to her is a tall Dutch blond, also on her bike, and they look at one another and smile. This is the new Amsterdam.
So perhaps the Dutch are such great bikers because they have been learning to negotiate obstacles all along. Whether by conquering territories for their wealth during the time of the Burghers or changing from a monoculture to an ethnically diverse culture, they have been challenging boundaries — national, ethnic and tribal, as well as economic and educational. Amsterdam could be the first small city that will evolve — or not — according to how well it enables those who reside in the margins of life to exist without threat; where once there was a singular uninterrupted culture, as is evident in the architecture and the museums, now there are only threads that are struggling to keep humanity together. And holding these threads are exiles. Amsterdam is a perfect example of a city of exiles, of histories that come from colonization, and newer ones that come along because they have been following the great human migration for survival, for subsistence.
[caption id=”attachment_227"" align=”alignleft” width=”300"" caption=”Bikes, Canals, and their Bridges — the web”]
[/caption]
The Amsterdam of tomorrow will be built on the shoulders of mindfulness and tolerance. And if successful, Amsterdam, as Al Andaluz before it, will hold a noble place in the continuum of great histories that have given humanity, even if for a moment, a ray of hope that we can live together and relish in our differences.

They wander into my dreams − now and again: Mario and Rita, head honchos of the Rodos Bar. Holding court, twenty-five-years ago, when I lived the life of a hobo in old Amsterdam. Mario, slightly unhinged in the nicest possible way, was Greek to his toenails. He was blessed with a mop of silver-greying hair and a scraggly beard that touched his barrelled chest as he shuffled about barking at his patrons. He used to make his way from the back room into the bar with gifts of food for one or two emaciated looking regulars. ‘YAMOS, comrade,’ he’d growl. And plonk a dish of Greek grub on to your lap, ‘Mario say EAT!’ A gift from the gods. Diamond geezer.
Time-warped and frazzled, Mario was an exiled maverick; forever paranoid about the long arm of the Greek Generals − always in his chair, early evening − monitoring. ‘Mario say OK’ ‘Mario’s happy now, ERRRR!’ ‘Mario say sit.’ A kind and generous man; no mistaking that. His old jukebox blasted out rebellious Cretan Rizitika folk songs and Horeftika dance tunes, as well as Frank Zappa, Joni Mitchell and Thin Lizzy numbers. We’d all scream along to Zappa’s ‘Bobby Brown’: ‘I can take about an hour on the tower of power/As long as I get a little golden shower.’ Mario allowed punters to put their own records on the machine if the Greek stuff stayed put. Priceless. What a place! Shebeen heaven …
It was more of a home than a pub to many. Buskers and musicians could store their gear in the back room: Mario’s domain. And they’d invariably drink their daily takings with Mario and Rita late in the afternoon till the early hours of the following morning. ‘Mario says OK!’ Bliss.
Cult writer Denis Johnson would’ve eaten his heart out to have supped in a place as cool as the Rodos Bar − I’m damned sure of that: vagabonds; grifters; whores; ex-whores; wastrels; artists; seamen; travellers; alcoholics; washed up deadheads; Amsterdammers; eccentrics; lost tourists, as well as an astrologer or two! All nations graced its dingy, dark, worn, wooden womb; all were royally nourished. A grubby brass bell hung down from one end of the bar. Once or twice a month, it was pulled with vigour, till it dinged and dinged and dinged. Then an almighty thirsty roar resounded through the place. That sound signified a free drink for everyone. One could only speculate what lucky touch precipitated such an action: A big welfare cheque, perhaps, dropped on someone’s doormat; a successful drug enterprise that came up trumps; a win on the lottery or horses; an artistic advance; someone about to leave Amsterdam for good; birthdays, christenings and the likes. Anything! I’ll never forget the sheer joy when that bell chimed, though. Righteous, bro, righteous, as they say nowadays.
Rita was an Amsterdammer and maintained matronly order in all things pertaining to the bar. Hazy demarcation lines, though: Amsterdam style. She had coded scraps of paper concerning bar tabs strewn all over the place. Only she seemed to be able to decipher who owed what, at any given time. In other words, it was organised chaos as regulars had to be reminded what they’d consumed or who they’d bought drinks for the night before. A lot of booze crossed that bar and there were always scrambled heads trying to get to grips with their tab.
Of course, Rita’s feral cat had right of way across the span of the bar: through bottles of Grolsch, vases of flowers, lit candles and tobacco paraphernalia it strutted. The banter and nonsensical exchanges hushed when the cat threaded its way past the bar’s animated throng. Rita epitomized the old saying: ‘how to stay sane in an insane world?’ She’d sit back on her high stool and take it all in; cool as a cucumber. She dished out reprimands, now and again, to the odd cantankerous drunkard. ‘Stay quiet or go!’ was usually enough. And a background grunt from Mario seemed to cement it. The place was precious to a lot of people. You don’t shit on your own doorstep, do you? That seemed to be the philosophical viewpoint of the Rodos Bar’s clientele, during that era.
On Rita’s birthday the bar resembled a flower market: roses, lilies, sunflower and wildflower bouquets abounded. Vase after vase of flowers lined the bar and tables. Lit candles adorned shelves and nooks. The Rodos Bar would be packed. Session on! A great show of love for her; people used to drop in all night to wish her well. Always a cracking night!
The wrecking ball and gentrification killed the Rodos Bar in 1997. Most of the people alluded to here are now dead including Mario and Rita, God rest their souls.
Thank you Rodos Bar for some of the best nights of my life!

Every October, the dance music faithful descend upon the Netherlands for the Amsterdam Dance Event (ADE), a five-day conference and festival that attracts close to 300,000 revelers seeking every shade of electronic dance music—from hardcore techno nerds in record-label t-shirts to EDM-crazed bros with spiked hair. Taking place in over 100 venues across the city, ADE is like Austin’s South By Southwest for the international DJ crowd. Or Miami’s Winter Music Conference, without the daytime pool parties.
Here are six insights into the state of dance music I came across in my travels through this year’s festivities.
I’m dining at my favorite Chinese restaurant in the EU, Hoi Tin, with a friend and former colleague who made the move from music journalism to major label A&R. These ADE meet-ups have become an annual tradition for us since I moved from Los Angeles to Berlin a few years ago. It’s a chance to catch up on the L.A. gossip, but also an opportunity to see what’s happening in the land of mainstream dance music. A true insider’s perspective.
Where in previous years, I’ve gamely smiled and nodded as he enthusiastically played me by-the-numbers EDM demos and spoke of Eastern European pop princesses he hoped to pair with superstar producers I’ve barely heard of (Blasterjaxx?!?), this year his ear has turned towards the sounds of European underground house. One act in particular, German duo Monkey Safari, had caught his attention during the previous night’s parties and he’s thrilled to hear that I am good friends with their manager. Introductory emails are sent immediately.
The idea that house is the new EDM has been bandied about for a minute in the press. UK house duo Disclosure’s reported domination of Coachella was over six months ago. But it’s reassuring to hear such sentiment coming from within the ranks of a global media conglomerate, and not just click-hungry media outlets.
But then again… I’m taking a taxi to the HYTE Warehouse party at the northern end of the city, eager to hear some full-contact techno at the hands of Berlin breakout DJ star Rødhåd and scene stalwart Chris Liebing (disclosure, this writer works for the company that produces HYTE). The cabbie knows I’m headed to “the festival,” and enthusiastically banters about the music on the radio—a live broadcast of the Amsterdam Music Festival, where 40,000+ EDM fans have packed into the Amsterdam Arena to wave their homeland flags (a tradition at this breed of Dutch events) to megastar acts like Martin Garrix, Dash Berlin and David Guetta.
The aggressive underground sound I’m itching to hear couldn’t be further from the sleek dance-pop coming out of the cab’s speakers, but it is undeniably part of the same industry. And while the 3,000-person techno bash I’m heading towards is hardly a renegade party (Dutch super-promoter ID&T is actually involved in both the HYTE and AMF events), it’s still clear which sound is filling stadiums.
But then again… If one were to add up the plethora of techno events happening across Amsterdam, you could probably fill an arena as well. Just two kilometers southwest from HYTE is Awakenings, the pyrotechnics powerhouse that takes place inside the massive Gashouder in the Westergasfabriek gasworks complex—packing 5,000 sweaty ravers inside its giant steel dome for the industrial sounds of Rotterdam native Speedy J’s Electric Deluxe label.
Further down in the city center, Dave Clarke (nickname: The Baron of Techno) is throwing his annual bash at Milkweg, a multi-purpose concert and events venue that holds at least 2,000 fans. Around the corner, one of the inventors of techno, Detroit’s Derrick May, has sold out the converted 18th century church that is now Paradiso club.
Across the Amstel River in Amsterdam Nord, several thousand more heads are enjoying a lighter breed of German techno at the Kompakt Records showcase as part of DGTL’s weekend of parties at NDSM Docklands. A similar sound is being showcased down south at the beloved Trouw nightclub at the equally esteemed annual Resident Advisor party, where the relatively delicate sound of Jon Hopkins provides a perfect counterpoint for Four Tet, who delivers a surprising tough set of techno, making certain that all in attendance will not be home in time for breakfast.
I’m strolling down Keizersgracht between the Felix Meritis and Dylan Hotel, the two venues where the conference portion of ADE primarily takes places. The narrow road is choked with badge-carrying attendees who buzz about on their way to and from the various panels, seminars and keynotes on offer for those who are willing to shell out a few hundred euro to be an official delegate. There are just as many non-delegates milling about along the canal, rapidly accruing roaming charges on their iPhones while they attempt to coordinate their next meeting or industry dinner.
Located between the two main buildings that bookend the block is the Traktor Cookery School. Now in its third year, the pop-up event invites some of the scene’s biggest DJs to cook a meal for 20 or so friends and colleagues — and the occasional freeloading journalist. As I pass the open door I’m hit with the unmistakable smell of Mexican food. REAL Mexican food. I walk inside to find Los Angeles natives Drumcell and Raíz (brothers Vangelis and Vidal Vargas), who collectively run techno crew Droid Behavoir. On the menu is fresh, genuine, homemade, East LA tacos. Running things in the kitchen is the Vargas’ mother, which tells this is the real deal as smoke from the kitchen (the good kind) fills the entire dining area. It’s a taste that is completely and utterly impossible to find on this continent. I am in heaven, as is Trouw resident Patrice Baumel sitting beside me. The atmosphere is relaxed and jovial, as if you’ve been invited into someone’s home. All the over-priced DJ dinners in Amsterdam can’t top this.
Equally inviting, though more competitive than the Cookery School, is the annual ADE DJ Cook Off. Now in it’s fourth year, three-time winner Seth Troxler has chosen the judges table over the kitchen counter, opening up the competition to a whole new set of contenders, including German tech-house duo Pan-Pot, electro innovator Arthur Baker (who once owned a BBQ spot in London), Danish Top Chef Finalist and DJ Kolsch, and Boy George (yes, that Boy George) who is now two decades into his career rebirth as a house DJ. The Cook Off might be the toughest ticket to score in all of Amsterdam, which runs opposite to Traktor’s drop-in vibe. But both events demonstrate the friendly family vibe that exists throughout much of the dance music community. A wholesome counterpoint to the late night hedonism usually on display.
It’s been widely reported that four people died while attending this year’s ADE. While only one has been confirmed to be the result of ecstasy use thus far, it’s not hard to assume that some sort of indulgences were possibly(?) involved in all four fatalities.
While such tragedies have become frustratingly frequent occurrences within the EDM scene, particularly in the United States, 2014 proved that even in the highly-enlightened drug culture of the Netherlands, unfortunate things can happen. Improvements can always be made, particularly if there is a will within the industry and governments to make conditions safer for those who chose to ingest intoxicating substances. But no drug is completely safe, and as the sheer numbers of people attending dance music events rises, the number of casualties at dance music events will increase correspondingly.
But then again… While a select few ADE adventures ended tragically, an immense amount of good was achieved this year as dance music shifts its focus towards altruistic endeavors around the world. The most visible accomplishment was undoubtedly Cycle2ADE, a collaboration between online dance music magazine Resident Advisor and the Bridges For Music charity. Launched just two years ago immediately following ADE 2012, Bridges has already made a significant mark by bringing some of dance music’s top stars, including Richie Hawtin, Skrillex and Luciano, to do presentations and perform in some of South Africa’s most poverty-stricken townships, raising the spirits of those who call these shantytowns home, and awareness of SA’s immense (and immensely talented) house music scene to the outside world.
Cycle2ADE was a four-day, 300 mile bicycle trip from London to Amsterdam for ADE. Among the riders were DJs Chris Liebing, Luciano and Midland, along with several members of the RA staff and others from the London dance music community. The goal was to raise £100,000 to build a music school in Langa Township outside of Cape Town, South Africa—a donation amount that the supportive dance music community easily surpassed. Proof that as ADE and dance music in general continues to expand, its ability to touch lives around the world will also grow.
You can still donate to Cycle2ADE
